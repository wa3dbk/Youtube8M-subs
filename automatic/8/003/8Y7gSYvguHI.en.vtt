00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello youtube friends today I bring you the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.660
 true story of good toy story 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.059
 let's all start loving this movie for 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.889
 I'm disgusting I can not believe success 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.710
 who has had I mean the famous 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.509
 toy story trilogy very few we know 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.509
 the true origins of this brand 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.310
 for creation was in the year 1991 when 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.169
 this started pixar wanted to change 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.329
 slightly the audience he was 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.699
 focused its productions and disney 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.680
 originated by the success of the lion king ' 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.199
 I wanted to change to see how it would work 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.050
 in a market more adult than as I know 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.850
 I was a maintenance employee 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.129
 It paid very well but there were some 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.089
 things that you should never say as 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.519
 this 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.170
 pixar had planned a story I do not know 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.269
 knows by whom it was created but 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.930
 supposedly this would be a work 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.930
 teacher in him 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.400
 bizarre cinema would be called toy story this 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.290
 it was only a short before passing it to the 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.630
 cinemas had to see it some other 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.370
 people and give their opinion in exchange for 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.610
 some money like I needed 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.160
 I accepted without hesitating terrible mistake we saw it 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.920
 a total of six people two executives 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.560
 of pixar three people that I did not know and 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.390
 obviously I the short one starts with a 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.960
 very macabre lullaby the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.960
 room 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.850
 where andy was dark and in letters 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.430
 small ones were able to distinguish 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.560
 'toy story' lyrics for technology 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.780
 they had was a very poor animation 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.270
 but being just a test I did not lend 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.399
 attention the room was illuminated 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.799
 I was andy and crying but in a way 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.200
 more than real a deep cry and that 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.450
 the music was sad, the music was silent 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.270
 you only heard the crying this happened during 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.729
 about two minutes the crying ends and 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.070
 now it sounds a discussion the take changes 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.990
 to andy's parents arguing on the edge 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.390
 from the stairs the mother looks 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.450
 obviously pregnant the dialogues do not 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.580
 distinguish only screams are heard the shot 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.409
 return to andy that takes woody a bertie 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.630
 and start playing with them 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.140
 betinho brought his sheep characteristics 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.789
 while woody smiled macabrely 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.680
 then andy took a beard and although 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.220
 in these they apparently simulated the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.220
 parents of a 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.840
 andy discussing until it reaches 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.690
 buddy and betty and they start hitting 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.850
 the other two dolls in that sounds a 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.950
 scream heartbreaking the shot changes to the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.870
 discussion of andy's parents and he looks 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.300
 to his father throwing sharply at his 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.460
 mother of the stairs this is hit in 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.650
 repeatedly and ends up lying on 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.720
 the floor surrounded by a pool of blood 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.850
 extremely real begin to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.770
 listen to cries of a desperate baby 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.560
 these cries were becoming more and more 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.840
 deep and strong we return with andy 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.970
 who realizes what happens took 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.990
 a knife under his bed and he throws 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.030
 against his father 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.190
 the cries of this one are heartbreaking and 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.320
 they enter directly into your mind as if 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.600
 that unfortunate person was in 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.820
 the same room as us the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.530
 Andy's father is dead but andy 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.750
 continues to penetrate with the knife 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.480
 then he cuts his father's arm and what 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.940
 he throws andy goes where his mother is lying 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.100
 and apparently dead the baby cries 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.470
 they become more and more sensitive and real 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.900
 at this moment the shot changes for a 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.080
 photo of a few months old baby without 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.080
 watch 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.770
 arms or legs and a man that 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.050
 begins to suffocate it until the baby 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.770
 Shut up the screams are similar to those of 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.410
 the animation 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.960
 Andy climbs the stairs with his two 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.270
 dead parents returns to his room and 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.310
 wood takes and embraces it revives and 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.500
 andy does not seem to miss her wood and he 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.780
 raise and start to comfort him saying 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.710
 this had to happen sometime it's not your 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.480
 guilt 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.580
 andy threw himself on the floor and started 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.120
 cry and whip her head on the floor 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.120
 until co 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.690
 begins to bleed him wood and so 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.030
 as he approaches under the bed and 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.220
 pulls out another knife approaches with andy and 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.260
 raise the knife at the moment in the 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.990
 who says this had to happen sometime 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.270
 the shot turns black and you only hear 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.640
 cries of a desperate child during 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.920
 approximately five minutes ends 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.870
 with the photo of a real child apparently 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.720
 stabbed and in the same conditions 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.850
 that the baby without arms or legs 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.250
 then ends the silence was 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.560
 inevitable the pixar executives are 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.690
 they went and whipped the door furious of 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.850
 the other three were two 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.790
 running and one stood there motionless and 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.680
 he broke down in tears I left in the moment 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.240
 of leaving the room a man I 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.240
 he apologized and told me not to 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.400
 light none of this I would investigate in 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.290
 the case years later 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.760
 'toy story' came to light with a 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.310
 story very different from the original 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.410
 best quality recording and sound 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.630
 but seeing the characters reminds me 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.730
 to that horrible occasion where dreams 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.950
 of a madman materialized in the thing 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.830
 the world's most innocent toys 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.870
 a boy now toy story3 came to the 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.330
 cinemas with the same innocent story 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.430
 but the mystery that I and maybe other 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.950
 five people I never knew what 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.690
 happened to them on my part disgusting me 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.430
 that so many people follow this macabre 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.430
 creation that he had in his eyes 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.810
 origins the terror good friends this has 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.210
 been all for today see you next 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.840
 video with a video of gta san andreas 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.840
 goodbye
