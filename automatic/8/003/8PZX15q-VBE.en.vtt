00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:12.200
 the series ended and the european championship 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.969
 among youth teams 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.790
 Russian team ranked only third 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.450
 place is the reason for such a performance and 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:23.350
 can it be considered unfortunate 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.350
 probably with a field as far as possible 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.080
 nordic tournament above all this 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.990
 tournament where young hockey players participate 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.730
 or rather devin 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.440
 not sweden and finland and norway 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.230
 they 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.510
 kindly for our request to participate in 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.920
 this tour 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.920
 our guys 95 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.090
 the novel of '95 got into knowingly knowing that 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.400
 for the year of our troubles and younger to your 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.830
 the question that they are successful or unsuccessful 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.520
 were made just this tournament and 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.330
 highlighted all the problematic moments in our 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.519
 youth sports I would say that Russia 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.439
 watch 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.050
 four games that guys had three 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.690
 the games were lost 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.550
 I would not say that they lost 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.280
 with a big advantage scandinavian 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.920
 there one is two swords of heavy weather 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.950
 conditions it was snowing chanting in this 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.570
 it is more interesting that is when a lot 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.280
 gear when a lot of our combat 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.649
 lost but again emphasize not 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.330
 hopeless fourth game 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:33.180
 Our team finally groped 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.150
 on the game of laziness and a few permutations 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.660
 It was made by trainers initially composition 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.690
 there was now let's say in front of a mustache and 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.090
 There are new bundles and the fourth game 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.430
 already confident domination guys against 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.980
 defeated their suicide bombers with a pinch 11 1 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.640
 I stress once again it was an intermediate 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.040
 tournament before the World Championship before '95 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.160
 you can say that I lost but 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.160
 I invite all people who participate 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.950
 coach who is often in the process 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.429
 as a coach the candidate candidate in which of 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.410
 clubs and coaches of course the 95th national team 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.530
 years of this peresnikov Oleg Grigoriev and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.580
 Tarasenko we will be going to spring in 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.459
 piece of advice 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.340
 explain to each other why 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.160
 such a situation with the younger generation 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.440
 need to find pain points and take 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.460
 solutions as three further as you level 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.650
 adult 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.650
 no surprises people are here or not 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.060
 you command 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.800
 I watched matches Russia Russia Finland very 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.930
 decently added due to the fact that 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.170
 Finnish players play Swedish 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.800
 Kazakhstan clubs are a smooth team I would 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.920
 noted 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.050
 organization of the tournament in different cities 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.209
 competitions are held in gÃ¶teborg 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.120
 Russia will be Sweden and grenades in this 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.209
 the main part of the rink passes on 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.930
 closed rinks that sweden honestly 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.940
 by saying 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.980
 teams already prevail 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.840
 major leagues play closed rinks and 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.840
 exhausted played in just this to me today 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.990
 led lighting 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.830
 and this is what the great seeks to develop 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.670
 regulate barry allen 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.660
 falcon 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.010
 learning to play the game is interesting i think that 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.739
 I am wondering about the screen 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.520
 live one day you can see that the team 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.500
 Russia adds new hotel 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.090
 your prediction for tomorrow's match Russia 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.640
 sweden match would be interesting 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.140
 to always beat the Russian team at 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.140
 They have all the prerequisites for this 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.050
 does not add it is felt that the team and 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.480
 neck wins
