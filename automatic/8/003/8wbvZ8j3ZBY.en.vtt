00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.760
 finding the magnetic pole is vital for all the navigators of the world 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.660
 strange as it seems the earth has two north poles 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.169
 and now they are 700 kilometers away 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.779
 the geographic pole lgt rotation of the earth 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:18.499
 but it is the magnetic pole that attracts the needles of the compasses and he so 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.499
 that is now in motion 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.119
 pou 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.130
 in 1831 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.640
 the captain of the British navy clear yens was the first to determine the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.740
 position of the north magnetic pole in northern Canada 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.630
 since then the politician has moved 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.130
 unbelievably two thousand kilometers 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.170
 the new calculations show that now it moves between 55 and 60 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.740
 kilometers per year 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.130
 and if nothing changes reach Siberia around the year 2040 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.170
 then 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.210
 the magnetic pole is the decision to choose our magnetic field 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.170
 land 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.860
 at 3 thousand kilometers under our feet the earth nucleus formed by 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.240
 liquid metals and the core iron generates a magnetic field 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 invisible 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.610
 although few people are aware of its existence this magnetic field has 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.610
 a great importance in our daily life 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.300
 the clearest evidence of subsistence can be found in the regions 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.140
 polar of the planet in the urns 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.530
 they are formed when particles of solar origin 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 they are trapped in the magnetic shield of our planet 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.660
 the shield that surrounds the earth as a protective bubble reaches a height of 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.420
 tens of thousands of kilometers 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.790
 it protects us from lethal particles from outer space and 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.790
 even in these processes 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.919
 but if we are on earth 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.699
 if we were not protected by our natural shield 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.809
 if the magnetic field 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.879
 the terrestrial atmosphere as we know it would disappear 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.869
 the question now is 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:35.199
 could happen the same thing in the real world could the earth's magnetic field and 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.149
 therefore its magnetic pole reversed 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:42.309
 could turn around in the sun constantly throws us particles 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.370
 charged and from time to time a solar eruption occurs 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.920
 and many charged particles of energy collide against the shield 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.709
 terrestrial magnetic making that oscillated glass that changes with much 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.709
 speed of the tower 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.219
 in the northernmost latitudes the shield is much less effective the effects 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.169
 of the biggest solar storms 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:13.789
 1994 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:18.259
 the solar activity damages to criticize God in elite 2 interrupting all the 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.259
 communications in northern canada 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.409
 1989 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.120
 a solar storm causes an electrical blackout in the province of quebec 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:33.019
 Due to its proximity to the magnetic pole this system is very sensitive 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.019
 to solar storms and variations of the magnetic field 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.110
 in western canada the oil pipelines vital for the oil industry 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.109
 and the gas are sensitive to the earth's magnetic field 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.869
 without the full protection of the magnetic shield could occur 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:54.109
 electric overloads oil spills fires and explosions 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:01.439
 you might think that in the gps era we do not have to worry about 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.409
 guide us with magnetism 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.109
 but the gps system 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.419
 It depends on the satellites and they are vulnerable to solar storms 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.169
 when they occur 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.169
 calculation errors reach 100 meters 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.870
 It's bad news for the offshore drilling industry too 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.450
 that precise exact positioning data to maintain the katas forms 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.110
 instead 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.430
 but we have also been subjected to the comings and goings of the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.430
 Cosmic shield in its constants for firefighters 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.650
 the town may not have been fully invested many times throughout the 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.759
 history of man 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.759
 but if it becomes difficult if said long possessions 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.539
 now 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.849
 5 this is the reading of a sample of the North Atlantic 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.780
 we see the people in a stable position and suddenly change a position 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.050
 absolutely abnormal near the equator diego the cholo like the one of it 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.280
 Previous stable position is a geomagnetic discussion accompanied by 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.360
 a decrease in intensity the pole moves from north to south if it returns to the north 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.839
 montero by a different route 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:18.269
 the magnetic pole moves south of the equator and then you come back 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.219
 this has happened several times in the last 40 thousand years 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.869
 no no
