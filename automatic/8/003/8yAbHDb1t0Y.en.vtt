 dynamo cheftrainer stefan citizen not 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.979
 only the new arrivals with applause in the big one 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.940
 garden 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.679
 I'm already fond of it like that 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.490
 resonance is and how the team 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:37.909
 was received 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.560
 you have to imagine how the club 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.030
 we 've missed the class target 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.490
 are down so yes you could too 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.750
 expect a different mood 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.700
 I believe this spirit of optimism this 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.810
 Positive attitude of fans fits 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.299
 our team to what we are 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.220
 plan and that really makes me feel right 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.030
 optimistic that was really good and 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.189
 sounded good 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.079
 the eyes were especially uplifted 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.509
 the new additions with the big ones 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.130
 looking forward to her new job at dynamo 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.539
 I'm just looking forward to dresden 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.420
 that's finally starting again 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.009
 concept barely expected 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.630
 yesterday night in the hotel is still coming 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.459
 you can hardly sleep because everything is like 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.870
 said new as the first day of school and 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.150
 I am simply looking forward to the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.010
 new task here are absolute 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.329
 Traditionverein traditional clubs are 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.340
 for me anyway something very special 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.880
 Schalke 04 is feeling great right now 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.200
 Stadion 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.560
 I already have a lot of games here 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.970
 allowed to play and was always nice here 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.160
 to play as the mood is real 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.600
 overrun and like me too 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.070
 the city is real 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.540
 I'm beautiful now a couple of times 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.730
 drove through and allowed me that 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.250
 look and can only give the impression 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.260
 Share the squad planning for the upcoming one 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.090
 playing time is not over yet 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.100
 there are still vacancies in the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.079
 Team two to three players should 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.470
 still committed until the start of the season 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.150
 become 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.410
 two weeks ago I would not have 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.269
 I thought that with so many players 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.069
 I thought I could be in the square 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.269
 We're going to work with 10 2 here 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.640
 that a coach always 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.989
 getting used to, I think there 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.269
 the club leadership in particular on 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.229
 a lot of very good work did that 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.340
 we had planned too 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.440
 numbers to 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.120
 got that was still a few free 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.290
 are that are also clear but that is 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.420
 It's not a problem at all early 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.500
 in preparation and that will be us 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.150
 succeed in finding one 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.209
 especially the change of nils fischer 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.980
 from fsv frankfurt to dresden 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.739
 for a positive mood among the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.599
 dynamo-fans the 23 year old comes from the 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.220
 second league and should dynamo the 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.629
 reinforce right defense side 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.750
 I really needed something new 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.370
 somehow new experience and the neuro 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.980
 dresden wanted me from the very beginning 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.310
 interest was strong there that 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.420
 Trust is there and he has me too 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.590
 very and that's why it was 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.069
 that's pretty clear then, too 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.019
 we agree with each transfer 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.290
 have considered very well for a long time 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.640
 conversations with the players 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.730
 I'll say the willingness 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.000
 the identification with our project 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.200
 to document and at first moment 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.480
 I think that you are good fans 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.329
 There are also two trainees 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.890
 new faces next to marcel miserius the 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.900
 as fitnesstrainer the succession of 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.610
 christian canestrini took part 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.190
 sascha countries also an old acquaintance 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.470
 next to the training ground of the mafell with 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.540
 reputable is has the sport 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.329
 scientific background is in 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.680
 area rehabilitation prevention 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.780
 athletic training diagnostics on the go 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.669
 and the Saarland is actually already 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.240
 Very much in recent months 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:25.099
 been an important feedback provider for me 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.490
 has played himself 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:30.680
 diploma psychologist and yes just in 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.370
 things integration new players 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.780
 what awaits us in the task we ourselves 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.780
 there already a clear support 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.250
 in the eyes of many journalists 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.900
 graduated stephan citizen with his 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.890
 protege to the training start one 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.600
 loose unit 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.370
 you have to know that the first days 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.050
 anyway, first serve the acclimation 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.020
 So there I do not put any big ones 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.670
 to scale but the gc to 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.080
 Presentation of press work 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.340
 the players should talk to each other 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.770
 get to know that it is much more important 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.450
 as training content but first we 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.380
 have enough time and there it comes 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.390
 not to hit today 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.150
 the reins will be in the coming weeks 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.220
 but tighter pulled to the best possible 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.280
 prepared the reboot in the third 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.080
 to tackle the league 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.610
 quite clearly basic endurance stands 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.840
 in the middle and until the 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.460
 Training camp the first two weeks 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.650
 will be filled with it 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.450
 it has nothing to do with it that we only 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.280
 permanently running around the place 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.930
 but also a lot of football play 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.100
 I want to get to know the players in 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.330
 to play football of your kind 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.770
 they should know each other 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.950
 learn and for the first two weeks 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.950
 long
