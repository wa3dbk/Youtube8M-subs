00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.180
 all welcome enemies and spectators and 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.590
 precious subscribers of our channel 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.570
 today is Saturday 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.849
 so it's time for a new release 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.470
 club news and the most interesting for 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.489
 last week in the world of gaming industry 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.820
 drove today we find out that dota 2 and 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.710
 surs 2 will soon become one 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.680
 borderlands online already announced 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.030
 soon early access h van ze 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.290
 one 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.930
 level will be able to play along with 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.850
 friends in no Minsk we will get you 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.640
 will be able to play with friends in no 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.159
 man's sky what does that mean oh wow 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.980
 quiet quiet quiet now we will tell everything 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.749
 but Minsk is not a traditional network 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.120
 the game here you can not explore 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.460
 space together with friends most 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.829
 you won't even know who 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.170
 other people play and whether it plays at all 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.420
 because the scale of the game is simply colossal in 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.760
 no man's sky all players explore total 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.760
 only one universe however it is so 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.979
 hugely a little wrong put it 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.780
 size is just a monster and every 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.180
 starts at a random place in the galaxy 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.580
 so even knowing where 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.590
 your friends are unlikely to be able to 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.750
 meet them 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.700
 quote people ask us but what if 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.850
 I know where my friends can I get 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.650
 there and I answer yes of course but then 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.660
 your friends will have to stay on 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.240
 place for quite a while while you 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.880
 you get there but even after getting there and 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.160
 sat down on one planet what do you say I'm on 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.860
 a planet the size of the earth standing on a mountain 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.290
 and you where I understand that all this is strange and 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.260
 somewhat chillingly the chapter 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.030
 hello games studios sean murray recall 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.220
 that the planets in no man's sky are also 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.220
 generated completely random that is 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.720
 their size is truly enormous earlier about such 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.790
 scale and reflect was 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.800
 it is so hard it was just 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.530
 impossible so difficult for you 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.660
 imagine what it is how big 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.840
 the scale of the game until we try not 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.450
 find out and therefore do not understand stella 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.770
 has anyone watched this movie 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.020
 developers on umansky stand on 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.470
 that the game is significantly different from everything 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.670
 of what people used to play 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.020
 We inform that the multiplayer in no man's sky 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.070
 not the basis of gameplay 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.050
 and only the release supplement is promised in 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.090
 2015 on playstation 4 version for 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.209
 personal computer is expected later 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:39.520
 date unfortunately not known in new 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.680
 a blog on the official website of the game dota 2 l 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.810
 in reported future plans tangent 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.910
 games including that the game 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.110
 will get the biggest engine improvements in 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.760
 early next year 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.830
 and it is likely that it will not 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.240
 just update and transition to the new version 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.130
 source 2 engine 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.110
 despite the fact that the developers are not 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.850
 calls engine exactly source 2 new 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.550
 version of the game dota 2 is marked as 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.380
 I quote a significant improvement which 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.209
 allow users to quickly create 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.950
 custom fashion on the example of the current 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.700
 version of the engine and editor dota 2 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.010
 workshops 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.100
 alpha unfortunately no details about 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.900
 there is no material except support 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.090
 64-bit systems what exactly will bring 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.160
 surse 2 in addition to the specified was not clear 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.500
 would be cool if you were a first-person view 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.030
 the company belt notes that due to 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.850
 this major update 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.260
 the game attention does not get festive 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.390
 content as past years 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.580
 This is due to the fact that any content 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.560
 will require complete processing from scratch to 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.410
 that Velv has neither time nor resources 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.820
 instead, all forces will go to carry 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.220
 dota 2 to the new engine 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.170
 however, there will be something in February 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.600
 new traditional festival of new colors 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.610
 so you can expect release 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.650
 dota 2 on new technologies most likely 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.650
 will be the end of February or spring 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.510
 information appeared about announcements 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.640
 borderlands online if you believe the edition 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.710
 stupid with reference to the Chinese source 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.750
 studio shaba games together with the studio 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.150
 tuki games announced borderlands 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.220
 online however is not yet completely clear 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.410
 how is all this implemented except 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.030
 the fact that this is an MRI shooter with the same 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.800
 concept as in previous parts 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.600
 the series also states that 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.520
 initially the project is oriented for 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.050
 Chinese region and beta players 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.480
 testing will take place on a personal 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.580
 computer and mobile devices worth 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.380
 mention that the concept of burgundy always 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.100
 was comfortable for doing online 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.140
 component 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.850
 except for all 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.890
 parts of the cooperative and themselves 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.170
 developers often shared their thoughts about 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.630
 creating quote endless 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.520
 borderlands do you think the move is right 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.100
 made studio shanda games in collaboration with 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:45.550
 studio such games beta testing 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:48.040
 by the way scheduled for 2015 came out on our 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.060
 look the most epic short 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.100
 team fortress 2 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.470
 the filming of this short film took 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.580
 literally years however james film can 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.680
 and not the end of the line 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.050
 that's what it's called at last 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.210
 finished and he really and if not 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.130
 the most epic of all animations 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.080
 films on team fortress 2 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.510
 included in the top five and on a par with the rollers 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.670

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.070

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.260
 subway maps zhki and other on the outskirts 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.450
 By the way worked bale and also worked 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.190
 Projects like black mesa despite 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.990
 the fact that he is a professional developer 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.210
 This does not mean that others can not 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.220
 also the entire short film was created in 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.340
 Sursk maker link of course in
