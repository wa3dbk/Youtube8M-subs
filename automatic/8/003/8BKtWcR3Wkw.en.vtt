00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.390
 hello and welcome for the first episode of something 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.990
 today we will present the case of year 500d evolution of the channel 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.469
 450d released a little over a year ago 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.469
 so it's an amateur SLR with a 14 megapixel sensor 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.189
 format aps ii 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.699
 with the digic 4 processor 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.310
 the big novelty on this model is the possibility to film in full 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.470
 hd 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.609
 it's the direct competitor of sony alpha 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.839
 a380 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.259
 denis cotte d5000 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.140
 or lola over six years 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.950
 when unpacking gifts of 500 unwinding find the manual 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.850
 of use 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.820
 charge to the battery the sheikh salah hamza the assembly 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.260
 the usb cable and TV and unfortunately as usual 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.950
 something is missing 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.880
 at the level of the general stole 4 70% on the 3 inch screen with a 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.490
 resolution of 921 points 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.920
 you find that it is a compact compact enough 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.140
 which presents a beautiful finish 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.130
 compared to other devices in the qua none range 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.860
 the 500d takes back the chassis and the viewfinder of the 450d 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.070
 as well as the selection wheel without big brother 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.720
 52 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.650
 during our test week we found that the handle was no longer 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.320
 enveloping that the 450d 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.050
 but a bit too short for our taste which hinders people in 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.550
 replacing the little finger 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.590
 we tend not to know what to do 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.650
 at the level of the positioning of the buttons to find that fall easily under 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.690
 fingers and we especially appreciated the location of the buttons iso and the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.120
 wheel that is right next to the trigger 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.479
 the screen contents and so it's a 3-inch lcd screen 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.260
 128 point resolution well above the competition 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.260
 however, it is not profitable 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.289
 during our week attest 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.919
 we particularly appreciated the direct focus on 

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:46.080
 the screen this very nice function 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.880
 I did not listen to see in some cases 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.899
 on the other hand we were very disappointed by the slow autofocus 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.430
 I sometimes even have up to 3 seconds to make the wind between 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.900
 Regarding the flash of a built-in flash 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.370
 which gives good results 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.590
 these images are touching 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.880
 exposed goods 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.460
 at the storage level 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.900
 the 500d accepts test formats 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.460
 spare parts 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.529
 we recommend a card with a high write speed 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.969
 of the type a6 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:14.189
 and a minimum of 8 gigabytes for video hd 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:15.519
 at the battery level 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.849
 so it's a battery that can do about 500 shock 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.319
 according to use 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.319
 an extra battery may be needed 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:28.339
 in terms of connectivity the 500d has a theater connectivity 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.019
 there is a mini hdmi socket 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.379
 a usb socket 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.159
 a plug for remote control 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.909
 to finish the anti-dust system 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.370
 the sensor cd everything automatically at each stop at each stop 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.399
 thanks to a vibration system 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.999
 we have the dust rushed to raise the mirror welcome for 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:48.969
 perform manual cleaning 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.969
 after a week of use the system does its job well 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.949
 no complaints 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.159
 regarding saving photos 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.340
 the device records 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.929
 hp 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.529
 I had everything at once 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.529
 videos when she goes public 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.019
 Regarding the menu navigation we found which was relatively 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.639
 simple and intuitive 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.069
 we only regret not seeing the training cross button in the menu 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.209
 as on other competing models 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.209
 it does not require you just to charge in your way 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.609
 the photo histogram 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.090
 present all the elements 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.619
 for precise control 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:26.849
 rtp brightness 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.949
 the unstabilized Cantabrian casing 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.949
 it is better to opt for goals that gets us out 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.299
 during this week of testing we found a slight overexposure 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.309
 pictures 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.360
 but the color rendering is rather neutral 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.969
 which is very nice 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:45.389
 the scissors 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.870
 they come pretty big beach of blood at 32 cents 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.310
 with possibility of extension via the personalization menu 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.559
 up to 6014 8 6 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:59.389
 up to 6400 of the noise is correct the pressure has four without any problem 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.439
 all this gets rid of the time of a photo 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.089
 the autofocus meanwhile has 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:08.789
 9 points kuperman autofocus 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.409
 to take stock quickly and efficiently 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.809
 and I'm sometimes a bit capricious 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:15.859
 in low light 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.849
 the optical viewfinder and endowed with a mirror puppet sight also are relatively 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:21.669
 important 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.110
 from 0 87 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.499
 and a field coverage of about 95% 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:30.679
 novel cervantes we found the sump pleasant except by Benoit 

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:33.679
 who is the most problem with his glasses 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.669
 and finally the video 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.430
 the strong element of this new model of his health 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.900
 it allows you to capture scenes in full hd 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.069
 with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.629
 but the speed is limited to 20 frames per second 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.059
 which makes the videos a little choppy 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:53.680
 they preferred to use the 720p mode 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.800
 which offers 30 images per second 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.999
 which makes videos more fluid 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.309
 autofocus 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:02.539
 and that once again too slow video mode 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.330
 which causes problems in the scenes 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.809
 with several depth of field 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:09.559
 the video mode is satisfactory for short sequences 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.169
 fixed shots 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.439
 and to conclude 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:14.749
 after this week of decline 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:18.169
 in this context is a pity that the screen of his laptop 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.479
 that video mode full hd this dignitary late in the game in second 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.069
 and that is not stereo sound 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.069
 and especially that autofocus in live view mode 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.960
 possible 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.779
 up to 3 seconds 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.570
 it's really not normal against once again 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.600
 that it surprises us with a compact device the versatile egypt that 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.259
 gives a very good image 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.210
 the interface is relatively simple 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.870
 its high resolution lcd screen is perfect 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.610
 resolution of 15 megapixels and october 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.770
 autofocus and very quickly fanned reflex 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.580
 and there is a very good noise management 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.599
 electronic 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.689
 we highly recommend this product 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.180
 stone camatte 500d 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.150
 you hang out thanks for watching this video 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.539
 and we hope very soon
