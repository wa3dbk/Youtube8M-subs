00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.519
 the number of thefts 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.519

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.619
 established residents 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.130
 that is always recorded tuesdays are just opened the number will drive away 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.410
 to have this cumbersome method 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.929
 on one of the commercial opportunities 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.300
 i say i 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.050
 small country world product 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 it's about a reaction behind 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.390
 this is really true 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.200
 the three perpetrators the minister a nice start and direct opponent who by 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.390
 the anp 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 This is such a horrible message about it that includes both goals 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.040
 it then comes naturally we try a new feature because the audience 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.780

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.560
 to test 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.610
 for that is a hefty assumption that employees have the stress tests on the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.860
 on our neighbor's job 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.940

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.040
 issues

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.829
 a bike larger than a year earlier when the child 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.430
 He recently started working that the chilly trend towards more though they were on the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.209
