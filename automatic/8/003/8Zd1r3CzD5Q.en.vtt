00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.280 
something has nothing yeah all of
nothing<00:00:05.370> is<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.670> bit<00:00:05.880> unfair<00:00:06.149> but<00:00:06.479> I<00:00:06.840> can<00:00:07.139> take

nothing is a bit unfair but I can take

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.390 
nothing is a bit unfair but I can take
it<00:00:07.970> I<00:00:08.970> think<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.770> obviously<00:00:10.770> first<00:00:11.010> off<00:00:11.190> wasn't

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
it I think we obviously first off wasn't

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.730 
it I think we obviously first off wasn't
our<00:00:11.700> level<00:00:12.060> and<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.480> recognize<00:00:12.930> that<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.350> I'm

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
our level and we recognize that and I'm

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.129 
our level and we recognize that and I'm
the<00:00:13.890> first<00:00:14.130> one<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> recognize<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:15.000> do<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.300> we

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
the first one to recognize we do that we

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.240 
the first one to recognize we do that we
couldn't<00:00:16.320> really<00:00:16.439> play<00:00:16.740> well<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.070> probably

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
couldn't really play well and probably

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.609 
couldn't really play well and probably
deserve<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.789> be<00:00:17.910> one<00:00:18.090> one<00:00:18.960> kneel<00:00:19.140> down<00:00:19.289> at<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
deserve to be one one kneel down at the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.970 
deserve to be one one kneel down at the
first<00:00:19.830> half<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> second<00:00:21.240> half<00:00:21.360> was<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.980> bit

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
first half in the second half was a bit

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.160 
first half in the second half was a bit
different<00:00:23.369> always<00:00:23.850> difficult<00:00:24.300> against

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
different always difficult against

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.080 
different always difficult against
against<00:00:26.070> Southampton<00:00:26.250> because<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:26.880> really

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
against Southampton because they really

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.670 
against Southampton because they really
played<00:00:27.300> extremely<00:00:27.930> well<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.350> very<00:00:28.440> well

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
played extremely well and very well

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.670 
played extremely well and very well
organized<00:00:29.990> but<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.050> think<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.350> the<00:00:31.439> end<00:00:31.529> we've

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
organized but I think in the end we've

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.139 
organized but I think in the end we've
got<00:00:31.710> what<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.129> deserve<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
got what we deserve for with in the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.509 
got what we deserve for with in the
second<00:00:33.449> half<00:00:33.569> the<00:00:34.039> great<00:00:35.039> moment<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
second half the great moment of

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.930 
second half the great moment of
individual<00:00:36.359> brilliance<00:00:36.569> obviously<00:00:37.879> in<00:00:38.879> that

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
individual brilliance obviously in that

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.319 
individual brilliance obviously in that
probably<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.989> split<00:00:40.739> second<00:00:41.159> that<00:00:41.329> Solomon

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
probably that split second that Solomon

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.439 
probably that split second that Solomon
didn't<00:00:42.569> allow<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:43.050> game<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.589> to<00:00:44.100> Gareth<00:00:44.449> that

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
didn't allow all game to to Gareth that

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.989 
didn't allow all game to to Gareth that

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:47.999 
day allowed and that in that instant and

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:49.910 
day allowed and that in that instant and

again difficult game in the beginning

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.540 
again difficult game in the beginning
you<00:01:51.000> think<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.390> couldn't<00:01:51.720> find<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> spaces

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
you think you couldn't find the spaces

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
you think you couldn't find the spaces
to<00:01:53.550> receive<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> ball<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.210> weren't<00:01:54.420> passing

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
to receive the ball we weren't passing

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.110 
to receive the ball we weren't passing
the<00:01:54.810> ball<00:01:54.930> properly<00:01:55.580> trying<00:01:56.580> a<00:01:56.640> lot<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.909> long

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
the ball properly trying a lot of long

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.300 
the ball properly trying a lot of long
balls<00:01:57.300> and<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:58.080> game<00:01:58.650> wasn't<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.159> our<00:01:59.280> way

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
balls and and game wasn't going our way

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.280 
balls and and game wasn't going our way
I<00:01:59.610> think<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> second<00:02:00.720> half<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.990> managed<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
I think in the second half we managed to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.410 
I think in the second half we managed to
find<00:02:01.530> him<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.800> little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.130> better<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.210> left

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
find him a little bit better on the left

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.030 
find him a little bit better on the left
and<00:02:03.690> then<00:02:03.900> on<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.140> right<00:02:04.290> when<00:02:04.620> he<00:02:04.710> changed

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
and then on the right when he changed

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.690 
and then on the right when he changed
again<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:08.009> think<00:02:08.190> probably<00:02:08.399> was<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
again and and I think probably was the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.379 
again and and I think probably was the
only<00:02:09.090> moment<00:02:09.269> where<00:02:09.709> Solomon<00:02:10.709> left<00:02:10.950> him<00:02:11.389> that

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:12.389 
only moment where Solomon left him that

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.489 
only moment where Solomon left him that
split<00:02:12.629> second<00:02:12.989> where<00:02:13.079> he<00:02:13.139> can<00:02:13.290> make<00:02:13.409> the

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:13.499 
split second where he can make the

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.059 
split second where he can make the
difference

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
difference

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.199 
difference
easy<00:02:14.280> fix<00:02:15.060> yeah<00:02:18.709> no<00:02:19.709> no<00:02:20.040> no<00:02:20.069> trained<00:02:20.909> all<00:02:21.030> weak

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
easy fix yeah no no no trained all weak

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:32.059 
easy fix yeah no no no trained all weak
trained<00:02:21.569> all<00:02:21.689> the<00:02:22.400> no<00:02:27.829> and<00:02:28.829> I<00:02:28.890> didn't<00:02:29.400> see<00:02:31.069> no

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
trained all the no and I didn't see no

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.780 
trained all the no and I didn't see no
we<00:02:32.310> haven't<00:02:32.700> Ella<00:02:32.909> penalty<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.989> so

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
we haven't Ella penalty this is so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.649 
we haven't Ella penalty this is so
similar<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.299> never<00:02:36.629> saw<00:02:36.780> this<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.110> football<00:02:37.440> but

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
similar I never saw this in football but

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.890 
similar I never saw this in football but
yeah<00:02:40.609> so<00:02:41.609> probably<00:02:42.120> means<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.540> we<00:02:42.659> end<00:02:42.780> up

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
yeah so probably means that we end up

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.030 
yeah so probably means that we end up
one<00:02:43.530> season<00:02:43.829> without<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.099> penalty<00:02:44.510> which<00:02:45.510> is

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
one season without a penalty which is

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.420 
one season without a penalty which is
remarkable<00:02:47.209> but<00:02:49.099> anyway<00:02:50.099> we're<00:02:50.220> not<00:02:50.310> that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
remarkable but anyway we're not that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.640 
remarkable but anyway we're not that
good<00:02:50.609> after<00:02:51.359> us<00:02:51.540> all<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.769> fine<00:02:55.849> yeah

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
good after us all so it's fine yeah

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.960 
good after us all so it's fine yeah
great<00:02:58.650> position<00:02:59.069> but<00:02:59.220> extremely<00:02:59.730> difficult

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
great position but extremely difficult

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.349 
great position but extremely difficult
we<00:03:00.900> have<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:01.099> great<00:03:02.099> week<00:03:02.280> ahead<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.549> us<00:03:02.730> with

we have a great week ahead of us with
two-way<00:03:03.840> games<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:05.849> are<00:03:06.599> decisive<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:08.310> keep

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
two-way games that are decisive to keep

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.949 
two-way games that are decisive to keep
us<00:03:08.609> in<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.760> frame<00:03:09.030> everything<00:03:09.599> is<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.870> our

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
us in the frame everything is in our

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.119 
us in the frame everything is in our
hands<00:03:10.379> but<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.970> know<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.650> we<00:03:13.650> hope<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.980> make

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
hands but you know is we hope to make

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.789 
hands but you know is we hope to make
that<00:03:14.280> final<00:03:14.519> push<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.959> game<00:03:16.139> against<00:03:16.379> Chelsea

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
that final push the game against Chelsea

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.189 
that final push the game against Chelsea
would<00:03:16.950> be<00:03:17.099> a<00:03:17.819> massive<00:03:18.239> massive<00:03:18.569> game<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.139> us

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
would be a massive massive game for us

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.580 
would be a massive massive game for us
obviously<00:03:19.949> depends<00:03:20.609> on<00:03:20.730> whatever<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.840> solid

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
obviously depends on whatever a solid

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.369 
obviously depends on whatever a solid
Chelsea<00:03:22.889> do<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.220> their<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.489> many<00:03:23.639> fixtures

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
Chelsea do with their in many fixtures

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.369 
Chelsea do with their in many fixtures
but<00:03:26.090> but<00:03:27.090> at<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.299> moment<00:03:27.449> we<00:03:27.690> are<00:03:27.750> still<00:03:27.930> in

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
but but at the moment we are still in

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.559 
but but at the moment we are still in
with<00:03:28.530> our<00:03:28.709> shot<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.549> with<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.030> destiny<00:03:30.419> no

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
with our shot and with the destiny no

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.610 
with our shot and with the destiny no
it's<00:03:35.359> both<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.480> them<00:03:36.629> have<00:03:36.750> both<00:03:37.019> Lenin<00:03:37.440> and

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
it's both of them have both Lenin and

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.409 
it's both of them have both Lenin and
then<00:03:38.280> Bella<00:03:38.459> felt<00:03:40.639> you<00:03:41.639> know<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.000> muscle

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
then Bella felt you know the muscle

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.509 
then Bella felt you know the muscle
tightness<00:03:42.769> they<00:03:43.769> haven't<00:03:44.040> ruptured<00:03:44.430> the

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
tightness they haven't ruptured the

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.119 
tightness they haven't ruptured the
muscle<00:03:44.849> but<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:46.290> know<00:03:46.410> as<00:03:46.500> soon<00:03:46.620> as<00:03:46.739> they<00:03:46.919> felt

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
muscle but you know as soon as they felt

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.530 
muscle but you know as soon as they felt
that<00:03:47.250> they<00:03:47.400> didn't<00:03:47.699> want<00:03:47.849> to<00:03:47.910> risk<00:03:48.180> which<00:03:48.510> is

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
that they didn't want to risk which is

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.949 
that they didn't want to risk which is
absolutely<00:03:49.379> fine<00:03:49.549> so<00:03:50.549> there<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.959> small

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
absolutely fine so there is a small

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.379 
absolutely fine so there is a small
possibility<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.680> they<00:03:52.829> will<00:03:52.919> be<00:03:53.040> okay<00:03:53.389> but

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
possibility that they will be okay but

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.619 
possibility that they will be okay but
we<00:03:54.750> have<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.099> we<00:03:56.099> have<00:03:56.129> to<00:03:56.250> let<00:03:56.489> them<00:03:56.669> settle<00:03:57.480> a
