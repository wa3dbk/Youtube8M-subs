stick I like the black more of a
stealthy<00:02:10.830> look<00:02:10.979> rather<00:02:11.220> than

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
stealthy look rather than

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.470 
stealthy look rather than
the<00:02:11.950> really<00:02:12.160> crazy<00:02:12.550> graphics<00:02:13.150> all<00:02:13.270> over<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
the really crazy graphics all over the

the really crazy graphics all over the
hockey<00:02:13.720> sticks<00:02:13.930> oh<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.050> like<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.410> artwork<00:02:14.740> on

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980

with<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.020> hockey<00:02:17.200> stick<00:02:17.620> performance<00:02:18.190> but<00:02:18.370> I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
with the hockey stick performance but I

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.030 
with the hockey stick performance but I
did<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.240> looks<00:02:19.390> nice<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:20.530> see<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
did it just looks nice you can see the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.410 
did it just looks nice you can see the
stick<00:02:21.220> has<00:02:21.280> already<00:02:21.520> seen<00:02:21.670> some<00:02:21.820> battle<00:02:22.150> got<00:02:22.360> a

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
stick has already seen some battle got a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.420 
stick has already seen some battle got a
few<00:02:22.570> chips<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.020> things<00:02:23.350> there<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.250> first

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
few chips and things there so the first

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.890 
few chips and things there so the first
feature<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.910> like<00:02:25.060> here<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.720> tack

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
feature that I like here is the tack

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.380 
feature that I like here is the tack
spiral<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.370> don't<00:02:27.520> really<00:02:27.580> like<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.970> grippy

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
spiral so I don't really like the grippy

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.340 
spiral so I don't really like the grippy
sticky<00:02:29.050> grip<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.310> somehow<00:02:31.030> mystics<00:02:31.480> have<00:02:31.600> so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
sticky grip that somehow mystics have so

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.440 
sticky grip that somehow mystics have so
these<00:02:33.280> ones<00:02:33.459> just<00:02:33.670> have<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.880> tactical<00:02:34.180> grip

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
these ones just have the tactical grip

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.120 
these ones just have the tactical grip
it's<00:02:34.660> just<00:02:34.840> bumps<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.620> can<00:02:35.800> still<00:02:35.980> get<00:02:36.100> a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
it's just bumps so you can still get a

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.260 
it's just bumps so you can still get a
better<00:02:36.250> feel<00:02:36.490> for<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.700> stick<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.090> bit<00:02:37.209> of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
better feel for the stick and a bit of

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.960 
better feel for the stick and a bit of
grip<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:37.900> it's<00:02:38.050> not<00:02:38.140> really<00:02:38.320> sticky<00:02:38.970> since

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
grip but it's not really sticky since

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.730 
grip but it's not really sticky since
I'm<00:02:40.060> moving<00:02:40.180> further<00:02:40.510> down<00:02:40.660> I'll<00:02:41.440> show<00:02:41.470> you

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.380 
what I got here so I got the tapes
pattern<00:02:43.540> P<00:02:43.750> 14<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.380> got<00:02:44.590> 87<00:02:44.890> flex<00:02:45.310> which<00:02:46.120> is<00:02:46.180> good

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
pattern P 14 I got 87 flex which is good

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.540 
pattern P 14 I got 87 flex which is good
for<00:02:46.570> rashad<00:02:47.200> snapshots<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.040> then<00:02:48.670> live<00:02:49.209> six

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
for rashad snapshots and then live six

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
for rashad snapshots and then live six
so<00:02:51.550> I'm<00:02:51.640> going<00:02:51.850> further<00:02:52.030> down<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.330> stick

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
so I'm going further down the stick

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.470 
so I'm going further down the stick
right<00:02:53.260> about<00:02:53.470> here<00:02:54.030> halfway<00:02:55.030> down<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.239> stick

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
right about here halfway down the stick

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.410 
right about here halfway down the stick
they<00:02:55.870> have<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.530> grip<00:02:56.950> TAC<00:02:57.190> which<00:02:57.550> is<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
they have the grip TAC which is the the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.090 
they have the grip TAC which is the the
sticky<00:02:58.810> stuff<00:02:58.989> which<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.770> was<00:02:59.890> talking<00:03:00.070> about

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
sticky stuff which I was talking about

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.990 
sticky stuff which I was talking about
earlier<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:01.180> cool<00:03:01.720> thing<00:03:01.959> is<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.920> it's<00:03:03.850> only

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
earlier the cool thing is that it's only

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.160 
earlier the cool thing is that it's only
on<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.209> bottom<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.540> hockey<00:03:04.720> sticks<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.110> I

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
on the bottom of hockey sticks so I

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.449 
on the bottom of hockey sticks so I
don't<00:03:05.350> like<00:03:05.470> having<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.890> on<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.010> top<00:03:06.250> dog

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
don't like having it on the top dog

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.010 
don't like having it on the top dog
stick<00:03:06.790> because<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.239> like<00:03:07.390> my<00:03:07.510> bond<00:03:07.660> hand<00:03:07.930> and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
stick because I like my bond hand and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.199 
stick because I like my bond hand and
got<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.140> slide<00:03:08.410> when<00:03:08.620> I'm<00:03:08.709> standing<00:03:09.190> so<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:09.970> can

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
got a slide when I'm standing so I can

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.550 
got a slide when I'm standing so I can
you<00:03:10.390> know<00:03:10.420> pull<00:03:10.510> off<00:03:10.900> moves<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.350> stuff<00:03:11.410> like

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
you know pull off moves and stuff like

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.770 
you know pull off moves and stuff like
that<00:03:11.709> easily<00:03:12.070> but<00:03:12.670> once<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.360> get<00:03:13.570> halfway

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
that easily but once you get halfway

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.750 
that easily but once you get halfway
down<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.080> stick<00:03:14.320> then<00:03:14.739> it's<00:03:15.310> cool<00:03:15.549> to<00:03:15.640> have

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
down the stick then it's cool to have

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.729 
down the stick then it's cool to have
the<00:03:15.880> grip<00:03:16.060> there<00:03:16.269> because<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.440> can<00:03:17.530> take<00:03:17.680> you

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
the grip there because we can take you

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.080 
the grip there because we can take you
slap<00:03:17.950> shots<00:03:18.220> or<00:03:18.370> snap<00:03:18.580> shots

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
slap shots or snap shots

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.520 
slap shots or snap shots
you're<00:03:19.330> gonna<00:03:19.420> get<00:03:19.600> better<00:03:19.870> grip<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.350> kind

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
you're gonna get better grip so I kind

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.050 
you're gonna get better grip so I kind
of<00:03:20.560> liked<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.799> idea<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.130> having<00:03:21.400> half<00:03:21.640> the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
of liked that idea of having half the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.910 
of liked that idea of having half the
stick<00:03:22.299> with<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.900> grip<00:03:23.110> TAC<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.830> other

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
stick with the grip TAC and the other

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.220 
stick with the grip TAC and the other
half<00:03:24.340> Authority<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.239> model<00:03:25.870> actually

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
half Authority so this model actually

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.600 
half Authority so this model actually
doesn't<00:03:26.470> have<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.769> but<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.250> ones<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:27.549> you

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
doesn't have it but the ones that you

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.710 
doesn't have it but the ones that you
see<00:03:27.760> in<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:27.880> sorcerer<00:03:28.150> sports<00:03:28.390> will<00:03:28.570> have

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
see in the sorcerer sports will have

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.759 
see in the sorcerer sports will have
that<00:03:28.900> on<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.080> bottom<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.410> think<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.650> was<00:03:29.739> a

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
that on the bottom so I think that was a

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.890 
that on the bottom so I think that was a
really<00:03:29.920> cool<00:03:30.130> feature<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.700> Bauer<00:03:31.180> did<00:03:31.390> it's

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
really cool feature that Bauer did it's

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.810 
really cool feature that Bauer did it's
kinda<00:03:32.110> nice<00:03:32.200> then<00:03:33.130> down<00:03:33.310> here<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.519> put<00:03:33.790> some

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
kinda nice then down here I put some

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.520 
kinda nice then down here I put some
tape<00:03:34.299> just<00:03:34.690> in<00:03:34.780> this<00:03:34.870> section<00:03:35.140> because<00:03:35.410> that's

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
tape just in this section because that's

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.199 
tape just in this section because that's
usually<00:03:35.830> where<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.130> get<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> lot<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.430> slashes<00:03:37.000> and

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
usually where I get a lot of slashes and

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.180 
usually where I get a lot of slashes and
hacks<00:03:37.390> from<00:03:37.720> taking<00:03:38.080> face<00:03:38.230> offs<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.590> stuff<00:03:38.769> so

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
hacks from taking face offs and stuff so

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.530 
hacks from taking face offs and stuff so
I<00:03:39.220> taped<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.519> up<00:03:39.700> just<00:03:40.060> for<00:03:40.150> some<00:03:40.329> extra

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
I taped that up just for some extra

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.210 
I taped that up just for some extra
protection<00:03:40.690> then<00:03:41.530> see<00:03:41.709> I've<00:03:41.799> already<00:03:41.920> saved

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
protection then see I've already saved

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.460 
protection then see I've already saved
my<00:03:42.370> stick<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:42.640> few<00:03:42.850> dings<00:03:43.299> there<00:03:44.079> in<00:03:44.230> there<00:03:44.380> and

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
my stick a few dings there in there and

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.990 
my stick a few dings there in there and
there<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.860> I<00:03:44.920> just<00:03:44.950> put<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:45.310> on<00:03:45.459> maybe<00:03:45.850> two

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
there and I just put this on maybe two

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.410 
there and I just put this on maybe two
games<00:03:46.209> ago<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:47.410> then<00:03:47.500> coming<00:03:47.739> down<00:03:47.920> we've<00:03:48.760> got

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
games ago and then coming down we've got

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.990 
games ago and then coming down we've got
just<00:03:50.170> some<00:03:50.320> more<00:03:50.440> pattern<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.760> think<00:03:51.910> this

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
just some more pattern and I think this

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.360 
just some more pattern and I think this
is<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.150> mid<00:03:52.600> kick<00:03:52.810> kick<00:03:53.170> point<00:03:53.530> for<00:03:53.769> snapshots

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
is a mid kick kick point for snapshots

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.979 
is a mid kick kick point for snapshots
and<00:03:54.519> rare<00:03:54.640> shots<00:03:54.820> was<00:03:55.000> good<00:03:55.150> then<00:03:55.690> going<00:03:55.900> on

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
and rare shots was good then going on

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.240 
and rare shots was good then going on
the<00:03:56.079> blade<00:03:56.290> there's<00:03:56.799> some<00:03:56.920> nice<00:03:57.010> features

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
the blade there's some nice features

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.060 
the blade there's some nice features
here<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.989> it's<00:03:59.320> got<00:03:59.470> this<00:03:59.560> rubber

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
here so it's got this rubber

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.400 
here so it's got this rubber
stuff<00:04:00.940> right<00:04:01.090> at<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.269> bottom<00:04:01.570> which<00:04:02.110> is<00:04:02.230> nice

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
stuff right at the bottom which is nice

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.860 
stuff right at the bottom which is nice
kind<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.010> softens<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.579> puck<00:04:03.820> even<00:04:04.420> when<00:04:04.780> you

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
kind of softens the puck even when you

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.449 
kind of softens the puck even when you
tape<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.200> it's<00:04:05.709> got<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:05.890> bit<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.100> rubber<00:04:06.220> there

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
tape it it's got a bit of rubber there

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.610 
tape it it's got a bit of rubber there
so<00:04:06.730> when<00:04:07.120> you're<00:04:07.500> giving<00:04:08.500> or<00:04:08.590> receiving

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
so when you're giving or receiving

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.380 
so when you're giving or receiving
passes<00:04:09.310> especially<00:04:09.400> receiving<00:04:10.000> pass<00:04:10.120> it's

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
passes especially receiving pass it's

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.789 
passes especially receiving pass it's
gonna<00:04:10.480> soften<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.989> past<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.410> bit<00:04:11.560> and

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
gonna soften the past is a bit and

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.199 
gonna soften the past is a bit and
inside<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:12.910> also<00:04:13.180> has<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:14.310> foam<00:04:15.310> core<00:04:15.549> so<00:04:16.060> that's

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
inside it also has a foam core so that's

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.349 
inside it also has a foam core so that's
gonna<00:04:16.299> dampen<00:04:16.540> the<00:04:16.840> past

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
gonna dampen the past

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.300 
gonna dampen the past
as<00:04:17.840> well<00:04:18.079> so<00:04:18.560> it's<00:04:18.680> really<00:04:18.739> nice<00:04:19.009> for

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
as well so it's really nice for

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.670 
as well so it's really nice for
stickhandling<00:04:19.969> and<00:04:20.659> also<00:04:21.289> taking<00:04:21.590> classes

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
advanced features that usually only see

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.149

tackles<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.620> new<00:04:54.740> feature<00:04:54.979> that<00:04:55.129> I<00:04:55.340> think<00:04:55.789> every

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:56.029 
tackles a new feature that I think every

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.490 
tackles a new feature that I think every
stick<00:04:56.240> should<00:04:56.389> have<00:04:56.539> because<00:04:56.960> that's<00:04:57.229> where<00:04:57.349> I

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
stick should have because that's where I

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.529 
stick should have because that's where I
can<00:04:57.800> use<00:04:57.979> a<00:04:58.009> lot<00:04:58.219> more<00:04:58.250> in<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.550> game<00:04:58.669> today<00:04:58.879> so

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
can use a lot more in the game today so

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:00.879 
can use a lot more in the game today so
those<00:04:59.719> are<00:04:59.870> some<00:04:59.990> features<00:05:00.139> that<00:05:00.289> usually<00:05:00.710> see

material that's used for making it the

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.649 
material that's used for making it the
shaft<00:05:15.620> on<00:05:15.800> a<00:05:15.860> stick<00:05:16.099> nice<00:05:16.849> and<00:05:17.029> durable<00:05:17.180> but

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
shaft on a stick nice and durable but

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:19.300 
shaft on a stick nice and durable but
still<00:05:17.900> very<00:05:17.930> light<00:05:18.289> so<00:05:18.830> that's<00:05:19.039> another

opponents<00:05:19.939> feature<00:05:20.090> usually<00:05:20.539> they<00:05:21.110> use<00:05:21.319> the

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:21.589 
opponents feature usually they use the

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.290 
opponents feature usually they use the
heavier<00:05:22.099> materials<00:05:22.580> for<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:22.789> cheaper<00:05:23.060> sticks

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
heavier materials for the cheaper sticks

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.459 
heavier materials for the cheaper sticks
and<00:05:23.479> lighter<00:05:23.690> materials<00:05:24.169> for<00:05:24.289> the<00:05:24.349> more

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
and lighter materials for the more

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.159 
and lighter materials for the more
expensive<00:05:24.650> sticks<00:05:25.039> so<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.550> $149<00:05:26.509> it's<00:05:26.779> a<00:05:26.839> nice<00:05:26.960> a

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
expensive sticks so I $149 it's a nice a

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.839 
expensive sticks so I $149 it's a nice a
between<00:05:27.500> stick<00:05:27.770> so<00:05:28.009> you<00:05:28.039> don't<00:05:28.310> get<00:05:28.400> too<00:05:28.639> much

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
between stick so you don't get too much

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.279 
between stick so you don't get too much
but<00:05:29.330> you<00:05:29.419> don't<00:05:29.569> get<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.839> bottom<00:05:30.169> of<00:05:30.229> the

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
but you don't get the bottom of the

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.290 
but you don't get the bottom of the
barrel<00:05:30.560> type<00:05:30.740> materials<00:05:31.219> so<00:05:31.759> I<00:05:31.789> really<00:05:32.150> like<00:05:32.270> a

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300
