00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
is we played the picking slightly

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.940 
is we played the picking slightly
different

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950

we play that
which<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.220> six<00:04:08.760> on<00:04:08.939> two<00:04:09.120> together<00:04:10.159> use<00:04:11.159> a

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
which is six on two together use a

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.100 
which is six on two together use a
little<00:04:11.519> hammer<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.390> first<00:04:12.629> fret<00:04:12.900> on<00:04:12.959> the

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
little hammer to the first fret on the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.050 
little hammer to the first fret on the
second<00:04:13.620> string

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.740 

from<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.019> open<00:04:17.290> screen

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
from the open screen

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:30.680 
from the open screen
and<00:04:19.140> then<00:04:19.290> we<00:04:19.380> play<00:04:19.590> four<00:04:20.190> one<00:04:21.170> six<00:04:22.170> three<00:04:23.540> four

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.260

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
okay after we play that just once we

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.000 
okay after we play that just once we
then<00:04:46.510> return<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.229> original<00:04:47.470> picking

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
then return to the original picking

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.710 
then return to the original picking
pattern

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.040 

okay<00:04:51.680> for<00:04:52.220> once<00:04:52.400> time<00:04:52.700> through<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:53.540> on<00:04:53.840> this

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
okay for once time through so on this

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.590 
okay for once time through so on this
shape<00:04:54.320> what<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:54.770> is<00:04:54.920> is<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.940> original<00:04:56.270> picking

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
shape what it is is the original picking

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.390 
shape what it is is the original picking
pattern<00:04:56.900> that<00:04:57.560> picking<00:04:57.950> pattern<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.340> just

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
pattern that picking pattern that just

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.730 
pattern that picking pattern that just
shows<00:04:58.850> you<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.300> then<00:04:59.840> the<00:05:00.110> original<00:05:00.290> plucking

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
shows you and then the original plucking

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.170 
shows you and then the original plucking
pattern<00:05:01.010> again<00:05:01.250> so<00:05:01.490> it's<00:05:01.670> three<00:05:01.940> times

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
pattern again so it's three times

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.910 
pattern again so it's three times
through<00:05:02.570> so<00:05:03.110> so<00:05:03.710> far<00:05:03.920> we<00:05:04.040> love<00:05:04.250> this

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:18.390 

you

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.400 

okay<00:05:19.030> just<00:05:19.419> doesn't<00:05:19.660> know<00:05:19.720> before<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.080> move<00:05:20.260> on

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
okay just doesn't know before I move on

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.460 
okay just doesn't know before I move on
to<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.680> next<00:05:20.830> position<00:05:21.760> is<00:05:21.940> that<00:05:22.229> this<00:05:23.229> only

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
to the next position is that this only

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.770 
to the next position is that this only
happens<00:05:23.889> during<00:05:23.979> the<00:05:24.490> verse<00:05:24.820> during<00:05:25.660> the

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
happens during the verse during the

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.810 
happens during the verse during the
intro<00:05:26.199> what<00:05:26.620> he<00:05:26.680> does<00:05:26.860> he<00:05:26.979> plays<00:05:27.250> that<00:05:27.520> same

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
intro what he does he plays that same

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.850 
intro what he does he plays that same
picking<00:05:28.240> pattern<00:05:28.360> for<00:05:29.199> the<00:05:29.290> three<00:05:29.560> times

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
picking pattern for the three times

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.980 
picking pattern for the three times
through<00:05:30.250> he<00:05:30.699> doesn't<00:05:31.060> play<00:05:31.210> that<00:05:31.240> alternate

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
through he doesn't play that alternate

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.670 
through he doesn't play that alternate
way<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.139> picking<00:05:32.800> it<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.669> second<00:05:34.060> time<00:05:34.680> okay

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
way of picking it the second time okay

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.890 
way of picking it the second time okay
so<00:05:35.970> why<00:05:36.970> I've<00:05:37.030> just<00:05:37.180> shown<00:05:37.389> you<00:05:37.479> here<00:05:37.600> is<00:05:37.660> the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
so why I've just shown you here is the

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.210 
so why I've just shown you here is the
verse<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.970> intro<00:05:39.970> is<00:05:40.180> just<00:05:40.750> a<00:05:40.870> plain<00:05:41.220> original

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
verse the intro is just a plain original

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:52.540 
verse the intro is just a plain original
picking<00:05:42.520> pattern<00:05:43.020> so<00:05:44.020> after<00:05:44.350> you<00:05:44.470> play<00:05:44.650> this

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.820 

what<00:05:53.000> we<00:05:53.090> do<00:05:53.240> then<00:05:53.449> is<00:05:53.479> we<00:05:53.690> lift<00:05:54.169> off<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.650> two

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
what we do then is we lift off the two

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.869 
what we do then is we lift off the two
fingers

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:57.879 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.699 

we<00:05:58.389> played<00:05:58.599> the<00:05:58.689> original<00:05:58.779> picking<00:05:59.409> pattern

00:05:59.699 --> 00:05:59.709 
we played the original picking pattern

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:03.179 
we played the original picking pattern
again<00:06:00.189> or<00:06:00.490> other<00:06:01.449> than<00:06:01.929> the<00:06:02.529> very<00:06:02.740> first

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:03.189 
again or other than the very first

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:04.980 
again or other than the very first
stroke<00:06:04.029> on<00:06:04.179> the<00:06:04.270> sixth<00:06:04.629> string<00:06:04.809> is

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
stroke on the sixth string is

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.109 
stroke on the sixth string is
accompanied<00:06:05.559> by<00:06:05.589> a<00:06:05.860> stroke<00:06:06.339> on<00:06:06.580> the<00:06:06.699> second

00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:07.119 
accompanied by a stroke on the second

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:16.269 
accompanied by a stroke on the second
string<00:06:07.360> open<00:06:08.020> second<00:06:10.679> okay

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.279 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:21.290 

so<00:06:17.029> we<00:06:17.149> play<00:06:17.269> that<00:06:17.419> once

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.960 

and<00:06:21.660> then<00:06:21.840> we<00:06:21.930> play<00:06:22.139> it<00:06:22.350> the<00:06:23.130> second<00:06:23.550> time<00:06:23.580> but

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
and then we play it the second time but

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.750 
and then we play it the second time but
during<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.539> second<00:06:24.930> time<00:06:25.080> through

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
during the second time through

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.800 
during the second time through
you

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
you

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.440 
you
we<00:06:29.320> move<00:06:29.530> down<00:06:29.860> to<00:06:30.160> the<00:06:30.310> second<00:06:30.970> fret<00:06:31.090> on<00:06:31.300> the

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
we move down to the second fret on the

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.050 
we move down to the second fret on the
sixth<00:06:31.840> string<00:06:31.920> for<00:06:32.920> the<00:06:33.040> second<00:06:33.580> stroke<00:06:33.790> on

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
sixth string for the second stroke on

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.370 
sixth string for the second stroke on
the<00:06:34.330> sixth<00:06:34.660> string<00:06:34.840> okay<00:06:35.200> so<00:06:35.260> it<00:06:35.590> plays

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.040 

okay

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:56.390 

okay<00:06:45.770> so<00:06:45.830> just<00:06:46.220> to<00:06:46.340> get<00:06:46.730> the<00:06:46.850> timing

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.470 

and<00:06:57.400> then<00:06:57.580> to<00:06:57.910> the<00:06:58.120> original<00:06:58.540> shape<00:06:58.720> again<00:07:00.480> and
