00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
this is because of the flexible eater

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.690 
this is because of the flexible eater
either<00:02:06.020> because<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.440> paying<00:02:06.950> attention<00:02:07.460> we're

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
either because of paying attention we're

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.460 
either because of paying attention we're
not<00:02:07.850> knowing<00:02:08.149> you're<00:02:08.270> supposed<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.720> stabilize

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
not knowing you're supposed to stabilize

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.220 
not knowing you're supposed to stabilize
your<00:02:09.619> knee<00:02:09.830> or<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.850> inflexibility<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:12.110> is

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
your knee or the inflexibility that is

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.530 
your knee or the inflexibility that is
in<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.500> hips<00:02:12.740> so<00:02:13.310> if<00:02:13.670> they're<00:02:13.940> really<00:02:14.240> tight

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
in the hips so if they're really tight

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.410 
in the hips so if they're really tight
when<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.410> turn<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:16.220> can't<00:02:16.670> turn<00:02:16.910> very<00:02:17.209> much

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
when I turn I can't turn very much

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.310 
when I turn I can't turn very much
without<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.870> need<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.170> speak<00:02:18.620> with<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:19.120> okay

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
without the need to speak with it okay

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.160 
without the need to speak with it okay
so<00:02:21.820> when<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:22.940> turn<00:02:23.180> got<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.570> how<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.780> keep<00:02:24.020> this
