tour<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:47.129> called<00:00:47.460> surface<00:00:47.879> computing<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
tour it's called surface computing and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.779 
tour it's called surface computing and
you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.110> do<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> without<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.980> interface<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you can do it without the interface of a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.220 
you can do it without the interface of a
mouse<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.539> object<00:00:51.899> recognition<00:00:53.899> how<00:00:54.899> about

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it comes time to pay just lay down your

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.340 
it comes time to pay just lay down your
credit<00:01:05.549> card<00:01:05.820> divvy<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> bill<00:01:06.570> add<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.260> the

tip and leave under the screen our

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
tip and leave under the screen our
cameras<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.280> actually<00:01:11.430> see<00:01:11.939> what

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
cameras that can actually see what

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580 
cameras that can actually see what
you're<00:01:12.330> touching<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> computer

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you're touching and then the computer

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.340 
you're touching and then the computer
reacts<00:01:13.950> creating<00:01:14.640> an<00:01:14.729> image<00:01:15.140> there<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> go

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
reacts creating an image there you go

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.530 
reacts creating an image there you go
and<00:01:16.979> again<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.820> put<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.030> down<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and again we just put it down here and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.020 
and again we just put it down here and
it<00:01:19.020> spills<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.380> photos<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> prompt<00:01:20.759> see

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it spills out photos not a prompt see

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.999 
it spills out photos not a prompt see
it's<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.630> they're<00:01:21.810> magically<00:01:22.380> drawn<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.860> of

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
it's like they're magically drawn out of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.910 
it's like they're magically drawn out of
your<00:01:23.130> digital<00:01:23.549> camera<00:01:23.610> into<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> box

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
your digital camera into the box

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.350 
your digital camera into the box
wirelessly<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.159> course<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.759> now<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.180> grab

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
wirelessly of course so now you can grab

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990 
wirelessly of course so now you can grab
photos<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.229> grab<00:01:28.439> photos<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.220> bit

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
photos and I grab photos and we can bit

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.390 
photos and I grab photos and we can bit
bigger<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:30.630> smaller<00:01:31.079> white<00:01:31.650> table<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.250> this

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
bigger or smaller white table in this

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.460 
bigger or smaller white table in this
case<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.329> case<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.290> we've

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
case in this case it is and so we've

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.080 
case in this case it is and so we've
used<00:01:34.710> those<00:01:35.009> different<00:01:35.369> attributes<00:01:35.880> of

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
used those different attributes of

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420 
used those different attributes of
surface<00:01:36.509> computing<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.799> application<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
surface computing in this application to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.950 
surface computing in this application to
create<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> totally<00:01:39.329> different<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:39.930> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
create a totally different kind of
