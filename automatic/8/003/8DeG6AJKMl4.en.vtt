00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
definitely won't be a problem and it

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.430 
definitely won't be a problem and it
does<00:02:31.890> provide<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.370> nice<00:02:32.610> sound<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.290> see

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
does provide a nice sound you can see

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.700 
does provide a nice sound you can see
and<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.520> bottom<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.630> separate<00:02:37.290> cut

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
and on the bottom we have a separate cut

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.430 
and on the bottom we have a separate cut
out<00:02:37.830> for<00:02:38.070> each<00:02:38.220> port<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.900> they<00:02:39.900> all<00:02:40.020> look<00:02:40.230> good

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
out for each port and they all look good

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.670 
out for each port and they all look good
and<00:02:41.220> I'll<00:02:42.000> plug<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:42.930> phone<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.530> make

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
and I'll plug in that your phone to make

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.200 
and I'll plug in that your phone to make
sure<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:43.920> works<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:46.530> does<00:02:46.740> fit<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.130> but<00:02:47.940> just

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
sure it works that does fit in but just

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.620 
sure it works that does fit in but just
barely<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.960> any<00:02:49.230> other<00:02:50.060> headphones<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.360> have

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
barely so any other headphones you have

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.350 
barely so any other headphones you have
they<00:02:52.290> if<00:02:52.530> they're<00:02:52.920> bigger<00:02:53.340> oversize<00:02:54.090> they

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
they if they're bigger oversize they

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.780 
they if they're bigger oversize they
likely<00:02:54.720> won't<00:02:54.960> fit<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.500> case<00:02:55.710> but<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
likely won't fit in this case but the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.550 
likely won't fit in this case but the
standard<00:02:57.150> ones<00:02:57.360> which<00:02:57.720> are<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.930> ones<00:02:58.050> I<00:02:58.260> use

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
standard ones which are the ones I use

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.000
