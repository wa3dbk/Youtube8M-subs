go with the six I just figured this was
the<00:05:03.620> one<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.800> figured<00:05:04.040> to<00:05:04.100> be<00:05:04.130> smoother<00:05:04.580> it's

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
the one I figured to be smoother it's

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.130 
the one I figured to be smoother it's
got<00:05:04.850> extra<00:05:05.120> sugars<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:05.600> I<00:05:05.660> stuff<00:05:05.930> like<00:05:06.110> that

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140

kind<00:05:06.830> of<00:05:06.890> you<00:05:07.040> know<00:05:07.190> it's<00:05:07.610> funny<00:05:07.730> I<00:05:08.060> kind<00:05:08.300> of

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
kind of you know it's funny I kind of

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.050 
kind of you know it's funny I kind of
thought<00:05:08.630> that<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:09.110> do<00:05:09.830> reversal<00:05:10.430> hopefully<00:05:10.820> of

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
thought that to do reversal hopefully of

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.969 
thought that to do reversal hopefully of
what<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.270> expected<00:05:11.840> but<00:05:13.240> what<00:05:14.240> can<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:14.479> do
