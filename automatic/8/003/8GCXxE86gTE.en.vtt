00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.310
 and to control 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.230
 the different algae the club friends the 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.520
 voice control 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.490
 and the different printers 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.500
 in the upper part of the dashboard we have 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.560
 a small gap of these aerators 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.540
 that you can regulate this is weird that 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.829
 exist are up and you can 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.609
 regular 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.609
 and also 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.340
 the radio system pretty basic but 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.890
 well done and then also this 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.720
 finished as in cash although good is 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.080
 plastic but the feeling is good not 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.080
 it's bad 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.270
 i 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.010
 the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.720
 on the dashboard here we have the lights 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:25.430
 front fog lights fog lights 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.110
 backs to remove the start &amp; stop or 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.140
 leave it on for closure 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.140
 centralized 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.460
 and so that the auto lights do not activate 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.690
 adaptive 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.970
 double air conditioning control for 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.210
 the left to the right 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.850
 here is for the different parameters to 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.570
 tell the truth 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.180
 It's a little mean is simple 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.040
 use but the pictograms are not 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.170
 too good 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.170
 the gearbox very well located 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.840
 to 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.880
 the space that we have is not much 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:30.580
 longitudinally it is fine although the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.650
 Half-ass belt is 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.690
 too much this part of the belt 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.690
 that comes to hurt is uncomfortable 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.110
 we have to put the boats here 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.270
 can you pull yourself out 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.860
 here it communicates with the trunk we have 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.810
 aeration outlet and space 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.160
 leg space length yes 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.270
 that is fine they have height in a 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.250
 height is missing 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.250
 lack lack a little 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.629
 the loading mouth is too high 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.549
 although this is so that the chassis is 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.859
 stiff but good height is 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.859
 considerable for hanging bags 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.409
 the spare wheel of alfa giulietta 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.409
 It's cookie type
