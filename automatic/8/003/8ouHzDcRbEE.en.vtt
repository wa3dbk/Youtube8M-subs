00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.540
 hello everyone with you free bro and today I 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.370
 I will introduce you with a series of mod with 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.780
 whom you can liven up your boats 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.090
 however strange it may sound 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.439
 and let's get down to fashion right now 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.050
 let's say you built this 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.850
 typical and very beautiful boat but we 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.619
 you can not swim on it at all 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.720
 that is, it is unreal that is 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.000
 just blocks that are on the water 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.219
 it's just impossible it's unthinkable but 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.750
 This mod will prove to you otherwise. 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.489
 adds four things and using 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 which you can revive this one 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.120
 the subject in this case is the boat that is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.770
 let me tell you more in detail what 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.940
 what are these items and how are they crafted 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.980
 first subject 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.930
 this is a spike maker that is to say this is a helm 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.450
 the base of our boat is crafting it like this 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.870
 that is, we put it in the stern well, that is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.420
 to the very center where we can 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.489
 control our boat that is this 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.530
 this subject he is responsible for 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.660
 the maneuverability of our ship we need 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.359
 him too somewhere to attach this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.979
 trillion is an air tank i mean he 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.290
 now it doesn't matter 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.970
 need for availability in this item and there 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.340
 Navigator itself, that is, it will be 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.500
 displayed speeds and easier that is it 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 pretty necessary that is, we set 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.080
 here is the subject that is responsible for 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.799
 navigation go to our boat set here 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.119
 here the wheel and we are on the wheel 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.070
 should put this navigator but 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.630
 there is a small refinement that is 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.640
 we just can not put on it 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.650
 so how do we start to manage and need 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.900
 put here about the block let's say on 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.790
 glass you put it here it is all 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.890
 quite comfortable and let's try 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.530
 ride on 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.690
 our boat, right-click and 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.190
 as we see the fact that our boat comes to life 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.040
 that is, we can really 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.450
 swim true steering wheel 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.520
 feeling so refined ie we 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.500
 just sit in it attack actually 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.450
 the boat can accelerate quite fast 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.930
 and we can swim on it and so are we 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.759
 we can 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.540
 drown out the engine of our beautiful 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.369
 boats and just exit when you press right 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.050
 click and so stop 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.600
 we can dock 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.280
 go out and meet your friends afterwards 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.619
 You can also ride with them. 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.540
 beautiful boat thank you all for 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.670
