00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.170
 hello car online readers 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.790
 today we are here on the trw lane 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.639
 in limeira in sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.530
 you will check how the 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.530
 vehicle performance tests 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.410
 the first procedure when it arrives at the 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.119
 test track is to check the 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.040
 Relative humidity air temperature 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.540
 the air that we take note of and 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.540
 then instrumental vehicle 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.240
 to enter the track the first test that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.220
 is made of noise at speeds of 50 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.220
 80 120 and neutral 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.590
 the second test to be done is to 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.950
 acceleration are made four passes 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.270
 from zero until the vehicle reaches the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.270
 until the end of the runway 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:24.300
 the third test are made to the resumes 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:28.860
 resumption of 40 to 100 per hour of 60 120 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.710
 and 80 to 120 per hour 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.530
 cut the braking test 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.439
 the maximum speed that the car reaches 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.829
 it is braked to 0 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.960
 10 pinion of fatigue are placed 200 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.979
 kilos of ballast in the trunk of the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.979
 vehicle and the car is subjected to 10 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.020
 consecutive braking of 100 to zero 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.840
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.590
 the sixth last test is made the gauging 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.590
 of the speedometer compared to vitx xxi 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.069
 when all dynamic tests are 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.630
 finished on the track 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.180
 we do not do the cycle consumption 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.860
 urban road transport comparing both the 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.190
 average of the on-board computer and the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.190
 tank to tank
