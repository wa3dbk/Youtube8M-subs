00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
against one tank into range so what I'm

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.300 
against one tank into range so what I'm
going<00:01:48.049> to<00:01:48.110> trying<00:01:48.320> to<00:01:48.470> do<00:01:48.590> his<00:01:48.770> control<00:01:49.189> the

tank with funders striking crude strike
which<00:01:51.290> knocks<00:01:51.500> him<00:01:51.650> away<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.100> also<00:01:52.610> try<00:01:52.880> and

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
which knocks him away and also try and

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.820 
which knocks him away and also try and
use<00:01:53.150> spin<00:01:53.450> strike<00:01:53.720> on<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.020> range<00:01:54.259> classes

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
use spin strike on the range classes

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.929 
use spin strike on the range classes
which<00:01:55.009> will<00:01:55.130> reflect<00:01:55.280> their<00:01:55.640> incoming

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
which will reflect their incoming

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.080 
which will reflect their incoming

so right now I'm trying to attack the
range<00:02:00.770> classes<00:02:01.189> and<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.460> have<00:02:01.640> been<00:02:01.820> knocking

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
range classes and I have been knocking

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.240 
range classes and I have been knocking
where<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.420> tank<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:02.900> see<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.530> ignitor<00:02:03.799> lining

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
where the tank I see the ignitor lining

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.039 
where the tank I see the ignitor lining
up<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.430> firestorm<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:05.180> go<00:02:05.360> point<00:02:05.630> blank<00:02:05.869> range

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
up a firestorm so I go point blank range

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.780 
up a firestorm so I go point blank range
into<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.409> spin<00:02:06.770> strike<00:02:07.040> which<00:02:07.280> reflects<00:02:07.670> is

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
into the spin strike which reflects is

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.249 
into the spin strike which reflects is
this<00:02:07.909> firestorm<00:02:08.149> accountant

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
this firestorm accountant

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.050 
this firestorm accountant
feeling<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.679> lot<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.890> damage<00:02:10.129> helps<00:02:10.700> me<00:02:10.789> get<00:02:10.909> the
