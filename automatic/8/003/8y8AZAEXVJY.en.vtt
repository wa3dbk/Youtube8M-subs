know this stuff is basic so as intended
to<00:01:11.950> that<00:01:12.070> basically<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.550> reason<00:01:12.789> why

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
effectively I didn't work against the

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.710 
effectively I didn't work against the
likes<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.820> fire<00:01:16.000> blossom<00:01:16.300> and<00:01:16.420> Rescue

Rabbit<00:01:16.840> specifically<00:01:17.740> was<00:01:18.280> because<00:01:18.580> both<00:01:19.119> of

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
Rabbit specifically was because both of

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.600 
Rabbit specifically was because both of
those<00:01:19.450> cards<00:01:19.840> are<00:01:19.990> off<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.380> field<00:01:20.619> and<00:01:20.890> they

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
those cards are off the field and they

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.460 
those cards are off the field and they
banish<00:01:21.910> such<00:01:22.270> tribute<00:01:22.630> themselves<00:01:22.990> as<00:01:23.080> their

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
banish such tribute themselves as their

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.230 
banish such tribute themselves as their
own<00:01:23.619> costs<00:01:24.190> to<00:01:24.490> activate<00:01:24.820> ohms<00:01:24.940> all<00:01:25.090> bare

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
own costs to activate ohms all bare

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.630 
own costs to activate ohms all bare
facts<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.920> they're<00:01:27.070> no<00:01:27.190> longer<00:01:27.340> on<00:01:27.550> the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
facts and so they're no longer on the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.249 
facts and so they're no longer on the
field<00:01:27.850> when<00:01:28.149> affect<00:01:28.420> their<00:01:28.570> results<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.229> that

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
field when affect their results and that

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.830 
field when affect their results and that
was<00:01:29.679> why<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:30.160> wasn't<00:01:30.940> some<00:01:31.210> kind<00:01:31.360> of<00:01:31.450> magical

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
was why it wasn't some kind of magical

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.240 
was why it wasn't some kind of magical
thing<00:01:32.020> like<00:01:32.229> they<00:01:32.380> are<00:01:32.470> speed<00:01:32.800> them<00:01:32.950> Randy

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
thing like they are speed them Randy

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.679 
thing like they are speed them Randy
don't<00:01:33.490> actually<00:01:33.759> I've<00:01:33.880> speeding<00:01:34.420> them<00:01:34.540> they

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
don't actually I've speeding them they

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.330 
don't actually I've speeding them they
just<00:01:34.869> get<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.470> activate<00:01:35.740> their<00:01:35.860> effect<00:01:36.100> first

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
just get to activate their effect first

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.630 
just get to activate their effect first
and<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:37.000> chain-link<00:01:37.240> dissipates

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.030 

okay<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.870> who<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.260> list<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.620> for<00:01:43.800> me<00:01:43.860> right

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
okay so who can list all for me right

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800 
okay so who can list all for me right
now<00:01:44.070> what<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:44.790> starts<00:01:45.030> chain<00:01:45.270> most

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
now what actually starts chain most

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.360 
now what actually starts chain most
people<00:01:46.140> would<00:01:46.290> go<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.740> stupid<00:01:47.100> things<00:01:47.250> like

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
people would go with stupid things like

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.250 
people would go with stupid things like
say<00:01:47.670> oh<00:01:47.850> somebody<00:01:48.390> wants<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.780> start<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.080> change

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
say oh somebody wants to start to change

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.680 
say oh somebody wants to start to change
no<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.620> doesn't<00:01:50.150> basically<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.420> only<00:01:51.510> thing

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
no it doesn't basically the only thing

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.149 
no it doesn't basically the only thing
that<00:01:51.780> starts<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.050> chain<00:01:52.080> is<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> activation<00:01:52.920> of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

response to the rabbit at next point is

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.790 
response to the rabbit at next point is
that<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.780> player<00:02:21.959> who<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> turn<00:02:22.500> player

can respond at the end of each phase

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.300 
can respond at the end of each phase
that<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.140> terms<00:02:25.320> are<00:02:25.440> house<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.160> at<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.280> end

has the ability to activate the card and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.930 
has the ability to activate the card and

technically the opponent the terms are
supposed<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.239> ask<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.750> opponent<00:02:37.080> at<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.590> end

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
supposed to ask the opponent at the end

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.259 
supposed to ask the opponent at the end
of<00:02:37.769> each<00:02:37.980> phase<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:38.550> they<00:02:38.760> want<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:38.970> activate

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
of each phase if they want to activate

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.000 
of each phase if they want to activate
card<00:02:39.510> although<00:02:40.140> that's<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.380> bit<00:02:40.530> silly<00:02:40.739> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
card although that's a bit silly and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.740 
card although that's a bit silly and
it's<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.640> bit<00:02:41.730> impractical<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.390> takes<00:02:42.570> up<00:02:42.630> too

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
it's a bit impractical and takes up too

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.199 
it's a bit impractical and takes up too
much<00:02:42.780> time<00:02:42.989> but<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.400> fact<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.730> some

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
much time but that is the fact that some

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.150 
much time but that is the fact that some
people<00:02:45.420> actually<00:02:45.570> don't<00:02:46.019> know<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.010> sort

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
people actually don't know that is sort

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.560 
people actually don't know that is sort
of<00:02:47.190> skipped<00:02:47.459> right<00:02:47.549> in<00:02:47.760> their<00:02:47.880> main<00:02:48.180> phase<00:02:48.390> to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
of skipped right in their main phase to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.940 
of skipped right in their main phase to
the<00:02:48.600> battle<00:02:48.870> phase<00:02:48.989> or<00:02:49.230> whatever<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.560> forget

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the battle phase or whatever I forget

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.039 
the battle phase or whatever I forget
about<00:02:50.070> it

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.850 

so<00:02:54.049> you've<00:02:54.319> been<00:02:54.409> talking<00:02:54.590> about<00:02:54.650> how

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
so you've been talking about how

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.289 
so you've been talking about how
priority<00:02:55.280> has<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> left<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.879> game<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.060> a

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
priority has a left the game in a

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.449 
priority has a left the game in a
certain<00:02:56.450> sense<00:02:56.720> but<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.379> has<00:02:57.500> also<00:02:57.680> stayed<00:02:58.220> the

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
certain sense but it has also stayed the

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.610 
certain sense but it has also stayed the
same<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.970> a<00:02:59.180> little<00:02:59.390> sense<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.959> that<00:03:00.409> is

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
same in a little sense and that is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.319 
same in a little sense and that is
specifically<00:03:01.189> in<00:03:01.400> relation<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:02.000> what<00:03:02.239> is

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
specifically in relation to what is

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.420 
specifically in relation to what is
called<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.720> open<00:03:03.079> game<00:03:03.349> state<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.220> at

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
called the open game state that is at

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.280 
called the open game state that is at
the<00:03:04.519> beginning<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.909> each<00:03:05.120> phase<00:03:05.510> after<00:03:05.840> all

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
the beginning of each phase after all

the beginning of each phase after all
chainable<00:03:06.860> events<00:03:07.189> have<00:03:07.340> resolved<00:03:07.640> in<00:03:07.909> a

chainable events have resolved in a
previous<00:03:08.120> phase<00:03:08.450> at<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.470> game<00:03:09.650> stage<00:03:10.190> is

previous phase at the game stage is

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.580 
previous phase at the game stage is
essentially<00:03:10.819> open<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:11.900> what<00:03:12.019> this<00:03:12.140> means<00:03:12.379> is

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
essentially open and what this means is

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.610 
essentially open and what this means is
that<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:13.220> term<00:03:13.430> player<00:03:13.640> in<00:03:13.849> a<00:03:14.180> fact<00:03:14.599> does<00:03:15.290> have

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
that the term player in a fact does have

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
what is can be turned priority to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.899 
what is can be turned priority to
activate<00:03:18.620> effects<00:03:18.980> before<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.400> opponent<00:03:19.790> can

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
activate effects before the opponent can

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.599 
activate effects before the opponent can
respond<00:03:20.239> because<00:03:21.109> certain<00:03:21.920> cards<00:03:22.129> cannot<00:03:22.489> be

activated at the beginning of Phase but
only<00:03:24.680> at<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.890> end<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.250> phase<00:03:26.019> okay<00:03:27.019> so

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
only at the end of phase okay so

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.630 
only at the end of phase okay so

your<00:03:32.900> opponent<00:03:33.139> sets<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.319> bunch<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.500> back<00:03:33.650> row

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
your opponent sets a bunch of back row

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.740 
your opponent sets a bunch of back row
and<00:03:33.950> ends<00:03:34.040> his<00:03:34.129> turn<00:03:34.280> that's<00:03:34.579> fine<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:34.970> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
and ends his turn that's fine and the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.839 
and ends his turn that's fine and the
next<00:03:35.780> turn<00:03:36.230> because<00:03:36.920> he<00:03:37.010> hasn't<00:03:37.220> enormous<00:03:37.700> sum

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
next turn because he hasn't enormous sum

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:38.949 
next turn because he hasn't enormous sum
of<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.000> rescue<00:03:38.239> rabbit<00:03:38.389> at<00:03:38.599> the<00:03:38.659> beginning<00:03:38.900> of

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
of the rescue rabbit at the beginning of

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.720 
of the rescue rabbit at the beginning of
main<00:03:39.139> phase<00:03:39.349> one<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.920> term<00:03:40.129> player<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.549> in<00:03:40.639> an

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
main phase one the term player is in an

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.759 
main phase one the term player is in an
open<00:03:41.030> game<00:03:41.239> state<00:03:41.480> there<00:03:41.810> was<00:03:41.900> no<00:03:41.959> chain<00:03:42.650> of

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
open game state there was no chain of

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.470 
open game state there was no chain of

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
events currently being resolved and so

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.240 
events currently being resolved and so
the<00:03:44.599> player<00:03:44.780> technically<00:03:45.319> speaking<00:03:45.409> has<00:03:46.040> i

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
the player technically speaking has i

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.920 
the player technically speaking has i
suppose<00:03:46.609> what<00:03:46.639> you<00:03:46.879> could<00:03:47.060> call<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.329> priority

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
suppose what you could call a priority

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.210 
suppose what you could call a priority
aren't<00:03:48.379> doing<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.590> resolve<00:03:48.859> the<00:03:49.010> rabbits

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
aren't doing a resolve the rabbits

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.699 
aren't doing a resolve the rabbits
effect<00:03:49.459> for<00:03:49.940> any<00:03:50.299> kind<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.629> response<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:51.440> only

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
effect for any kind of response the only

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.229 
effect for any kind of response the only
difference<00:03:51.889> being<00:03:52.129> with<00:03:52.430> quick<00:03:52.579> events<00:03:52.879> for

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
difference being with quick events for

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.149 
difference being with quick events for
example<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.840> opponent<00:03:54.200> cones<00:03:54.769> drop<00:03:54.980> effect

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
example the opponent cones drop effect

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.979 
example the opponent cones drop effect
by<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.370> amount<00:03:55.670> but<00:03:56.120> he<00:03:56.180> could<00:03:56.389> drop<00:03:56.569> maxi

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
by the amount but he could drop maxi

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.599 
by the amount but he could drop maxi
because<00:03:57.349> Maxie<00:03:57.709> it<00:03:57.949> can<00:03:58.160> be<00:03:58.250> dropped<00:03:58.370> in

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
because Maxie it can be dropped in

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.909 
because Maxie it can be dropped in
anticipation<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.449> such<00:03:59.989> an<00:04:00.079> event<00:04:00.169> in<00:04:00.440> any

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
anticipation of such an event in any

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:02.860 
anticipation of such an event in any
phase<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:01.730> if<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.849> can<00:04:02.000> drop<00:04:02.090> it<00:04:02.239> in<00:04:02.389> a<00:04:02.419> snap<00:04:02.690> at

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
phase so if you can drop it in a snap at

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.539 
phase so if you can drop it in a snap at
the<00:04:02.989> end<00:04:03.169> of<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.470> standby<00:04:03.799> phase<00:04:03.980> for<00:04:04.190> example

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
the end of the standby phase for example

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:05.979 
the end of the standby phase for example
before<00:04:04.669> the<00:04:04.910> main<00:04:05.060> phase<00:04:05.239> begins<00:04:05.480> which

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
before the main phase begins which

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.449 
before the main phase begins which
include<00:04:06.230> top<00:04:06.440> effect<00:04:06.709> better<00:04:06.919> at<00:04:07.069> that<00:04:07.190> point

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
include top effect better at that point

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.740 
include top effect better at that point
because<00:04:07.609> effect<00:04:07.940> veiler<00:04:08.090> kind<00:04:08.419> of<00:04:08.480> holy<00:04:08.599> he

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
because effect veiler kind of holy he

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.110 
because effect veiler kind of holy he
dropped<00:04:08.959> during<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.919> main<00:04:10.069> phase<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.970> at<00:04:11.060> the

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
dropped during the main phase and at the

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.939 
dropped during the main phase and at the
beginning<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.540> that<00:04:11.629> main<00:04:11.780> phase<00:04:12.049> there<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:12.859> an

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:12.949 
beginning of that main phase there is an

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.280 
beginning of that main phase there is an
open<00:04:13.190> game<00:04:13.459> stage<00:04:13.699> so<00:04:14.180> you<00:04:14.269> cannot<00:04:14.629> start<00:04:15.109> a

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
open game stage so you cannot start a

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.170 
open game stage so you cannot start a
changeable<00:04:15.590> event<00:04:15.889> the<00:04:16.280> only<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.000> turn

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
changeable event the only the turn

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.789 
changeable event the only the turn
player<00:04:17.389> can<00:04:17.870> basically<00:04:20.289> so<00:04:21.289> the<00:04:21.530> point<00:04:21.650> to

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
player can basically so the point to

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.080 
player can basically so the point to
note<00:04:21.979> is<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.220> at<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.550> beginning<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.910> each

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
note is that at the beginning of each

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.700 
note is that at the beginning of each
phase<00:04:23.389> return<00:04:23.720> not<00:04:23.990> just<00:04:24.139> main<00:04:24.320> phase<00:04:24.530> but

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
phase return not just main phase but

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.200 
phase return not just main phase but
every<00:04:24.919> face<00:04:25.099> there<00:04:25.580> is<00:04:25.729> what<00:04:25.880> is<00:04:25.910> called<00:04:26.000> an

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
every face there is what is called an

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.610 
every face there is what is called an
open<00:04:26.389> game<00:04:26.539> straight<00:04:26.780> when<00:04:27.050> no<00:04:27.199> chain<00:04:27.500> these

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
open game straight when no chain these

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.990 
open game straight when no chain these
are<00:04:27.860> anything<00:04:28.250> like<00:04:28.400> that<00:04:28.460> are<00:04:28.729> currently

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
are anything like that are currently

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.879 
are anything like that are currently
being<00:04:29.150> resolved<00:04:29.389> basically<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.169> means<00:04:30.289> that

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
being resolved basically that means that

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.500 
being resolved basically that means that
if<00:04:31.099> somebody<00:04:31.400> does<00:04:31.639> something<00:04:31.789> like<00:04:32.030> drops<00:04:32.419> an

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
if somebody does something like drops an

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.700 
if somebody does something like drops an
effect<00:04:32.750> there<00:04:32.900> at<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.110> beginning<00:04:33.169> of<00:04:33.500> your

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
effect there at the beginning of your

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.649 
effect there at the beginning of your
main<00:04:33.919> phase<00:04:34.099> you<00:04:34.580> will<00:04:34.610> set<00:04:34.970> you<00:04:35.120> simply<00:04:35.539> say

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659 
main phase you will set you simply say

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.870 
main phase you will set you simply say
to<00:04:35.720> them<00:04:35.930> in<00:04:36.110> response<00:04:36.289> to<00:04:36.770> what<00:04:37.039> it's<00:04:37.520> an<00:04:37.639> open

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
to them in response to what it's an open

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.279 
to them in response to what it's an open
game<00:04:38.060> stage<00:04:38.300> there's<00:04:38.539> nothing<00:04:38.870> there's<00:04:39.199> no

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
game stage there's nothing there's no

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.300 
game stage there's nothing there's no
chain<00:04:39.560> links<00:04:39.830> there's<00:04:40.010> something<00:04:40.220> may

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
chain links there's something may

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.040 
chain links there's something may
resolve<00:04:40.580> nothing<00:04:40.880> is<00:04:40.970> going<00:04:41.120> on<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.720> can't

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
resolve nothing is going on you can't

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.950 
resolve nothing is going on you can't
just<00:04:42.320> drop<00:04:42.470> Vader<00:04:42.710> out<00:04:42.979> of<00:04:43.099> nothing

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.969 

well<00:04:46.960> I'm<00:04:47.110> sure<00:04:47.229> you've<00:04:47.379> all<00:04:47.469> pretty<00:04:47.680> much<00:04:47.710> got

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
well I'm sure you've all pretty much got

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.610 
well I'm sure you've all pretty much got
it<00:04:48.009> at<00:04:48.249> this<00:04:48.370> stage<00:04:48.430> but<00:04:48.819> basically<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:50.080> brass

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
it at this stage but basically the brass

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.279 
it at this stage but basically the brass
tacks<00:04:50.949> of<00:04:51.189> the<00:04:51.279> matter<00:04:51.430> is<00:04:51.669> that<00:04:51.699> and

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
tacks of the matter is that and

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.779 
tacks of the matter is that and
everything<00:04:53.289> has<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.860> be<00:04:53.889> response<00:04:54.460> to

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
everything has to be response to

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.010 
everything has to be response to
everything<00:04:54.969> else<00:04:55.210> at<00:04:55.449> the<00:04:55.569> beginning<00:04:55.839> of<00:04:55.900> each

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
everything else at the beginning of each

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.570 
everything else at the beginning of each
phase<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.439> term<00:04:56.620> player<00:04:56.800> always<00:04:57.039> has<00:04:57.339> I

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
phase the term player always has I

resolves in the typical fashion everyone
seems<00:05:14.949> to<00:05:15.039> know<00:05:15.129> this<00:05:15.430> fact<00:05:15.699> that<00:05:15.939> chain<00:05:16.150> leads

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
seems to know this fact that chain leads

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.670 
seems to know this fact that chain leads
resolved<00:05:16.629> backwards<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:17.199> all<00:05:17.259> that<00:05:17.409> stuff

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
resolved backwards and all that stuff

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.799 
resolved backwards and all that stuff
but<00:05:18.279> a<00:05:18.430> chain<00:05:18.669> has<00:05:18.879> to<00:05:19.029> start<00:05:19.270> first<00:05:19.569> and

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:19.809 
but a chain has to start first and

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:21.719 
but a chain has to start first and
people<00:05:20.289> need<00:05:20.379> to<00:05:20.499> know<00:05:20.649> what<00:05:21.099> starts<00:05:21.639> a<00:05:21.699> chain

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
people need to know what starts a chain

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.760 
people need to know what starts a chain
the<00:05:22.419> summoning<00:05:22.749> of<00:05:22.779> a<00:05:22.870> monster<00:05:23.229> doesn't<00:05:23.499> start

doesn't start a chain as I said in my
previous<00:05:28.029> section<00:05:28.449> it's<00:05:28.629> activations<00:05:29.409> that

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
start chains but what does happen is

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.200 
start chains but what does happen is
that<00:05:32.559> when<00:05:32.860> a<00:05:32.889> monster<00:05:33.309> is<00:05:33.339> summoned<00:05:33.639> the<00:05:34.029> game

that when a monster is summoned the game

that when a monster is summoned the game
state<00:05:34.479> becomes<00:05:34.930> closed<00:05:35.379> and<00:05:35.770> it<00:05:36.399> doesn't

leave any options open for your pownage
to<00:05:38.860> respond<00:05:39.219> but<00:05:39.849> what<00:05:40.629> people<00:05:40.779> mix<00:05:41.469> up<00:05:41.710> is

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
to respond but what people mix up is

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.379 
to respond but what people mix up is
that<00:05:42.129> when<00:05:42.460> someone<00:05:42.729> drops<00:05:42.849> a<00:05:42.999> bather<00:05:43.180> and

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
that when someone drops a bather and

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:44.519 
that when someone drops a bather and
Rescue<00:05:43.689> Rabbit<00:05:43.779> they<00:05:44.020> think<00:05:44.229> that<00:05:44.409> the

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:44.529 
Rescue Rabbit they think that the

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.529 
Rescue Rabbit they think that the
barrier<00:05:44.830> is<00:05:45.009> directly<00:05:45.669> responding<00:05:46.300> to<00:05:46.449> the

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
barrier is directly responding to the

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.860 
barrier is directly responding to the
rabbit<00:05:46.809> sump<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.370> it's<00:05:48.370> not<00:05:48.580> it's<00:05:49.300> responding

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
rabbit sump and it's not it's responding

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.809 
rabbit sump and it's not it's responding
because<00:05:50.529> quick<00:05:50.949> effects<00:05:51.279> can<00:05:51.430> be<00:05:51.459> activated

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
because quick effects can be activated

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:58.140 
because quick effects can be activated
at<00:05:52.029> any<00:05:52.209> time<00:05:52.479> during<00:05:52.899> that<00:05:53.169> main<00:05:53.349> face

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.370 

so<00:05:59.150> perhaps<00:05:59.390> we<00:05:59.600> lot<00:05:59.720> of<00:05:59.780> people<00:05:59.930> this<00:06:00.020> didn't

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
so perhaps we lot of people this didn't

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.110 
so perhaps we lot of people this didn't
make<00:06:00.440> a<00:06:00.620> whole<00:06:00.800> lot<00:06:00.860> of<00:06:01.070> sense<00:06:01.280> but<00:06:01.820> I<00:06:01.880> was

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
make a whole lot of sense but I was

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.190 
make a whole lot of sense but I was
really<00:06:02.360> trying<00:06:02.450> to<00:06:02.570> put<00:06:02.720> across<00:06:02.780> the<00:06:02.960> point

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
really trying to put across the point

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.140 
really trying to put across the point
that<00:06:03.770> there<00:06:04.040> is<00:06:04.190> a<00:06:04.220> certain<00:06:04.670> stay<00:06:04.820> in<00:06:04.970> the<00:06:05.030> game

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
that there is a certain stay in the game

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.580 
that there is a certain stay in the game

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.230 
known as the open game safe that a lot
of<00:06:06.620> people<00:06:06.680> don't<00:06:07.040> seem<00:06:07.280> to<00:06:07.310> know<00:06:07.700> about<00:06:07.820> and

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
of people don't seem to know about and

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.310 
of people don't seem to know about and
they<00:06:08.450> seem<00:06:08.630> to<00:06:08.660> think<00:06:08.780> that<00:06:09.170> they<00:06:09.260> can

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
they seem to think that they can

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
keep an eye out for stuff like that

check out for yourself but basically a
lot<00:06:47.450> of<00:06:47.540> people<00:06:47.660> aren't<00:06:47.930> aware<00:06:48.020> of<00:06:48.200> these

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
lot of people aren't aware of these

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.310 
lot of people aren't aware of these
things<00:06:48.410> they<00:06:49.220> learn<00:06:49.490> a<00:06:49.520> basic<00:06:50.320> representation

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
things they learn a basic representation

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.440 
things they learn a basic representation
of<00:06:51.440> the<00:06:51.530> rills<00:06:51.770> which<00:06:52.340> does<00:06:52.520> not<00:06:52.670> include<00:06:52.850> at

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
of the rills which does not include at

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.480 
of the rills which does not include at
terms<00:06:53.900> such<00:06:54.080> as<00:06:54.350> ignition<00:06:54.950> trigger

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
terms such as ignition trigger

terms such as ignition trigger
continuous<00:06:56.150> types<00:06:56.420> effects<00:06:56.840> and<00:06:56.990> also<00:06:57.800> things

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
continuous types effects and also things

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.070 
continuous types effects and also things
like<00:06:58.070> chain<00:06:58.430> ability<00:06:58.790> open<00:06:59.420> game<00:06:59.600> states<00:06:59.870> and

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
like chain ability open game states and

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.350 
like chain ability open game states and
so<00:07:00.410> forth<00:07:00.680> they<00:07:01.250> will<00:07:01.430> learn<00:07:01.580> rudimentary<00:07:02.270> a

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
so forth they will learn rudimentary a

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.330 
so forth they will learn rudimentary a
basic<00:07:02.840> form<00:07:03.080> of<00:07:03.140> those<00:07:03.320> things<00:07:03.500> and<00:07:03.830> they<00:07:04.190> will

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
basic form of those things and they will

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.950 
basic form of those things and they will
basically<00:07:04.520> miss<00:07:04.790> out<00:07:04.970> on<00:07:05.120> things<00:07:05.300> which<00:07:05.540> could

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
basically miss out on things which could

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.540 
basically miss out on things which could
potentially<00:07:06.080> gain<00:07:06.620> them<00:07:06.800> some<00:07:06.950> advantage<00:07:07.340> in

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
potentially gain them some advantage in

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.330 
potentially gain them some advantage in
