00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Gasol marc and pau brothers were the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.330
 great protagonists upon their arrival at 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.929
 new york- scenario of a new 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.849
 2015 all-star edition of the nba el 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.610
 center of memphis grizzlies was with 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.740
 difference the most requested player its 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.170
 second participation in the party of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.630
 the stars will be even more special for 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.900
 he as the initial jump in the madison 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.949
 square garden will be a family duel 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.740
 well it was not an exciting time 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.349
 being an emotional moment where 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.930
 possibly because many emotions 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.910
 run for our our bodies 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.340
 there's nothing but it's going to be a 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.740
 moment like many jumps we do 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.720
 every match that my brother is going to be 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.430
 opposite and the stage is unique and 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.430
 unrepeatable is different 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.540
 As you play well and you see that 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.580
 the votes well then they start 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.030
 to do a little bit the illusion or the idea 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.469
 that it is possible 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.480
 so, well, you do not finish it either 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.620
 to believe until virtually the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.590
 great they know the name announced by 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.440
 television and is and is already confirmed 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.479
 official form so nothing until that 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.680
 moment we both do not congratulate each other 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.330
 mutually and 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.130
 so but it has been a nice process 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.550
 the season is going very well for 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.910
 both is something also exceptional and 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.910
 very happy 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.850
 although doing so we have followed 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.280
 and in what is change he understood that 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.210
 they are important because 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.100
 before sitting down to do what would be 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:46.450
 be prepared for the segment 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:48.850
 and little by little he is becoming more conscious 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.619
 since it is practically at the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.899
 around the corner so very 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.479
 I'm very happy to be in this 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.580
 situation now finally disconnected 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.399
 a little bit of the league of our routine 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.530
 daily and and willing to enjoy 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.820
 this special unforgettable weekend 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.820
 and as you say historical
