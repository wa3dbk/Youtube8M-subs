00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.179 
of weird I don't like it but whatever um
I<00:03:09.879> assume<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.629> crossbow<00:03:11.319> uses<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.980> same

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
I assume the crossbow uses the same

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.569 
I assume the crossbow uses the same
perks<00:03:12.519> as<00:03:12.790> arrows<00:03:13.269> because<00:03:14.079> I<00:03:14.650> alt<00:03:15.099> can<00:03:15.459> also

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
perks as arrows because I alt can also

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.550 
perks as arrows because I alt can also
swim<00:03:15.969> with<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.209> like<00:03:16.510> just<00:03:16.719> like<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:16.989> can<00:03:17.290> with<00:03:17.530> a

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
swim with it like just like I can with a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.420 
swim with it like just like I can with a
bow<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.519> arrow<00:03:18.730> when<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.299> got<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.659> perk<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:21.400> I

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
bow and arrow when I got the perk so I

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.479 
bow and arrow when I got the perk so I
think<00:03:21.579> that's<00:03:22.000> how<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.629> works<00:03:22.739> not<00:03:23.739> completely

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
think that's how it works not completely

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.690 
think that's how it works not completely
sure<00:03:24.519> but<00:03:25.290> there's<00:03:26.290> no<00:03:26.439> new<00:03:26.650> new<00:03:27.040> perks<00:03:27.370> or

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
sure but there's no new new perks or

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.119 
sure but there's no new new perks or
anything<00:03:28.450> for<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.870> it's<00:03:29.049> just<00:03:29.230> Audrey<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.980> I

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
anything for it it's just Audrey and I

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.099 
anything for it it's just Audrey and I
couldn't<00:03:30.879> really<00:03:30.969> see<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.239> new<00:03:31.450> perks<00:03:31.780> either

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
couldn't really see the new perks either

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.720 
couldn't really see the new perks either
the<00:03:34.500> vampire<00:03:35.500> werewolf<00:03:35.769> stuff<00:03:36.310> but<00:03:36.579> you<00:03:36.670> know

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
the vampire werewolf stuff but you know

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.020 
the vampire werewolf stuff but you know
I'll<00:03:36.939> sure<00:03:37.359> I'll<00:03:37.569> get<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.900> later<00:03:39.150> um<00:03:42.030> something

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
I'll sure I'll get it later um something

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.710 
I'll sure I'll get it later um something
else<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.299> can<00:03:43.450> do<00:03:44.129> kill<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:45.250> foul<00:03:45.430> more<00:03:45.669> I<00:03:45.939> shown

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
else I can do kill the foul more I shown

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.899 
else I can do kill the foul more I shown
I<00:03:46.930> can<00:03:47.079> use<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.409> crossbow<00:03:47.829> for<00:03:48.430> late<00:03:48.669> but

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
I can use the crossbow for late but

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.420 
I can use the crossbow for late but
whatever<00:03:49.349> there's<00:03:50.349> not<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.650> bandits<00:03:51.129> I<00:03:51.220> just

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
whatever there's not a bandits I just

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.149 
whatever there's not a bandits I just
killed<00:03:51.669> I<00:03:51.970> got<00:03:52.900> them<00:03:53.079> with<00:03:53.230> one<00:03:53.439> shot<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.980> the

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
killed I got them with one shot so the

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:02.460 
killed I got them with one shot so the
crossbar<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.150> pretty<00:03:58.359> powerful<00:04:01.470> didn't

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
crossbar is pretty powerful didn't

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.710 
crossbar is pretty powerful didn't
really<00:04:03.280> show<00:04:03.489> when<00:04:03.669> I<00:04:03.700> killed<00:04:04.000> Sal<00:04:04.269> Murr<00:04:04.480> but

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.839 
really show when I killed Sal Murr but
whatever<00:04:05.049> I<00:04:05.229> think<00:04:06.010> it's<00:04:06.129> a<00:04:06.190> cool<00:04:06.340> app<00:04:06.549> and<00:04:06.760> I

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849
