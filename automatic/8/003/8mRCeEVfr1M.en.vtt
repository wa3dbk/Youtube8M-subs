as well when we analyzed the scoring

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.380 
as well when we analyzed the scoring
criteria<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:45.400> looked<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:45.910> straight

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
criteria it looked like straight

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.940

so<00:02:57.970> if<00:02:58.030> someone<00:02:58.420> takes<00:02:58.599> home<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> wiki<00:02:59.170> speedcar

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
so if someone takes home a wiki speedcar

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.619 
so if someone takes home a wiki speedcar
they're<00:03:00.189> not<00:03:00.370> taking<00:03:00.700> home<00:03:00.849> a<00:03:00.879> gasoline<00:03:01.420> car

something that can be either one of
those<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.379> about<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.680> time<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.010> takes<00:03:06.099> to

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
those and about the time it takes to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
change a tire the car has eight pieces

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.280 
change a tire the car has eight pieces
and<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.760> disassembles<00:03:10.390> into<00:03:10.599> eight<00:03:10.689> pieces<00:03:10.870> we

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
and it disassembles into eight pieces we

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.020 
and it disassembles into eight pieces we
can<00:03:11.439> change<00:03:11.650> any<00:03:11.950> one<00:03:12.159> of<00:03:12.189> them<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.549> put<00:03:12.939> it

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
can change any one of them and put it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.789 
can change any one of them and put it
back<00:03:13.180> together<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.170> helps<00:03:14.440> us<00:03:14.590> make<00:03:14.769> a
