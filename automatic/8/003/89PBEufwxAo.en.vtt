00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.110
 increase in muscle mass 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.120
 tricks to increase muscle mass 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.820
 If your purpose is to improve your muscle mass, keep in mind the following 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.590
 points that are going to be the key to make your muscles grow 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.720
 the training sessions will be intense 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.920
 that is, once we pick up tone in a couple of weeks 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.569
 the exercises should fatigue the muscle enough to make it grow 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.710
 for this we will use three to eight series per exercise with eight or ten 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.960
 repetitions each so that the last repetition of the series we 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.170
 It's hard to do it but we can complete the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.590
 You have to know how to choose the training routine well 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.770
 you can not work all the muscles in a session nor should you 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.260
 focus one muscle per session 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.010
 the ideal is to divide the large muscle groups in three days and work each 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.510
 one in different sessions 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.860
 rest is fundamental 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.230
 At the beginning it is advisable to train one day and rest another 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.780
 When the body gets used to it they can introduce two days of 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.310
 training with one of rest 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.220
 not by much training the muscle will grow more since it needs your time 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.660
 of rest to grow 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.930
 food is essential 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.060
 make sure you get the right amount of protein and hydrates from 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.960
 carbon 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.420
 proteins to build muscle the leadership you carbon so you do not miss 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.160
 energy in training sessions 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.820
 vitamins and antioxidants should also be included in the diet to help 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.670
 build muscle more optimally and prevent us from western 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.290
 a good warm-up is important because it prepares the muscles for 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.689
 be 100% in training and avoid injury 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.650
 if there is an injury you could not train and therefore the muscle instead of growing 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.770
 will wane when not receiving stimuli 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.290
 read little by little 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.040
 if you finish a series of an exercise doing strange movements because you do not 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.040
 you can lift the weight, try to lower it a little 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.020
 better quality than quantity 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.539
 as the muscle grows it will ask you more and you will be able to gain weight 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.099
 do not forget the aerobic part 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.670
 to run to ride a bicycle or to do aerobic exercise 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:22.569
 increases the blood flow to the muscle it cleans it of debris and gives it new 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.289
 Energy sources 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:28.369
 you will also burn fat little by little and the muscle will become more noticeable 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.069
 patience and discipline 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.449
 these are the two key points 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.189
 the muscle will not grow in ten days 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.290
 but if we are disciplined with the training the rest and the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.900
 We will already notice changes in the first month and within a year or 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.870
 year and a half is when you will not make your muscles have really grown
