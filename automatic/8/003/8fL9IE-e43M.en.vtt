projectile<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.929> pretty<00:01:52.079> good<00:01:52.229> anti<00:01:52.530> air

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
projectile it's a pretty good anti air

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.739

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
version has a projectile which is really

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.429 
version has a projectile which is really
great<00:01:56.789> because<00:01:57.000> again<00:01:57.630> his<00:01:57.780> mobility<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.319> not

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
great because again his mobility is not

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.359 
great because again his mobility is not
to<00:01:58.590> go<00:01:58.709> great<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.069> when<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
to go great but when you have a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.580 
to go great but when you have a
projectile<00:01:59.849> you're<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:00.840> right<00:02:01.049> which

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
projectile you're in there right which

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.109 
projectile you're in there right which
is<00:02:01.709> really<00:02:01.859> great<00:02:02.069> for<00:02:02.130> him<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.609> that's

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
is really great for him to get in that's

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.459 
is really great for him to get in that's
only<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.359> expert<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.899> that's<00:02:04.020> predict<00:02:04.319> I'll

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
only the expert and that's predict I'll

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.010 
only the expert and that's predict I'll
by<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.679> way<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.990> theater<00:02:06.990> just

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
by the way it's not the theater just

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.190 
by the way it's not the theater just
regular<00:02:07.649> bird<00:02:07.799> looks<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.849> like<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.200> his

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
regular bird looks just like that his

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.990 
regular bird looks just like that his
other<00:02:10.289> movis<00:02:10.649> he<00:02:10.769> has<00:02:10.950> his<00:02:11.430> Devils<00:02:11.760> reverse

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
other movis he has his Devils reverse

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.850 
other movis he has his Devils reverse
which<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.299> back<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.140> do<00:02:13.260> down<00:02:13.560> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
which is back so if you just do down and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.069 
which is back so if you just do down and
then<00:02:14.129> up<00:02:14.340> kick<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:15.209> get<00:02:15.360> head<00:02:15.510> start<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.989> then

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
then up kick you get head start and then

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.270 
then up kick you get head start and then
you<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.319> punch<00:02:16.530> button<00:02:16.829> after<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.129> you<00:02:17.190> get

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
you get a punch button after and you get

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.830 
you get a punch button after and you get
to<00:02:17.340> follow<00:02:17.549> up<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:18.120> that's<00:02:18.239> have<00:02:18.420> some<00:02:18.629> pretty

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
to follow up so that's have some pretty

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.479 
to follow up so that's have some pretty
normal<00:02:19.049> right<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.799> can<00:02:19.920> also<00:02:20.040> turn<00:02:20.310> that

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
normal right but you can also turn that

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.160 
normal right but you can also turn that
into<00:02:20.700> Devils<00:02:21.060> reversed<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.840> if<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.019> get<00:02:22.110> a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
into Devils reversed so if you get a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.740 
into Devils reversed so if you get a
light<00:02:22.349> punch<00:02:22.590> you'll<00:02:23.129> stop<00:02:23.519> short<00:02:23.849> if<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.660> get

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
light punch you'll stop short if you get

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.300 
light punch you'll stop short if you get
medium<00:02:25.049> punch<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.379> go<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.530> little<00:02:25.680> farther<00:02:25.920> and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
medium punch you go a little farther and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.000 
medium punch you go a little farther and
if<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.879> hit<00:02:27.120> heavy<00:02:27.569> punch<00:02:27.870> go<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> farthest

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
if you hit heavy punch go the farthest

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.680 
if you hit heavy punch go the farthest
right<00:02:29.220> he'll<00:02:29.400> go<00:02:29.549> in<00:02:29.670> from<00:02:29.849> full<00:02:30.000> screen<00:02:30.239> so

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
right he'll go in from full screen so

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.000 
right he'll go in from full screen so
you<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:30.810> use<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.260> kind<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.530> change<00:02:31.769> up

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
you can use that to kind of change up

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.559 
you can use that to kind of change up
your<00:02:32.040> approach<00:02:32.519> pretty<00:02:32.790> much<00:02:32.970> right<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:33.480> you

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
your approach pretty much right so you

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.580 
your approach pretty much right so you
can<00:02:33.720> use<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.049> get<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.319> pretty<00:02:34.560> easily

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
can use that to get in pretty easily

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.740 
can use that to get in pretty easily
like<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.129> saw<00:02:35.430> there<00:02:35.609> that<00:02:35.790> was<00:02:35.879> pretty<00:02:36.060> pretty

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
like I saw there that was pretty pretty

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.660 
like I saw there that was pretty pretty
far<00:02:36.989> i'm<00:02:37.470> like<00:02:37.650> half<00:02:37.829> screen<00:02:38.069> with<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.280> hitbox

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
far i'm like half screen with the hitbox

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.920 
far i'm like half screen with the hitbox
on<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:38.970> which<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.180> really<00:02:39.209> good<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.629> Devils

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
on it which is really good as Devils

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.559 
on it which is really good as Devils
reverse<00:02:40.109> in<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.379> game<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.829> really<00:02:41.819> strong

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
reverse in this game is really strong

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.680 
reverse in this game is really strong
you<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.560> change<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.040> direction<00:02:44.790> you're

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
you can change the direction you're

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.390 
you can change the direction you're
going<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.260> at<00:02:46.530> what<00:02:46.680> speed<00:02:46.920> pretty<00:02:47.250> easily

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
going and at what speed pretty easily

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.750 
going and at what speed pretty easily
it's<00:02:47.880> really<00:02:48.299> really<00:02:48.569> good<00:02:49.579> another<00:02:50.579> move

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
it's really really good another move

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.099 
it's really really good another move
that<00:02:50.910> he<00:02:50.970> has<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.269> this<00:02:51.420> flame<00:02:51.660> which<00:02:51.840> is<00:02:51.959> down

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
that he has is this flame which is down

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.470 
that he has is this flame which is down
a<00:02:52.139> punch<00:02:52.470> whoops<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.150> really<00:02:54.269> good

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
a punch whoops and this is really good

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.610 
a punch whoops and this is really good
for<00:02:54.569> pressure<00:02:54.780> as<00:02:54.959> well<00:02:55.109> with<00:02:55.380> stuff<00:02:55.590> like

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
for pressure as well with stuff like

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.440 
for pressure as well with stuff like
this<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.930> X<00:02:58.049> version<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.769> flame<00:02:59.209> it<00:03:00.209> looks

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
this the X version of the flame it looks

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.030 
this the X version of the flame it looks
didn't<00:03:00.840> get<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.049> there<00:03:01.169> x<00:03:01.680> version<00:03:01.919> on<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
didn't get it there x version on the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.890 
didn't get it there x version on the
flame<00:03:02.220> hits<00:03:02.819> on<00:03:02.940> both<00:03:02.970> sides<00:03:03.269> like<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.480> hits

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
flame hits on both sides like that hits

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.120 
flame hits on both sides like that hits
a<00:03:03.989> lot<00:03:04.139> of<00:03:04.230> times<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.590> can<00:03:04.620> actually<00:03:04.799> juggle

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
a lot of times you can actually juggle

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.589 
a lot of times you can actually juggle
after<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.609> so<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.819> can<00:03:05.940> do<00:03:06.000> like<00:03:06.090> he<00:03:06.239> expired

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
after it so you can do like he expired

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.750 
after it so you can do like he expired
while<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.900> explain<00:03:07.280> scissor<00:03:08.280> cake<00:03:08.489> stuff

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
while you explain scissor cake stuff

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.339 
while you explain scissor cake stuff
like<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:08.940> it's<00:03:09.269> really<00:03:09.450> really<00:03:09.690> good<00:03:09.720> so

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
like that it's really really good so

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.629 
like that it's really really good so
those<00:03:10.500> were<00:03:10.620> his<00:03:10.680> special<00:03:11.040> was<00:03:11.190> pretty<00:03:11.370> simple

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
those were his special was pretty simple

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.650 
those were his special was pretty simple
right<00:03:11.760> Bisons<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.239> pretty<00:03:12.419> straightforward

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
right Bisons a pretty straightforward

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.420 
right Bisons a pretty straightforward
character<00:03:13.169> he's<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.380> charge<00:03:13.590> character<00:03:13.980> it's

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
character he's a charge character it's

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.620 
character he's a charge character it's
like<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.609> little<00:03:14.730> bit<00:03:14.910> about<00:03:15.030> his<00:03:15.239> v<00:03:15.389> skill

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
like a little bit about his v skill

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.140 
like a little bit about his v skill
looks<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.139> it's<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.709> projectile<00:03:17.160> absorb

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
looks like this it's a projectile absorb

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.819 
looks like this it's a projectile absorb
and<00:03:18.389> it<00:03:18.480> can<00:03:18.569> also<00:03:18.690> turn<00:03:18.989> into<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.290> reflect<00:03:19.680> if

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
and it can also turn into a reflect if

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.620 
and it can also turn into a reflect if
you<00:03:19.919> hold<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.250> button<00:03:20.519> down<00:03:20.549> he<00:03:21.120> shoots<00:03:21.419> the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
you hold the button down he shoots the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.050 
you hold the button down he shoots the
projectile<00:03:22.139> back<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.859> it's<00:03:23.340> twice<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
projectile back and it's twice so the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.550 
projectile back and it's twice so the
projectile<00:03:24.480> reflects<00:03:24.900> shoots<00:03:25.109> twice<00:03:25.260> which

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
projectile reflects shoots twice which

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.170 
projectile reflects shoots twice which
is<00:03:25.680> really<00:03:25.889> good<00:03:26.069> because<00:03:26.130> if<00:03:26.880> they're<00:03:27.060> trying

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
is really good because if they're trying

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.759 
is really good because if they're trying
to<00:03:27.269> do<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.480> projectile<00:03:28.019> war<00:03:28.230> with<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.620> can

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
to do a projectile war with you you can

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.170 
to do a projectile war with you you can
reflect<00:03:29.010> their<00:03:29.220> projectiles<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.030> have<00:03:30.120> a

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
reflect their projectiles and you have a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.520 
reflect their projectiles and you have a
multi<00:03:30.510> ending<00:03:30.720> projectile<00:03:31.139> which<00:03:31.290> means

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
multi ending projectile which means

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.110 
multi ending projectile which means
you're<00:03:31.650> pretty<00:03:31.799> much<00:03:31.859> gonna<00:03:32.069> win<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.030> can

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
you're pretty much gonna win so you can

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.789 
you're pretty much gonna win so you can
do<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.389> reflect<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.019> slide<00:03:34.319> in<00:03:34.470> behind<00:03:34.620> the

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
do that reflect it slide in behind the

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.800 
do that reflect it slide in behind the
projectile<00:03:35.340> or<00:03:35.519> jump<00:03:35.790> in<00:03:35.970> or<00:03:36.150> Devils<00:03:36.599> reverse

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
projectile or jump in or Devils reverse

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.960 
projectile or jump in or Devils reverse
down<00:03:37.019> or<00:03:37.109> whatever<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.440> want<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.620> do<00:03:37.769> right

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
down or whatever you want to do right

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.580 
down or whatever you want to do right
it's<00:03:38.970> really<00:03:39.239> really<00:03:39.419> good<00:03:39.480> another<00:03:40.200> thing<00:03:40.379> is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
it's really really good another thing is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.759 
it's really really good another thing is
his<00:03:40.769> v-trigger<00:03:41.190> Bisons<00:03:41.910> v-trigger<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.989> very

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
his v-trigger Bisons v-trigger is very

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.050 
his v-trigger Bisons v-trigger is very
good<00:03:44.220> as<00:03:44.340> soon<00:03:44.400> as<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.579> pops<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.940> you'll

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
good as soon as you pops it you'll

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.280 
good as soon as you pops it you'll
notice<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.480> v-trigger<00:03:45.660> last<00:03:46.079> forever

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
notice that the v-trigger last forever

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.779 
notice that the v-trigger last forever
if<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.650> look<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:46.919> bottom<00:03:47.099> left<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.519> takes

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:47.789 
if you look in the bottom left it takes

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:49.909 
if you look in the bottom left it takes
forever<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.419> tick<00:03:48.630> down<00:03:48.780> now<00:03:49.259> his<00:03:49.410> dashes<00:03:49.799> are

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
forever to tick down now his dashes are

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.510 
forever to tick down now his dashes are
teleports<00:03:50.400> as<00:03:50.699> for<00:03:50.910> dash<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.329> teleport

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
teleports as for dash is a teleport

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.330 
teleports as for dash is a teleport
which<00:03:52.820> is<00:03:52.940> really<00:03:53.120> good<00:03:53.300> for<00:03:53.450> him<00:03:53.630> obviously

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
which is really good for him obviously

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.590 
which is really good for him obviously
because<00:03:55.340> he<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.550> makes<00:03:55.880> people<00:03:56.180> up<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:56.480> it

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
because he can makes people up and it

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.970 
because he can makes people up and it
gives<00:03:56.720> them<00:03:56.810> more<00:03:56.930> mobility<00:03:57.230> as<00:03:57.560> you<00:03:57.710> saw<00:03:57.860> that

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
gives them more mobility as you saw that

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.560 
gives them more mobility as you saw that
the<00:03:58.130> scissor<00:03:58.310> kick<00:03:58.520> disappears<00:03:59.150> when<00:03:59.480> you

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
the scissor kick disappears when you

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.660 
the scissor kick disappears when you
start<00:03:59.810> it<00:03:59.870> up<00:03:59.960> the<00:04:00.770> heavy<00:04:00.950> kick<00:04:01.130> disappears

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
start it up the heavy kick disappears

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.940 
start it up the heavy kick disappears
for<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:01.910> while<00:04:02.200> it's<00:04:03.200> like<00:04:03.320> that<00:04:03.500> time<00:04:03.530> worse

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
for a while it's like that time worse

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.710 
for a while it's like that time worse
it's<00:04:04.220> not<00:04:04.430> there<00:04:04.640> it<00:04:05.030> changed<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.390> lot<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.600> his

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
it's not there it changed a lot of his

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.380 
it's not there it changed a lot of his
other<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:06.290> other<00:04:06.560> property<00:04:06.950> we<00:04:07.100> go<00:04:07.220> out<00:04:07.390> one

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
other is other property we go out one

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.730 
other is other property we go out one
thing<00:04:08.510> that's<00:04:08.690> really<00:04:08.810> nice<00:04:09.020> about<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.350> is

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
thing that's really nice about it is

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.910 
thing that's really nice about it is
that<00:04:10.270> while<00:04:11.270> he's<00:04:11.450> in<00:04:11.600> be<00:04:11.780> trigger<00:04:12.140> his

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
that while he's in be trigger his

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.490 
that while he's in be trigger his
mobility<00:04:13.340> is<00:04:13.760> just<00:04:14.090> crazy<00:04:14.660> with<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.290> devil

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
mobility is just crazy with the devil

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.090 
mobility is just crazy with the devil
diverse<00:04:15.890> loops<00:04:16.190> because<00:04:17.000> he<00:04:17.810> disappears<00:04:18.530> as

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
diverse loops because he disappears as

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.430 
diverse loops because he disappears as
you<00:04:19.370> know<00:04:19.520> as<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:19.940> pretty<00:04:20.750> quickly<00:04:20.959> realized

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
you know as you pretty quickly realized

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.050 
you know as you pretty quickly realized
yeah<00:04:21.830> he<00:04:21.980> disappears<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.670> that<00:04:22.790> was<00:04:22.940> actually

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
yeah he disappears and that was actually

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.430 
yeah he disappears and that was actually
a<00:04:23.240> cross<00:04:23.420> up<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.660> whole<00:04:23.780> diverse<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.230> didn't

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
a cross up the whole diverse I didn't

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.270 
a cross up the whole diverse I didn't
even<00:04:24.500> mean<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.710> do<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:24.890> but<00:04:25.130> it<00:04:25.250> just

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
even mean to do that but it just

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.730 
even mean to do that but it just
happened<00:04:25.900> yeah<00:04:26.900> so<00:04:27.110> that's<00:04:27.320> one<00:04:27.500> thing<00:04:27.680> about

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
happened yeah so that's one thing about

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.130 
happened yeah so that's one thing about
devil<00:04:28.250> trigger<00:04:28.370> devil<00:04:29.330> trigger<00:04:29.450> v-trigger

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
devil trigger devil trigger v-trigger

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.080 
devil trigger devil trigger v-trigger
it's<00:04:30.740> pretty<00:04:30.920> nice<00:04:31.100> is<00:04:31.430> that<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:31.790> devil's

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
it's pretty nice is that the devil's

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.400 
it's pretty nice is that the devil's
reverse<00:04:32.300> becomes<00:04:32.660> really<00:04:32.870> really<00:04:33.080> tricky<00:04:33.230> to

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
reverse becomes really really tricky to

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.200 
reverse becomes really really tricky to
deal<00:04:33.560> with<00:04:33.710> another<00:04:34.280> good<00:04:34.430> thing<00:04:34.460> is<00:04:34.640> that<00:04:34.880> the

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
deal with another good thing is that the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.330 
deal with another good thing is that the
head<00:04:35.360> stomp<00:04:35.600> when<00:04:35.840> you're<00:04:35.990> in<00:04:36.110> this<00:04:36.350> hits<00:04:37.190> the

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
head stomp when you're in this hits the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.770 
head stomp when you're in this hits the
ground<00:04:37.490> instantly<00:04:38.000> will<00:04:38.270> block<00:04:38.480> it<00:04:38.510> and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
ground instantly will block it and

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.630 
ground instantly will block it and
there's<00:04:38.990> an<00:04:39.110> extra<00:04:39.320> stop<00:04:39.530> being<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:40.310> what

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
there's an extra stop being so what

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.010 
there's an extra stop being so what
while<00:04:40.820> you're<00:04:41.000> gonna<00:04:41.120> be<00:04:41.270> trigger<00:04:41.540> with<00:04:41.660> bison

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
while you're gonna be trigger with bison

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.800 
while you're gonna be trigger with bison
your<00:04:42.170> mobility<00:04:42.500> is<00:04:42.950> just<00:04:43.340> crazy<00:04:43.850> like<00:04:44.240> it's

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
your mobility is just crazy like it's

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.710 
your mobility is just crazy like it's
way<00:04:45.080> higher<00:04:45.320> than<00:04:45.380> it<00:04:45.950> was<00:04:45.980> previously<00:04:46.720> and

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
way higher than it was previously and

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.470 
way higher than it was previously and
it's<00:04:48.170> just<00:04:48.350> really<00:04:48.500> good<00:04:48.910> it's<00:04:49.910> kind<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.210> sorts

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
it's just really good it's kind of sorts

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.940 
it's just really good it's kind of sorts
out<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.630> issue<00:04:50.870> where<00:04:51.260> his<00:04:51.470> walk<00:04:51.680> speeds

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
out the issue where his walk speeds

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.730 
out the issue where his walk speeds
really<00:04:52.160> slow<00:04:52.370> Sina's<00:04:53.000> v<00:04:53.120> triggers<00:04:53.390> on<00:04:53.540> he<00:04:54.530> is

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
really slow Sina's v triggers on he is

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.650 
really slow Sina's v triggers on he is
just<00:04:55.040> incredibly<00:04:55.730> fast<00:04:55.970> so<00:04:56.180> that<00:04:56.210> is<00:04:56.540> pretty

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
just incredibly fast so that is pretty

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.730 
just incredibly fast so that is pretty
much<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:56.900> Bison<00:04:57.320> character<00:04:57.590> breakdown

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
much the Bison character breakdown

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.440 
much the Bison character breakdown
pretty<00:04:58.130> simple<00:04:58.460> character<00:04:58.700> overall<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.270> guess

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
pretty simple character overall I guess

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.560 
pretty simple character overall I guess
I'll<00:04:59.600> show<00:04:59.630> her<00:04:59.810> super<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.230> Sam<00:05:00.710> football<00:05:01.570> not

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
I'll show her super to Sam football not

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.910 
I'll show her super to Sam football not
what<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.780> super<00:05:02.930> looks<00:05:03.200> like<00:05:03.350> thanks<00:05:03.770> for

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
what the super looks like thanks for

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.140 
what the super looks like thanks for
watching<00:05:03.950> guys<00:05:04.310> hopefully<00:05:04.640> you<00:05:04.820> got<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.060> enjoy
