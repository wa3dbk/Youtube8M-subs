00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.340
 we come back with more 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.310
 abc rural 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.639
 sheep production continues to win 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:17.270
 market in Paraguay we already have 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.310
 two refrigerators specialized in 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.770
 sheep meat and that is very important 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.010
 because because we have to improve the 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.130
 production and on this point the doctor 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.440
 José María Espinola not to mention 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.390
 selection by teething and also other 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.070
 special considerations to have 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.070
 good sheep production 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.370
 yes 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.000
 an important job in a 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.059
 livestock establishment is the selection 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.120
 Bone that eliminate animals that no longer 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.829
 they serve or of low production in such a way 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.540
 set aside the old sheep and sheep that 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.460
 have defects for example not 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.920
 have more calf for us to call 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.680
 machorra or that have some defect 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.810
 may have the defect in the mouth 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.630
 prognatism or can have horn 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.700
 etcetera or eye problem all that already 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.190
 moves away in November in such a way 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.039
 give a good treatment for the task 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.670
 end of the year which is the time when 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:25.000
 meat is sold or consumed more 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.220
 sheep to review this is important 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.820
 have also some practice 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.800
 and an adequate way to check the animal 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.870
 For this we are going to check the mouth 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.360
 look at the mouth let's see the age of 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.640
 animal that is known by the teeth by 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.310
 the appearance of permanent teeth 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.730
 of the permanent incisors that go 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.860
 appearing two teeth per year at 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.450
 check the mouth you can see the age of 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.640
 animal this for example has six 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.980
 teeth the last one is a baby tooth 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.290
 it means that this animal is 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.750
 around the three years of life is 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.810
 important also to know the time of 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.810
 parición then adjusts more to the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.729
 effective age of the animal also at 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.520
 open the mouth that is done that way 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.370
 a hand rests on the nape of the neck and with the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.640
 two fingers the index finger and the thumb 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.950
 place where you should 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.810
 be the horns in case you have horns 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.810
 the animal because to have horns in this 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.240
 race is a flaw in doing this with the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.150
 index and the thumb you see the age and 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.790
 you can also see if he has or not pronat ism 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.890
 prognatism of when it protrudes 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.980
 the jaws either superior or 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.510
 bottom has to be fine 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.569
 correlated as in this case also 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.030
 when making lateral movements it 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.549
 appreciate the eyes where you can 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.489
 appreciate some problems as 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.310
 example entropion is a problem when 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.370
 the eyelids are inverted towards the globe 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.439
 of the eye is a hereditary defect that is 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.959
 important to eliminate animals that 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.299
 have those problems it shows very well 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.670
 because the animal is permanently 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.620
 tearing is throwing and if one 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.959
 observe well you notice right away that the 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.079
 eyelids are reversed towards the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.419
 eyeball that affects vision can 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.419
 ulcerate and may be left blind 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.849
 animal this one already completed its teething of 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.980
 what we call mouth full in a mouth 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.650
 full new because it's just coming out 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.379
 the last permanent teeth and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.510
 it does not have horns either and it does not have the 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.189
 eyes problem this has four 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.530
 teeth can notice the teeth 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.780
 permanent are four be an animal of 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.140
 two years this one has six teeth 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.660
 three years it is noted that the last one is still 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.880
 of milk is very small belly 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.610
 reelectos this one has two teeth wants 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.430
 say that he has turned the year that is not 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.470
 very well the difference between teeth 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.989
 permanent and teeth milk is 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.150
 important to appreciate because 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.850
 mainly when you are going to acquire 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.739
 animals the first thing to know 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.350
 is the age of the animals that is going to 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:10.130
 buy either male or female because 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.980
 we know the lifespan of a sheep is of 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:15.800
 8 years and the productive starts from 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.980
 of 1 year is from 1 to 8 years at 8 years 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.950
 the permanent teeth are totally 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.700
 worn to the gum and it 's time 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.520
 to discard that sheep animal already 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.460
 Send to a better position no longer 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.770
 Don Ram gets fat for his job 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.990
 normally it is no longer sheared because it 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.729
 leave the leather with the wool for 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.729
 take advantage of as a cushion
