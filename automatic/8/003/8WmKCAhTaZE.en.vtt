00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.120
 dust 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.400
 the headband is adjustable and is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.769
 equipped with a colored canvas and a 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.440

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.010
 on android but then only the play and 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.540
 pause button as we see is the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.460
 headphones made from durable 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.770
 materials but the sound is like that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.720
 powerful as they promise and worked 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.040
 remote control indeed with ios 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.870
 Products 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.850
 the fifty millimeter drivers that the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.160

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.310
 excellent and powerful sound the 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.410
 brussels nice and full but not over the top 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.670
 in fact everything was well balanced 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.820
 the cord also has a protective one 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.260

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.150

 We have now connected to an iPhone 4 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.530
 for example when the volume controls 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.290
 the remote control 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.890
 then the volume moves on my iphone 4 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.750
 also get along well when I am called 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.610
