00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
player most importantly I think he was

player most importantly I think he was
instrumental<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.430> forcing<00:00:35.430> through<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> move

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
and force and savea's hand because it's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.430 
and force and savea's hand because it's
come<00:00:38.610> out<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> press<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.239> he<00:00:39.840> wanted<00:00:40.260> to
