 I as a Christmas gift an almost elton 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.519

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.780
 am that I just had to do this with you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.450
 share 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.880
 so this is a sort of reviews bottle 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.510
 and boxing is what the dollar is talking about 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.119
 is the rowenta multistyler steel eat this 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.830
 is a h krups trash hairstyles slash 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.830
 wafer tongs in one 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.040
 when i first saw the box that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.440
 I get a small box of sets then 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.160
 but then I thought oh yes of course the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.930
 hair straightener the bottom part is separate from 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.489
 the different attachments so after one 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.660
 small box 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.660
 open the box is a black bag 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.309
 these and here are the different ones 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.989
 parts in this bag is also 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.980
 it needs shikari to make the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.460
 assignment and if you like this dam 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.830
 opening up is first and foremost the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.180
 straightener yourself in this spa easy 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.320
 the only thing that is done is the on and on 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.229
 power button 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.229
 and there's a light on that 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.729
 indicates when the state is then on 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.500
 it is not that it goes out when 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.580
 then state completely lived on or 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.320
 When he is empty, he himself is quite there 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.780
 fairly light 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.810
 well then different attachments 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.409
 First of all , there is this little one 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.060
 curling iron with accompanying attachment 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.369
 curling brush 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.110
 this case especially not used if you 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.759
 have fine hair i have done it i can 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.049
 my flat got stuck so that later 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.619
 certainly finished 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.490
 the curling iron itself is great for 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.680
 making a move 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.610
 loose curls I am very excited about 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.030
 this one 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.140
 from my thin hair he makes yes 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.350
 beautiful smooth natural curls 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.860
 then as a second racing flat curls a 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.899
 with this you make strong curls something 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.310
 tighter and shorter curls 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.260
 you saw i sure i got everything 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.610
 all tried out full bar and 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.830
 there is a clear difference between these 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.110
 and this one 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:22.180
 there is also a large curling iron that is 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.130
 I think that this is 32 mm 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.870
 cut through 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.360
 with this you can of that beautiful slut me 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.370
 wanted to make that loose from a grove 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.500
 curls and strokes 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.049
 and now I work that and my thin h that 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.400
 this the bottle took the sag 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.350
 and then you can fine this as well 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.840
 use alternative and certainly sit 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.110
 just go through with your fingers or 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.269
 just out of side then you can almost do this 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.830
 just such loose curls but just anyway 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.799
 just effe that it takes a little longer 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.269
 remains in place has about the same 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.780
 effect that someone with dean has with 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.510
 I think this is the last curling iron now 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.769
 is it is this this is for 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.459
 create spiral curls with this 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.489
 so really 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.320
 pipe curls say and this is also one 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.150
 very nice tool to try out think 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.420
 wants from a long harbor mine 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.609
 maintain than real super short at once 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.950
 also got really good 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.560
 then I'm not on the straightener about this 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.799
 so enthusiastic and you liked this tool 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.630
 buy for you stand from your father I guess 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.950
 it certainly finished and the do in my 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.489
 case is nothing actually already have one 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.650
 great straightener he will always stay that way 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.260
 your hair instead of style 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.319
 make in your hair flat pieces away until 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.510
 frizzy whether or not a good set then 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.250
 your he is also incredibly heavy 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.709
 practically falls out of your hands and awkwardly 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.870
 in use with clamp 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:50.360
 perhaps with thicker hair do 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.530
 still work reasonably well but then you say 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.190
 we also have this one 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.709
 true full plates at one you can do as well 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.420
 is very good for this and me 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.290
 and will show who they manage blood here 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.069
 on a block 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.269
 put you in between the upper part 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.400
 up you get it like this 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:18.590
 and then click this one there 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:21.139
 far in this also closes slightly better 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.030
 each other right away and with this you can 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.419
 make water in your hair and it works 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.570
 well than the everywhere conclusion of this 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.810
 proposes to the after the pros and cons 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.550
 the benefits I think you get a lot 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.270
 get different trolls for it 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.680
 the same amount that you normally have one 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.539
 normally priced the curling iron 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.130
 so I think that with all certainty 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.199
 so I still place below this 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.950
 just the real price 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.389
 I think it was 39 euros and 37 euros 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.430
 you have four for this 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.030
 different curling irons 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.330
 basically target brush and straightener 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.310
 So wafer stand this allows them 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.330
 try a lot of hairstyles and certainly 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.680
 if you do not like you if you like to 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.570
 to experiment a little differently 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.000
 want then this is a lot of fun then 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.870
 he is also good has the color remains 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.169
 sit for a long time 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.419
 it is very easy to use 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.710
 no fuss school simple and easy 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.400
 I really like it 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.220
 the super fast bar think that's why 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.960
 another half minute is he comes in mine 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.310
 bag what you want is very easy that you have it 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.529
 can always take it is small 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.499
 compact 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:36.109
 it's nicer and waffle maker 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:38.509
 Disadvantages is that you get the temperature 

00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:40.159
 can not argue regular that can before 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:42.879
 people disadvantage I myself are not so whole 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.879
 many problems with it 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:48.469
 oh i can imagine if you are there 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.729
 really important that that is difficult 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:56.179
 does not indicate that in the rod 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:57.829
 is completely warm or has cooled down and there 

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:59.119
 not much curler is also 

00:05:57.829 --> 00:06:00.649
 nowadays have a 

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:03.529
 automatically off function that has this 

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:07.159
 not even then it is short pruning 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.969
 relationship with the lights the light 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.499
 handle 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.059
 can be quite tricky if you have the bigger ones 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:13.039
 heavier thing setting up thereby can 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:14.749
 I can slip a little hands 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.159
 and those are actually for me 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:18.739
 most important yes oh yes and of course that 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:20.209
 the straightener itself does not work properly but 

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:22.339
 I also think it's really great 

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:25.129
 and certainly for the money 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:26.539
 you can certainly talk 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.029
 I leave different languages ​​for a while 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.409
 see seperately in separate videos 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:33.319
 if you like it then i make it 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.179
 a different hairstyle with each pair of tongs 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:37.279
 And then you can well see the difference between 

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:39.649
 the different thomas in because if me 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:41.899
 now these and these three next to each other 

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.949
 use my hair in this video 

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:44.119
 a pick 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.499
 you can not very clear the 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:48.619
 differences signal you have to 

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:50.119
 real experience as a blow so I think 

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:52.849
 that I have some separate videos 

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:54.860
 included and then this was my review of 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.449
 I eat the moment of multistyler style 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.029
 hope you are a little wiser 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:01.209
 and thank you for watching 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:01.209
 bye
