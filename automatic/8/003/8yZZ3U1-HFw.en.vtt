big is it took adjectives or transactive
the<00:01:50.670> tokens<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.930> he<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.070> manipulate

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the tokens and then he can manipulate

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.800 
the tokens and then he can manipulate
these<00:01:54.899> tokens<00:01:55.790> juxtaposed<00:01:56.790> them<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.240> counter

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.300 

let<00:02:09.379> me<00:02:09.470> see<00:02:09.590> if<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.709> can<00:02:09.800> get<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.009> straight

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
let me see if I can get this straight

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.390 
let me see if I can get this straight
okay<00:02:10.519> you've<00:02:10.849> got<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.540> worm<00:02:11.810> who<00:02:12.739> can<00:02:12.980> sense

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
okay you've got the worm who can sense

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.920 
okay you've got the worm who can sense
the<00:02:13.580> world<00:02:13.790> sort<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.690> then<00:02:14.810> you've<00:02:14.900> got

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
the world sort of and then you've got

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.619 
the world sort of and then you've got
the<00:02:15.200> monkey<00:02:15.379> who<00:02:15.769> can<00:02:15.980> pull<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.030> world<00:02:17.209> into

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
the monkey who can pull the world into

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.630 
the monkey who can pull the world into
some<00:02:17.810> degree<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.349> make<00:02:18.500> an<00:02:18.620> association<00:02:19.129> okay

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
some degree and make an association okay

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.910 
some degree and make an association okay
then<00:02:20.180> you've<00:02:20.330> got<00:02:20.450> us<00:02:20.629> and<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.319> can<00:02:21.470> play<00:02:21.739> with

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
then you've got us and we can play with

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.699 
then you've got us and we can play with
those<00:02:22.010> associations<00:02:22.959> how<00:02:23.959> did<00:02:24.110> how<00:02:24.440> did<00:02:24.470> that

those associations how did how did that

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.070 
those associations how did how did that
happen<00:02:25.220> well<00:02:25.450> well<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.599> cut<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:26.870> cause<00:02:27.049> of

change from day to day and it allows the
