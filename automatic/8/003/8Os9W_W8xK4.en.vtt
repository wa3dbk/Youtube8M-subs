00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this so let's say we're using three

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.980 
this so let's say we're using three
zones<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.510> left<00:01:09.720> hand

functions within one's own because you

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.940 
functions within one's own because you
have<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> huge<00:02:26.340> living<00:02:26.670> area<00:02:27.000> where<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:27.989> have<00:02:28.230> a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
have a huge living area where you have a

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.860 
have a huge living area where you have a
lot<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.519> blinds<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.390> lot<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.599> lights

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
lot of blinds and a lot of lights

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.470 
lot of blinds and a lot of lights
circuits<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.500> need<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.769> control<00:02:32.330> then<00:02:33.330> you

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
circuits you need to control then you

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.780 
circuits you need to control then you
can<00:02:33.630> easily<00:02:34.080> go<00:02:34.530> into<00:02:34.709> zone<00:02:34.980> selections<00:02:35.550> and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
can easily go into zone selections and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.530 
can easily go into zone selections and
give<00:02:36.510> those<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:37.800> zones<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.400> same<00:02:38.640> name<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.450> in

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
give those to zones the same name so in

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.009 
give those to zones the same name so in
our<00:02:39.660> case<00:02:39.959> this<00:02:40.260> would<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.620> living<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:42.019> then

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
our case this would be living and then

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.900 
our case this would be living and then
those<00:02:43.230> zones<00:02:43.530> will<00:02:43.739> be<00:02:43.890> merged<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.700> only

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
those zones will be merged so you only

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.289 
those zones will be merged so you only
have<00:02:45.150> one<00:02:45.390> living<00:02:45.660> zone<00:02:46.470> within<00:02:46.769> your<00:02:47.069> apps

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
have one living zone within your apps

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.780 
have one living zone within your apps
which<00:02:48.299> will<00:02:48.480> then<00:02:48.630> give<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.870> 32<00:02:49.349> objects<00:02:50.099> to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
which will then give you 32 objects to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.059 
which will then give you 32 objects to
be<00:02:50.940> added<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.390> zone<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.590> extend

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
be added to that zone you can extend

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.610 
be added to that zone you can extend
that<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.430> as<00:02:53.670> many<00:02:53.970> up<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.480> as<00:02:54.630> many<00:02:54.810> zones<00:02:55.200> as

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
that to as many up to as many zones as

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.390 
that to as many up to as many zones as
you'd<00:02:56.130> like

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
you'd like

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.020 
you'd like
so<00:02:57.090> let's<00:02:57.299> say<00:02:57.510> our<00:02:57.540> third<00:02:57.959> zone<00:02:58.200> here<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:59.130> our

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
so let's say our third zone here is our

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:10.759 
so let's say our third zone here is our
master<00:03:00.540> bedroom<00:03:08.630> we<00:03:09.630> furthermore<00:03:10.140> have<00:03:10.380> the

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
master bedroom we furthermore have the

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.539 
master bedroom we furthermore have the
