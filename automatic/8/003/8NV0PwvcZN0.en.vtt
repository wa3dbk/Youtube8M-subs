a<00:00:37.329> great<00:00:37.540> game<00:00:38.489> if<00:00:39.489> moody<00:00:40.050> doesn't<00:00:41.050> cramp<00:00:41.649> up

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
a great game if moody doesn't cramp up

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.580 
a great game if moody doesn't cramp up

doing I've been there before and I know
that's<00:01:45.580> an<00:01:45.790> issue<00:01:45.939> because<00:01:46.270> now<00:01:46.720> they<00:01:46.990> don't

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
that's an issue because now they don't

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.920 
that's an issue because now they don't
have<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.710> play<00:01:47.979> they<00:01:48.640> just<00:01:48.939> dribble<00:01:49.510> down<00:01:49.689> and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
have to play they just dribble down and

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.359 
have to play they just dribble down and
jump<00:01:50.080> over<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.409> guy<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.740> shoot<00:01:50.950> there's<00:01:51.189> no

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
jump over a guy and shoot there's no

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.850 
jump over a guy and shoot there's no
real<00:01:51.610> defense<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:52.810> but<00:01:53.560> i<00:01:53.590> thought

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
real defense to that so but i thought

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.580 
real defense to that so but i thought

effort or what I don't know i watch I

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.700 
effort or what I don't know i watch I
just<00:03:55.540> thought<00:03:55.660> there<00:03:55.840> were<00:03:55.930> times<00:03:56.200> we<00:03:56.410> didn't

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
just thought there were times we didn't

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.470 
just thought there were times we didn't
block<00:03:56.890> out<00:03:57.130> we<00:03:57.370> ran<00:03:57.670> in<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.120> ball<00:03:58.270> went

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
block out we ran in and the ball went

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.030 
block out we ran in and the ball went
wide<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.050> I<00:03:59.140> think<00:03:59.410> there<00:03:59.560> are<00:03:59.590> other<00:03:59.710> times

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
wide and I think there are other times

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.800 
wide and I think there are other times
that<00:04:00.190> we<00:04:00.400> needed<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.850> have<00:04:01.030> some<00:04:01.060> physical

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
that we needed to have some physical

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.070 
that we needed to have some physical

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.990 
contact and we didn't there were

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
we're still learning and I think this is

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.450 
we're still learning and I think this is
a<00:05:02.940> wake-up<00:05:03.940> call<00:05:04.330> for<00:05:04.360> them<00:05:04.810> that<00:05:05.020> look<00:05:05.860> teams

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
a wake-up call for them that look teams

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.040 
a wake-up call for them that look teams

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.180 
Tyler against a smaller guy has a big
advantage<00:05:55.419> why<00:05:55.870> he<00:05:55.960> didn't<00:05:56.229> in<00:05:56.290> this<00:05:56.440> game<00:05:56.650> so

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
advantage why he didn't in this game so

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.890
