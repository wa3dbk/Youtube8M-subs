I think some of the some of the facts
that<00:00:58.199> help<00:00:58.559> the<00:01:00.079> characteristics<00:01:01.079> were<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
that help the characteristics were that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.340 
that help the characteristics were that
I<00:01:01.739> started<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.399> operations<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.870> didn't

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
I started in operations so I didn't

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320

for a while so you know when you get

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.460 
for a while so you know when you get
that<00:01:30.840> operational<00:01:32.060> perspective<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.750> adds<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that operational perspective it adds a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.030 
that operational perspective it adds a
