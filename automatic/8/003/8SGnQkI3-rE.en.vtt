00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.670 

the<00:02:13.060> other<00:02:13.209> way<00:02:13.390> enzymes<00:02:13.870> break<00:02:14.079> down<00:02:14.200> complex

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
the other way enzymes break down complex

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.729 
the other way enzymes break down complex
compounds<00:02:15.489> is<00:02:15.610> by<00:02:15.790> oxidation<00:02:16.569> this<00:02:17.170> process

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739

a random structure every molecule is

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.199 
a random structure every molecule is

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
different so the lock and key method

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.050 
different so the lock and key method
does<00:02:25.359> not<00:02:25.540> work<00:02:26.129> also<00:02:27.129> it<00:02:27.340> takes<00:02:27.519> a<00:02:27.670> lot<00:02:28.030> of
