something<00:00:29.830> that<00:00:29.950> I<00:00:30.220> don't<00:00:30.550> think<00:00:30.730> any<00:00:31.000> of<00:00:31.090> us

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
something that I don't think any of us

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.609 
something that I don't think any of us
have<00:00:31.360> ever<00:00:31.450> done<00:00:31.630> before<00:00:32.020> and<00:00:32.110> it's<00:00:32.439> something

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
have ever done before and it's something

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
that could turn out really really cool

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.870 
that could turn out really really cool
and<00:00:34.510> I'm<00:00:34.720> excited<00:00:34.989> to<00:00:35.170> see<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:36.220> outcome<00:00:36.250> not

only<00:00:37.150> are<00:00:37.270> we<00:00:37.330> doing<00:00:37.450> something<00:00:37.870> we<00:00:37.960> haven't

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
only are we doing something we haven't

only are we doing something we haven't
done<00:00:38.320> before<00:00:38.380> we<00:00:38.770> have<00:00:38.860> three<00:00:39.250> different

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400

done before we have three different
athletes<00:00:39.700> like<00:00:40.239> Daddy<00:00:40.540> myself<00:00:41.020> and<00:00:41.230> Alice

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
it's going to be a cool variety on the

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.910 
it's going to be a cool variety on the
logistic<00:00:47.110> side<00:00:47.290> it's<00:00:47.530> been<00:00:47.680> very<00:00:47.860> challenging

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
logistic side it's been very challenging

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.850

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
because we never did that so we had to

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.130 
because we never did that so we had to
get<00:00:51.010> a<00:00:51.040> bunch<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.970> people<00:00:52.330> and<00:00:52.480> never<00:00:52.870> quite

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
get a bunch of people and never quite

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.580 
get a bunch of people and never quite
work<00:00:53.440> together<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:54.160> quickly<00:00:55.030> learn<00:00:55.210> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
work together and quickly learn to
