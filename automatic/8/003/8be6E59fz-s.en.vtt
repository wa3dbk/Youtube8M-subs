we attach this one on the back these are

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.330 
we attach this one on the back these are
it<00:00:20.320> should<00:00:20.529> be<00:00:20.619> tight<00:00:20.860> you<00:00:21.009> may<00:00:21.099> want<00:00:21.310> to

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
it should be tight you may want to

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.679 
it should be tight you may want to
double<00:00:21.579> check<00:00:21.610> them<00:00:21.880> you<00:00:21.970> can<00:00:22.119> snug<00:00:22.329> those<00:00:22.509> up

double check them you can snug those up

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.089 
double check them you can snug those up
because<00:00:22.840> they're<00:00:23.020> steel<00:00:23.290> bolts<00:00:23.649> inside<00:00:23.919> these

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
because they're steel bolts inside these

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.729 
because they're steel bolts inside these
pans<00:00:24.970> so<00:00:25.329> you<00:00:25.779> can<00:00:25.930> tighten<00:00:26.200> these<00:00:26.290> up<00:00:26.529> and

00:00:26.729 --> 00:00:26.739 
pans so you can tighten these up and

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.460 
pans so you can tighten these up and
then<00:00:27.489> the<00:00:27.700> front<00:00:28.029> fork<00:00:28.360> now<00:00:29.050> if<00:00:29.230> you'll<00:00:29.410> notice

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
then the front fork now if you'll notice

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.960 
then the front fork now if you'll notice
this<00:00:29.829> is<00:00:30.009> adjustable<00:00:30.610> back<00:00:31.270> and<00:00:31.509> forth<00:00:31.719> and

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
this is adjustable back and forth and

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.640 
this is adjustable back and forth and
the<00:00:33.970> way<00:00:34.300> it<00:00:34.450> comes<00:00:34.720> out<00:00:34.900> on<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.170> savage<00:00:35.530> is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
the way it comes out on the savage is

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.140 
the way it comes out on the savage is
the<00:00:35.770> best<00:00:36.010> I<00:00:36.220> think<00:00:36.250> is<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.670> have<00:00:36.820> it<00:00:36.910> quite<00:00:37.120> a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
the best I think is to have it quite a

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.710 
the best I think is to have it quite a
ways<00:00:37.360> forward<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:39.520> it<00:00:39.670> it<00:00:40.060> just<00:00:40.240> puts<00:00:40.570> the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
ways forward because it it just puts the

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.450 
ways forward because it it just puts the
front<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.110> seat<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.320> little<00:00:41.500> bit<00:00:41.860> lower<00:00:42.070> so

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
front of the seat a little bit lower so

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.340

okay I've mounted the spring to the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.640 
okay I've mounted the spring to the
perch<00:01:45.460> here<00:01:45.760> if<00:01:46.720> you'll<00:01:46.960> notice<00:01:47.260> that<00:01:47.470> I've

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
squiggly I've got this out on my bike

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.940 
squiggly I've got this out on my bike
now<00:01:51.729> that's<00:01:51.909> not<00:01:52.119> set<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:52.930> stone<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:53.409> can<00:01:53.560> be

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
now that's not set in stone it can be

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.980 
now that's not set in stone it can be
they<00:01:54.159> can<00:01:54.280> be<00:01:54.369> in<00:01:54.610> or<00:01:54.970> out<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.659> you<00:01:55.780> won't<00:01:55.930> want

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
they can be in or out and you won't want

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.719 
they can be in or out and you won't want
to<00:01:56.229> when<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:56.740> mount<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.130> spring<00:01:57.400> leave<00:01:57.610> this

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
to when you mount the spring leave this

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.399 
to when you mount the spring leave this
just<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.060> little<00:01:58.299> loose<00:01:58.450> so<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.750> swivels<00:01:59.170> and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
just a little loose so it swivels and

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.130 
just a little loose so it swivels and
then<00:02:00.040> we<00:02:00.250> when<00:02:00.460> we<00:02:00.610> put<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:00.880> seed<00:02:01.119> on<00:02:01.150> we<00:02:01.960> can

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
then we when we put the seed on we can

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.840 
then we when we put the seed on we can
determine<00:02:02.470> which<00:02:02.799> way<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.130> squiggly<00:02:03.430> will<00:02:03.670> go

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
determine which way the squiggly will go

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.450 
determine which way the squiggly will go
before<00:02:04.479> we<00:02:04.570> tighten<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.439> up<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.040> go<00:02:06.310> ahead<00:02:06.369> and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
before we tighten it up so go ahead and

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.309 
before we tighten it up so go ahead and
mount<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.820> spring<00:02:07.090> just<00:02:07.270> like<00:02:07.330> that<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:07.869> then

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
mount the spring just like that and then

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.610 
mount the spring just like that and then
we'll<00:02:08.530> continue<00:02:08.709> on

nylock<00:03:15.170> nut<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.620> washer<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.550> spring<00:03:16.940> and

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
nylock nut the washer the spring and

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.210 
nylock nut the washer the spring and
then<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.570> flange<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.830> that's<00:03:19.040> how<00:03:19.160> that

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
then the flange so that's how that

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.130 
then the flange so that's how that
mounts<00:03:19.640> on<00:03:19.730> there<00:03:19.910> like<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.780> like<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.020> say

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
mounts on there like that and like I say

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.270 
mounts on there like that and like I say
you<00:03:21.170> can<00:03:21.410> go<00:03:21.470> ahead<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.620> snug<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.010> bottom

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
you can go ahead and snug the bottom

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.940 
you can go ahead and snug the bottom
bolts<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:22.850> bottom<00:03:23.090> bolts<00:03:23.330> too<00:03:23.570> down<00:03:24.110> here<00:03:24.470> so

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
bolts the bottom bolts too down here so

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.729 
bolts the bottom bolts too down here so
do<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.220> nut<00:03:25.459> goes<00:03:25.610> up<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:27.200> then<00:03:27.290> we'll<00:03:27.500> go<00:03:27.590> on

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
do the nut goes up and then we'll go on

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.440 
do the nut goes up and then we'll go on
to<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:27.950> front<00:03:28.370> now<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.820> front<00:03:29.060> it's<00:03:29.239> really
