00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.120 
wiki go with the wiki and what happened
was<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.330> started<00:01:18.900> copying<00:01:19.290> pressure<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.950> one<00:01:20.100> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
was I started copying pressure in one of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.999 
was I started copying pressure in one of
his<00:01:20.250> videos<00:01:20.340> before<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.930> went<00:01:22.500> through<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
his videos before I went through and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
his videos before I went through and
check<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.580> wiki<00:01:23.960> information<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.439> one

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
check the wiki information so this one

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.100 
check the wiki information so this one
according<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.310> wiki<00:01:26.840> should<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.960> back

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
according to the wiki should be back

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.679 
according to the wiki should be back
here<00:01:29.659> this<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:30.960> should<00:01:31.650> be<00:01:31.710> over<00:01:32.040> here<00:01:32.659> but<00:01:33.659> I

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
here this one should be over here but I

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.560 
here this one should be over here but I
did<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.439> right<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
did get this one right so this is the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.100 
did get this one right so this is the
optimum<00:01:37.140> placement<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> z-axis<00:01:39.110> optimum

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
optimum placement for the z-axis optimum

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.620 
optimum placement for the z-axis optimum
placement<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.860> x-axis<00:01:41.610> which<00:01:42.270> again<00:01:42.479> it

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
placement for the x-axis which again it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.880 
placement for the x-axis which again it
doesn't<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:42.930> matter<00:01:43.170> where<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.500> put<00:01:43.770> them

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
doesn't really matter where you put them

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.139 
doesn't really matter where you put them
as<00:01:44.040> long<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.369> your<00:01:44.520> flag<00:01:44.729> gets<00:01:45.149> you're<00:01:45.479> good<00:01:47.149> so

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
as long as your flag gets you're good so

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.520 
as long as your flag gets you're good so
there's<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.960> ex<00:01:49.619> optiv<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.500> y<00:01:52.500> opto

this<00:02:23.620> black<00:02:23.859> tube<00:02:24.159> and<00:02:24.849> I'm<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.329> electronics

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
this black tube and I'm the electronics

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.830 
this black tube and I'm the electronics
one<00:02:27.670> unique<00:02:28.120> thing<00:02:28.180> about<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.659> pressure

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
one unique thing about the pressure

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.780 
one unique thing about the pressure
Mendel<00:02:29.319> is<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:29.829> has<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:31.890> z<00:02:32.890> axis<00:02:33.370> motors

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
Mendel is that it has to z axis motors

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.599 
Mendel is that it has to z axis motors
reason<00:02:34.689> that<00:02:34.959> this<00:02:35.109> is<00:02:35.290> done<00:02:35.500> is<00:02:35.709> because<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
reason that this is done is because the

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.119 
reason that this is done is because the
z-axis<00:02:37.359> motors<00:02:38.109> only<00:02:38.349> cost<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.680> about<00:02:38.769> twelve

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
z-axis motors only cost you about twelve

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.619 
z-axis motors only cost you about twelve
dollars<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.700> by<00:02:39.819> the<00:02:39.879> time<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.269> buy<00:02:40.389> all<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
dollars and by the time you buy all the

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.500 
dollars and by the time you buy all the
hardware<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.319> do<00:02:41.439> the<00:02:41.590> belting<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:43.239> isn't

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
hardware to do the belting that isn't

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.599 
hardware to do the belting that isn't
costing<00:02:43.629> you<00:02:43.930> more<00:02:44.049> than<00:02:44.230> twelve<00:02:44.409> dollars<00:02:44.739> so

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
costing you more than twelve dollars so

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.429 
costing you more than twelve dollars so
it's<00:02:45.970> best<00:02:46.150> just<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.450> go<00:02:46.569> ahead<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.019> do<00:02:47.290> the

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
it's best just to go ahead and do the

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.129 
it's best just to go ahead and do the
pressure<00:02:47.680> mendel<00:02:48.099> instead<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.579> the<00:02:48.760> original

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
pressure mendel instead of the original

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.809 
pressure mendel instead of the original
cells<00:02:50.139> Mendel<00:02:50.560> version<00:02:51.099> because<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.549> ends<00:02:51.760> up

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
cells Mendel version because it ends up

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.610 
cells Mendel version because it ends up
saving<00:02:52.000> money<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.810> gives<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.139> a<00:02:53.169> whole

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
saving money and it gives you a whole

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.670 
saving money and it gives you a whole
lot<00:02:53.680> more<00:02:54.040> power<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.459> your<00:02:54.790> z-axis<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:56.590> way

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
lot more power on your z-axis that way

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.860 
lot more power on your z-axis that way
you're<00:02:56.859> not<00:02:56.889> going<00:02:57.099> to<00:02:57.159> have<00:02:57.250> as<00:02:57.310> many<00:02:57.430> jams

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
you're not going to have as many jams

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.089 
you're not going to have as many jams
one<00:02:58.870> thing<00:02:59.049> your<00:02:59.200> own<00:02:59.290> nose<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.709> haven't

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
one thing your own nose is I haven't

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.479 
one thing your own nose is I haven't
taped<00:03:00.400> these<00:03:00.760> yet<00:03:01.030> um<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:02.620> do<00:03:02.919> need<00:03:03.129> to<00:03:03.280> wrap

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
taped these yet um you do need to wrap

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.580 
taped these yet um you do need to wrap
tape<00:03:03.819> here<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:05.280> across<00:03:06.280> here<00:03:06.849> to<00:03:07.780> hold<00:03:08.319> the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
tape here and across here to hold the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.210 
tape here and across here to hold the
motors<00:03:09.370> down<00:03:09.900> but<00:03:10.900> anyway<00:03:11.139> easiest<00:03:12.040> way<00:03:12.159> to

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
motors down but anyway easiest way to

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.210 
motors down but anyway easiest way to
wire<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:13.030> z-axis<00:03:13.239> in<00:03:13.750> parallel<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.470> found<00:03:14.829> is

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
wire the z-axis in parallel I found is

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.619 
wire the z-axis in parallel I found is
to<00:03:15.250> run<00:03:15.989> this<00:03:16.989> motor<00:03:17.290> over<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:19.150> motor<00:03:19.359> that

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
to run this motor over to the motor that

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.240 
to run this motor over to the motor that
is<00:03:19.659> on<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> same<00:03:20.079> side<00:03:20.319> as<00:03:20.379> your<00:03:20.680> electronics

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
is on the same side as your electronics

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.379 
is on the same side as your electronics
and<00:03:21.900> then<00:03:22.900> put<00:03:23.639> both<00:03:25.260> sets<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.349> wires<00:03:26.620> in<00:03:27.389> each

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
and then put both sets of wires in each

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.439 
and then put both sets of wires in each
one<00:03:28.959> side<00:03:29.169> of<00:03:29.319> terminal<00:03:29.500> block<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.190> then<00:03:30.849> have

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:31.449 
one side of terminal block and then have

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.869 
one side of terminal block and then have
your<00:03:31.900> leads<00:03:32.769> going<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.310> your<00:03:33.430> electronics

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
your leads going to your electronics

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.039 
your leads going to your electronics
come<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.269> other<00:03:34.359> side<00:03:34.449> that's<00:03:34.959> the

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
come out the other side that's the

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.379 
come out the other side that's the
easiest<00:03:35.260> way<00:03:35.409> around<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:36.849> can<00:03:36.970> also<00:03:37.120> just

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
easiest way around you can also just

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.360 
easiest way around you can also just
solder<00:03:37.599> them<00:03:37.780> together<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.680> like<00:03:39.069> having

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
solder them together but I like having

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.059 
solder them together but I like having
access<00:03:39.669> to<00:03:39.729> be<00:03:39.940> able<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.120> unscrew<00:03:40.479> the<00:03:40.569> motors

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
access to be able to unscrew the motors

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:48.689 
access to be able to unscrew the motors
but<00:03:42.069> anyway<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.989> there's<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:48.310> can<00:03:48.489> mount

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
but anyway so there's that you can mount

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.969 
but anyway so there's that you can mount
the<00:03:48.879> electronics<00:03:49.560> anywhere<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.650> want<00:03:50.859> you

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:50.979 
the electronics anywhere you want you

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.969 
the electronics anywhere you want you
can<00:03:51.129> actually<00:03:51.250> mount<00:03:51.489> them<00:03:51.849> here<00:03:52.979> Clemente

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:53.979 
can actually mount them here Clemente

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:55.679 
can actually mount them here Clemente
who's<00:03:54.220> one<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.579> designers<00:03:55.299> of<00:03:55.510> the

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
who's one of the designers of the

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.420 
who's one of the designers of the
pressure<00:03:55.989> mendel<00:03:56.379> actually<00:03:56.709> has<00:03:56.859> his<00:03:57.069> mounted

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
pressure mendel actually has his mounted

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.409 
pressure mendel actually has his mounted
their<00:03:58.019> prashar<00:03:59.019> has<00:03:59.889> his<00:04:00.549> the<00:04:00.939> the<00:04:01.239> guy<00:04:01.359> who

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
their prashar has his the the guy who

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.089 
their prashar has his the the guy who
actually<00:04:01.659> did<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.109> original<00:04:02.319> designing<00:04:02.979> on

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
actually did the original designing on

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:06.629 
actually did the original designing on
this<00:04:03.729> he<00:04:03.939> actually<00:04:04.090> has<00:04:04.389> his<00:04:04.629> laid<00:04:04.930> flat<00:04:05.639> here

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
this he actually has his laid flat here

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.879 
this he actually has his laid flat here
and<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:07.299> think<00:04:07.359> that's<00:04:07.540> also<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.349> way<00:04:08.500> the

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
and I think that's also the way the

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.949 
and I think that's also the way the
maker<00:04:09.669> gear<00:04:10.030> kits<00:04:10.299> going<00:04:10.599> to<00:04:10.689> be<00:04:10.780> having

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
maker gear kits going to be having

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.399 
maker gear kits going to be having
there's<00:04:12.239> you<00:04:13.239> can<00:04:13.449> choose<00:04:13.659> to<00:04:13.689> mount<00:04:14.109> your

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
there's you can choose to mount your

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
power supply to the bot or you can just

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:21.870 
power supply to the bot or you can just
have<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:16.900> ran<00:04:17.380> separately<00:04:19.799> let's<00:04:20.799> see<00:04:21.039> you

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
have it ran separately let's see you

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.340 
have it ran separately let's see you
need<00:04:22.029> to<00:04:22.120> make<00:04:22.240> sure

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
need to make sure

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.100 
need to make sure
it<00:04:24.040> gives<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:24.670> directions<00:04:25.090> on<00:04:25.360> how<00:04:25.420> to<00:04:25.690> do

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
it gives you directions on how to do

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.440 
it gives you directions on how to do
your<00:04:26.620> optos<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.850> that<00:04:28.090> they<00:04:28.180> trigger

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
your optos so that they trigger

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.910 
your optos so that they trigger
correctly<00:04:31.170> one<00:04:32.170> thing<00:04:32.380> main<00:04:32.680> thing<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:32.860> need

correctly one thing main thing you need

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.950 
correctly one thing main thing you need
to<00:04:33.070> make<00:04:33.220> sure<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.670> that<00:04:33.700> you're<00:04:34.090> up<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.300> n<00:04:34.600> stop

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
to make sure is that you're up to n stop

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:43.350 
to make sure is that you're up to n stop
goes<00:04:36.480> inside<00:04:38.220> enough<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:40.770> back<00:04:41.770> up<00:04:41.950> here<00:04:42.360> so

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
goes inside enough to back up here so

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.380 
goes inside enough to back up here so
the<00:04:43.510> amount<00:04:43.630> aluminum<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.140> very<00:04:44.410> easy<00:04:44.560> to<00:04:44.710> fix

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
the amount aluminum is very easy to fix

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.890 
the amount aluminum is very easy to fix
so<00:04:46.390> you<00:04:46.480> want<00:04:46.630> your<00:04:46.750> flags<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.950> go<00:04:48.900> that

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
so you want your flags to go that

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.040 
so you want your flags to go that
resistance<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:52.240> is<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:52.750> proper

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
resistance like that that is the proper

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.200 
resistance like that that is the proper
way<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.590> I'll<00:04:54.310> go<00:04:54.340> in<00:04:54.580> stock<00:04:54.760> should<00:04:54.910> go<00:04:55.030> in

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
way and I'll go in stock should go in

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.030 
way and I'll go in stock should go in
you<00:04:56.020> should<00:04:56.200> have<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:56.470> on<00:04:56.590> each<00:04:56.710> one<00:04:56.860> year

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
you should have that on each one year

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.450 
you should have that on each one year
accesses<00:04:58.050> but<00:04:59.050> that's<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.710> electrical<00:05:00.250> set

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
accesses but that's the electrical set

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.040 
accesses but that's the electrical set
up<00:05:00.550> for<00:05:00.730> the<00:05:00.790> pressure<00:05:01.000> mendel<00:05:01.420> I<00:05:01.570> hope<00:05:01.810> this

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
up for the pressure mendel I hope this

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.880 
up for the pressure mendel I hope this
cleared<00:05:02.470> up<00:05:02.560> any<00:05:02.770> confusion<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:04.120> hand<00:05:04.650> if<00:05:05.650> I

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
cleared up any confusion you hand if I

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.740 
cleared up any confusion you hand if I
mess<00:05:06.190> this<00:05:06.220> up<00:05:06.550> in<00:05:06.700> any<00:05:06.850> way<00:05:07.030> please<00:05:07.270> comment
