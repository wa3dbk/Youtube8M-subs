00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
going to rotate through that diamond

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.320 
going to rotate through that diamond
pattern<00:00:14.040> there<00:00:14.460> since<00:00:14.730> they<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> man<00:00:15.240> on

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
pattern there since they have a man on

pattern there since they have a man on
the<00:00:15.420> crease<00:00:15.660> he's<00:00:16.619> going<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.949> stay<00:00:17.190> locked<00:00:17.609> on

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
the crease he's going to stay locked on

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.320 
the crease he's going to stay locked on
to<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.180> man<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.600> crease<00:00:20.000> if<00:00:21.000> they're

to the man on the crease if they're

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.540 
to the man on the crease if they're
motioning<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.170> they<00:00:22.289> switch<00:00:22.590> guys<00:00:22.859> he's

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
motioning and they switch guys he's

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.980 
motioning and they switch guys he's
gonna<00:00:23.670> pick<00:00:24.000> up<00:00:24.150> whoever<00:00:24.359> comes<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
gonna pick up whoever comes to the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.660 
gonna pick up whoever comes to the
crease<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.529> allow<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> other<00:00:26.130> person<00:00:26.279> to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
crease and allow the other person to

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.779 
crease and allow the other person to
rotate<00:00:27.029> out<00:00:27.830> he's<00:00:28.830> always<00:00:29.010> gonna<00:00:29.250> front<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
rotate out he's always gonna front the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.820 
rotate out he's always gonna front the
man<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> crease<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.960> normal<00:00:31.230> so

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
man on the crease just like normal so

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.120 
man on the crease just like normal so
he's<00:00:31.949> gonna<00:00:32.070> front<00:00:32.430> them<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:34.559> rotate<00:00:35.010> around

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
he's gonna front them and rotate around

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.740 
he's gonna front them and rotate around
as<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> ball<00:00:35.790> does<00:00:37.640> will<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.820> adjacent<00:00:39.420> help

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
as the ball does will have adjacent help

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.680 
as the ball does will have adjacent help
so<00:00:40.399> defenders<00:00:41.399> number<00:00:41.790> four<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.629> number

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
so defenders number four and number

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.380 
so defenders number four and number
three<00:00:43.200> are<00:00:43.440> helping<00:00:43.770> right<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.239> with<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
three are helping right now with the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
three are helping right now with the
drives<00:00:45.719> again<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.500> don't<00:00:46.710> want<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> drive<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
drives again we don't want the drive to

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610 
drives again we don't want the drive to
go<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> middle<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.629> read<00:00:49.410> that's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
go to the middle so we read that's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.619 
go to the middle so we read that's
really<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.100> even<00:00:50.399> an<00:00:50.520> option<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.210> hopefully

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
really not even an option so hopefully

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.080 
really not even an option so hopefully
we<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.780> force<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> drive<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.739> go<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
we can force the drive to go down the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.000 
we can force the drive to go down the
side<00:00:54.270> where<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.079> adjacent<00:00:55.559> help<00:00:55.739> from

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
side where we have adjacent help from

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
side where we have adjacent help from
four<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.489> also<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:59.210> the<00:01:00.210> last<00:01:00.480> man

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
four and also just like the the last man

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.160 
four and also just like the the last man
down<00:01:01.320> defense<00:01:01.890> our<00:01:02.550> sliders<00:01:03.239> our<00:01:03.539> fire<00:01:03.780> guys

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
down defense our sliders our fire guys

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740 
down defense our sliders our fire guys
are<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.729> bottom<00:01:06.090> two<00:01:06.270> defenders

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
are going to be the bottom two defenders

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.940 
are going to be the bottom two defenders
that<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> only<00:01:07.590> ones<00:01:07.860> who

gonna be the ones who slide so as it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.870 
gonna be the ones who slide so as it
goes<00:01:12.570> through<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> first<00:01:13.080> time<00:01:13.610> it's<00:01:14.610> just

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
goes through the first time it's just

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
goes through the first time it's just
our<00:01:15.030> normal<00:01:15.240> rotation<00:01:17.960> our<00:01:18.960> normal<00:01:19.409> rotation
