does just allow the air to circulate

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.890 
does just allow the air to circulate
inside<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:15.190> tent<00:01:15.430> creating<00:01:16.060> a<00:01:16.150> nicer<00:01:16.450> climate

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
inside the tent creating a nicer climate

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.120 
inside the tent creating a nicer climate
and<00:01:17.200> make<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.530> bit<00:01:17.650> more<00:01:17.680> comfortable

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
and make it a bit more comfortable

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.840

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.780 
makes it nice and easy to get in and out
of<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.840> tent<00:01:41.080> so<00:01:41.710> they<00:01:41.950> flying<00:01:42.280> out<00:01:42.460> on<00:01:42.580> here

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
of the tent so they flying out on here

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.670 
of the tent so they flying out on here
as<00:01:42.940> well<00:01:43.150> so<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.450> just<00:01:43.720> stops<00:01:43.870> any<00:01:44.080> bugs<00:01:44.560> or

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
as well so that just stops any bugs or

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.740 
as well so that just stops any bugs or
anything<00:01:44.979> getting<00:01:45.130> in<00:01:45.340> keeping<00:01:46.299> again<00:01:46.570> nice

style<00:01:49.810> groundsheet<00:01:50.440> inside<00:01:50.770> here<00:01:50.979> so<00:01:51.100> this

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
style groundsheet inside here so this

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.010 
style groundsheet inside here so this
just<00:01:51.340> curves<00:01:51.640> up<00:01:51.790> around<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.210> corners<00:01:52.630> and

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
just curves up around the corners and

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.560 
just curves up around the corners and
around<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.350> sides<00:01:53.619> sown<00:01:54.549> straight<00:01:55.000> into<00:01:55.420> the

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
sleeping pod itself just again stops any

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.080 
sleeping pod itself just again stops any

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
of its features this material actually

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.550 
of its features this material actually
has<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.100> 5000<00:02:27.880> hydrostatic<00:02:28.480> head<00:02:28.510> rating<00:02:29.110> which

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
has a 5000 hydrostatic head rating which

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.170 
has a 5000 hydrostatic head rating which
is<00:02:29.710> nearly<00:02:29.920> double<00:02:30.190> what<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:30.790> tend<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.000> find

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
virginity and in that tunnel design

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.050 
virginity and in that tunnel design
readers<00:02:39.940> maximize<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.570> space<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.080> inside
