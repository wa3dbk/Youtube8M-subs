00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.700
Hi everyone!

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:15.780
I'm going to introduce my top 5 of best beauty products 2014.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.060
No.5 is... 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.300
evolutionary liquid products, such as cream cheek blush by Majorica Majorca,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.860
and cream foundation by Esprique.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.440
Previously, cheek blush had only powder type but now there is cream type,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.160
in the same way, now the foundation has new kind of texture like this one.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.720
So this year, I paid attention to these evolutionary liquid items.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.720
I think it is good for moisturizing skin.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
That was my No.5.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.680
No.4 is... red lips.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.920
This one is "Lip Tint Water Raspberry Red" by Cats Face.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.420
And this is "Jewelry Gloss Red 01" by Ettusais.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.700
Both of these colors are really red, and I think it was this year's trend.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.560
So that was No.4.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.480
No.3 is...

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.660
Facial Treatment by SKâ…¡.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.100
This is a set of toning lotion and treatment essence.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.280
First, toning lotion exfoliates the dead skin cells and prepares the face.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.680
And then treatment essence absorbs deeply into your skin and helps improve your clear skin.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.300
This double treatment works really good.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.380
These were very good for my dry skin and my favorite.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.040
No.2 is...

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200
CC Cream.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.640
There were only "BB cream" last year, but this year new "CC cream" came in.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.200
CC cream is a moisturizer added version of BB cream.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.080
I think this CC cream was a hit item of 2014.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.380
No.1 is...

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.460
"Oil Essence" by Trinity.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.760
Actually, beauty oil is the most useful product you should have in your beauty routine at least one.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.340
You can use it not only for facial care, but for hair and body cares also.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.360
Of course it is good for dry skin like me, but even for oily skins and skin troubles,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.520
the oil hydrates your skin and it really works.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.640
That's all for my best beauty products 2014.
