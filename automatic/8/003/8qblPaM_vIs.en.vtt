00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.990
 let's see now how to put them 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.970
 after that we open the good first 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.970
 that nothing will move the skins 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.750
 is worth for example the downloads you 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.780
 appear in download what are those that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.040
 you open downloads and 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.659
 I do not know, let's give an example 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.420
 select the skin and move it to 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.080
 The data of the tour is in 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.720
 android data and we look for it here is 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.670
 but if it does not find in the folder of 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.379
 data first there will be in the why tour and 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.780
 they close it again so that the folder 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.790
 of data is created 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.569
 then we put the skin in the folder 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.930
 skins here is I already have several here 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.220
 are all I have once 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.810
 once having done this 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.810
 we open the tulle 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.970
 we go to turkey 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.970
 and to change textures or skins 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.490
 good we select the skin they want 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.980
 a little bit will all be selected 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.330
 this 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.330
 they start using skin 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.410
 then they give in 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.410
 in applying changes 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.270
 will tell you to wait for you because you have 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.040
 to install the minecraft 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.390

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.010

 10 install is installed because put 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.580
 I'm recording the cell phone you put a 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.740
 bit slower but you do not think that 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.270
 lasts more than a minute 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.270
 it will be less minutes com 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.130

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.600
