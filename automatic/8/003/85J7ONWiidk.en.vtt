00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
done t-rex right everybody then the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.850 
done t-rex right everybody then the
champ<00:02:44.160> Rex<00:02:44.430> he<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.269> trained<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.050> TRX<00:02:46.560> he's

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860

a<00:02:46.890> monster<00:02:47.310> oh<00:02:49.459> yeah<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.489> like<00:02:50.940> that

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.880 

I<00:02:56.600> guess<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.780> focus<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.590> keep<00:02:58.740> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
I guess the focus is to keep the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.410 
I guess the focus is to keep the
stability<00:02:59.340> because<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.700> feel<00:02:59.910> like<00:02:59.940> doing<00:03:00.300> this

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
stability because I feel like doing this
