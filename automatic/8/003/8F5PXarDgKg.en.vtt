00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
and you just young keep bouncing between

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.089 
and you just young keep bouncing between
these<00:03:30.759> things<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.349> using<00:03:32.349> this<00:03:32.470> method<00:03:32.889> i<00:03:32.979> was

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
these things so using this method i was

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.339 
these things so using this method i was
able<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.340> get<00:03:33.609> this<00:03:33.849> and<00:03:34.150> i'm<00:03:34.479> probably<00:03:35.139> about

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
able to get this and i'm probably about

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.729 
able to get this and i'm probably about
an<00:03:35.500> hour<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.889> i<00:03:35.919> had<00:03:36.069> like<00:03:36.189> 13<00:03:36.759> grab<00:03:36.970> kills

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
an hour and i had like 13 grab kills

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.469 
an hour and i had like 13 grab kills
beforehand<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:38.889> i<00:03:39.009> hit<00:03:39.280> 250<00:03:40.000> in<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.209> middle

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479 
beforehand and i hit 250 in the middle

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.229 
beforehand and i hit 250 in the middle
of<00:03:40.629> the<00:03:41.049> game<00:03:41.199> after<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.889> or<00:03:42.669> this<00:03:42.939> was<00:03:43.120> like

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
of the game after this or this was like

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.869 
of the game after this or this was like
my<00:03:43.419> second<00:03:44.079> or<00:03:44.199> third<00:03:44.409> game<00:03:44.439> i<00:03:44.769> think<00:03:44.799> so<00:03:45.759> it

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
my second or third game i think so it

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.719 
my second or third game i think so it
really<00:03:46.030> doesn't<00:03:46.209> take<00:03:46.389> that<00:03:46.540> long<00:03:46.599> at<00:03:46.900> all<00:03:46.989> and

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
really doesn't take that long at all and

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.219 
really doesn't take that long at all and
you<00:03:48.729> know<00:03:48.819> it's<00:03:48.970> it's<00:03:49.269> kind<00:03:49.599> of<00:03:49.629> nice<00:03:49.750> for<00:03:50.079> the

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
you know it's it's kind of nice for the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.899 
you know it's it's kind of nice for the
solo<00:03:50.530> mastery<00:03:50.979> it's<00:03:51.129> kind<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.310> nice<00:03:51.430> for<00:03:51.729> you

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
like that but i mean the main thing is

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.780 
like that but i mean the main thing is
to<00:03:59.319> just<00:03:59.439> hop<00:03:59.739> around<00:03:59.979> cover<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.400> if<00:04:00.459> you<00:04:00.549> see

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
to just hop around cover and if you see

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.360
