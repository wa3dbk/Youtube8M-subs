00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.800
 hello friends welcome to be a drama 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.440
 My name is seen in his rodrÃ­guez 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.910
 today's class we're going to see the flan accent 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.910
 let's see what it is 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.060
 here 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.570
 look friends the flan axel is the 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.629
 combination of the simple vale with the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.449
 flan in the first of every three 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.800
 let's say it would be right left 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.960
 Right left right and left 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:13.610
 will know a triplet worth between stamps 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:15.500
 eighth note 1 2 3 1 2 3 3 1 2 3 points at 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.140
 What happens is that what we do 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.110
 is that we put the flan in the first 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.149
 of every three and we emphasize the first in 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.229
 this case would be like this 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.229
 1 2 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.530
 2. 3 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.189
 apart from that it will also carry what 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.369
 would be hand positions for example if 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.520
 we do this here would be a 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.110
 down stroke the flan when lowering it would be 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.539
 down stroke apps stroud stroud so 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.820
 so much we would be prepared our 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.179
 left hand to give the next 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.290
 plan packs of friends we're going to start 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:01.930
 slowly making the flan would be 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.010
 flame with the danish truck 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.010
 estruch 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.200
 tap stroke and we would be ready 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.970
 here our left hand 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.020
 the flan dan stroke 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.480
 up stroke 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.550
 and tap stroke so I would not go back 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.490
 again to be ready 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:31.900
 this would be one two three 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.900
 12 31 23 12 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.440
 let's see it now in more detail 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.920
 putting our foot on the first of 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.920
 every three 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.520
 good friends then then we are going to 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.230
 explain a little more in detail this 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.080
 performance that for us is 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.700
 quite important and that has 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.480
 many, many, many applications 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.450
 both inside the box and inside 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.430
 our team 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.170
 when I mean to put your foot in the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.720
 first of every three is that we 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.390
 We will always be marking our 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.760
 black with the left foot then in 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.310
 this case clear when we do 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.890
 the flan our left foot is going to 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.130
 coincide exactly with the strong in 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.360
 this case the one that makes the down is worth 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.360
 then it would be such that 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.110
 when we have the change of 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.170
 hand because being 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.840
 1 2 and 3 is exactly going to be 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.570
 our left hand up to 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.100
 we go back again to start the 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:46.710
 1-2-3 that's why it's hand change in 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:57.380
 this case would be a 2 3 1 2 3 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:57.380
 if we repeat it from space it would be a 23.2 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.099
 well you have to be quite attentive with 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.739
 this kind of rudiments good with all 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:10.159
 in general but with this here we 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.329
 let's explore the field of videos 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.639
 previous ones in which we 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:19.579
 we explain what the down tap up and the full 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:25.820
 in this case we here what we're going 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:28.370
 to see is the down stroke the up stroke and 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.960
 The tap stroke are quite important 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.620
 because they are going to do us 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.449
 save energy so much that for us 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.699
 it is very important and especially since the 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.220
 touch relaxed remember that always 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.680
 I say playing relaxed both when 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.080
 We are touching our box like when 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.110
 we are touching all our 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.810
 team 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.400
 so, as always , we're going 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.180
 to start at 50 and we'll take it to 100 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.270
 Obviously this can be done 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.250
 much more but for you to do it 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.980
 you see well we are going to do it 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:07.220
 here I will do it directly 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.220
 in the box, let's see it in detail 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.400
 ah 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.420
 good friends so up to here the 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.640
 today's exercise we have caught and we have 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.030
 made a very good rhythm very simple 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.190
 so you can see more or less as you see 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.710
 could apply only in the box 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.080
 remind you that we will soon get a 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.540
 section where the rudiments we 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.700
 we will carry them throughout the kit so 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.250
 do not despair I think that first at 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.820
 principle we should catch then all 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.550
 these rudiments irles removing therefore the 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:37.600
 juice they deserve and then take them 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:40.570
 to all our kit before finishing me 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.010
 I would like to thank as always as a 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.640
 all the people who follow us on youtube 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.260

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.330
 percussionists and good as not about 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.700
