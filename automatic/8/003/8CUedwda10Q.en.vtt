00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.330
 Well let's start a series of 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.400
 video classes 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.400
 in 80 the intention here is to create several 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.880
 video lessons starting at zero 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:31.510
 starting from the installation going to the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:38.300
 dns services the file server 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:42.290
 gppo backup covering a series of 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.239
 2008 services then let's go 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.160
 start here from scratch you can see that 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.720
 My virtual machine here I am 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:55.839
 using virtualbox is empty 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:01:04.269
 create a new chamack machine from 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:04.269
 2008 server I'm going to change down here 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.820
 windows 2008 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.220
 he asks me for 500 of 512 mega memory 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.890
 but I'm going to put here 1.024 giga button 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.820
 create a new virtual disk I'll ask 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.510
 to create 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.390
 I will use this virtual standard hardy said 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.670
 What if I go to any other? 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.700
 type of virtual machine it will pick up 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.760
 be sold was either virtual pc or 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.660
 any other it will work so 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.720
 next 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.940
 the next is that the size of the disk I 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.210
 I can let these 25 even say I will. 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.210
 create 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:59.280
 now done this I go in settings 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:04.619
 here on my disk storage I go 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:11.200
 get the picture of my 2008 soon 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:15.870
 here ready 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.870
 He will come up there with the image 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.660
 good comes on the screen and installation 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.680
 installation is very quiet choose the 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.110
 language to install now is one 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.730
 installation similar to windows vista 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:59.319
 windows 7 there is no type of 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.280
 difficulty in this regard is not only 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.160
 wait 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:09.250
 We start the installation here. 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.340
 here i am choosing the version 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.349
 standard that the simplest version is 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.890
 in that a standard there the 32-bit version 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.140
 you can have your 64 bit because the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.030
 people will see here it will not do 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.579
 difference since we will not treat 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.470
 of ripper vi no other technology 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:34.450
 need 64-bit here 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.170
 So here's the record, I'm not going. 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.170
 I'm going to use it all here right here 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.170
 advance 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.600
 and now just wait for the installation 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 concludes 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.989
 it's good to finish setup 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.329
 This is the first screen he will give you. 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.750
 ask to register a password 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.430
 for the first time the osÃ³rio user 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:15.239
 administrator 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:19.979
 so I 'm going to put a password that 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:24.479
 any or click who will say that the 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:29.100
 password has been successfully changed and now it 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:31.610
 will load the settings from our 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.610
 server 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:40.320
 so it's there he carried it's the first 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.000
 window that we will set up and with 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.479
 This concludes our first video that 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.479
 the installation
