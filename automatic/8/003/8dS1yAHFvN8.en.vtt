00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
mileage so what I did is I would just

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.190 
mileage so what I did is I would just
shift<00:02:53.560> at<00:02:53.770> 4000<00:02:54.310> rpm<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:55.480> be<00:02:55.570> pretty<00:02:55.750> mellow

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
know just go through the gears and you

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.430 
know just go through the gears and you
can<00:03:01.030> do<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.360> pretty<00:03:01.630> good<00:03:01.720> number<00:03:01.990> pretty

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.230 

first<00:03:47.870> 10<00:03:48.080> miles<00:03:48.290> on<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.500> bike<00:03:48.740> is<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.730> little

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
first 10 miles on the bike is a little

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.180 
first 10 miles on the bike is a little
bit<00:03:50.330> unusual<00:03:50.690> because<00:03:51.050> I'm<00:03:51.560> used<00:03:51.860> to<00:03:51.920> clutch

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
bit unusual because I'm used to clutch

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.420 
bit unusual because I'm used to clutch
until<00:03:53.090> first<00:03:53.600> time<00:03:53.810> new<00:03:54.320> bike<00:03:54.530> no<00:03:54.890> clutch<00:03:55.160> and

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
until first time new bike no clutch and

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.830 
until first time new bike no clutch and
that<00:03:55.670> was<00:03:55.790> really<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.360> little<00:03:56.540> bit<00:03:56.690> unusual

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
that was really a little bit unusual

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.990 
that was really a little bit unusual
bike<00:03:57.710> ran<00:03:57.920> great<00:03:58.100> those<00:03:58.310> handles<00:03:58.730> real

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
bike ran great those handles real

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.520 
bike ran great those handles real
lightweight<00:03:59.390> they're<00:03:59.810> real<00:04:00.020> low<00:04:00.200> center<00:04:00.500> of

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
lightweight they're real low center of

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.740 
lightweight they're real low center of
gravity<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:01.100> just<00:04:01.250> clicks<00:04:01.460> around

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750
