00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 So you have downloaded to Jesse and 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.810
 you want to create a graphic adventure but 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.030
 where to start note before you start 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.700
 it is important that you keep in mind that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.460
 this tutorial was done with version 3.0 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.250
 of ax in mind if you have a new 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.240
 version there may be small 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.920
 inconsistencies in catches of 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.990
 screen where they may have 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.029
 added additional options or some 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 modification but most of what 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.560
 it says in this tutorial it should be 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.330
 applicable also to the new version 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.099
 creating the game starts the editor of 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.530
 axa by double clicking on the file 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.480
 I agreed thor point exe and should of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.690
 the welcome screen appears as 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.100
 the one shown in this image 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.410
 make sure you select start and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.969
 in game and click continue 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.980
 then you will be shown the 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.350
 assistant for the creation of a game 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.480
 New Now click next and you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.460
 you will find the selection screen 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.890
 of templates here you must select 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.910
 what template will you use for the creation of 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.739
 your game 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.899
 acz has three templates incorporated 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.010
 although you can find more in the forums 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.049
 of hacks 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.850
 the ford template in play by 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.070
 defect will be what we will use in this 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.930
 tutorial since it is accompanied with 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.330
 some graphics that will allow us 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.369
 start quickly with the edition the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.320
 template is still in empty play is the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.539
 type of template that you want to use 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.729
 Once you are already familiar with ac 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.460
 it's an empty form that just brings 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.710
 built-in graphics selects from folk 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.659
 danger click on next has arrived 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.850
 moment to decide how you want to 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.890
 your game in the first field you can 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.350
 write the full name of your game 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.569
 this name will be displayed in the bar 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.759
 title when the game runs in a 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.770
 window and will also be used for other 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.960
 things that will be explained later 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.179
 for the purposes of this tutorial 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.310
 let's head the game rogers 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.830
 adventure although you can use the name 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.659
 that you want the second field 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.030
 corresponds to the name of the file of your 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.039
 game this name will only be used to 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.530
 name the game folder and name 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.750
 of the exe file when you buy it 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.369
 the third field allows you to tell 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 apps in which directory you want to save 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.229
 the files of your game the directory 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.050
 used by default is my documents and 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.150
 I'll leave it for the beam tutorial 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.100
 click on the finish button and after a few 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.080
 seconds you should meet the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.390
 Main screen of the jacques editor 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.630
 here you have your game ready for the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.520
 editing starting the easiest mode and 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.620
 practical to move in the editor is 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.600
 use the project tree that is the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.760
 box that is located on the corner 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.739
 top right of the editor which will 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.350
 allows access to different parts 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.330
 of your game we will quickly start 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.430
 placing us at the beginning of the list and 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.769
 double- clicking on general settings 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.140
 In the image you can see three of the 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.930
 main functions of the editor 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.000
 the project tree project 3 as already 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.400
 mentioned above gives you access to 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.590
 the different parts of your game the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.750
 property grid property grid in 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.610
 the bottom left corner of the editor 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.640
 is where you access the properties 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.709
 specific to each element is not used 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.690
 in the game settings window but we'll see 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.250
 and we will explain its usefulness later 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.440
 finally the app editor allows you 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.690
 have several windows open at the same 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.550
 time are placed in the form of eyelashes 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.470
 in the bar open windows in the part 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.170
 top so you can move between 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.970
 they easily use the close button 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.940
 to close a window once 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.920
 you have finished using it now we are going to 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.600
 concentrate on the panel settings and 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.720
 let's examine above the 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.070
 different options that shows us 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.739
 make sure that these options are 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.020
 enabled in speak of bad mode as 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.090
 let's start to develop a game 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.570
 we want to have the assistance of the divaga 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.340
 in the game engine this will allow you 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.840
 teleport to other rooms 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.420
 dispose of all the objects of the game 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.800
 in your inventory and so on in order to 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.750
 do tests and check that everything 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.670
 It works well 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.739
 you must remember to disable this 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.930
 option when you are going to compile the game 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.420
 in atlantic law mod 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.780
 if you do not activate this option the movement 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.790
 of the character will be strange pixel perfect 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.709
 click detection improves the gameplay 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.600
 making clicks in parts 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.330
 transparent objects not the 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.130
 activen characters turn for walking 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.110
 if the character is looking at the 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.000
 left and click to move 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.739
 on the right this option will make the 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.470
 character turns around before 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.360
 start to walk this option is used 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.770
 for the games of sierra and lucasarts and 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.220
 will give your game one more touch 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.290
 personally personally always active 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.810
 these four options when I start to 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.030
 create a game once you meet 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.800
 c's you'll know which options fit the most 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.510
 to the type of game you want to create and 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.210
 you can deactivate the ones you do not want 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.280
 use color selection has come the 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.090
 moment to decide if we want to create a 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.890
 game based on 8-bit color palette 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.190
 256 colors or a game with high 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.320
 color resolution 16 or 32 bits the 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.240
 advantages of using the color palette is 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.130
 that the game will have a smaller size and 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.200
 that will run up to 2 times more 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.150
 quick that if you use high colors 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.890
 resolution 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.960
 using palette you can also use the 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.540
 effects of neal baddin and color kick link 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.950
 The advantage of using high colors 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.080
 resolution is that you do not have to 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.360
 bother to adapt your graphics to the 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.440
 Game colors simply matter 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.760
 your graphics and they work 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.740
 giving a game to 256 colors double beam 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.590
 click on colors inside the tree 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.610
 projects you should see a screen like 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.220
 this the editor shows a grid with 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.740
 256 slots for colors the first 40 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.720
 colors are game wide what it means 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.610
 that those slots in the palette will have a 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.880
 fixed color throughout the game 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.430
 on any screen the rest of the slots 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.350
 marked with an x are colors of 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.540
 background background and they vary from screen to 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.300
 screen this allows us to different 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.210
 types of funds use different ranges of 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.970
 color the palette settings by 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.770
 defect is not very compensated tube and you 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.630
 main character have to use 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.610
 game white colors as they will be 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.370
 present on all screens of the 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.350
 game so unless you want a 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.240
 grayscale character the 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.930
 default colors that are the ones that 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.580
 shown in the picture are not enough 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.100
 so let's add some colors 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.990
 in white select the first x 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.940
 after the colors and keeping 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.350
 press the shift key click on the 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.690
 last x of the row with the number 8 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.700
 You should see something like what 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.710
 It shows in the next image now 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.570
 we are going to explain the utility of 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.910
 property grid property grid 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.860
 change the bar time color one 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.010
 gameboy and you'll see how the slots 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.810
 selected changes from x to colors if 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.330
 you select any of the colors 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.490
 you will see its corresponding rgb number in 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.130
 the property grid where you can 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.140
 adjust the color of said slide if not 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.660
 you want to do this operation manually 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.450
 with each color you can define the slots 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.760
 42 to 95 through a program of 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.370
 drawing or editing of saved images 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.230
 as a bmp file right click 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.270
 in the selected slots and choose 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.550
 replace selected slots from file 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.130
 replace the selected slots from 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.140
 file what colors to use that gives your 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.230
 choice and will depend on which scheme of 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:16.420
 colors you use in your graphics we return to 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.880
 game settings panel look at the 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.800
 first option of the color list there 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.410
 You can select the depth of 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.330
 color desired message appears 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.120
 notice to know if you are sure of the 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.860
 change confirms and you're ready to 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.349
 continue with the edition 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.569
 resolution of the game having decided 

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:36.550
 the color depth the next 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:38.080
 decision that we have to make has to 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.840
 see with the resolution to which 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.030
 will run the game the most resolutions 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.919
 high will allow you to have more graphics 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.080
 detailed but will also require more 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:49.000
 memory and will run slower than
