00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.540
 hello little friends and little friends of magic os 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.670
 I bring a curious video a video 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.890
 curious about curious and casual things 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.560
 that I found on the magic to which 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.170
 I liked to call them curiosities 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.029
 words that I've invented that we're going to 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.270
 do and that comes from mixing curiosity 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.030
 to happen actually this is a 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.610
 well and everything I'm going to patent the good 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.800
 the concept is the following you knew that 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.579
 there are letters with the exact name of 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.949
 some magnification of magic then if 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.870
 exist to this day there are exactly 11 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.929
 I thought there was one or two but you 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.059
 you put to look and america is many things 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:55.090
 Here I leave you simply without more and for 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.000
 alphabetical order are these apocalypse 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.839
 there you have the letter and there is the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.170
 enlargement cool snap there is the letter 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.770
 there is curious expansion there will be some 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.560
 cult meaning can 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.750
 with flush there is the letter and the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.060
 expansion there is not so long ago that 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.600
 he left 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.100
 future 6 great expansion but you knew that 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.100
 there was the letter in blue 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.750
 morning times another good extension but 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.750
 I met that this sun 0 and white 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.370
 house lounge another good extension all 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.290
 the extensions are good have their 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.050
 funny letters and their letters less 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.909
 players but they are all good this is 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.130
 another good example 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.829
 plan chaos there you have it 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.229
 red enchantment that went out in court 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.090
 but that has the same name as its the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.189
 extension named own 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.500
 said funny prophecy there you have it 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.869
 native land letter has already rained from 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.390
 this and years and years and years after 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.799
 they decided to take out an extension called 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.799
 prophecy what a curious truth 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.830
 time spiral in goddess saga brought out the 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.760
 blue spell and after a few 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.890
 take decades expanding more and 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.220
 the chances I would say 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.080
 another other that such a dance looks at 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.880
 how much is the letter and look when it came out 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.630
 the enlargement 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.480
 certainly bad is good 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.750
 and finally, vision is a letter from 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.790
 law ens there are you have are 11 a day of 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.380
 today there is no one else who knows if within 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.550
 two or three years they take out another one that is called 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.950
 just like a letter that you have to look for 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.980
 in the historical archives of letters of 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.590
 magic when it happens we will update the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.450
