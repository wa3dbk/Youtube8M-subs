00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
craft replica I've been working on

00:00:23.460 --> 00:01:03.780 
craft replica I've been working on
recently

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.910 

so<00:01:04.790> I<00:01:04.820> started<00:01:05.360> off<00:01:05.570> with<00:01:05.900> making<00:01:06.530> small

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
so I started off with making small

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.250 
so I started off with making small
models<00:01:07.370> of<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.760> parts<00:01:08.120> that<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:08.390> used<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.110> make

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
models of the parts that I used to make

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.470 
models of the parts that I used to make
the<00:01:09.440> final<00:01:09.680> project<00:01:10.310> then<00:01:10.940> took<00:01:11.180> all<00:01:11.360> the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
the final project then took all the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.570 
the final project then took all the
measurements<00:01:12.050> and<00:01:12.170> sizes<00:01:12.680> into<00:01:12.920> Photoshop

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
measurements and sizes into Photoshop

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:25.900 
measurements and sizes into Photoshop
the<00:01:14.540> first<00:01:14.810> page<00:01:15.140> was<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:23.479> on<00:01:24.310> then<00:01:25.310> after

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
the first page was and so on then after

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.290 
the first page was and so on then after
I've<00:01:26.060> made<00:01:26.360> some<00:01:26.600> tests<00:01:27.430> I've<00:01:28.430> putted<00:01:28.940> off<00:01:29.150> the

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
I've made some tests I've putted off the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.450 
I've made some tests I've putted off the
final<00:01:29.570> pages<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.470> stopped<00:01:30.770> them<00:01:30.950> together<00:01:31.100> to

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
final pages and stopped them together to

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.730 
final pages and stopped them together to
make<00:01:31.610> final<00:01:31.910> project<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.990> biggest<00:01:36.170> problems

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
make final project the biggest problems

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.520 
make final project the biggest problems
I<00:01:36.920> had<00:01:37.160> was<00:01:37.700> size<00:01:38.119> because<00:01:39.020> it's<00:01:39.140> hard<00:01:39.380> to

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
I had was size because it's hard to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.120 
I had was size because it's hard to
determine<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.640> exact<00:01:41.320> measurements<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.979> your

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
determine the exact measurements to your

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.340 
determine the exact measurements to your
left<00:01:43.310> or<00:01:43.460> right<00:01:43.520> hands<00:01:44.210> for<00:01:44.509> an<00:01:44.600> object<00:01:44.780> from<00:01:45.229> a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
left or right hands for an object from a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.999 
left or right hands for an object from a
game<00:01:45.590> or<00:01:45.920> film<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:47.630> second<00:01:48.050> problem<00:01:48.680> I<00:01:48.770> had

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
game or film the second problem I had

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.330 
game or film the second problem I had
was<00:01:49.460> size<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.570> buttons<00:01:51.100> every<00:01:52.100> time<00:01:52.130> I

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
was size of the buttons every time I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.279 
was size of the buttons every time I
made<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.759> nets<00:01:53.030> for<00:01:53.360> them<00:01:53.600> they<00:01:53.750> either<00:01:53.929> came

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
made the nets for them they either came

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.889 
made the nets for them they either came
out<00:01:54.500> too<00:01:54.740> small<00:01:55.070> or<00:01:55.280> too<00:01:55.340> big<00:01:55.910> or<00:01:56.210> just<00:01:56.570> didn't

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
out too small or too big or just didn't

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.810 
out too small or too big or just didn't
look<00:01:57.050> right<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.890> way<00:02:01.039> you<00:02:01.070> can<00:02:01.369> make<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.640> look

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
look right the way you can make it look

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.169 
look right the way you can make it look
relatively<00:02:02.360> realistic<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.619> by<00:02:03.920> taking<00:02:04.399> an<00:02:04.580> LED

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179
