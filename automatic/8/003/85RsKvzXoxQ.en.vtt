just<00:00:49.390> enough<00:00:49.660> to<00:00:49.900> make<00:00:50.620> sure<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:50.830> big<00:00:51.010> gust<00:00:51.220> of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
just enough to make sure a big gust of

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.510 
just enough to make sure a big gust of
wind<00:00:51.489> didn't<00:00:51.730> come<00:00:51.910> by<00:00:52.090> and<00:00:52.239> take<00:00:53.020> it<00:00:53.520> so

the porch area and under the whole tent
obviously<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.860> don't<00:01:08.950> where<00:01:09.490> this<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:09.880> put<00:01:10.119> on

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
obviously you don't where this is put on

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.850 
obviously you don't where this is put on
grass<00:01:10.539> you<00:01:10.899> don't<00:01:11.080> need<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.380> floor<00:01:11.590> but<00:01:11.740> I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
grass you don't need the floor but I

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.710 
grass you don't need the floor but I
wanted<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.550> just<00:01:12.700> make<00:01:13.149> sure<00:01:13.180> everything<00:01:13.630> is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
wanted to just make sure everything is

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.650 
wanted to just make sure everything is
what<00:01:13.899> I<00:01:13.930> expected<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.530> be<00:01:14.590> I<00:01:15.479> put<00:01:16.479> in<00:01:16.570> a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
what I expected it to be I put in a

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.010 
what I expected it to be I put in a
window<00:01:16.930> here<00:01:17.289> or<00:01:17.979> I<00:01:18.039> had<00:01:18.220> them<00:01:18.430> do<00:01:18.580> it<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:19.020> one

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
window here or I had them do it and one

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.260 
window here or I had them do it and one
kitty<00:01:20.259> corner<00:01:20.500> if<00:01:21.399> I<00:01:21.580> were<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.820> do<00:01:21.940> it<00:01:21.970> again<00:01:22.090> I

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
kitty corner if I were to do it again I

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.789 
kitty corner if I were to do it again I
probably<00:01:22.509> would<00:01:22.780> have<00:01:22.810> added<00:01:23.080> another<00:01:23.500> one<00:01:23.590> in

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
probably would have added another one in

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.929 
probably would have added another one in
the<00:01:23.890> middle<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.280> another<00:01:24.400> one<00:01:24.729> in<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:24.880> middle

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
the middle and another one in the middle

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.480 
the middle and another one in the middle
here<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:26.380> reason<00:01:26.560> why<00:01:26.770> not<00:01:26.979> on<00:01:27.100> that<00:01:27.250> end

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
here and the reason why not on that end

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.149 
here and the reason why not on that end
is<00:01:27.640> because<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:29.020> tent<00:01:29.260> stove<00:01:29.439> goes<00:01:29.650> over<00:01:29.890> here

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
is because the tent stove goes over here

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.510 
is because the tent stove goes over here
this<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.549> fire<00:01:30.880> mat<00:01:31.150> silicone<00:01:31.630> fire<00:01:31.840> mat<00:01:32.049> and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
this is a fire mat silicone fire mat and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020 
this is a fire mat silicone fire mat and
there's<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.580> stove<00:01:33.939> jack<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:35.670> hanging<00:01:36.670> up<00:01:36.790> I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
there's a stove jack and so hanging up I

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.609 
there's a stove jack and so hanging up I
have<00:01:37.509> this<00:01:37.840> pocket<00:01:38.740> organizer<00:01:38.890> thing<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:40.619> added

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
have this pocket organizer thing I added

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.100 
have this pocket organizer thing I added
extra<00:01:42.009> angles<00:01:42.759> into<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.299> tent<00:01:43.509> meaning<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:43.930> got

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
extra angles into the tent meaning I got

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.080 
extra angles into the tent meaning I got
one<00:01:44.350> extra<00:01:44.500> set<00:01:44.890> of<00:01:44.920> rafters<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.700> legs<00:01:45.880> and

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
one extra set of rafters and legs and

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.270 
one extra set of rafters and legs and
everything<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.380> that's<00:01:47.500> why<00:01:47.770> this<00:01:47.830> doesn't

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
everything so that's why this doesn't

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.929 
everything so that's why this doesn't
fit<00:01:48.670> necessarily<00:01:49.450> that's<00:01:50.140> all<00:01:50.350> right<00:01:50.939> I'm

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
fit necessarily that's all right I'm

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.539 
fit necessarily that's all right I'm
sure<00:01:52.000> if<00:01:52.270> I<00:01:52.360> were<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.570> call<00:01:52.720> them<00:01:52.930> they<00:01:53.049> would

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
sure if I were to call them they would

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.609 
sure if I were to call them they would
give<00:01:54.549> me<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.759> new<00:01:54.909> one<00:01:54.939> smaller<00:01:55.450> but<00:01:55.750> it's<00:01:56.259> fine

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
give me a new one smaller but it's fine

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.679 
give me a new one smaller but it's fine
I'm<00:01:56.920> not<00:01:57.100> worried<00:01:57.369> about<00:01:57.400> it<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:58.420> smaller

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
I'm not worried about it the smaller

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.550 
I'm not worried about it the smaller
version<00:01:59.079> obviously<00:01:59.200> does<00:01:59.770> fit<00:02:00.040> just<00:02:00.220> fine

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
version obviously does fit just fine

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.080 
version obviously does fit just fine
there's<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.740> sod<00:02:02.979> cloth<00:02:03.310> right<00:02:03.579> here<00:02:03.880> along

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
there's the sod cloth right here along

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.370 
there's the sod cloth right here along
the<00:02:04.270> bottom<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.479> don't<00:02:07.630> have<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:08.019> use<00:02:08.170> this

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
the bottom so you don't have to use this

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.600 
the bottom so you don't have to use this
floor<00:02:08.739> and<00:02:10.739> we're<00:02:11.739> about<00:02:11.799> five<00:02:12.130> feet<00:02:12.310> tall<00:02:12.579> I

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
floor and we're about five feet tall I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.550 
floor and we're about five feet tall I
believe<00:02:12.940> over<00:02:13.120> here<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.140> can't<00:02:14.380> remember

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
believe over here and I can't remember

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.250 
believe over here and I can't remember
maybe<00:02:14.890> 9<00:02:15.160> feet<00:02:15.430> or<00:02:15.549> so<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.030> center<00:02:16.329> nine

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
maybe 9 feet or so in the center nine

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.729 
maybe 9 feet or so in the center nine
and<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.440> half<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.920> don't<00:02:18.190> think<00:02:18.400> it's<00:02:18.519> ten<00:02:19.739> but

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
and a half I don't think it's ten but

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.500 
and a half I don't think it's ten but
it's<00:02:20.860> plenty<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.250> headroom<00:02:21.370> for<00:02:21.579> me<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.060> I'm<00:02:22.120> a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
it's plenty of headroom for me and I'm a

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.430 
it's plenty of headroom for me and I'm a
little<00:02:22.630> over<00:02:22.900> 6<00:02:23.110> foot<00:02:23.290> 6<00:02:23.530> 1<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.450> did<00:02:26.170> put<00:02:26.410> a

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
little over 6 foot 6 1 so I did put a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.559 
little over 6 foot 6 1 so I did put a
door<00:02:26.739> on<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:27.040> front<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.849> back<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.390> can

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
door on the front and the back so I can

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.320 
door on the front and the back so I can
get<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.720> nice<00:02:28.930> cross-breeze<00:02:29.319> there<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.300> can

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
get a nice cross-breeze there as you can

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.610 
get a nice cross-breeze there as you can
see<00:02:31.629> up<00:02:31.720> there<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.110> can<00:02:32.290> put<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.590> Ridge<00:02:32.830> poles

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
see up there you can put in Ridge poles

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.710 
see up there you can put in Ridge poles
and<00:02:33.709> then<00:02:34.010> if<00:02:34.250> you're<00:02:34.400> not<00:02:34.430> like<00:02:34.849> I'm<00:02:35.030> I'm<00:02:35.450> not

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
and then if you're not like I'm I'm not

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.320 
and then if you're not like I'm I'm not
doing<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.140> but<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.500> can<00:02:36.769> cinch<00:02:37.040> those<00:02:37.220> down

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
typically the portion of the zipper that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.670 
typically the portion of the zipper that
wears<00:02:42.830> out<00:02:43.099> is<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:44.060> metal<00:02:44.629> piece<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.349> we<00:02:45.500> had

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
wears out is this metal piece so we had

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.770 
wears out is this metal piece so we had
them<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.220> neck<00:02:46.430> extra<00:02:47.090> zipper<00:02:47.450> for<00:02:47.629> us

them so in a neck extra zipper for us

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.949 
them so in a neck extra zipper for us
right<00:02:47.989> here<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.700> if<00:02:49.849> this<00:02:50.000> ever<00:02:50.269> starts

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
right here so that if this ever starts

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.690 
right here so that if this ever starts
to<00:02:51.260> wear<00:02:51.379> out<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.620> gives<00:02:51.950> us<00:02:52.099> grief<00:02:52.340> we<00:02:52.519> can

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
to wear out and gives us grief we can

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.150 
to wear out and gives us grief we can
take<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.060> off<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.239> then<00:02:53.629> we<00:02:54.590> have<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.860> extra

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
take it off and then we have the extra

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.559 
take it off and then we have the extra
zipper<00:02:55.430> here<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:57.310> do<00:02:58.310> have<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.730> Colorado<00:02:59.269> storm

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
covers the zippers and protects them

that I didn't put up the reason why I

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
didn't put it up is because I kind of

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.210 
didn't put it up is because I kind of

had the tent up before I thought about

setting it up as far as I'm aware at

least or have a ladder or something like
that<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.129> where<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.489> was<00:03:31.579> just<00:03:31.610> my<00:03:32.000> daughter

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
that and where it was just my daughter

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.910 
that and where it was just my daughter
and<00:03:32.569> I<00:03:32.629> I<00:03:32.660> didn't<00:03:33.049> want<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.260> try<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.500> pull<00:03:33.890> that

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
and I I didn't want to try to pull that

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.550 
and I I didn't want to try to pull that
over<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:35.090> top<00:03:37.299> anyway<00:03:38.299> there's<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.230> and

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
over the top anyway there's that and

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.250 
over the top anyway there's that and
then<00:03:40.549> here's<00:03:41.030> just<00:03:41.269> some<00:03:41.329> bags<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.989> extra

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
then here's just some bags and extra

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.080 
then here's just some bags and extra
things<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:42.680> have<00:03:42.799> some<00:03:43.010> cots<00:03:43.250> seven<00:03:43.790> but<00:03:44.060> I

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
things I have some cots seven but I

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.670 
things I have some cots seven but I
think<00:03:44.359> they're<00:03:44.450> two<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.720> half<00:03:44.870> by<00:03:45.170> 7<00:03:45.530> foot

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
think they're two and a half by 7 foot

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.309 
think they're two and a half by 7 foot
cots<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:46.190> would<00:03:46.310> go<00:03:46.459> in<00:03:46.579> here<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:46.819> can<00:03:47.060> fit

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
cots that would go in here I can fit

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.289 
cots that would go in here I can fit
four<00:03:48.319> here<00:03:48.680> easily<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.430> another<00:03:49.819> couple<00:03:50.060> over

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
four here easily and another couple over

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.569 
four here easily and another couple over
here<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.709> then<00:03:51.799> we'll<00:03:51.920> have<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.069> nice<00:03:52.280> open

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
here and then we'll have a nice open

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.449 
here and then we'll have a nice open
area<00:03:52.849> or<00:03:53.299> something<00:03:56.230> this<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:57.290> one-inch<00:03:57.650> EMT

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
area or something this is one-inch EMT

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.569 
area or something this is one-inch EMT
conduit<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.900> cut<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.530> poles<00:04:00.769> yourself<00:04:01.310> I

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
conduit you cut the poles yourself I

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.229 
conduit you cut the poles yourself I
guess<00:04:02.419> you<00:04:02.630> can<00:04:02.780> have<00:04:02.810> them<00:04:03.109> do<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.440> but

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
guess you can have them do it but

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.789 
guess you can have them do it but
shipping<00:04:05.239> would<00:04:05.329> be<00:04:05.450> cost<00:04:05.720> prohibitive<00:04:05.930> due

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
shipping would be cost prohibitive due

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.129 
shipping would be cost prohibitive due
to<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:07.010> weight<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.370> size<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:08.720> they<00:04:08.840> do<00:04:08.900> what

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
to the weight and size so they do what

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.300 
to the weight and size so they do what
they<00:04:09.230> typically<00:04:09.560> do<00:04:09.739> is<00:04:09.829> they<00:04:09.919> just<00:04:09.950> give<00:04:10.280> you

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
they typically do is they just give you

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.990 
they typically do is they just give you
the<00:04:10.430> angles<00:04:11.109> and<00:04:12.109> I<00:04:12.739> again<00:04:13.130> I<00:04:13.160> bought<00:04:13.400> an<00:04:13.579> extra

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
the angles and I again I bought an extra
