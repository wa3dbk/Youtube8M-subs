a<00:04:35.610> stampede<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:38.020> modifications<00:04:38.560> into<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:38.890> is

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
a stampede the modifications into it is

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.300 
a stampede the modifications into it is
the<00:04:39.100> battery<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:40.680> internals<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:42.160> I

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
the battery and the internals that I

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.580 
the battery and the internals that I
kept<00:04:42.490> us<00:04:42.610> bringing<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.510> main<00:04:43.780> spring<00:04:44.470> that

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
kept us bringing the main spring that

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.340 
kept us bringing the main spring that
brings<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:44.860> forward<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.550> same<00:04:45.760> the<00:04:46.480> pats<00:04:47.020> ring

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
brings it forward the same the pats ring

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.930 
brings it forward the same the pats ring
that<00:04:47.500> shoots<00:04:47.800> a<00:04:47.890> dart<00:04:48.100> is<00:04:48.250> different<00:04:48.669> it's<00:04:48.850> a

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
that shoots a dart is different it's a

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.810 
that shoots a dart is different it's a
bigger<00:04:49.090> spring<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:50.110> battery<00:04:50.440> mod<00:04:50.650> able<00:04:51.310> they

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
bigger spring the battery mod able they

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.770 
bigger spring the battery mod able they
it's<00:04:51.940> like<00:04:51.970> one<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.360> big<00:04:52.480> adder<00:04:52.660> is

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
it's like one of the big adder is

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.580 
it's like one of the big adder is
alligator<00:04:53.290> clamps<00:04:54.090> yep<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:56.290> then<00:04:56.410> my

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590
