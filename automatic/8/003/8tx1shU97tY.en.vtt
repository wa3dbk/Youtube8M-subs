00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
having used this having listened to a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.330 
having used this having listened to a
lot<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.150> music<00:03:33.299> with<00:03:33.659> it<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.680> noticeable

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
lot of music with it it is a noticeable

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.949 
lot of music with it it is a noticeable
change<00:03:35.400> if<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:35.970> switch<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.329> on<00:03:36.419> and<00:03:36.569> off<00:03:36.690> you

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
change if you switch it on and off you

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.929 
change if you switch it on and off you
can<00:03:37.109> really<00:03:37.139> tell<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.739> difference<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.310> it

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
can really tell the difference and it

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.240 
can really tell the difference and it
really<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.299> something<00:03:39.449> that<00:03:39.659> I<00:03:40.139> think<00:03:40.620> yields

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
really is something that I think yields

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.369 
really is something that I think yields
a<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.729> positive<00:03:42.000> listening<00:03:42.840> experience

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
a really positive listening experience

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.649 
a really positive listening experience

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
anything like that that I have

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.339 
anything like that that I have
experimented<00:03:46.979> with<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:47.639> far<00:03:48.019> one<00:03:49.019> thing<00:03:49.229> to

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
experimented with so far one thing to

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.539 
experimented with so far one thing to
note<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.739> if<00:03:49.859> your<00:03:50.010> ROM<00:03:50.280> does<00:03:50.579> come<00:03:51.090> with<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.299> DSP

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
note is if your ROM does come with a DSP

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.520 
note is if your ROM does come with a DSP
manager<00:03:53.549> some<00:03:53.790> sort<00:03:53.970> of<00:03:54.000> DSP<00:03:54.269> setting<00:03:54.780> for<00:03:55.019> for

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
doing a system-wide equalizer those

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.199 
doing a system-wide equalizer those
settings<00:03:58.379> need<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.590> be<00:03:58.680> disabled<00:03:59.250> otherwise
