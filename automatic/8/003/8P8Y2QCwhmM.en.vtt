00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
drying process is important because

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.770 
drying process is important because
without<00:01:01.469> drying<00:01:01.920> by<00:01:02.579> pressing<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.239> adding

without drying by pressing and adding

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.179 
without drying by pressing and adding
into<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> oil<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.379> loves<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:04.769> too<00:01:04.920> much<00:01:05.040> oil

into the oil it loves out too much oil

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.730 
into the oil it loves out too much oil
so<00:01:05.760> drying<00:01:06.090> will<00:01:06.390> avoid<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.110> also<00:01:07.320> you
