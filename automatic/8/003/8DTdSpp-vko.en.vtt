00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.620
 i 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.090
 very good youtube I'm going to teach a 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.850
 new tutorial on how to install the mod 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.010
 of the moon for minecraft is very 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.990
 simple first I will leave you in the link of 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.350
 the description a mediafire file 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:40.290
 elevated montwood 1 points 2.5 rare point 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.290
 and download JCE once downloaded 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 I opened it you look for it that enters it by 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.340
 here I do not have it installed I speak it 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.219
 we open this folder and it will appear 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.180
 minecraft point pitcher then let's 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:02.230
 our minecraft point folder for that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:06.159
 we do app data with 2% roaming a shot 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.820
 in kraft and let's pin once in bing 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.590
 we open this file the heart point is 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.570
 If you want, keep it if you need it 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.340
 you keep it shirt the name or what 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.820
 you leave on the desk that you see is what 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 What am I gong to do 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.609
 and this we take it and drag it there 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.979
 and we already have the mountain and now I'm going to 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.740
 spend a moment to change to the fraps 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.790
 because the fish is not lage 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.210
 in the micro so a moment 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.450
 open the minecraft once opened 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.460
 go single player I have a map but 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.120
 you create a new one I recommend to the creative 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.570
 to be able to catch things then call 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.330
 null for example you put the creative and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.010
 that the new world I recommend for 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.320
 the minecraft points archives all the 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.070
 modes because if not a parent error because 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.140
 it 's almost not compatible with almost 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.210
 no way 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.430
 the mode of the moon 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.539
 once we do not have open 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.289
 think of some things to get me 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.289
 in the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:20.720
 once so I have a little bit of the jewel 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.560
 that I have many things there is 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.680
 let's see your mind and we catch you throw 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.780
 some things but all the things that 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.510
 have better torches than you 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.100
 I recommend having and take the cheese 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.890
 it's the cheese 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.950
 then we take 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:45.110
 a stick of these sonic script tests 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.500
 and then the jacket that is to go to the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.110
 moon and not die anything will take 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.670
 once you have all that you put the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.030
 suit 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.390
 spatially this is very well done looking 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.150
 is perfect and for her creative 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.040
 and then with the cheese 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.900
 the one that behaves the cne of what is it 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.900
 that with the weight of avoiding all the snow 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.500
 I'm going to take the sound off we have this 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.410
 OK 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.510
 what's going on 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.890
 we put 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.709
 and in these branches with these orchards 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.319
 and they say behave the same leader 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.439
 4 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.230
 and we continue like this and we have our 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:43.260
 portal now we take the stick and adjust 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.319
 for here for the bottom of the 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.120
 portal and appears the export here done 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.060
 and now to show that it works 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.349
 through inside 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:58.250
 a small step for man says 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.250
 Lenten steve for men 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.299
 once we arrive we are in a 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.670
 new without kristen zero gravity 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.480
 it's amazing and there are also quite a few 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.280
 bugs that you can see now and there are 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.590
 one 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.900
 according to the difficulty that may appear 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.870
 more and oppose pit bull because we 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.570
 they will appear to none but they do not attack you 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.389
 or nothing if they see you only in the attacks is 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.590
 able to you that there is not a problem of 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.660
 some are killed between the cut by spa of 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.660
 diamonds and they are very quick the truth 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.570
 and dies and then experience time 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.900
 well I hope I did a lot with this 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.030
 mod 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.490
 there is one thing if you put then it works 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.100
 fully illuminated and all and also 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.150
 without flying nor the same eyes for him like that 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.790
 Well, these fish space 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.010
 but it's good I hope you have 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.930
