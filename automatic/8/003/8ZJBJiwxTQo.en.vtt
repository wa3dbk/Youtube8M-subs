time and then when I got the Avengers I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.390 
time and then when I got the Avengers I
didn't<00:01:12.450> expect<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.900> be<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.140> way<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.770> really

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
didn't expect it to be this way I really

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.530 
didn't expect it to be this way I really
honestly<00:01:14.580> thought<00:01:14.909> it'd<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> little<00:01:15.330> bit

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
honestly thought it'd be a little bit

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.840 
honestly thought it'd be a little bit
less<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.619> Avengers<00:01:16.920> okay<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.400> seven

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
less the Avengers okay so with seven

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.640 
less the Avengers okay so with seven
characters<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.570> 19<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.170> 20<00:01:19.439> characters

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
characters now it's 19 or 20 characters

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.679 
characters now it's 19 or 20 characters
in<00:01:19.890> every<00:01:20.100> issue<00:01:20.189> tiny<00:01:20.580> panels<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.270> very<00:01:21.450> tiny

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
in every issue tiny panels a very tiny

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.390 
in every issue tiny panels a very tiny
paneling<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.350> know<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:22.979> more

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
paneling you know what that is more

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.380 
paneling you know what that is more
difficult<00:01:23.549> than<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.090> expected<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
difficult than I expected is that the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.630 
difficult than I expected is that the
choreography<00:01:27.439> choreographing<00:01:28.439> scenes<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
background so that makes it believe that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.480

if you want to have guys moving around

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.150 
if you want to have guys moving around
the<00:02:09.720> background<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.229> justifies<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.979> fact

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the background so it justifies the fact

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.600 
the background so it justifies the fact
that<00:02:11.190> they're<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> different<00:02:11.520> spot

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
whatever you can this is because it's

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.300 
whatever you can this is because it's
really<00:02:14.500> difficult<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:14.950> me<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.820> know<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:18.100> next
