see is a it's a big huge monstrous with
massive<00:00:39.379> size<00:00:39.590> think<00:00:42.670> it's<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:44.269> didn't<00:00:44.960> really

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
massive size think it's it didn't really

struck<00:00:45.350> me<00:00:45.379> to<00:00:45.559> strawberry<00:00:45.920> how<00:00:45.980> big<00:00:46.220> it<00:00:46.340> was

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
struck me to strawberry how big it was

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.430 
struck me to strawberry how big it was
until<00:00:46.519> I<00:00:46.879> had<00:00:47.150> a<00:00:47.180> box<00:00:47.480> of<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:48.019> really<00:00:48.230> as<00:00:48.350> a

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
until I had a box of it really as a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.930 
until I had a box of it really as a
massive<00:00:50.500> dual<00:00:51.500> motor<00:00:51.739> a<00:00:51.860> motor<00:00:52.100> on<00:00:52.250> each<00:00:52.430> and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
massive dual motor a motor on each and

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.649 
massive dual motor a motor on each and
basic<00:00:53.570> axles<00:00:54.080> but<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.710> drive<00:00:55.010> units<00:00:55.460> basically

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:07.270 

for<00:00:59.659> steering<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:05.290> body<00:01:06.290> shell<00:01:06.500> on<00:01:06.830> getting

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
for steering the body shell on getting

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.240 
for steering the body shell on getting
real<00:01:07.400> at<00:01:07.540> that<00:01:09.670> big<00:01:10.670> fan<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:10.880> scale<00:01:11.350> detail<00:01:12.350> and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
real at that big fan of scale detail and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.859 
real at that big fan of scale detail and
this<00:01:13.520> doesn't<00:01:13.790> look<00:01:14.090> like<00:01:14.150> anything<00:01:14.630> in

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
this doesn't look like anything in

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.230 
this doesn't look like anything in
actual<00:01:15.260> production<00:01:15.530> all<00:01:16.010> use<00:01:16.310> in<00:01:17.000> real<00:01:17.479> life

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
actual production all use in real life

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.550 
actual production all use in real life
it's<00:01:20.240> just<00:01:20.390> gonna<00:01:20.630> be<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.930> GV<00:01:26.049> after<00:01:27.049> I've

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
it's just gonna be you GV after I've

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.110 
it's just gonna be you GV after I've
told<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:28.220> all<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.430> cables<00:01:28.850> with<00:01:29.000> some

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
told you that all the cables with some

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.400 
told you that all the cables with some
cable<00:01:29.450> ties<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:34.630> I've<00:01:35.630> changed<00:01:35.870> the<00:01:36.050> table

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
cable ties and I've changed the table

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.100 
cable ties and I've changed the table
side<00:01:36.590> but<00:01:36.950> I<00:01:37.130> think<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:38.480> battery<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:38.960> actually

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
side but I think the battery is actually

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:48.010 
side but I think the battery is actually
cable<00:01:39.680> side<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:45.550> the<00:01:46.550> batteries<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:47.720> I<00:01:47.750> did

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
cable side in the batteries and so I did

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.910 
cable side in the batteries and so I did
so<00:01:50.050> I'm<00:01:51.050> going<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.290> be<00:01:51.380> looking<00:01:51.530> for<00:01:51.740> some

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
so I'm going to be looking for some

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.000 
so I'm going to be looking for some
reusable<00:01:52.220> cable<00:01:52.940> size<00:01:53.120> and<00:01:53.570> or<00:01:53.960> another<00:01:54.770> way

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
reusable cable size and or another way

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.469 
reusable cable size and or another way
of<00:01:55.150> securing<00:01:56.150> a<00:01:56.330> package<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.930> but<00:01:57.920> they

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
of securing a package of it but they

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.540 
of securing a package of it but they
another<00:01:59.050> thing<00:01:59.260> is<00:01:59.380> though<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.830> get<00:02:00.430> the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
another thing is though to get the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.360 
another thing is though to get the
battery<00:02:00.850> out<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.120> vehicle<00:02:01.510> life<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.810> remove

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
battery out the vehicle life to remove

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.400 
battery out the vehicle life to remove
one<00:02:03.370> of<00:02:03.400> these<00:02:03.580> cross<00:02:04.479> beam<00:02:05.080> member<00:02:05.970> bar

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
one of these cross beam member bar

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.150 
one of these cross beam member bar
things<00:02:08.410> technical<00:02:09.100> totally<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:11.069> what<00:02:12.069> I'm

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
things technical totally or what I'm

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.650 
things technical totally or what I'm
actually<00:02:12.310> going<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.610> do<00:02:12.730> is<00:02:13.000> on<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.270> back

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
actually going to do is on the back

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.710 
actually going to do is on the back
plate<00:02:14.140> this<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.950> fun<00:02:15.330> it's<00:02:16.330> basically<00:02:16.600> just

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
plate this is a fun it's basically just

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.900 
plate this is a fun it's basically just
Dremel<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.530> little<00:02:17.920> bit<00:02:18.070> out<00:02:18.190> there<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.730> will

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
Dremel a little bit out there so it will

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.510 
Dremel a little bit out there so it will
just<00:02:19.030> slide<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.630> out<00:02:20.430> something<00:02:21.430> new

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
just slide in and out something new

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:31.110 
just slide in and out something new
together<00:02:21.670> batteries<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:29.130> think<00:02:30.130> I've<00:02:30.700> met<00:02:30.940> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
together batteries I think I've met the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:40.770 
together batteries I think I've met the
GoPro<00:02:31.510> map<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:37.290> more<00:02:38.290> like<00:02:38.440> Aug<00:02:38.920> beam<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.780> toy

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
GoPro map so more like Aug beam in a toy

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:49.410 
GoPro map so more like Aug beam in a toy
truck<00:02:41.140> anyway<00:02:47.640> I'm<00:02:48.640> going<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.880> be<00:02:48.970> using<00:02:49.300> it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420
