00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.920
Hi, I'm Marian. Welcome to Thrive Gluten Free, where I'm all about showing you how easy it is to cook simple and delicious gluten free meals.

00:00:07.925 --> 00:00:11.715
Today I'm going to show you how to make a simple breakfast frittata.

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:15.154
It is perfect for meal prep Sunday, for eating throughout the week

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.893
or for your Sunday brunch with your friends and those mimosas.

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:20.868
This frittata is a Southwest style frittata

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.100
We are going to use beef, onions, spinach, bell peppers

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.542
and we're going to make it all in bacon grease.

00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.007
If bacon grease is not your thing, feel free to use coconut oil or butter

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.879
I just like that bacon grease helps it not stick to the pan, and it tastes great.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.760
You can use as much or as little as you want

00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:39.479
I like to be a little bit more liberal

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:44.534
and you just turn on the heat to a medium-low

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:45.723
and let that melt.

00:00:45.723 --> 00:00:47.869
While that is melting, we're going to chop.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.890
Take a yellow onion, and cut it in half

00:00:55.904 --> 00:00:58.544
and a quick peel, all these loose pieces

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:14.021
We're just going to rough chop them

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:19.535
I got these cute little  bell peppers from my local store

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:23.201
you can use a big one. I just got these little ones, so that's what I'm going to use

00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:47.171
The onions and the peppers are chopped, so now we're going to add half a pound of  ground beef.

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:52.692
You can use breakfast sausage or chorizo if you want, however we like ground beef here.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.576
and then we're going to add the peppers as well, and just let those start to cook

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.780
You want to chop the beef up into small pieces

00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:12.662
It smells fantastic already

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.520
While the beef, onions, and peppers are browning, we are going to go ahead and take a dozen eggs and scramble them.

00:02:24.998 --> 00:02:29.718
The meat is all brown, so we're going to add the rest of the ingredients, mix the eggs in, and place it in the oven

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.070
We're going to take a hand full of spinach, just rough chop

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:35.305
nothing fancy.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.020
toss those in to wilt a little bit

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:42.406
Then a can of mild green chili's.

00:02:42.406 --> 00:02:46.713
You can use hot chili's if that's what you prefer. We have kids, so we tend to keep it pretty mild.

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:55.700
Turn off the heat, then we're just going to again, mix these in, help the spinach wilt just a touch, before we add in the eggs

00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:01.122
It smells SO good

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:06.459
So with the heat off, we're literally just going to pour the eggs in

00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:19.568
Make sure everything is covered and mixed around just a little bit

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.255
and now we're going to place it in the oven

00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:36.835
This will cook for about 25-30 minutes

00:03:36.835 --> 00:03:41.668
And you'll know that it's done when you go in to try to wiggle it, and the middle does not move.

00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:45.485
Alright, our frittata is smelling amazing,  I'm going to check on it

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:50.806
And how you know that it's ready, if you pull it up and shake it, and the middle doesn't move

00:03:50.806 --> 00:03:53.658
and it is not moving, so we are going to take it out

00:03:56.687 --> 00:03:57.807
turn the oven off

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.200
and then now you just let it cool

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.352
and then I like to cut it into pizza slices, scoop it out and serve it that way

00:04:10.406 --> 00:04:12.900
Frittatas are really are really one of my favorite ways to use up leftovers.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.490
On Sunday's when I go grocery shopping, I kinda take a tally of what's in the fridge

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.556
then I throw together, whatever meat and vegetables I have left over

00:04:20.556 --> 00:04:24.000
top some eggs on it, and do this every single week. We love it, they're always different.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.159
And it's really just a great way to use up everything that you buy, and saves you money!

00:04:29.513 --> 00:04:31.913
