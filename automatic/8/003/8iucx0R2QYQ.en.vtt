00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
back saying see you see I've got all

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.130 
back saying see you see I've got all
these<00:01:29.280> cuts<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.060> simply<00:01:30.479> using<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
these cuts and then I simply using the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
these cuts and then I simply using the
same<00:01:31.320> motion<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.880> cut<00:01:33.060> straight

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
same motion I'm going to cut straight

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.859 
same motion I'm going to cut straight
down<00:01:34.310> across<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:36.329> cuts<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.780> made<00:01:37.159> and

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
down across the cuts that I made and

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.450 
down across the cuts that I made and
then<00:01:39.869> you'll<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.759> what<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.030> here<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:43.460> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
then you'll see what I have here is a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.990 
then you'll see what I have here is a
perfectly<00:01:44.939> diced<00:01:45.180> onion<00:01:45.770> now<00:01:46.770> we're<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
perfectly diced onion now we're going to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.700 
perfectly diced onion now we're going to
finely<00:01:48.689> dice<00:01:48.869> an<00:01:49.079> onion<00:01:49.140> because<00:01:49.320> you'll<00:01:49.560> see

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
finely dice an onion because you'll see

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.319 
finely dice an onion because you'll see
sometimes<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> says<00:01:50.369> dice<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.850> sometimes<00:01:51.210> it

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
sometimes it says dice and sometimes it

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.539 
sometimes it says dice and sometimes it
says<00:01:51.509> finely<00:01:51.930> diced<00:01:52.140> 2<00:01:52.680> finely<00:01:53.100> dice<00:01:53.250> an<00:01:53.460> onion

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
says finely diced 2 finely dice an onion

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.719 
says finely diced 2 finely dice an onion
it's<00:01:54.360> simply<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> same<00:01:55.079> move<00:01:55.310> but<00:01:56.310> I'm<00:01:56.399> making

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
it's simply the same move but I'm making

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.789 
it's simply the same move but I'm making
smaller<00:01:57.149> cuts<00:01:57.540> which<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.439> say<00:01:58.469> there's

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
smaller cuts which is to say there's

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.649 
smaller cuts which is to say there's
less<00:01:59.040> space<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.549> between<00:01:59.700> my<00:02:00.060> cuts<00:02:00.299> then<00:02:00.540> there

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
less space in between my cuts then there

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.380 
less space in between my cuts then there
were<00:02:00.780> before<00:02:01.520> I'll<00:02:02.520> go<00:02:02.640> straight<00:02:02.939> down<00:02:02.969> just

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
were before I'll go straight down just

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.179 
were before I'll go straight down just
like<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.630> did<00:02:03.689> before<00:02:03.899> again<00:02:04.409> using<00:02:04.770> my<00:02:04.860> finger

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
like I did before again using my finger

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.029 
like I did before again using my finger
as<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> guide<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.200> then<00:02:07.200> what<00:02:07.380> I'll<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.890> I'll

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
as a guide and then what I'll do is I'll

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.710 
as a guide and then what I'll do is I'll
make<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> series<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.640> cuts<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> other

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
make a series of cuts going the other

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.100 
make a series of cuts going the other
way<00:02:11.060> just<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.209> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
way just like that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.960 
way just like that
the<00:02:13.620> key<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:13.950> always<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.340> keep<00:02:14.370> your<00:02:14.640> fingers

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
the key is always to keep your fingers

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.210 
the key is always to keep your fingers
away<00:02:15.000> from<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.660> blade<00:02:15.780> that's<00:02:16.710> common<00:02:17.190> sense

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
away from the blade that's common sense

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.470 
away from the blade that's common sense
and<00:02:18.200> then<00:02:19.200> same<00:02:19.800> cuts<00:02:20.040> again<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:21.060> straight

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and then same cuts again going straight

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.570 
and then same cuts again going straight
down<00:02:21.510> across<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:23.990> then<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.260> see<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:26.430> my

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
down across and then you can see that my

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.350 
down across and then you can see that my
dice<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.950> finer<00:02:28.950> same<00:02:29.940> cuts<00:02:30.210> just

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
dice on this is finer same cuts just

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.140 
dice on this is finer same cuts just
different<00:02:30.900> lengths<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.260> between<00:02:32.030> now<00:02:33.030> we're

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
different lengths in between now we're

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.550 
different lengths in between now we're
going<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.300> get<00:02:33.420> into<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.720> chef's<00:02:33.960> knife<00:02:34.200> which

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
going to get into the chef's knife which

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.380 
going to get into the chef's knife which
i<00:02:34.680> think<00:02:34.740> is<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.220> greatest<00:02:35.760> knife<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.030> use<00:02:36.210> this

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
i think is a greatest knife I use this

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.730 
i think is a greatest knife I use this
knife<00:02:36.570> for<00:02:36.780> pretty<00:02:36.930> much<00:02:36.990> everything<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:37.650> my

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
potato the julienne i'm going to just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.350 
potato the julienne i'm going to just
make<00:02:56.760> some<00:02:56.940> very<00:02:57.120> thin<00:02:57.390> slices<00:02:59.180> just<00:03:00.180> like

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
make some very thin slices just like

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.750 
make some very thin slices just like
that<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.810> I'll<00:03:00.900> set<00:03:01.110> those<00:03:01.290> aside<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.920> then

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
that and I'll set those aside and then

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.550 
that and I'll set those aside and then
for<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> dice<00:03:03.270> I'm<00:03:03.570> just<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.410> do

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
for the dice I'm just going to do

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.590 
for the dice I'm just going to do
thicker<00:03:04.800> slices<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.940> same<00:03:06.180> motion

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
thicker slices so it's the same motion

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.199 
thicker slices so it's the same motion
again<00:03:07.230> using<00:03:07.590> my<00:03:07.680> finger<00:03:07.980> as<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.220> guide<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:09.150> I

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
again using my finger as the guide so I

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.699 
again using my finger as the guide so I
have<00:03:09.300> just<00:03:09.480> two<00:03:09.600> different<00:03:09.959> thicknesses<00:03:10.650> of

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
have just two different thicknesses of

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.190 
have just two different thicknesses of
slices<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.220> for<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.000> julienne<00:03:12.450> I'm<00:03:12.959> just

going<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.380> stack<00:03:13.650> my<00:03:13.680> slices<00:03:14.160> up<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.700> make

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
going to stack my slices up and make

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.770 
going to stack my slices up and make
very<00:03:15.690> thin<00:03:15.959> cuts<00:03:16.519> right<00:03:17.519> across<00:03:17.580> again<00:03:18.269> same

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780

going<00:03:21.690> straight<00:03:21.959> across<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:23.299> then<00:03:24.299> there's

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
going straight across and then there's

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
going to cut straight down and there's

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.789 
going to cut straight down and there's
my<00:03:47.850> dice<00:03:48.060> similarly<00:03:49.049> if<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.290> wanted<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.620> go

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
my dice similarly if I wanted to go

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.110 
my dice similarly if I wanted to go
ahead<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.070> make<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> fine<00:03:50.489> dice<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.850> would<00:03:50.970> just

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
ahead and make a fine dice I would just

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.530 
ahead and make a fine dice I would just
take<00:03:51.269> some<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.540> my<00:03:51.660> julienne<00:03:52.110> strips<00:03:53.540> same

take some of my julienne strips same
process<00:03:55.019> I'm<00:03:55.260> lining<00:03:55.530> them<00:03:55.769> up<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.130> then<00:03:56.820> I'm

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
process I'm lining them up and then I'm

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.600 
process I'm lining them up and then I'm
just<00:03:56.970> making<00:03:57.390> smaller<00:03:57.750> cuts

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.460 

and<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.510> last<00:04:03.630> thing<00:04:03.810> i<00:04:03.990> want<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.170> show<00:04:04.230> is

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
and the last thing i want to show is

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.800 
and the last thing i want to show is
mincing<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.160> mincing<00:04:05.550> more<00:04:06.390> often<00:04:06.660> than<00:04:06.750> not

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
mincing and mincing more often than not

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.720 
mincing and mincing more often than not
pertains<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.530> garlic<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.310> that's<00:04:08.460> something

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
pertains to garlic and that's something

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.340 
pertains to garlic and that's something
I<00:04:08.940> think<00:04:09.150> everybody<00:04:09.480> uses<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.020> kitchen

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
I think everybody uses in the kitchen

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.380 
I think everybody uses in the kitchen
and<00:04:10.470> mincing<00:04:10.740> your<00:04:10.890> own<00:04:10.980> garlic<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:11.610> snap

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
and mincing your own garlic is a snap

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.210 
and mincing your own garlic is a snap
and<00:04:12.570> it's<00:04:12.720> really<00:04:13.050> all<00:04:13.230> about<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.650> motion<00:04:14.010> so

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
and it's really all about the motion so

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.310 
and it's really all about the motion so
I've<00:04:14.340> got<00:04:14.460> two<00:04:14.670> cloves<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:15.090> garlic<00:04:15.480> here<00:04:15.630> and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
I've got two cloves of garlic here and

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.599 
I've got two cloves of garlic here and
I'm<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.590> going<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.769> start<00:04:17.010> by<00:04:17.160> doing<00:04:17.220> some

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
I'm just going to start by doing some

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.860 
I'm just going to start by doing some
very<00:04:17.730> rough<00:04:18.030> cuts<00:04:18.530> on<00:04:19.530> my<00:04:19.590> garlic<00:04:23.660> keep<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.780> all

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
very rough cuts on my garlic keep it all

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.080 
very rough cuts on my garlic keep it all
in<00:04:25.020> a<00:04:25.080> pile<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.590> then<00:04:25.680> it's<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.460> same<00:04:26.670> motion

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
in a pile and then it's the same motion

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.730 
in a pile and then it's the same motion
so<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.300> can't<00:04:27.540> have<00:04:27.660> my<00:04:27.690> garlic<00:04:28.080> in<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.260> pile<00:04:28.440> here

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
so I can't have my garlic in a pile here

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.260 
so I can't have my garlic in a pile here
