00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.550 

the<00:01:23.610> motor<00:01:23.850> does<00:01:24.330> need<00:01:24.570> work<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.050> needs<00:01:25.200> the

the motor does need work it needs the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.100 
the motor does need work it needs the
carbs<00:01:26.490> gone<00:01:26.730> through<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.800> properly<00:01:28.800> adjusted

and<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:32.190> motor<00:01:32.430> needs<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> rubber

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and the motor needs there's a rubber

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.399 
and the motor needs there's a rubber
grommet<00:01:34.080> right<00:01:34.500> here

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.700 

this<00:01:37.829> rubber<00:01:38.039> grommet<00:01:38.630> it's<00:01:39.630> missing<00:01:40.469> from

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
this rubber grommet it's missing from

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.760 
this rubber grommet it's missing from
this<00:01:40.890> side<00:01:41.270> which<00:01:42.270> allows<00:01:42.749> it<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:42.990> tighten<00:01:43.679> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
this side which allows it to tighten the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.169 
this side which allows it to tighten the
tiller<00:01:44.009> who<00:01:44.100> knows<00:01:44.249> so<00:01:44.460> right<00:01:44.819> now<00:01:44.939> it's

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
tiller who knows so right now it's

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.740 
tiller who knows so right now it's
wobbly<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:47.179> to<00:01:48.179> replace<00:01:48.509> that's

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
wobbly like this to replace that's

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.580 
wobbly like this to replace that's
pretty<00:01:49.020> easy<00:01:49.079> there's<00:01:49.500> two<00:01:49.710> bolts<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.069> here

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
his Phillips head screw which you guys

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.240 
his Phillips head screw which you guys
somehow<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.410> with<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:32.600> put<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:32.990> there<00:02:33.230> but<00:02:33.470> I'm

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.520

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
fix that

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.190 
fix that
and<00:02:41.100> once<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.490> fix<00:02:42.420> all<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.900> should<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.170> a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
and once you fix all that it should be a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
and once you fix all that it should be a
good<00:02:43.470> running<00:02:43.710> motor<00:02:45.770> you're<00:02:46.770> just<00:02:46.980> starting

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
good running motor you're just starting

00:02:47.220 --> 00:03:25.730 
good running motor you're just starting
again

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.700 

it<00:03:26.740> starts<00:03:27.040> right<00:03:27.190> up<00:03:27.250> pretty<00:03:27.610> easy
