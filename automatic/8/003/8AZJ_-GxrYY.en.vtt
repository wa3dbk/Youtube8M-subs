dominating<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.409> game<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.919> mean<00:03:48.819> you'd<00:03:49.180> think

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
dominating this game I mean you'd think

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.759 
dominating this game I mean you'd think
they'd<00:03:49.569> make<00:03:49.720> streaks<00:03:50.109> easier<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.590> get

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
they'd make streaks easier to get

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.259 
they'd make streaks easier to get
because<00:03:51.069> if<00:03:51.190> people<00:03:51.489> are<00:03:51.699> playing<00:03:52.060> and

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
because if people are playing and

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.789

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
getting more streaks to have a more fun

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:54.780 
getting more streaks to have a more fun
right<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.099> mean<00:03:54.340> when<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.489> get<00:03:54.609> in<00:03:54.699> your

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
right I mean when you get in your

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
streaks you're having fun so if they

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.309 
streaks you're having fun so if they
raise<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.739> score<00:03:56.979> to<00:03:57.099> 125<00:03:58.079> they<00:03:59.079> would<00:03:59.199> be

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
raise the score to 125 they would be
