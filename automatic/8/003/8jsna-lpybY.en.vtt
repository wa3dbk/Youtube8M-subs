00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello to you elena chudinova 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.460
 today i'm doing a video about carbohydrates and i 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.319
 glycemic index 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.150
 do you want to know why 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.160
 important to know in order to lose weight 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.920
 Yes, and the principle or health get with 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.900
 me when we want to lose weight in the House of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.960
 what about god really need to give up 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.770
 potatoes from sweet from flour and when 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 this we stuck 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.660
 another bun but how does life out 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.310
 affably and we live once and want 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.050
 enjoy and in general not 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.240
 lose weight in any case will be so with me 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.250
 here but one fine moment I just 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.050
 decided to figure out what was happening and why and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.090
 as you can see, I basically lost weight 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.219
 while I do not suffer the fact that I am there 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.010
 do not eat something fasting indulge 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.469
 very, very sweet, that's why it 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.969
 everything happens today i will tell so 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.100
 in fact there are only two 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.260
 carbohydrate source 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.660
 this slow carbs fast carbs 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.410
 carbohydrates are generally such molecules 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.660
 organic who get to us 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.789
 organize energy when we eat 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.129
 quick input was fast water it 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.350
 chocolate and sweet rolls in general 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.120
 that sweet they consist of simple 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.880
 sugars and getting into the body almost 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.070
 do not require any processing thereby 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 when ingested such carbohydrates find our 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.920
 the body is going through a very sharp jump 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.170
 blood sugar levels and accordingly 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.810
 there is a sharp jump in insulin levels 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 because our body is enough 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.509
 stable system and hormones yes all this 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.280
 regulated very quickly when 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.110
 we have lost what is great 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.240
 the amount of glucose in the blood is our brain 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.630
 just baldeet why love so sweet 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.610
 information comes to the brain that 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.130
 much where in the blood a lot of glucose 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.890
 then give the main consumer in principle 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.100
 this is glucose our brain here it is very 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.409
 pleased but at the same time insulin up 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.340
 scatters all glucose quickly 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.790
 all cells 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.890
 and blood glucose levels drop dramatically and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.869
 our brain receives information about what 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.750
 oh once again need to have no 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.520
 glucose again there is no source of energy here 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.560
 and we want to eat again where we are 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.180
 time we just want to eat very much we 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.700
 ready to sweep away everything that lies 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.710
 large quantities and on the most for 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.379
 weight loss is very bad what 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.360
 happens if we eat and 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.740
 the drive method is such a polysaccharide 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.780
 which the body is exposed to 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.890
 splitting into simple sugars and 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.160
 accordingly in the process of this 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.600
 splitting there is no such sharp jump 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.550
 blood sugar levels and can be 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.520
 so we do not really like this food 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.950
 because dramatically such joy about how everything 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.720
 tasty how great everything is yes does not happen 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.720
 in fact, everything is very physiological 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.600
 explained here but we are longer 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.610
 the time can be without food we have 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.800
 sudden jump in glucose level 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.290
 matched the energy level and no 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.000
 sharp decline so we can calmly 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.430
 look at and be calm for a long time 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.410
 cook until the next meal and 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.150
 accordingly, we can sit down and the border 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.400
 some limited amount of liver 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.530
 there you have enough everything there is 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.510
 the concept is called the glycemic index 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.190
 that is, this indicator shows how 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.780
 a product breaks down quickly 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.300
 for simple sugars but naturally for 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.459
 absolutely there for a chemical unit 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.370
 index is taken naturally glucose then 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.020
 the percentage is fast sugar the lower 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.870
 the glycemic index is slower 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.239
 split carbohydrates carbohydrate 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.330
 refers to ascii carbohydrates are 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.180
 fruits and vegetables but in principle there 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.880
 lists yes I 'll leave a link here 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.860
 on to the wall where I wrote what 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.780
 products with this kind of chemical index 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.910
 which products are medium or chemical 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.130
 index and what products with low 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.410
 glycemic index now the question is how 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.269
 All this is connected with losing weight, that is 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.220
 see if you want to lose weight of course 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.170
 can use products with low 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.540
 glycemic index up while you 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.980
 will be good enough 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.110
 bruni energy you will be good 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.959
 mood and there will be drops of this 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.120
 energy structure is the second time 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.269
 you can rate because it did not get you 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.940
 do not fix the second if you are still 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.459
 love sweets very much 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.200
 you can eat a small amount after 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.630
 main meal in the first half 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.310
 of the day itself as I do therefore I donâ€™t 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.910
 I can say that I completely abandoned 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.310
 sweet 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.290
 I his bucket it could be a cake but I 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.180
 spoke of the yard there once or twice in 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.820
 week in the morning of course not 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.160
 often the evening I did not eat quickly carbohydrate 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.620
 I hope that the information was useful 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.419
 if so put like subscribe 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.419
 on the channel see you and bye bye
