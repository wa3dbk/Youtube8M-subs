00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.609
 according to the message 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.279
 the idea is simple frequencies 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.640
 square 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 square 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.800
 up to 4 42 5 45 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.569
 mashal further 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.569
 but if we talk about water quality 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.370
 chair km 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 x 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.890
 well no 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.180
 whites must 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 plot story 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.360
 as reported by reuters 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.050
 we do not have 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.850
 found a typo 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.480
 together with mom 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.010

 26 March 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.980
 millennia 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.510
 reportedly 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.510
 parliamentarian 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
 hard of course 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.789
 however it is not for me 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.129
 to implement these solutions 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.129
 for ten no 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.889
 signed agreement 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.549
 many cities 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.279
 and the decision 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.759
 probably will grow
