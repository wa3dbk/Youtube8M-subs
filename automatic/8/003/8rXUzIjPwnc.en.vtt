00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.190
 the continuous current that goes quietly 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.710
 from the highest - without changing direction 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.230
 it's good to understand but in 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.099
 the reality we have just as often to 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.099
 to do alternating current 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.000
 then the time has come for you 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.660
 present this graceful curve called 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.660
 sinewave 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.300
 you know that if we have an arrow of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.800
 unit length able to turn in 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.860
 a circle its projection on an axis 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.860
 vertical to for fine length us to 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.470
 at estang the angle that makes the arrow 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.180
 rotating with its starting position 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.310
 langlois is usually measured in 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.270
 degrees but can also be measured in 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.250
 what are called radiants we have 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.860
 calculated once for all the values 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.860
 sine for each value of langlois 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.200
 and it's in the memories of all 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.200
 good calculator 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.420
 you will notice that the sinus and first 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:42.400
 equal to zero then they believe becomes 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.920
 maximum equal to decreases to zero 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.630
 goes in the other direction of a light and 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.630
 say equal to -1 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.320
 but by recording her on a roll 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.320
 of paper that would draw a sinusoid 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.180
 you will notice that it is exactly 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.900
 like that the current behaves 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.630
 alternative 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.330
 but instead of a rotating arrow of 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.180
 length units we take an arrow whose 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.000
 the length represents the intensity 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.050
 maximum 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.940
 so we can know a moment 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.080
 that it counts the value of intensity 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.020
 alternating current 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.880
 these snapshots and gally maximum that 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.710
 multiply sinus to this of course to 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.620
 condition that we know langlois or 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.110
 more precisely the little time and who 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.180
 has elapsed since the moment 0 details 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.770
 techniques for drawing the silhouette 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.540
 alternating current 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.910
 rather, we use a utensil 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.970
 more subtle electronics also says 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.340
 the water thanks tells us that the current 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.140
 alternative is a periodic phenomenon 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.360
 because at intervals of time 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.270
 regular whose periodic current 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.130
 finds the same value and in the same 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.900
 sense of variation 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.860
 what you notice is a 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.200
 arrows tower 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.570
 the time that elapses between the two 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.260
 is called the period and is measured in 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.370
 second 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.440
 my milliseconds or in microseconds on 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.700
 can also count how many turns does 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.830
 the arrow in one second 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.360
 before that is called the frequency the 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.580
 frequency and therefore the number of periods 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.930
 per second it is measured in hertz in 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.880
 kilometers in which are the period of 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.340
 frequencies are so two ways of 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.170
 measure the same periodic phenomenon 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.810
 so knowing that the sector current 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.310
 at a frequency of 50 Hz its period 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.010
 is therefore 1/50 equals 0.02 seconds or 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.630
 20000 second skin more details you 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.270
 please refer to the teacher 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.040
 usual but I have nothing to do said 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.959
 you know what's going on at the 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.180
 millisecond near use it but 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.370
 appears a lot for in his review yes 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.440
 but at the highest level of studies 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.090
 we arrived if we want to have a 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.980
 idea of ​​what happens in current 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.050
 alternative in the resistances of 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.930
 coils and capacitors it's worth 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.940
 better to have it all in mind forgot 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.190
 to say that if we can alternative 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.010
 which runs through a resistance for example 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.709
 bonuses a sinusoid it's going 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.660
 exactly the same for the tension the 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.640
 formulas by the way look alike or 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.010
 is it then when we say that the attention 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.739
 of the sector is 220 volts 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.020
 how much of the sinusoid 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.310
 does it match its 220 volts at this 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.400
 point here at this point or at other 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.650
 well no 220 volt sector 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.650
 this is called attention 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.650
 effective 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.939
 if an alternative source plugged into 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:43.249
 a front resistance have some 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:45.080
 energies in the form of heat that's to 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.689
 say by joule effect and well the tension 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.939
 effective this alternative source and 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.310
 the attention of a continuous source who 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:56.139
 would produce exactly the same day 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.139
 what corresponds to these 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:07.340
 my mathematician friend will prove by 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:10.280
 has more b than the maximum voltage and the 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.479
 effective voltage are easily deduced 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.490
 one from the other 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.310
 so when we are not very friendly 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.199
 with sinusoids and their formulas the 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.180
 effective value allows in some cases 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.419
 to reason on an alternative circuit 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.819
 as if it were continuous but 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.099
 attention this only works if the 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:32.330
 circuit only has resistors 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:33.370
 pure guard of that between robin stage and 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.900
 capacitors 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.490
 so here things happen a lot 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.490
 more subtle we'll see a little bit more
