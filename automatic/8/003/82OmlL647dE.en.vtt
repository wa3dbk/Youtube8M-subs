sand<00:02:17.520> making<00:02:18.330> sure<00:02:18.570> we<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.810> rid<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:18.990> any<00:02:19.140> of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
sand making sure we get rid of any of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.930 
sand making sure we get rid of any of
the<00:02:19.350> rough<00:02:19.500> spots<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.040> we<00:02:20.190> have<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> unit

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
the rough spots that we have on the unit

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.490 
the rough spots that we have on the unit
there's<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.540> couple<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.870> places<00:02:22.020> where<00:02:22.380> there

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
there's a couple of places where there

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.560 
there's a couple of places where there
is<00:02:22.530> some<00:02:22.740> rust<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> lot<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:24.210> once<00:02:24.450> we

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
is some rust not a lot and then once we

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.210 
is some rust not a lot and then once we
remove<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.990> rust<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:25.590> we'll<00:02:25.770> go<00:02:25.920> back<00:02:26.190> over

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
remove the rust then we'll go back over

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.340 
remove the rust then we'll go back over
that<00:02:26.730> with<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.330> little<00:02:27.660> bit<00:02:27.780> finer<00:02:28.050> grit

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
that with a little bit finer grit

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.930 
that with a little bit finer grit
sandpaper<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:29.040> smooth<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> surface<00:02:29.580> out

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
sandpaper to smooth the surface out

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.270 
sandpaper to smooth the surface out
because<00:02:30.270> we're<00:02:30.450> going<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.690> put<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> very<00:02:31.140> thin

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
because we're going to put a very thin

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.340 
because we're going to put a very thin
coat<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.310> paint<00:02:32.760> on<00:02:33.060> here<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> idea<00:02:34.290> here

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
coat of paint on here so the idea here

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.780 
coat of paint on here so the idea here
is<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.620> we're<00:02:34.860> going<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.100> go<00:02:35.220> ahead<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.640> get

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
is that we're going to go ahead and get

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.880 
is that we're going to go ahead and get
this<00:02:35.970> prepped<00:02:36.390> up<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.630> it'll<00:02:37.590> take<00:02:37.740> us<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
this prepped up and it'll take us a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.530 
this prepped up and it'll take us a
little<00:02:38.010> bit<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.250> time<00:02:38.460> we're<00:02:39.060> going<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.270> sand

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
little bit of time we're going to sand

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.080 
little bit of time we're going to sand
the<00:02:39.690> entire<00:02:39.990> unit<00:02:40.380> more<00:02:41.280> about<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.850> way<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
the entire unit more about the way the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.700 
the entire unit more about the way the
project<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.540> going<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.690> proceed<00:02:43.020> here<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.560> we

and stick and then we'll have a flow
coat<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.430> will<00:03:50.550> flow<00:03:50.820> out<00:03:50.850> with<00:03:51.300> this<00:03:51.540> and

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
coat that will flow out with this and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.570 
coat that will flow out with this and
give<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.930> really<00:03:52.260> nice<00:03:52.440> finish<00:03:52.860> as<00:03:53.040> our<00:03:53.190> second

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
give a really nice finish as our second

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:09.460 
give a really nice finish as our second
coat

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.770 

we've<00:04:09.830> done<00:04:10.040> three<00:04:10.370> light<00:04:10.580> coats<00:04:10.970> and<00:04:11.360> it's

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
we've done three light coats and it's

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.120 
we've done three light coats and it's
looking<00:04:12.140> very<00:04:12.200> nice

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
looking very nice

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.550 
looking very nice
the<00:04:13.670> reason<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.150> lids<00:04:14.720> are<00:04:14.870> open<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:15.380> we've

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
the reason the lids are open is we've

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.830 
the reason the lids are open is we've
painted<00:04:15.830> the<00:04:16.100> rim<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.670> edges<00:04:17.090> we're<00:04:17.630> going<00:04:17.780> to

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
painted the rim the edges we're going to

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.539 
painted the rim the edges we're going to
let<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:17.959> dry<00:04:18.140> thoroughly<00:04:18.709> before<00:04:19.040> we<00:04:19.310> close

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
let that dry thoroughly before we close

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.640 
let that dry thoroughly before we close
the<00:04:19.700> lids<00:04:19.880> again<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.450> then<00:04:20.989> start<00:04:21.260> looking<00:04:21.380> at

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
the lids again and then start looking at

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.890 
the lids again and then start looking at
whether<00:04:21.830> we<00:04:21.920> need<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.220> do<00:04:22.340> one<00:04:22.580> final<00:04:23.120> touch-up

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
whether we need to do one final touch-up

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.110 
whether we need to do one final touch-up
coat<00:04:24.140> to<00:04:24.590> even<00:04:24.890> things<00:04:25.130> out

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.730

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
burners get the unit as hot as we

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.170 
burners get the unit as hot as we
possibly<00:05:22.100> can<00:05:22.430> with<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.790> fuel<00:05:23.000> we<00:05:23.150> have

one<00:05:31.610> of<00:05:31.730> the<00:05:31.790> things<00:05:32.000> we<00:05:32.180> have<00:05:32.390> prepared<00:05:32.840> for

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
one of the things we have prepared for

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.600 
one of the things we have prepared for
is<00:05:33.140> we<00:05:33.260> do<00:05:33.350> have<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.530> small<00:05:33.830> fan<00:05:34.130> we're<00:05:34.400> going<00:05:34.550> to

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
is we do have a small fan we're going to

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.070 
is we do have a small fan we're going to
blow<00:05:34.760> some<00:05:34.970> air<00:05:35.120> out<00:05:35.150> of<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.450> room<00:05:35.480> this<00:05:35.780> is<00:05:35.840> in

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
blow some air out of the room this is in

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.020 
blow some air out of the room this is in
a<00:05:36.170> sunroom<00:05:36.740> we're<00:05:37.460> going<00:05:37.580> to<00:05:37.640> blow<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:37.910> air

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
a sunroom we're going to blow the air

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.480 
a sunroom we're going to blow the air
out<00:05:38.060> of<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.390> room<00:05:38.540> as<00:05:38.750> the<00:05:38.780> paint<00:05:39.710> starts<00:05:40.310> to

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
out of the room as the paint starts to

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.610 
out of the room as the paint starts to
set<00:05:40.820> because<00:05:41.570> there<00:05:41.690> will<00:05:41.870> be<00:05:41.930> a<00:05:42.050> little<00:05:42.440> bit

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
set because there will be a little bit

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.740 
set because there will be a little bit
of<00:05:42.680> an<00:05:42.770> odor<00:05:42.980> coming<00:05:43.670> off<00:05:43.880> of<00:05:43.910> the<00:05:44.240> paint<00:05:44.450> as<00:05:44.600> it

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
of an odor coming off of the paint as it

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.240 
of an odor coming off of the paint as it
changes<00:05:46.750> so<00:05:47.750> this<00:05:47.870> is<00:05:48.050> the<00:05:48.200> completed<00:05:48.680> project

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
changes so this is the completed project

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.540 
changes so this is the completed project
after<00:05:49.640> we've<00:05:50.300> done<00:05:50.330> the<00:05:50.720> initial<00:05:50.930> burn<00:05:51.550> the

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
after we've done the initial burn the
