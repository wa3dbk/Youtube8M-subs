00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
are already programs being made to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.370 
are already programs being made to
create<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.380> bootable<00:00:31.650> USB<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:33.180> few<00:00:33.840> clicks

set up from USB this is the actual

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.440 
set up from USB this is the actual
program<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.920> we're<00:02:01.219> going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.549> install<00:02:01.969> it<00:02:02.030> to

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
program so we're going to install it to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.669 
program so we're going to install it to
your<00:02:02.770> heart<00:02:03.770> or<00:02:04.009> our<00:02:04.100> computers<00:02:04.939> in<00:02:05.420> order<00:02:06.289> we

your heart or our computers in order we
can<00:02:06.799> proceed<00:02:07.250> with<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.579> process<00:02:07.880> of<00:02:08.830> making

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
can proceed with the process of making

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.500 
can proceed with the process of making
bootable<00:02:10.459> USB<00:02:11.290> right<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:13.099> can<00:02:13.370> install<00:02:14.239> this

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
bootable USB right you can install this

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.710 
bootable USB right you can install this
if<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.620> already<00:02:15.980> installed<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.299> if<00:02:17.569> you

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
if you already installed it and if you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.130 
if you already installed it and if you
are<00:02:17.750> ready<00:02:18.049> to<00:02:18.200> create<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:19.310> bootable<00:02:19.610> USB<00:02:20.140> you

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
are ready to create a bootable USB you

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.759 
are ready to create a bootable USB you
can<00:02:21.380> launch<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:22.190> problem<00:02:26.829> here<00:02:27.829> is<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
can launch that problem here is the

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:37.809 
can launch that problem here is the
program<00:02:31.120> when<00:02:32.120> setup<00:02:33.549> from<00:02:34.549> USB<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:36.819> basically

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
program when setup from USB so basically

be<00:02:57.139> formatted<00:02:57.650> first<00:02:58.450> into<00:02:59.450> NTFS<00:03:00.579> because<00:03:01.780> USB

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
be formatted first into NTFS because USB

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.379 
be formatted first into NTFS because USB
we<00:03:04.010> are<00:03:04.250> formatted<00:03:05.060> as<00:03:05.290> fat32<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:07.730> do<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:08.180> you

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
we are formatted as fat32 to do that you

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.120 
we are formatted as fat32 to do that you
have<00:03:08.569> to<00:03:08.780> run<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:10.040> program<00:03:10.519> which<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.510> called

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
have to run the program which is called

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.750 
have to run the program which is called
the<00:03:16.000> USB<00:03:17.000> formatter<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.489> USB

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
the USB formatter this is the USB

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.879 
the USB formatter this is the USB
formatter

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
formatter

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.030 
formatter
so<00:03:21.889> if<00:03:22.099> you're<00:03:22.310> going<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.609> format<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.209> USB

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
so if you're going to format the USB

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.900 
so if you're going to format the USB
this<00:03:25.040> is<00:03:25.190> your<00:03:25.400> USB<00:03:26.079> you<00:03:27.079> have<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.440> choose<00:03:27.910> NTFS

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
this is your USB you have to choose NTFS

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.710 
this is your USB you have to choose NTFS
and<00:03:30.459> of<00:03:31.459> course<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.880> can<00:03:32.060> change<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.569> volume

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
and of course you can change the volume

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.500 
and of course you can change the volume
label<00:03:33.079> every<00:03:33.590> one<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:35.000> can<00:03:35.180> then<00:03:35.480> start

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
label every one and you can then start

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.680 
label every one and you can then start
the<00:03:36.459> formatting<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.609> your<00:03:38.980> USB<00:03:39.980> n2n

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
the formatting of your USB n2n

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.350 
the formatting of your USB n2n
and<00:03:41.840> if<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.860> read<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.880> down<00:03:44.030> with<00:03:44.270> the

and if you read it down with the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.050 
and if you read it down with the
formatting<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.830> can<00:03:45.980> close<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.280> program

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
formatting you can close that program

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.890

should<00:04:58.070> be<00:04:58.220> safe<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.550> start<00:04:59.210> from<00:04:59.570> very<00:04:59.840> honest

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
should be safe to start from very honest

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.340 
should be safe to start from very honest
just<00:05:01.850> pick<00:05:02.120> up<00:05:02.150> a

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
just pick up a

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:10.600 
just pick up a
so<00:05:04.280> I<00:05:04.730> almost<00:05:05.000> then<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:08.860> that<00:05:09.860> does<00:05:10.070> it<00:05:10.220> do<00:05:10.370> now

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
so I almost then and that does it do now

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.600 
so I almost then and that does it do now
is<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:12.830> exit<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.400> program

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
is to exit the program

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:25.860 
is to exit the program
and<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:20.500> try<00:05:21.240> your<00:05:22.240> new<00:05:23.069> bootable<00:05:24.069> Windows<00:05:24.870> XP

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
and to try your new bootable Windows XP

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.040 
and to try your new bootable Windows XP
or<00:05:28.229> check<00:05:29.229> if<00:05:29.500> it<00:05:29.770> is<00:05:29.889> really<00:05:30.129> working<00:05:30.780> so<00:05:31.780> what

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
or check if it is really working so what

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:40.760 
or check if it is really working so what
you<00:05:32.229> are<00:05:32.259> going<00:05:32.469> to<00:05:32.560> use<00:05:32.740> is<00:05:33.129> the<00:05:33.400> move<00:05:33.699> align

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.310 

so<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.430> just<00:05:41.460> a<00:05:41.700> move<00:05:41.940> away<00:05:45.020> they're<00:05:46.020> just

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
so it is just a move away they're just

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.070 
so it is just a move away they're just
going<00:05:46.560> to<00:05:46.710> start<00:05:47.450> directly<00:05:48.450> from<00:05:48.510> a<00:05:48.720> bootable

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
going to start directly from a bootable

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:58.130 
going to start directly from a bootable
USB<00:05:49.320> Drive<00:05:53.480> okay<00:05:54.480> and<00:05:55.610> check<00:05:56.720> this<00:05:57.720> and<00:05:58.050> you

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
USB Drive okay and check this and you

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.100 
USB Drive okay and check this and you
have<00:05:58.260> to<00:05:58.320> save<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:59.150> this<00:06:00.150> image<00:06:00.480> in<00:06:00.780> your<00:06:00.900> hard

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
have to save and this image in your hard

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:08.210 
have to save and this image in your hard
disk<00:06:01.380> or<00:06:01.590> no<00:06:02.100> it

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.420 

here<00:06:09.220> you<00:06:09.370> will<00:06:09.550> see<00:06:09.820> that<00:06:10.120> your<00:06:11.370> ESB<00:06:12.370> is

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
here you will see that your ESB is

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:26.200 
here you will see that your ESB is
working

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:32.200 

so<00:06:26.780> meaning<00:06:27.169> that<00:06:27.440> our<00:06:30.370> procedure<00:06:31.370> in<00:06:31.729> grading

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210
