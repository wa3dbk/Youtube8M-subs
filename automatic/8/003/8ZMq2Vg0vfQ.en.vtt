00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hi guys, on youtube, this is bad. 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.910
 plus a video of the newspaper today's video 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.469
 talking about customizing the label 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.500
 beer beauty 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.139
 There are a lot of people who like to do 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:20.100
 custom is the theme of it is necessary 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.439
 button the time is understood the service and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.470
 Today we will make this label to 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 people put their client 's name on the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.130
 center with the same source as the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.910
 same curvature the same shadow for 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.399
 stay as close as possible beauty was 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.160
 people saved here in our plan the people 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.440
 will use I will duplicate this layer to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.090
 People see how it's going to work. 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.600
 end with the original 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.100
 I will work here only with the copy not 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 has no secret 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.440
 It's how we 're going to take that name here. 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.770
 the first one we can do the way the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.609
 The first way is to use the brush because 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.979
 the background is a community only of blue to 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.159
 people using a brush and using the same 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.780
 purpose of red applied in color and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.790
 coming here to find out what this 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.299
 probability we'll run 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.680
 I would paint this name here and it will disappear 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.200
 simple simple 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.760
 this is one of the ways people 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.430
 take that name 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.050
 understood without having to keep doing 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:32.680
 a lot of things get cut and lots of it 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.950
 thing rather clear fsi background had is 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.500
 other colors if you had several things 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.210
 this way it would not work any more than 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.950
 it's just a shade of red and 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.270
 it works even 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.030
 You can also take that name here. 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.119
 using the cut beauty tool to people 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.430
 Gonna bring it here. 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:02.560
 the whole name and make the cut 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.860
 name here beauty the cut is ready 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.800
 We know he's alert. 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.440
 He's going to take that white part of you. 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.430
 will paint red and will return to 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.620
 normal 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.420
 he has no secret these 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.120
 dotted here you're just trying 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.190
 rebuild up because it is so in 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.640
 white still 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.370
 It's ours - I'm not leaving today. 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.830
 one other way that I taught with 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.350
 brush is much easier when you have 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.240
 a tint understood why I left 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.300
 Like this, ney said this way. 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.040
 first how are we going to put the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.820
 text 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.850
 the text tool we will click and 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.410
 put the same beer logo font 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:53.640
 for example I'll put my name on the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:03:00.900
 white color on select here comes strawberry 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:03.110
 white ac is observational nuno the people 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.440
 It will change the font. 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.860
 same source appears the same as the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.140
 Beer is shocking it I'm going to leave 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.670
 in the video link description for you 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.530
 and if this source is on the site here 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.680
 Done source you often download put 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.840
 speed or fum with br 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.870
 this site you can download your 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.370
 forces have stories for things they have 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.170
 of beer has to have several beauty I 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.350
 I'll leave the application even though you 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.140
 can give goes looking for these sources is good 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.930
 in any correct position and stay the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.850
 Your name can come back here on the dot. 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.340
 and drag on high 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:57.120
 beauty move well centralized and let's 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.380
 here up here almost 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.380
 touching the p 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:09.570
 center the name as we go 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.910
 now put the shadow of the name and the 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.280
 bend to be the most similar 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.640
 possible with the original 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.510
 let's put the shadow in this text is 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:24.330
 twice on the name will open the styles 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.350
 of layers shouts of shadows 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.800
 designed and will put a shadow 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.880
 opacity we will use 100% to 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:39.660
 distance we will put and 10 to 11 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.020
 expanding the same thing from 10 to 11 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.390
 the size we can keep five 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.970
 because the size if you change it goes 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.490
 shadow style and it is not 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.280
 this effect we want people who are the 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.090
 effect equal to pain or beer 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.050
 so we can keep all five add up already 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.419
 is ready 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.130
 Did you see that you are the most similar? 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.640
 possible with us will do to 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.040
 Bending name upon layer 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.870
 text 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.130
 with the right button we come 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.950
 Distorting text will pop up this window 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:18.680
 in style we will put 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:22.160
 beauty flag has several kinds of 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.070
 contact here but the correct one is 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.960
 finisher that will happen if you put 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.750
 a lot of people just came here in the bend 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.510
 and leave more in the center 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.930
 as close as possible to see not only 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.150
 give a slight contraction even beauty 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.750
 Have you seen that practically 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.390
 same original it is clear that your 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.700
 customer is as if you are 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.940
 making some material for him 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.250
 It's him who changes only the name is simply 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.470
 This is going to be a lot of fun, you work so much 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.330
 well done but if you need to 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.910
 example change that part from below 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.610
 1888, you can do this anyway 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.790
 just kidding and if that gold 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:11.660
 brushing and writing doing the 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:14.690
 same coverage and you can change other 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.090
 things also this way beauty does not have 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.940
 No, no, it 's not that way, it's too much. 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.070
 easy to make this label has on 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.650

 this way here is as easy as possible 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.170
 we merge the two layers for us 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:38.230
 see if it looked like the original 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.370
 the bottom layer and the top layer 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.380

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:50.590
 size of the name that I stretched a lot 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:54.250
