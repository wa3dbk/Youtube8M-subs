00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.010
 ah 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.840
 hello how am I mÃ³nica for unai cole and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.790
 today we are going to learn how to do these 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.590
 paper flowers so pretty they serve 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 to decorate the gifts or any 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.610
 thing that you want what you're going to 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.960
 need is colored paper those that 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.050
 you like them or they stick with what 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.050
 go make scissors and a pencil 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.710
 Well, you take the first paper 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.590
 and what we are going to do is cut back a 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.170
 small square 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.680
 and we can do it look we put a 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.950
 about a third of the folio and 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.950
 half 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.100
 you can measure with the rule if you want 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.010
 so 15 centimeters by 15 20 by 20 what 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.030
 that you want but square 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.030
 we cut it 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.110
 and what we 're going to do is draw a 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.430
 spiral inside this square 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.810
 starting from the center outward 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.810
 as if it were a snail you see 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.010
 try to be asymmetric 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.150
 and well you already have it you do not have to 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.070
 occupy all the square that you had 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.380
 cut 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.120
 there you have it to be able to be with pencil and not 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.250
 Mark a lot so you do not see 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.250
 well, we started to cut back 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.060
 you do one side and you have to cut back 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.310
 the other following the whole spiral 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.810
 as you approach the center, it is a 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.820
 little harder and you have to go more 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.619
 careful but with scissors you can 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.740
 do well then we have this spiral 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.000
 as you see 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.110
 it looks like an orange or potato cover 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.939
 well then what we are going to do is 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.380
 take it in the middle and take this 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.320
 little piece that has stayed here as a 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.820
 little ball and then hirai about himself what 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.539
 doubles is a little bit you make a little 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.610
 cone and on the cone we are going around 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.610
 rolling the rest of the paper strip 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.340
 you have to go squeezing well with your hand 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.180
 that holds the flower so that it stays 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.120
 marked the wave that makes the paper 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.079
 you can do it like I do or do 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.079
 the other side as you want 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.110
 it is clear that these flowers or roses 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.120
 You can make them the size you want 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.370
 human with a longer spiral or more 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.010
 It is cut or with the widest petals or 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.900
 closer is what I'm doing 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.200
 It has approximately one centimeter of 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.120
 wide every petal the strip we go the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.459
 spiral 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.170
 conroy eyes to the end that stays 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.170
 well marked the crease of the paper 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.680
 well, we almost arrived, you see 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.310
 here you learn, it's worth staying the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.600
 form and now you're going to drop loose 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.210
 then you have a little more open 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.350
 the flower and the petals are marked more 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.020
 what are we going to do so that we do not know 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.790
 open choose the end of the outside the 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.230
 outside and we paste it with a little bit of 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.230
 glue to the flower 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.500
 it does not have to be perfect because 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.280
 It will not look good because here you have it 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.819
 we have done the first 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.499
 we make a second 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.409
 in this case in yellow we have chosen 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:37.049
 the paper and now let's make one in 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.909
 red color are very nice too if 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.620
 you make them on newspaper or in 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.920
 magazine paper that you sure have 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.019
 by house they give a more rustic air more 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.639
 vintage is very pretty in the truth and 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.989
 It is also a paper that doubles enough 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.690
 well the newspaper is pretty 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.730
 manageable 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.470
 Well, here we have our three 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.260
 rositas and what we are going to do is 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.510
 decorate a box as an ornament in this 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.100
 case we take a gift box or the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.290
 wrap problems previously with the 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.910
 paper that you want and we are going to put a 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.610
 little bit of a hundred to this cord is called 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.320
 bakers point we give several turns 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.320
 to one side and to the other 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.690
 we turn in the bottom to 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.690
 do it to the other side 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.049
 and there it is 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.030
 good here in tastes you can also 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.770
 put a ribbon or tie or nothing 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.400
 simply the little flowers on the 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.810
 package will be very good 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.810
 cut and tamos 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.450
 and so the knot will not be seen because it's going to 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.550
 be at the bottom in the part 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.470
 from above we will put our flowers 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.940
 you can do them centered are a 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.070
 corner as you like 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.720
 Well, you put them on top of the 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.160
 gift to see how they are when the 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.970
 put in the order that you like 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.970
 before gluing 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:01.379
 Well, with a little bit of glue 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.269
 in a bar or a glue or a glue 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.829
 liquid glue if you want a ribbon 

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:08.269
 double-sided we are going to have them 

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:08.269
 to dry well so they do not fall 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.599
 he squeezes them a little bit in the middle 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.840
 because there comes the finger to be able 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.840
 to tight 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.120
 and well it 's here we have our 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.120
 box with flowers 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.270
 you can add if you want a label of 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.680
 thank you like this one or a 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.030
 label with the name of the person to 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.980
 which is the gift addressed 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.270
 I hope you liked it and that it 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.190
 encourage them to do them because they are very 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.060
 easy you can do them even with
