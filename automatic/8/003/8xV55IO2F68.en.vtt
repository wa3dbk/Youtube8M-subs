00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
stiff the unique thing about this that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.530 
stiff the unique thing about this that
contradicts<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.280> stiffness<00:00:40.790> and<00:00:41.000> the

performance qualities of it is that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.950 
performance qualities of it is that
you've<00:00:43.160> got<00:00:43.340> compliance<00:00:43.850> in<00:00:44.030> this<00:00:44.180> frame<00:00:44.540> here

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
you've got compliance in this frame here

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.229 
you've got compliance in this frame here
this<00:00:45.440> frame<00:00:45.710> here<00:00:46.129> actually<00:00:46.520> absorbs<00:00:47.090> a<00:00:47.210> lot

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
this frame here actually absorbs a lot

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.930 
this frame here actually absorbs a lot
of<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.600> road<00:00:47.750> vibrations<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.730> makes<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:49.850> a

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
of the road vibrations and makes it a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.250 
of the road vibrations and makes it a
much<00:00:50.059> smoother<00:00:50.450> ride<00:00:50.600> so<00:00:50.780> you're<00:00:50.899> not<00:00:50.989> getting

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
much smoother ride so you're not getting

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.860 
much smoother ride so you're not getting
fatigued<00:00:51.649> near<00:00:52.039> as<00:00:52.160> much<00:00:52.660> another<00:00:53.660> thing

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
fatigued near as much another thing

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.240 
fatigued near as much another thing
everybody<00:00:54.379> had<00:00:54.530> questions<00:00:54.920> about<00:00:55.010> the

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
everybody had questions about the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.049 
everybody had questions about the
aerodynamics<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:56.649> why<00:00:57.649> do<00:00:57.710> we<00:00:57.829> disputed<00:00:58.460> so

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
aerodynamics and why do we disputed so

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.600 
aerodynamics and why do we disputed so
we<00:00:59.180> actually<00:00:59.329> took<00:00:59.570> it<00:00:59.690> to<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.840> wind<00:01:00.079> tunnel<00:01:00.260> and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
we actually took it to a wind tunnel and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.010 
we actually took it to a wind tunnel and
this<00:01:01.610> actually<00:01:01.820> performs<00:01:02.420> slightly<00:01:02.870> better

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
this actually performs slightly better

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.660 
this actually performs slightly better
than<00:01:03.140> a<00:01:03.350> solid<00:01:03.649> cylinder<00:01:03.920> tube<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:04.430> we<00:01:04.550> were

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
than a solid cylinder tube so we were

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.490 
than a solid cylinder tube so we were
very<00:01:04.820> pleased<00:01:05.180> with<00:01:05.330> that<00:01:05.360> it's<00:01:05.960> not<00:01:06.200> enough

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
very pleased with that it's not enough

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.620 
very pleased with that it's not enough
to<00:01:06.530> brag<00:01:06.860> about<00:01:07.160> so<00:01:07.490> it's<00:01:07.789> a<00:01:07.850> non-issue<00:01:08.030> for<00:01:08.330> us

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
to brag about so it's a non-issue for us

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.399 
to brag about so it's a non-issue for us
so<00:01:09.170> we<00:01:09.310> 1.8<00:01:10.310> pales<00:01:10.610> super<00:01:11.420> fast<00:01:11.659> super<00:01:11.930> stiff

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
so we 1.8 pales super fast super stiff

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.520 
so we 1.8 pales super fast super stiff
extremely<00:01:13.369> responsive<00:01:14.000> now<00:01:14.990> as<00:01:15.110> far<00:01:15.290> as<00:01:15.409> the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
extremely responsive now as far as the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.480 
extremely responsive now as far as the
strength<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.100> look<00:01:16.250> at<00:01:16.340> this<00:01:16.430> you

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
strength and you look at this you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.980 
strength and you look at this you
wouldn't<00:01:16.760> expect<00:01:16.909> this<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.360> be<00:01:17.390> very<00:01:17.479> strong

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
wouldn't expect this to be very strong

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.499 
wouldn't expect this to be very strong
how<00:01:18.260> strong<00:01:18.290> is<00:01:18.799> this<00:01:19.299> typically<00:01:20.299> they're

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
how strong is this typically they're

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.670 
how strong is this typically they're
going<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.689> say<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:20.990> ten<00:01:21.170> times<00:01:21.350> stronger

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
going to say it's ten times stronger

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.590 
going to say it's ten times stronger
than<00:01:21.860> steel<00:01:22.220> one<00:01:23.030> thing<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:23.330> we<00:01:23.420> did<00:01:23.540> was

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
than steel one thing that we did was

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.090 
than steel one thing that we did was

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
a noodle e-bike it is super stiff you

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.880 
a noodle e-bike it is super stiff you
can<00:01:44.180> use<00:01:44.329> this<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.570> sprint<00:01:45.049> you<00:01:45.590> can<00:01:45.740> use<00:01:45.860> it

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
can use this to sprint you can use it

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.499 
can use this to sprint you can use it
for<00:01:46.130> touring<00:01:46.490> we<00:01:46.610> think<00:01:46.939> this<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.240> real

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
for touring we think this is a real
