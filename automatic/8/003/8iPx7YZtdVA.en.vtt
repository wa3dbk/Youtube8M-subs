00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
right so this is a demo of the echo loop

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:16.400 
right so this is a demo of the echo loop
feature<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:06.529> dns<00:00:07.529> 1200<00:00:08.929> here<00:00:09.929> we<00:00:10.050> go<00:00:15.410> my

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
feature on the dns 1200 here we go my

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:29.200 
feature on the dns 1200 here we go my
children<00:00:16.770> read<00:00:17.220> my<00:00:17.490> chest<00:00:17.820> you're<00:00:18.690> my<00:00:18.840> type

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.810 

alright<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.599> happens<00:00:30.930> is<00:00:31.400> when<00:00:32.400> you<00:00:32.550> turn

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
alright so what happens is when you turn

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.180 
alright so what happens is when you turn
the<00:00:32.850> jog<00:00:33.450> while<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.440> turn<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.680> Jaguar

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the jog while as you turn the Jaguar

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.100 
the jog while as you turn the Jaguar
gets<00:00:35.520> clockwise<00:00:36.030> you'll<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.629> this<00:00:36.809> meter

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
gets clockwise you'll see this meter

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.970 
gets clockwise you'll see this meter
here<00:00:37.410> filling<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:38.120> see<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.739> when<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.829> gets

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
here filling up see that when it gets

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.860 
here filling up see that when it gets
all<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> way<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.400> the<00:00:41.640> end<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.030> echo<00:00:42.420> becomes

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
all the way to the end the echo becomes

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.340 
all the way to the end the echo becomes
a<00:00:43.020> loop<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:44.480> then<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.839> change<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
a loop and then you can change the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.920 
a loop and then you can change the
parameter<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.980> make<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.400> one<00:00:47.790> to<00:00:47.940> beat<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
parameter to make it a one to beat a to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
parameter to make it a one to beat a to
loop<00:00:49.199> for<00:00:50.040> loop<00:00:51.110> 18<00:00:52.110> quarter<00:00:52.890> half<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.879> beat

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
loop for loop 18 quarter half a beat

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
loop for loop 18 quarter half a beat
there<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.019> go<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.350> we're<00:00:55.470> gonna<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.680> this
