00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and like you said luchas Purefoy who we

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.020 
and like you said luchas Purefoy who we
know<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:04.890> he<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> cornerback

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
know what he can do a cornerback

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.540 
know what he can do a cornerback
he's<00:02:06.390> all-american<00:02:06.630> candidate<00:02:07.440> there<00:02:07.770> I

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
he's all-american candidate there I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.160 
he's all-american candidate there I
don't<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.240> that<00:02:09.539> we're<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:09.990> to<00:02:10.050> have

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
don't know that we're just going to have

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.900 
don't know that we're just going to have
to<00:02:10.200> continue<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.220> monitor<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.790> as

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
to continue to kind of monitor that as

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.940 
to continue to kind of monitor that as
we<00:02:12.090> move<00:02:12.120> forward<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.780> still<00:02:13.319> think<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.830> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
we move forward I still think that the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.670 
we move forward I still think that the
plan<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.610> get<00:02:14.790> him<00:02:15.000> some<00:02:15.380> action<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.440> both

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
plan is to get him some action on both

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.559 
plan is to get him some action on both
sides<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.220> ball<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:18.120> know<00:02:18.209> he<00:02:18.360> worked

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
sides of the ball but you know he worked

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.840 
sides of the ball but you know he worked
there<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.380> receiver<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.250> spring<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> lot

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
there in that receiver in spring a lot

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.460 
there in that receiver in spring a lot
so<00:02:21.000> they've<00:02:21.569> seen<00:02:21.840> him<00:02:21.990> there<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.350> it's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so they've seen him there so it's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.870 
so they've seen him there so it's
probably<00:02:22.709> not<00:02:22.950> imperative<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.520> they<00:02:23.700> work

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
probably not imperative that they work

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.880 
probably not imperative that they work
in<00:02:24.030> their<00:02:24.209> life<00:02:24.420> Paul<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.709> may

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
in their life Paul but I think we may

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.410 
in their life Paul but I think we may
still<00:02:26.130> see<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:26.670> campus<00:02:27.060> they<00:02:27.150> got<00:02:27.270> some

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
still see that in campus they got some

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.479 
still see that in campus they got some
special<00:02:27.660> teams<00:02:27.989> work<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.500> both<00:02:28.830> today<00:02:29.310> and

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
special teams work in both today and

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.420 
special teams work in both today and
yesterday<00:02:29.819> during<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.690> scrimmage<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.430> last

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
yesterday during the scrimmage and last

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.670 
yesterday during the scrimmage and last
weekend<00:02:32.790> Caleb<00:02:33.090> surgical<00:02:33.750> 58<00:02:34.200> yard<00:02:34.410> field

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
weekend Caleb surgical 58 yard field

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.229 
weekend Caleb surgical 58 yard field
goal<00:02:34.709> from<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.010> Miami<00:02:35.310> Dolphins<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:36.060> think

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
goal from the Miami Dolphins I think

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.760

Austin heart has a stronger leg of the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.590 
Austin heart has a stronger leg of the
two<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:11.160> it's<00:03:11.340> still<00:03:11.700> an<00:03:11.820> open<00:03:11.910> camp<00:03:12.329> but<00:03:12.510> you

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
two so it's still an open camp but you

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.850 
two so it's still an open camp but you
know<00:03:12.720> right<00:03:12.900> now<00:03:13.079> Austin<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.560> heart<00:03:13.739> and

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
know right now Austin the heart and

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.710 
know right now Austin the heart and
seems<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.220> maybe<00:03:14.820> be<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.090> little<00:03:15.180> bit<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
seems to maybe be a little bit in the
