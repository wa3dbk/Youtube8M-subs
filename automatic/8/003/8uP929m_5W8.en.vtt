00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.690
 so well, guys, well, basically everything 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.690
 It turned out as you see 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:17.500
 then I put it really 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:22.789
 the supply was warming 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.890
 water jet column showed 55 degrees 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.939
 the water was pretty hot 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:34.929
 afraid that the plastic will crack again here but 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:38.319
 held somewhere about 5 minutes probably 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:45.370
 then took a stool but bed 

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:48.110
 towel and light taps our 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.550
 a blog 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.190
 from there fell out and all the same it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.129
 constriction 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.530
 played its role and eased us 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.920
 pulling out because literally like 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.800
 only he became 1 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:14.869
 but the cola is 5 millimeters he just himself 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:19.530
 stood out and everything is so all that 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.930
 it turned out pretty good so 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:28.070
 our further actions which means we 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.920
 now we will pull out of here 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.530
 plasticine put now somewhere on 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.720
 half an hour and the refrigerator is plasticine under 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:43.140
 froze something and it was easier from there 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.380
 pull out the weight turned out pretty 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.190
 decent obviously more kilos and this 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.610
 despite the fact that here is the middle you see 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.610
 here 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:02:03.450
 insert inserted and then show here 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:09.619
 such a back is empty which is pretty 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.619
 it will turn out so heavy 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.619
 turned out 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.170
 in principle, in principle, you can even this 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.590
 capacity further and do not use launder 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.530
 her 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.720
 and leave for the next time next 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.370
 fill of course if such containers have 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.129
 there are a few of us there you can leave 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.870
 one under the fill 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.730
 Here, let the mat fuck bursts 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.760
 this principle will not be important for us 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.239
 that we take out the block being processed and 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:55.349
 we insert already normal neat 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:56.640
 the capacity here is the capacity I like everything 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.840
 can still come 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:05.760
 blue couple very comfortable so near 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:09.120
 left in general look further now 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.030
 Now I will take care of when all 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.099
 I will process everything 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.099
 how and what will come of it 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.370
 guys well what is the most tedious part of the work 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.370
 is finished 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:34.090
 built impersonal by the way everyone 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.480
 I recommend to put 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:42.700
 the shape of the refrigerator before recovery 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:47.350
 plasticine because he then not 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.400
 smeared does not stretch minutes remains 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.290
 more or less normal 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:00.640
 the volume is plasticine here which is not 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.640
 I know you understand it is not clear but a lot 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.390
 here we have what I told you 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.680
 formulas hope inside 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.680
 hollow for weight relief 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:26.479
 used her for that two packs 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:30.370
 cigarettes shook just to me 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:34.370
 for advertising as they say not attracted 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.300
 tobacco products here but you can not 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.120
 to wrap up just wrap with duct tape 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.260
 why boomers and when because about 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.180
 extract I just cut it and 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.080
 freely pulled out if here was 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.900
 some kind of plastic I know something else with 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.340
 the cure would be problems and then no 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:03.860
 problems cut down gnawed out and threw out 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:05.610
 here it will not use paper or 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:11.840
 cardboard for 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:14.370
 such charter chick means that now 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.830
 handle it to look like 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.930
 more or less beautiful and I also want to draw 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.060
 Your attention to the quality of the fill see 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.780
 everything 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.689
 with air bubbles turned out though 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:34.050
 tried and knocked 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:42.419
 after pouring however either 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:46.379
 is the quality of alabaster and does not even know 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:50.539
 what's the matter well in general something like this for those 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:58.669
 species that are small 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:06:02.479
 not particularly inclined to gnaw is uncritical 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.479
 there are types that are just 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:11.819
 This is a gnawing gnaw, but again 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.099
 is it not critical bullets gnaw what is not 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:19.279
 pro make themselves extra moves 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:22.770
 somehow it will spoil us nothing 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:25.680
 the main thing that they have not climbed here 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:31.199
 here in the humidification chamber and everything else 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.379
 it doesn't matter to us 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:36.270
 exit to the arena 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:38.479
 has not begun processing will look 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.960
 maybe here I will make one more of them in the arena 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:47.060
 so that they do not push through 1 or so 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:51.439
 and leave everything in general now 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:54.770
 I process the result I will show 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:54.770
 look further
