00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:12.490
 but if you graduated you attended 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:16.100
 college in the 70's was not me in 3 69 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.890
 took the time of the brave dictatorship in the photo 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.130
 militancy at that time and systems 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:26.990
 I joined the party at 73 I went 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:32.540
 called by the arise my friend 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:36.920
 party and I found that one 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.660
 more or less my proposal 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.630
 number because at the same time 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:49.400
 meets the need I had for myself 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.260
 to express the revolt at the situation and 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.570
 my political conscience and such 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.840
 at the same time it was also a party of 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:03.800
 left of the profile is a profile 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.840
 we call it prudent let's say it's the 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.690
 I always leave when I'm already in 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.970
 there had been a division between the 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.190
 was the armed struggle but did not share 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:19.300
 has always been guided by prudence and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:23.030
 a modesty to use days as soon as 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.950
 sometimes I did not even agree very much with 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.840
 But for me it was good too because 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.940
 I was a bit of a bitch, I did not like it either. 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.680
 much of the idea of â€‹â€‹taking up arms and leaving 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.530
 there amelie faced each agent had 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 work in the union is not 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.170
 I had our idea was to help 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.549
 unions to understand the work of the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.190
 journalist and campaign adviser 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.710
 with something as necessary as a doctor 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.790
 dental practitioner and services with 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.020
 that the trade union structure 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.540
 was related to mass of 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.369
 workers did not call the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:07.100
 worker to join and I 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.119
 attractive is that we have dentists 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.969
 have a lawyer 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.529
 and this type of trade unionism began to 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:14.719
 show signs of tiredness 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:16.220
 back in the late 1970s with ads 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:19.700
 started 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.430
 the movements are all in abc and this 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.280
 politicization of this republicanization of 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.740
 union movement has brought the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.840
 also from gt to have a service of 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.840
 campaign advisory journalism 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.150
 more consistent in the then what we 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.400
 wanted with the oboe and got it was 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.330
 to simulate the trade unions to develop and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.360
 also have within their structure 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:54.709
 and its participation in the oboe, which is 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.430
 designed also attended the trade unions 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.010
 I created a lot of character for the category 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.020
 or I've worked on characters that have already 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.800
 existed as the home of the 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.370
 all 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:11.690
 I used to look comic like that and 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.790
 for the printed material that you 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.840
 face some kind of repression because 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.820
 in the time of heavy 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.940
 no repression had come before 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.100
 When we founded love, we already 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.180
 was in the aftermath of a great repression 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.120
 on top of the party was in 75 killed the 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.010
 admire plays but besides killing 69 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.640
 all my friends were stuck is just 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.340
 was not arrested because I fled when the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.470
 person who lived with me by the galley was 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.920
 I was arrested I was in my tava 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:54.200
 Ear already I went to hide and fled 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:59.060
 to where the holy spirit that no one 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:02.000
 me look at the jewelry brigade had 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.170
 girlfriend there I 'll be for everyone 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.840
 I would go to rio was the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:12.080
 spirit of cleverness and then I went there 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:17.229
 following how long a week or 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:20.510
 two and it was at this moment that they killed and 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.550
 practically afterwards began to see a 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.160
 a sign that the company was 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.660
 responding that this had been a 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.010
 kind of a border was crossed there and 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.890
 really was 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.400
 at the same time kill the final manual 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.970
 I think he did not raise so much emotion 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.200
 fact that they killed vladimir herzog 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.960
 was decisive 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.060
 the journalist worked in TV culture and 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.760
 he also had a position in the 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:54.950
 understandings among the forces that 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:58.640
 were on the stage at this time that was not 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.130
 so it could not be stirred like that, and the 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.690
 guys were upstairs knowing that 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.760
 and bet on a kind of upset 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.320
 that did not happen happened against 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.590
 because when I play 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.979
 the geisel took the opportunity to clean 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.630
 territory near him 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.940
 was a time when society 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.430
 also began to manifest itself through 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.000
 of the oab journalists' union 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.120
 Then and from the few I went lightening 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.490
 so I felt I could go back and I 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.419
 I felt that at least in prisons were not going 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:39.710
 continue and I returned it was started 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:44.270
 working to help politicians 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:48.260
 to compose small pieces of cards and 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.539
 things as soon as the deficit in could 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.310
 the will of the people to give 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:58.190
 one thing is enough to democratize the 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.940
 redemocratize the country to help 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.940
 in this idea
