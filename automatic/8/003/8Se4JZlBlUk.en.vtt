was<00:00:36.870> 1:1<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.579> I<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> first<00:00:39.239> half<00:00:39.540> I

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
was 1:1 and I think in the first half I

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.180 
was 1:1 and I think in the first half I
think<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.050> gotta<00:00:40.350> go<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.620> video<00:00:40.860> could<00:00:41.010> got<00:00:41.160> a
