whenever<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.850> fertilize<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.240> garden<00:00:06.720> it's

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
whenever you fertilize a garden it's

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.810 
whenever you fertilize a garden it's
important<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.529> know<00:00:07.770> what<00:00:08.189> your<00:00:08.370> fertilizer

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
important to know what your fertilizer

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.360 
important to know what your fertilizer
levels<00:00:09.330> are<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.870> start<00:00:10.230> with<00:00:10.469> because<00:00:10.950> if<00:00:11.250> you

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
levels are to start with because if you

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.669 
levels are to start with because if you
don't<00:00:11.639> know<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.300> you're<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:13.170> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.500> know

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
don't know that you're not going to know

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
don't know that you're not going to know
what<00:00:14.009> type<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.370> fertilizer<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.240> need<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.719> use

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
what type of fertilizer you need to use

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.040 
what type of fertilizer you need to use
for<00:00:16.740> example<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.609> garden<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.720> plenty

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
for example on this garden I have plenty

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.439 
for example on this garden I have plenty
of<00:00:19.199> phosphorus<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.010> potassium<00:00:20.210> which<00:00:21.210> are

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
of phosphorus and potassium which are

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.689 
of phosphorus and potassium which are
two<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> three<00:00:22.410> nutrients<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.189> normally

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
two of the three nutrients you normally

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.420 
two of the three nutrients you normally
need<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.210> garden<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> don't<00:00:25.920> need<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
need in a garden and so I don't need to

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.640 
need in a garden and so I don't need to
add<00:00:26.609> any<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.180> those<00:00:27.359> two<00:00:27.630> nutrients<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
add any of those two nutrients but I

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.339 
add any of those two nutrients but I
will<00:00:29.039> need<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.400> add<00:00:29.429> nitrogen<00:00:29.820> nitrogen<00:00:30.750> does

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
will need to add nitrogen nitrogen does

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.160 
will need to add nitrogen nitrogen does
not<00:00:31.560> stick<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> soil<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.059> therefore<00:00:34.020> you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
not stick to a soil and therefore you

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.680 
not stick to a soil and therefore you
normally<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.190> nitrogen<00:00:35.640> every<00:00:36.270> year

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
normally have to use nitrogen every year

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.319 
normally have to use nitrogen every year
and<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.649> that's<00:00:37.890> all<00:00:38.250> I'm<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.850> using

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and so that's all I'm going to be using

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.840 
and so that's all I'm going to be using
on<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.690> garden<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.469> year<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.640> this

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
on this garden for this year and in this

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.049 
on this garden for this year and in this
case<00:00:42.120> I'm<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.660> use<00:00:42.719> urea<00:00:43.320> which<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> 46

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
case I'm going to use urea which is a 46

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.380 
case I'm going to use urea which is a 46
-<00:00:45.329> OH<00:00:45.660> -<00:00:45.690> oh<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.829> first<00:00:47.309> number<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.879> always<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
- OH - oh that first number is always a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.200 
- OH - oh that first number is always a
percent<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.899> nitrogen<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.559> when<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> says<00:00:50.550> 46

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
percent of nitrogen and when it says 46

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.799 
percent of nitrogen and when it says 46
it<00:00:51.420> means<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.780> 46<00:00:52.440> percent<00:00:53.129> nitrogen<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it means it's 46 percent nitrogen that

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.660 
it means it's 46 percent nitrogen that
means<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.739> about<00:00:55.860> half<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.550> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
means that about half of this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.779 
means that about half of this
fertilizers<00:00:57.390> nitrogen<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.370> here

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
fertilizers nitrogen what I have in here

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.790 
fertilizers nitrogen what I have in here
is<00:00:59.850> enough<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.539> cover<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.930> whole<00:01:01.170> garden<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
is enough to cover this whole garden and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
is enough to cover this whole garden and
that'll<00:01:02.430> put<00:01:02.609> down<00:01:02.879> about<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> pound<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that'll put down about a pound of

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.840 
that'll put down about a pound of
nitrogen<00:01:04.439> per<00:01:04.470> thousand<00:01:05.100> square<00:01:05.339> feet<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
nitrogen per thousand square feet and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.630 
nitrogen per thousand square feet and
again<00:01:06.659> that's<00:01:07.080> all<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> need<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.340> garden

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
again that's all I need for this garden

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.539 
again that's all I need for this garden
this<00:01:09.390> year<00:01:09.750> unless<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.350> some<00:01:10.710> side<00:01:11.040> dressing

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
this year unless I do some side dressing

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.420 
this year unless I do some side dressing
later<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> year<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.619> nitrogen

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
later in the year this is just nitrogen

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.600 
later in the year this is just nitrogen
and<00:01:14.610> nitrogen<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.869> dissolve<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.500> water

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
and nitrogen will dissolve in water

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.700 
and nitrogen will dissolve in water
therefore<00:01:17.610> once<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> down<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.530> you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
therefore once you have it down all you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.770 
therefore once you have it down all you
need<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> water<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.060> it'll<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.509> in

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
need to do is water it in it'll be in

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.770 
need to do is water it in it'll be in
the<00:01:21.900> soil<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.220> also<00:01:23.460> added<00:01:24.150> phosphorus

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the soil if you also added phosphorus

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.700 
the soil if you also added phosphorus
and<00:01:24.930> potassium

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and potassium

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.609 
and potassium
those<00:01:26.610> two<00:01:26.909> nutrients<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.350> tilled

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
those two nutrients do need to be tilled

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.710 
those two nutrients do need to be tilled
in<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.790> move<00:01:30.150> into<00:01:30.329> soil

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
in because they do not move into soil

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.260 
in because they do not move into soil
well<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.100> once<00:01:32.430> you've<00:01:32.640> applied<00:01:32.790> those

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
well and so once you've applied those

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.910 
well and so once you've applied those
it's<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.659> good<00:01:33.810> idea<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.229> go<00:01:34.500> ahead<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it's a good idea to go ahead and

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.399 
it's a good idea to go ahead and
rototill<00:01:35.460> those<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.229> them

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
rototill those in so you can get them

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.260 
rototill those in so you can get them
down<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> where<00:01:37.829> those<00:01:38.159> roots<00:01:38.549> will<00:01:38.850> be<00:01:38.880> more

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
down to where those roots will be more

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.719 
down to where those roots will be more
likely<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.689> contact<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:41.280> I'm<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
likely to contact them now I'm going to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.819 
likely to contact them now I'm going to
start<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.180> few<00:01:42.240> feet<00:01:42.720> back<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> beginning

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
start a few feet back from the beginning

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.469 
start a few feet back from the beginning
of<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> garden<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.060> throw<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
of the garden because it will throw it

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.870 
of the garden because it will throw it
out<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.869> front<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.350> me<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.250> don't<00:01:47.310> want<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
out in front of me and I don't want to

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.520 
out in front of me and I don't want to
have<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> skip<00:01:48.479> right<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.990> beginning<00:01:49.350> of

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
have a skip right at the beginning of

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:58.150 
have a skip right at the beginning of
the<00:01:49.619> garden
