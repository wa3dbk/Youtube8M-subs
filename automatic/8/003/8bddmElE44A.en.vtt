00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
point spread that I'm seeing in this

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.500 
point spread that I'm seeing in this
game<00:02:35.599> today<00:02:35.840> why<00:02:36.500> because<00:02:37.069> I<00:02:37.190> see<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.580> defensive

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
game today why because I see a defensive

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.039 
game today why because I see a defensive
struggle<00:02:38.930> between<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.760> number<00:02:41.209> one<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.720> for

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
struggle between the number one and for

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.680 
struggle between the number one and for
two<00:02:42.290> ranked<00:02:42.620> defenses<00:02:43.489> in<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.700> country<00:02:44.090> I

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
two ranked defenses in the country I

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.410 
two ranked defenses in the country I
think<00:02:45.079> a<00:02:45.170> point2<00:02:45.890> points3<00:02:46.280> points<00:02:46.970> are<00:02:47.060> all

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
think a point2 points3 points are all

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.870 
think a point2 points3 points are all
that<00:02:47.810> separates<00:02:48.349> these<00:02:48.799> two<00:02:48.860> these<00:02:49.370> two<00:02:49.430> teams

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
that separates these two these two teams

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.089 
that separates these two these two teams
and<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.390> think<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.840> this<00:02:51.019> game<00:02:51.140> can<00:02:51.590> actually

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
and I think that this game can actually

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.470 
and I think that this game can actually
go<00:02:52.310> either<00:02:52.579> way<00:02:52.880> um<00:02:53.950> two<00:02:54.950> great<00:02:55.370> kickers<00:02:56.000> also

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
go either way um two great kickers also

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.479 
go either way um two great kickers also
i<00:02:56.660> would<00:02:56.840> say<00:02:57.110> like<00:02:57.290> Alabama's<00:02:57.920> got<00:02:58.069> tipping

i would say like Alabama's got tipping

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.369 
i would say like Alabama's got tipping

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.580 
run about a 4-3 that's pretty much a
prerequisite<00:03:44.359> of<00:03:44.480> being<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.840> skill<00:03:45.169> position

player<00:03:45.829> in<00:03:45.859> Florida<00:03:46.400> so<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:46.760> think<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.180> game

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
player in Florida so I think this game

player in Florida so I think this game
is<00:03:47.419> a<00:03:47.599> coin<00:03:48.019> flip<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.560> in<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.739> coin<00:03:48.950> flip<00:03:49.160> we

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
is a coin flip and in a coin flip we

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.250 
is a coin flip and in a coin flip we
always<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.030> just<00:03:50.299> take<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.720> points<00:03:51.109> and
