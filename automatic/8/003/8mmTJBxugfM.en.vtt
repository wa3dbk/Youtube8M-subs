at<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.620> production<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.870> figured

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
at the production of this so I figured

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.979 
at the production of this so I figured
wouldn't<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.190> be<00:03:33.310> interesting<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.720> rather

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
wouldn't it be interesting and rather

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.720 
wouldn't it be interesting and rather
ironic<00:03:35.650> if<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:37.320> auctioned<00:03:38.320> off<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.859> limited

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
ironic if I auctioned off a limited

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.480 
ironic if I auctioned off a limited
edition<00:03:39.880> of

edition of

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.060

world leaders the powerful and with that

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.090 
world leaders the powerful and with that

money we celebrate the powerless and
there's<00:03:47.910> also<00:03:48.090> an<00:03:48.450> interesting<00:03:48.690> irony

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
there's also an interesting irony

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.010 
there's also an interesting irony
because<00:03:49.740> some<00:03:50.490> of<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.940> world<00:03:51.600> leaders<00:03:51.810> I
