00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
I explained it earlier there's a bracket

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.430 
I explained it earlier there's a bracket
here<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.950> this<00:03:43.100> has<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.550> fit<00:03:43.760> in<00:03:44.260> it<00:03:45.260> has<00:03:45.410> a

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
here that this has to fit in it has a

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.640 
here that this has to fit in it has a
mechanism<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.610> that's<00:03:47.210> opening<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.410> then<00:03:48.590> you

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
mechanism to that's opening and then you

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.940 
mechanism to that's opening and then you
shut<00:03:48.860> it<00:03:48.890> down<00:03:49.100> to<00:03:49.340> lock<00:03:49.460> it<00:03:49.670> in<00:03:49.790> in<00:03:50.420> place<00:03:50.950> so

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
shut it down to lock it in in place so

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.000 
shut it down to lock it in in place so
first<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.400> could<00:03:52.580> I<00:03:53.410> camera<00:03:54.410> right<00:03:55.040> here<00:03:57.010> good

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
first you could I camera right here good

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.750 
first you could I camera right here good
and<00:03:58.600> then<00:03:59.600> you<00:04:00.530> just<00:04:00.709> put<00:04:00.890> this<00:04:01.010> right<00:04:01.070> in<00:04:01.490> here

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
and then you just put this right in here
