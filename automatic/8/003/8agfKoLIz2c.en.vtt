00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hi everyone, I'm here with christian 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.680
 ilaria husband and wife in japan have 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.620
 tastes very different as you notice in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.750
 these decidedly Balkan days of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.160
 I like five more friends lists 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.050
 the technological side of japan tokyo 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.160
 we said in general regards me 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.470
 quarters said that maybe he has you 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
 hit the most so much that after all the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.180
 neighborhood but more precisely 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.890
 to shibuya fantastic the killing 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.050
 facinoli young colors 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 a larger pedestrian crossing 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.519
 in the world all those people really 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.730
 I leave myself amused with little by three 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:45.089
 months the area seen more the historical part e 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.579
 ancient then the temples the atmosphere la 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.430
 also craft things 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.469
 then the kimono processing these 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.809
 things so kyoto so let's say keep 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.000
 both liked I wanted more time for 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.570
 Turning on the mind list is love at first 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.879
 view 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.399
 yes yes yes yes also in the streets of 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.439
 kyoto maybe neighborhood pull with it 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.780
 calm but also all the streets 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.610
 that we did both in the city and outside 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.759
 to reach the temples they were all with 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.140
 a certain type of atmosphere too 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:17.670
 relaxing will not even be a way to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.259
 see the present also a bit of nature 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 in some restaurant a bit special 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.100
 a guy last night of Alcatraz 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.549
 sure to claudia between risks however it is not 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.000
 What a fantastic atmosphere really 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.250
 truly unique in the world in stoneware 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.720
 and to do as we are different to me 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.400
 example really enjoyed going to moles 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.020
 little restaurants their own 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.540
 those of the old ancient when we are 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.240
 we eat ramen sitting practically 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.070
 on that on a perch in the middle of the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.869
 street those people who just passed by 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.900
 with the bowl of he complained ancient 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.570
 as you can see it also remains I meant that 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.190
 it was fun and you married lists is 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.810
 also liked to come however also with 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.940
 group and how you found yourself in 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.110
 general then we simply are 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.080
 we prefer to stay together then we say 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.450
 together with the group together with others 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.690
 friends with whom to talk like that though 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.790
 despite all not 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.650
 we missed the gods 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.570
 share one of all travel dedication 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.280
 only to ourselves we say if then 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.520
 you are detached because you like free 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.000
 sure if we got where it was nice 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.590
 stay in a group then other other things 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.140
 when it was better to be alone perhaps 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.710
 made a ride on the other hand is completed 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.150
 freedom 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.060
 did you open some purchases from a 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.390
 particular in green areas or with a 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.710
 antique fan in front with a 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.540
 fan made with workmanship 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.380
 craft we bought some 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:49.810
 prints with drawings in gold then and then 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.810
 on the other hand, comics and gadgets 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.740
 load declared by the one piece shop 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.860
 so for all the fans it 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.500
 I consider some really beautiful 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.420
 akihabara hourly shops churches 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.790
 interested agatha christie are indeed 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.110
 in many technology stores for i 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.360
 sick technology 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.970
 if I could stick it in front of 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.860
 practically the davis ilaria commuter 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.020
 subsequent stores want kyoto barrels 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.120
 traditional exists yes yes okay me 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.090
 when i was most kids it was the game 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.460
 more manga I liked to see the thing that 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.680
 I was a bit disappointed that there is a lot 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.960
 for those who are going now 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.030
 in fashion then you find accounts is found 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.680
 naruto so I am sick of the 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.240
 clamp I had little luck because it is 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.860
 so big that you can't 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.959
 turn everything and find just that 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.430
 so you have to have one 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.350
 good guide say so 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.940
 and in any case also with the 15th note 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.900
 good guidance of those states 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.710
 toxins companions but nothing 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.990
 in fact the titan will succeed 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.390
 we really were lucky in the 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.100
 unfortunate that our friends are not there 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.750
 they know us and we had to postpone the 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.370
 our trip for work reasons the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.990
 so our honeymoon is there 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.640
 this at the end we say it was 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.230
 such as 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.250
 the honeymoon as soon as I saw it 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.720
 the opportunity did not let me pass 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.540
 okay thanks and then by 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.540
 next month's pressures in Japan 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.540
 thank you
