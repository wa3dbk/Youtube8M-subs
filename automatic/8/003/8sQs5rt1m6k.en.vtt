00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.350
 hello how are you I hope you are super 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.510
 super good I 'm happy to be another 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.480
 Friday with you today 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.830
 I bring a video about the hair and it's 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.140
 that I think most of the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 women and is that not all of us have a 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.040
 very big concern to have a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.899
 cute hair because we cool fast 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.540
 because I am healthy and many times 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:30.029
 We commit acts that do not think 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.640
 can damage our hair or 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.649
 stop the growth then that's why 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.649
 today I'm going to bring you some 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.570
 points of things we do wrong for 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.520
 our hair so if you want 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.220
 have beautiful and healthy hair 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.530
 stay watching this video we are going to 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.300
 start with something we do a lot 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.240
 wrong and that is when we want our 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.540
 hair grow we stop cutting that 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.310
 it's something quite bad because you 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.860
 hair by nature is going to go 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.930
 mistreating then let's say we have 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.320
 to prune our hair at least 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.210
 the tips every two months and really 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.060
 It works quite well because the more 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.010
 You are cutting more and you are growing obviously 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.440
 if you want your hair to be long 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.750
 you have to cut very little but for 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.180
 have a healthy growth is 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.180
 indispensable that you cut your hair 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.890
 another mistake that you may be committing 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.770
 is if your elaborate hairstyles very 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.900
 constantly pressed is super bad 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.750
 for you why because he elaborates his 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.880
 very tight hairstyles and last a long 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.510
 time with them then what you do 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.160
 is that this hairstyle exerts a lot 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.890
 pressure or in your hair and it will go 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.980
 weakening over time so it is 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.420
 very likely in the short or long term 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.420
 your hair is falling 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.330
 and you suffer from frizz the worst you can 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.310
 to do is to leave to bathe shake your 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.229
 hair with the towel that is lousy 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.810
 because the only thing you're going to cause is 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.120
 that the frizz appears so if you 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.340
 You look like that or you do not want frizz 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.100
 your hair I recommend you simply 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.490
 your wet hair and a towel you do 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:32.740
 pressure in this way without disturbing your 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:34.660
 mane, many people say that it is not 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.090
 It is advisable to brush your hair when 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.730
 It's still wet but if you brush it 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.640
 wet like me it is important that you change 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.800
 your brush for a tooth comb 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.260
 so you're going to avoid breaking and 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.000
 mistreating your hair is very very 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.760
 important that if you are 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.920
 constantly iron or tongs for the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.709
 hair do not abuse the temperature in 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.540
 the news and the new tools 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.320
 to comb us they surprise us with 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.150
 temperatures too high then what 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.980
 healthy for your hair is a temperature 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.519
 of 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.530
 120 and 150 degrees celsius do not pass if 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.150
 your hair is pretty rebellious or you 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.640
 Hair is Chinese and you want a graceful 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.519
 perfect it is preferable that you pass two 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.109
 times that a first time you expose to 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.109
 your hair at very high temperatures 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.660
 Y 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.690
 if you want beautiful hair and 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.300
 healthy is very important always the 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.940
 cleaning so like as regularly 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.190
 we wash our makeup brushes 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.680
 how we regularly change our 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.560
 toothbrush is very important too 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.590
 and wash and disinfect very well with 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.510
 antibacterial brushes and tongs of the 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.569
 worst things you can do for your 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.390
 hair is to use spray and your iron or 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.790
 pincer at the same time most of the 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.069
 aerosols contain alcohol then 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.069
 makes like the perfect chemistry so that 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.980
 mistreat your hair so much 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.890
 never never never use spray and have 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.930
 more at the same time and it is very important 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.690
 Also, always use a spray 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.690
 thermal to protect you from the heat 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.680
 Well, I hope you liked it a lot 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.470
 this video how can you see are things 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.930
 pretty obvious that we do but many 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.389
 Sometimes we do not put enough care and 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.509
 we commit those mistakes daily so 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.639
 so if you want beautiful hair 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.800
 healthy it is important that you stop 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.330
 do this and many of you 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.060
