full Jan mushrooms are sold but

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.390 
full Jan mushrooms are sold but
certainly<00:01:03.629> looking<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> combat<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.739> we

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
certainly looking at the combat here we

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
certainly looking at the combat here we
have<00:01:05.549> Auto<00:01:05.820> troop<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.600> i<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.840> my

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
have Auto troop because i have my

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.570 
have Auto troop because i have my
service<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.100> still<00:01:08.280> something

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
service can see it's still something

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.380 
service can see it's still something
very<00:01:09.000> weird<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.630> i<00:01:09.750> think<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.110> shouldn't<00:01:10.560> do

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.060 

essentially<00:01:15.390> what<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.689> doing<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.110> allows<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
essentially what it's doing is allows it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
essentially what it's doing is allows it
is<00:01:17.189> true<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> bow<00:01:18.210> from<00:01:18.720> like

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
is true with the bow from like

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.520 
is true with the bow from like
point-blank<00:01:19.920> range<00:01:20.549> yet<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.720> also<00:01:21.960> attack

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
point-blank range yet you also attack

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.590 
point-blank range yet you also attack
with<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> dagger<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.610> seem<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.090> alternate

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
with the dagger so you seem to alternate

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.810 
with the dagger so you seem to alternate
between<00:01:24.630> hitting<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> dagger<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
between hitting with the dagger and the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.840 
between hitting with the dagger and the
foe<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:28.080> looks<00:01:28.799> very<00:01:28.920> weird<00:01:29.490> when<00:01:29.700> you're

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
foe it looks very weird when you're

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.170 
foe it looks very weird when you're
doing<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.540> i<00:01:31.470> think<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.670> shouldn't<00:01:33.030> be

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
doing it and i think you shouldn't be

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.719 
doing it and i think you shouldn't be
able<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.540> do<00:01:33.860> i'm<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.070> sure<00:01:35.130> why<00:01:35.549> it's

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
able to do i'm not sure why it's

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
able to do i'm not sure why it's
actually<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.619> both

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
actually in there that you can do both

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.090 
actually in there that you can do both
like<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.060> keeps<00:01:39.689> shooting<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.909> while<00:01:43.100> that's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
like it keeps shooting a while that's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.789 
like it keeps shooting a while that's
just<00:01:44.729> something<00:01:45.210> i<00:01:45.600> think<00:01:45.659> needs<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.259> fixed

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
just something i think needs to be fixed

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.620 
just something i think needs to be fixed
I<00:01:46.920> mean<00:01:47.280> other<00:01:47.460> people<00:01:47.549> might<00:01:48.060> think<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
I mean other people might think it's a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.020 
I mean other people might think it's a
good<00:01:48.869> thing<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.710> more<00:01:50.100> damage<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.850> bow

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
good thing I do more damage with my bow

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450 
good thing I do more damage with my bow
so<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.479> allows<00:01:51.780> me<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.229> more<00:01:52.500> effective<00:01:53.310> in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
so it allows me to be more effective in

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:04.110 
so it allows me to be more effective in
combat

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:12.280 

alright<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:09.619> we<00:02:10.009> have<00:02:10.039> whatever<00:02:10.880> we<00:02:11.240> needed<00:02:11.480> so

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
alright so we have whatever we needed so

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.699 
alright so we have whatever we needed so
where<00:02:12.500> do<00:02:12.590> we<00:02:12.680> have<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.860> go<00:02:13.160> with<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.400> now<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:14.709> can

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
where do we have to go with it now I can

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.580 
where do we have to go with it now I can
we<00:02:15.920> go<00:02:16.040> back<00:02:16.250> here<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:17.030> firstly<00:02:17.900> there<00:02:18.560> is

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
we go back here but firstly there is

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.620 
we go back here but firstly there is
this<00:02:18.920> functions<00:02:19.370> have<00:02:19.610> which<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.150> think<00:02:20.330> needs

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
this functions have which I think needs

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.530 
this functions have which I think needs
to<00:02:20.750> be<00:02:20.870> broken<00:02:21.170> down<00:02:21.380> into<00:02:22.000> kind<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.120> separate

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
to be broken down into kind of separate

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.350 
to be broken down into kind of separate
things<00:02:23.720> as<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:25.040> is<00:02:25.310> broken<00:02:25.730> down<00:02:25.910> safely

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
things as it is broken down safely

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.600 
things as it is broken down safely
around<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.900> map<00:02:27.110> but<00:02:27.620> if<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.160> look<00:02:28.340> at<00:02:28.459> the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
around the map but if we look at the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.850 
around the map but if we look at the
items<00:02:28.850> store<00:02:29.420> here<00:02:29.600> because<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.530> free<00:02:30.709> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
items store here because this is free to

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
lag or anything it was running about 200

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.500 
lag or anything it was running about 200
FPS<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.980> that's<00:04:31.190> with<00:04:31.370> all<00:04:31.550> settings<00:04:31.880> on<00:04:32.270> high
