in this first video we'll show you how
to<00:00:26.689> correctly<00:00:27.349> measure<00:00:27.680> for<00:00:28.070> your<00:00:28.130> radiator

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699

government but before we get started it

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.040 
government but before we get started it
would<00:00:34.280> be<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:34.489> really<00:00:34.940> good<00:00:35.090> idea<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.480> have<00:00:35.840> to

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
would be a really good idea to have to

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.210 
would be a really good idea to have to
hand<00:00:36.290> a<00:00:36.620> notepad<00:00:37.399> pen<00:00:38.239> or<00:00:38.840> pencil<00:00:39.220> tape

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.630 

finally<00:01:43.910> we'll<00:01:44.240> measure<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.570> depth<00:01:45.490> let's<00:01:46.490> do

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
finally we'll measure the depth let's do

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.990 
finally we'll measure the depth let's do
this<00:01:46.850> place<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.360> book<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.200> surfaces<00:01:49.000> and

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
this place the book of the surfaces and

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.410 
this place the book of the surfaces and
measure

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.360 

we<00:01:59.990> should<00:02:00.200> now<00:02:00.380> have<00:02:00.409> free<00:02:01.130> measurements

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
we should now have free measurements

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.850 
we should now have free measurements
which<00:02:02.090> can<00:02:02.330> be<00:02:02.450> entered<00:02:02.780> into<00:02:02.930> relevant<00:02:03.500> boxes

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
which can be entered into relevant boxes

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.460 
which can be entered into relevant boxes
of<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.610> website

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.590 

the<00:02:09.040> website<00:02:09.550> will<00:02:09.850> now<00:02:10.090> return<00:02:10.570> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
the website will now return the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.820 
the website will now return the
measurements<00:02:11.230> for<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.470> Finnish<00:02:11.740> cabin<00:02:13.830> it

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
measurements for the Finnish cabin it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.710 
measurements for the Finnish cabin it
would<00:02:15.040> be<00:02:15.220> worth<00:02:15.430> going<00:02:15.730> back<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.240> checking

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
would be worth going back in checking

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.480 
would be worth going back in checking
that<00:02:16.840> these<00:02:17.050> measurements<00:02:17.590> will<00:02:17.950> fit<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
that these measurements will fit the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.880 
that these measurements will fit the
