changes on your tank I bought this I

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.060 
changes on your tank I bought this I
guess<00:00:49.659> a<00:00:49.690> couple<00:00:50.079> of<00:00:50.140> months<00:00:50.409> ago<00:00:50.649> I've<00:00:51.010> been

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.850 
guess a couple of months ago I've been
using<00:00:51.430> it<00:00:51.640> for<00:00:51.670> all<00:00:51.969> my<00:00:52.000> tanks<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:53.680> makes

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
using it for all my tanks and it makes

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.109 
using it for all my tanks and it makes
water<00:00:54.070> changes<00:00:54.640> very<00:00:55.239> simple<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.610> it<00:00:57.760> hooks<00:00:57.940> up

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:58.119 
water changes very simple so it hooks up

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.579 
water changes very simple so it hooks up
to<00:00:58.149> your<00:00:58.299> tap

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
to your tap

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.729 
to your tap
whichever<00:01:00.339> tap<00:01:00.579> you're<00:01:00.820> gonna<00:01:00.909> run<00:01:01.180> it<00:01:01.299> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
whichever tap you're gonna run it to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.630 
whichever tap you're gonna run it to
mine<00:01:02.739> has<00:01:03.839> 25<00:01:04.839> feet<00:01:05.140> of<00:01:05.289> hose<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:06.310> can<00:01:06.490> also

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
mine has 25 feet of hose you can also

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.620 
mine has 25 feet of hose you can also
buy<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:06.940> 50<00:01:07.479> foot<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:07.990> larger<00:01:08.920> I<00:01:08.950> think<00:01:09.569> so<00:01:10.569> you

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
buy a 50 foot and larger I think so you

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.790 
buy a 50 foot and larger I think so you
hook<00:01:10.869> it<00:01:10.990> up<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.289> your<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:12.190> your<00:01:12.220> tap<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:14.380> turn

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
hook it up to your to your tap you turn

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.609 
hook it up to your to your tap you turn
the<00:01:14.979> water<00:01:15.100> on<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.450> now<00:01:19.750> you<00:01:19.929> can<00:01:20.080> adjust<00:01:20.200> it

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
the water on and now you can adjust it

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.309 
the water on and now you can adjust it
down<00:01:20.950> here<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:22.450> would<00:01:22.690> be<00:01:22.720> sucking<00:01:23.200> the

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
down here this would be sucking the

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.480 
down here this would be sucking the
water<00:01:23.350> out<00:01:23.740> or<00:01:24.960> yeah<00:01:25.960> this<00:01:26.229> is<00:01:26.460> sucking<00:01:27.460> the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
water out or yeah this is sucking the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.120 
water out or yeah this is sucking the
water<00:01:27.580> out<00:01:27.970> of<00:01:28.000> your<00:01:28.149> tank<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:29.799> shove<00:01:30.100> it

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
water out of your tank if you shove it

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.850 
water out of your tank if you shove it
up<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:31.209> would<00:01:31.450> put<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.810> water<00:01:31.990> back<00:01:32.200> into<00:01:32.530> your

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
up it would put the water back into your

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.620 
up it would put the water back into your
tank<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.659> easy<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:35.140> use<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:37.600> just

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
tank so it's that easy to use you just

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.749 
tank so it's that easy to use you just
let<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.079> run<00:01:38.229> into<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.680> sink<00:01:41.399> I've<00:01:42.399> got<00:01:42.640> it

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
let it run into the sink I've got it

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:50.219 
let it run into the sink I've got it
running<00:01:42.939> to<00:01:43.240> my<00:01:43.420> 75<00:01:44.140> gallon<00:01:44.619> aquarium<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:49.229> you

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
running to my 75 gallon aquarium and you

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.999 
running to my 75 gallon aquarium and you
can<00:01:50.380> see<00:01:50.590> it<00:01:50.680> in<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:50.920> tank<00:01:51.159> there<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.859> can

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
can see it in the tank there and you can

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.560 
can see it in the tank there and you can
clean<00:01:54.219> the<00:01:54.340> gravel<00:01:54.729> with<00:01:54.850> this<00:01:55.000> too<00:01:55.270> it's<00:01:55.479> very

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
clean the gravel with this too it's very

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.180 
clean the gravel with this too it's very
simple

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.920 

let<00:02:02.190> me<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.460> focus<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.030> camera<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:03.630> for

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
let me just focus the camera here for

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.719 
let me just focus the camera here for
you

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.360 

so<00:02:11.270> this<00:02:11.450> cleans<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.870> gravel<00:02:12.290> at<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.099> same

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
so this cleans the gravel at the same

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.110 
so this cleans the gravel at the same
time<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:15.709> run<00:02:16.069> it<00:02:16.190> down<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.640> clean<00:02:16.970> the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
time you just run it down and clean the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.150 
time you just run it down and clean the
gravel<00:02:17.510> out<00:02:17.629> if<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.319> have<00:02:18.440> gravel<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:18.980> is

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
gravel out if you have gravel this is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.040 
gravel out if you have gravel this is
sand<00:02:19.459> here<00:02:19.879> so<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> have<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.480> be<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:20.629> little<00:02:20.810> bit

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
sand here so I have to be a little bit

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.160 
sand here so I have to be a little bit
more<00:02:21.260> careful<00:02:22.569> on<00:02:25.690> gravel<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.750> don't<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:27.080> to

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
more careful on gravel you don't have to

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.780 
more careful on gravel you don't have to
worry<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.190> have<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.459> worry<00:02:28.640> about

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
worry on this you have to worry about

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.470 
worry on this you have to worry about
sucking<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.690> sand<00:02:30.260> up<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.030> just<00:02:32.239> go<00:02:32.360> along

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
sucking the sand up so you just go along

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.900 
sucking the sand up so you just go along
and<00:02:33.190> clean<00:02:34.190> all<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.519> crevices<00:02:34.760> out<00:02:39.730> it's<00:02:40.730> very

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
and clean all the crevices out it's very

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:50.380 
and clean all the crevices out it's very
easy<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.599> use<00:02:48.190> so<00:02:49.190> first<00:02:49.519> what<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.760> want<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.269> do

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
easy to use so first what you want to do

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.589 
easy to use so first what you want to do
is<00:02:50.599> shut<00:02:50.930> shut<00:02:51.530> your<00:02:51.650> heater<00:02:51.890> off<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.700> he

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
is shut shut your heater off and he

is shut shut your heater off and he
pumps<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.079> have<00:02:54.230> running<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:56.000> nothing<00:02:56.480> gets

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
pumps you have running so nothing gets

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.870 
pumps you have running so nothing gets
damaged<00:02:57.560> when<00:02:57.799> you're<00:02:57.950> doing<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.400> but<00:02:58.730> it's

coming<00:03:30.260> out<00:03:30.350> of<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.560> tank<00:03:30.799> you<00:03:31.069> want<00:03:31.190> to

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
coming out of the tank you want to

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.400 
coming out of the tank you want to
adjust<00:03:31.579> your<00:03:31.940> water<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:34.280> then<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.579> put<00:03:34.910> this

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
adjust your water and then you put this

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.539 
adjust your water and then you put this
this<00:03:36.410> thing<00:03:36.680> here<00:03:36.980> up<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:39.769> just<00:03:39.920> flip<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.340> up

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
this thing here up you just flip that up

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.360 
this thing here up you just flip that up
and<00:03:41.359> now<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.630> water<00:03:41.930> is<00:03:42.109> going<00:03:42.290> back<00:03:42.680> into<00:03:43.040> the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
and now the water is going back into the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.140 
and now the water is going back into the
tank

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.759 

so<00:03:51.150> now<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.360> water<00:03:51.629> is<00:03:51.900> going<00:03:52.140> back<00:03:52.409> into<00:03:52.680> the

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
so now the water is going back into the

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.920 
so now the water is going back into the
tank<00:03:55.730> I'm<00:03:56.730> going<00:03:56.909> to<00:03:56.970> show<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.629> have<00:03:57.750> to

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
tank I'm going to show you you have to

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.350 
tank I'm going to show you you have to
put<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.739> put<00:03:59.700> Prime<00:04:00.299> in<00:04:00.510> mine<00:04:01.879> so<00:04:02.879> I'm<00:04:02.970> gonna<00:04:03.120> put

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
put I put Prime in mine so I'm gonna put

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.569 
put I put Prime in mine so I'm gonna put
a<00:04:03.390> bit<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:03.959> Prime<00:04:04.319> as<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.709> waters<00:04:05.040> going<00:04:05.280> back

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
a bit of Prime as the waters going back

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.020 
a bit of Prime as the waters going back
in<00:04:05.909> I<00:04:06.829> took<00:04:07.829> how<00:04:07.980> about<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.379> would<00:04:10.379> say<00:04:10.500> about

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
in I took how about I would say about

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.000 
in I took how about I would say about
close<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.060> 30<00:04:12.540> gallons<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:13.140> took<00:04:13.379> out<00:04:13.560> 30

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
close to 30 gallons I took out 30

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.300 
close to 30 gallons I took out 30
percent<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.880> I'm<00:04:18.000> gonna<00:04:18.120> put<00:04:18.799> about<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.859> half<00:04:19.949> a

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
percent so I'm gonna put about a half a

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.500 
percent so I'm gonna put about a half a
cap<00:04:20.549> of<00:04:21.539> Prime<00:04:23.810> in<00:04:24.810> with<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.699> water<00:04:26.910> as<00:04:27.180> the

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
cap of Prime in with in the water as the

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.340 
cap of Prime in with in the water as the
water<00:04:27.690> is<00:04:27.870> going<00:04:28.050> into<00:04:28.229> the<00:04:28.470> tank

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.610 

you<00:04:32.980> just<00:04:33.160> drop<00:04:33.370> that<00:04:33.400> in<00:04:33.930> what<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:34.960> do<00:04:35.080> is<00:04:35.350> pull

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
you just drop that in what I do is pull

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.750 
you just drop that in what I do is pull
the<00:04:35.740> hose<00:04:35.890> back<00:04:36.190> out<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:39.070> let<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.430> water<00:04:39.580> flow

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
the hose back out and let the water flow

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.870 
the hose back out and let the water flow
in<00:04:40.330> like<00:04:40.540> that<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:42.430> it<00:04:42.550> mixes<00:04:42.880> up<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.060> Prime

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
in like that so it mixes up the Prime

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.100 
in like that so it mixes up the Prime
gets<00:04:45.880> rid<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.270> chlorine<00:04:46.690> out<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:46.990> your

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
gets rid of the chlorine out of your

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.900 
gets rid of the chlorine out of your
water<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.890> you're<00:04:48.040> putting<00:04:48.280> into<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.640> tank

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
water that you're putting into the tank

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.270 
water that you're putting into the tank
so<00:04:52.080> now<00:04:53.080> you<00:04:53.140> just<00:04:53.410> fill<00:04:53.590> it<00:04:53.680> back<00:04:53.800> up<00:04:53.860> that's

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
so now you just fill it back up that's

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.350 
so now you just fill it back up that's
how<00:04:54.430> simple<00:04:54.790> it<00:04:54.880> is<00:04:54.910> no<00:04:55.750> buckets<00:04:57.090> just<00:04:58.090> let<00:04:58.240> the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
how simple it is no buckets just let the

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:08.220 
how simple it is no buckets just let the
water<00:04:58.510> run<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:05.020> as<00:05:05.170> you<00:05:05.380> can<00:05:05.470> see<00:05:06.720> it's<00:05:07.720> a<00:05:07.900> hands

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
water run so as you can see it's a hands

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.130 
water run so as you can see it's a hands
off<00:05:08.400> you<00:05:09.400> don't<00:05:09.550> even<00:05:09.700> have<00:05:09.880> to<00:05:10.060> hold<00:05:10.780> on<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.050> it

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
off you don't even have to hold on to it

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.950 
off you don't even have to hold on to it
you<00:05:11.170> just<00:05:11.380> set<00:05:11.740> it<00:05:11.830> in<00:05:11.920> the<00:05:12.070> tank<00:05:12.840> let<00:05:13.840> the

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
you just set it in the tank let the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.260 
you just set it in the tank let the
water<00:05:14.170> run<00:05:14.260> back<00:05:14.620> in<00:05:14.890> make<00:05:15.700> sure<00:05:15.730> you<00:05:16.030> put<00:05:16.240> some

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
water run back in make sure you put some

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.870 
water run back in make sure you put some
Prime<00:05:16.720> in<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.050> tank<00:05:17.880> and<00:05:20.400> what<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:21.520> should<00:05:21.730> do

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
Prime in the tank and what you should do

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.640 
Prime in the tank and what you should do
is<00:05:22.000> test<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.390> water<00:05:22.660> coming<00:05:22.960> out<00:05:23.170> with<00:05:23.470> your

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
is test the water coming out with your

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.280 
is test the water coming out with your
hands<00:05:24.070> and<00:05:24.220> see<00:05:24.400> if<00:05:24.580> it's<00:05:25.170> approximately<00:05:26.170> the

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
hands and see if it's approximately the

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:33.800 
hands and see if it's approximately the
same<00:05:26.560> temperature<00:05:26.920> as<00:05:27.130> your<00:05:27.220> tank<00:05:27.610> water

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.750 

which<00:05:34.260> mind<00:05:34.560> is<00:05:34.680> just<00:05:34.860> about<00:05:35.070> perfect<00:05:35.340> there

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
which mind is just about perfect there

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.820 
which mind is just about perfect there
it's<00:05:35.940> around<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:36.930> same<00:05:37.140> temperature<00:05:37.590> as<00:05:37.710> the

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
it's around the same temperature as the

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.690 
it's around the same temperature as the
water<00:05:38.010> inside<00:05:38.460> so<00:05:39.260> you<00:05:40.260> just<00:05:40.410> wait<00:05:40.610> let<00:05:41.610> it

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
water inside so you just wait let it

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.250 
water inside so you just wait let it
keep<00:05:41.850> running<00:05:42.150> it<00:05:42.240> takes<00:05:42.420> a<00:05:42.540> boat<00:05:42.690> I<00:05:42.960> don't

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
keep running it takes a boat I don't

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.890 
keep running it takes a boat I don't
know<00:05:43.560> less<00:05:44.550> than<00:05:44.760> five<00:05:44.970> minutes<00:05:45.180> to<00:05:45.450> fill<00:05:45.750> back

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
know less than five minutes to fill back

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.530 
know less than five minutes to fill back
up

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.460 

and<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.350> aqua<00:05:51.770> vac<00:05:51.950> comes<00:05:52.370> with<00:05:53.470> little

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
side of the tank there it just holds it

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.220 
side of the tank there it just holds it
in<00:06:06.200> place<00:06:06.470> if<00:06:06.710> you<00:06:06.740> want<00:06:07.010> to<00:06:07.870> just<00:06:08.870> put<00:06:09.110> it<00:06:09.200> like

right now that's what the brackets look
like<00:06:15.470> with<00:06:15.680> a<00:06:15.710> suction<00:06:16.040> cup<00:06:16.250> on<00:06:16.610> them<00:06:17.470> and<00:06:18.470> you

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
like with a suction cup on them and you

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.380 
like with a suction cup on them and you
can<00:06:18.800> attach<00:06:19.370> it<00:06:19.400> to<00:06:19.670> the<00:06:19.760> side<00:06:20.000> of<00:06:20.180> your

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
can attach it to the side of your

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:27.910 
can attach it to the side of your
aquarium<00:06:24.520> it<00:06:25.520> also<00:06:25.730> comes<00:06:26.180> with<00:06:26.390> a<00:06:27.080> screen

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
aquarium it also comes with a screen

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.860 
aquarium it also comes with a screen
attachment<00:06:29.860> right<00:06:30.860> there<00:06:31.330> you<00:06:32.330> can<00:06:32.510> put<00:06:32.720> this

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
attachment right there you can put this

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.220 
attachment right there you can put this
on<00:06:33.170> the<00:06:33.230> end<00:06:33.590> of<00:06:33.740> it<00:06:34.180> if<00:06:35.180> you<00:06:35.450> wanted<00:06:35.780> to<00:06:35.990> when

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:36.230 
on the end of it if you wanted to when

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.050 
on the end of it if you wanted to when
you're<00:06:36.410> taking<00:06:37.100> the<00:06:37.130> water<00:06:37.400> out<00:06:37.580> of<00:06:37.610> the<00:06:37.760> tank

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
you're taking the water out of the tank

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.250 
you're taking the water out of the tank
and<00:06:38.360> it<00:06:39.260> prevents<00:06:39.800> you<00:06:39.950> from<00:06:40.810> sucking<00:06:41.810> up<00:06:42.050> any

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
and it prevents you from sucking up any

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.340 
and it prevents you from sucking up any
small<00:06:42.650> fish<00:06:42.920> I<00:06:43.660> didn't<00:06:44.660> use<00:06:44.810> it<00:06:44.960> this<00:06:45.080> time

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
small fish I didn't use it this time

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.650 
small fish I didn't use it this time
because<00:06:45.560> I've<00:06:45.710> got<00:06:45.890> cichlids<00:06:46.340> which<00:06:46.670> right

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
because I've got cichlids which right

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.470 
because I've got cichlids which right
now<00:06:47.690> are<00:06:47.840> hiding<00:06:48.410> in<00:06:48.530> the<00:06:48.620> rocks<00:06:48.880> as<00:06:49.880> I'm<00:06:50.150> doing

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
now are hiding in the rocks as I'm doing

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.440 
now are hiding in the rocks as I'm doing
this<00:06:50.860> so<00:06:51.860> they<00:06:52.100> don't<00:06:52.130> come<00:06:52.430> out<00:06:52.580> but<00:06:53.240> if<00:06:53.390> you

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
this so they don't come out but if you

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.090 
this so they don't come out but if you
have<00:06:53.570> any<00:06:53.750> small<00:06:53.990> fish<00:06:54.230> in<00:06:54.380> the<00:06:54.410> tank<00:06:54.530> it<00:06:54.920> might

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
have any small fish in the tank it might

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.360 
have any small fish in the tank it might
be<00:06:55.220> a<00:06:55.250> good<00:06:55.430> idea<00:06:55.490> to<00:06:55.910> put<00:06:56.120> that<00:06:56.150> on<00:06:56.390> the<00:06:56.540> end

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:57.370 
be a good idea to put that on the end

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.090 
be a good idea to put that on the end
when<00:06:58.370> you're<00:06:59.410> taking<00:07:00.410> the<00:07:00.440> water<00:07:00.680> out<00:07:00.920> of<00:07:00.980> your

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100 
when you're taking the water out of your

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.950 
when you're taking the water out of your
tank<00:07:01.430> when<00:07:01.940> you're<00:07:02.060> putting<00:07:02.240> it<00:07:02.390> back<00:07:02.540> in<00:07:02.810> you

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:02.960 
tank when you're putting it back in you

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.460 
tank when you're putting it back in you
don't<00:07:03.080> need<00:07:03.350> it<00:07:03.500> but<00:07:03.970> that's<00:07:04.970> just<00:07:05.150> a<00:07:05.470> screen

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.470 
don't need it but that's just a screen

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.980 
don't need it but that's just a screen
or<00:07:06.710> a<00:07:06.740> strainer<00:07:07.130> to<00:07:07.490> keep<00:07:08.180> the<00:07:08.330> fish<00:07:08.540> from<00:07:08.750> Cup

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
or a strainer to keep the fish from Cup

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.150 
or a strainer to keep the fish from Cup
being<00:07:09.260> sucked<00:07:09.590> at<00:07:09.770> the<00:07:09.860> table

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
is just about up to the top of the tank

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:28.420 
is just about up to the top of the tank
so<00:07:20.020> I'm<00:07:20.140> just<00:07:20.320> gonna<00:07:20.470> go<00:07:20.680> and<00:07:20.860> shut<00:07:21.070> it<00:07:21.190> off
