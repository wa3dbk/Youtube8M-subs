it hurts bottom line their systems are

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.370 
it hurts bottom line their systems are
different<00:01:34.750> than<00:01:34.869> ours<00:01:35.729> remember<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:37.380> they

like we do they want to live just like
we<00:01:47.590> do<00:01:47.770> because<00:01:48.490> when<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.789> comes<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.179> pain

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
we do because when it comes to pain

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.440 
we do because when it comes to pain
hunger<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.500> thirst<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:51.550> not<00:01:51.759> wanting<00:01:52.090> to<00:01:52.149> die

we're<00:01:53.110> all<00:01:53.380> basically<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.340> same<00:01:54.490> all<00:01:55.149> this

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
we're all basically the same all this

methods<00:01:59.170> exist<00:01:59.500> because<00:02:00.090> testing<00:02:01.090> on<00:02:01.270> animals

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
methods exist because testing on animals

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.639 
methods exist because testing on animals
gives<00:02:02.170> faulty<00:02:02.890> results<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.500> was

gives faulty results because it was

gives faulty results because it was
wrong<00:02:05.920> when<00:02:06.399> we<00:02:06.520> did<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:06.880> orphans<00:02:07.330> blacks

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259

GIS<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:09.340> gypsies<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:11.440> wrong<00:02:11.709> when<00:02:12.010> we<00:02:12.160> do<00:02:12.310> it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
GIS and gypsies it's wrong when we do it

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.530 
GIS and gypsies it's wrong when we do it
to<00:02:12.580> him

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.479 

because<00:02:19.540> we<00:02:20.200> can't<00:02:20.500> explain<00:02:21.069> what<00:02:21.340> we're

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
because we can't explain what we're
