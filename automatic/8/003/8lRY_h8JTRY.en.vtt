00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040
 or not 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.040
 do not 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.980
 hello friends today we are here to 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.059
 present you the new receiver of the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.550
 rs 4800 satellite and this receiver 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.980
 really is a pass is a receiver 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.070
 tiny also incorporates also 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.560
 The pvr function among others is a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.289
 function that allows you to always record 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.449
 with external devices in addition to this 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.140
 function one thing that is very well and we 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.930
 offers the rs 4800 and is the update 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.750
 both channels and software 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.450
 one thing that will be very useful for you 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.270
 cut good so you have a little 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.920
 of notions of this receiver well let's 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.640
 to teach what connections would be 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.070
 basic as you see in the back 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.840
 It has all the connections 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.170
 from what would be the network input 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.750
 until the shots to connect our 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.180
 satellite dish and then we have 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.000
 also what is the audio output 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.520
 digital is a coaxial cable output 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.130
 of digital audio that gives us a 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.840
 quality in sound for movies or 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.899
 everything we want to see in this 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.440
 receiver that is perfect then we have 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.960
 also a small as you see connector 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.750
 here that goes there we would put what would be 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.690
 a led that already comes in the equipment itself 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.670
 we have our receiver somewhere 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.680
 secluded or hidden then I'll 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.960
 we will show is a small infrared 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.789
 that you can put it under the TV or 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.150
 where you do best 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.990
 we also have the output of hdmi 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.210
 hdmi output to be able to see the hd 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.100
 perfectly up to 1080 gives us a 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.840
 perfect quality 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.729
 and well this would be a little 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.049
 connections that on the other hand what 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.390
 that have incorporated into this new 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.330
 receiver that is fantastic allows us 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.940
 move us much more easily would be the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.159
 I control the remote control as you see 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.049
 a part would be a normal command with the 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.840
 basic functions to handle 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.860
 quickly our receiver and by the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.150
 back side 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.310
 we would have everything that is a system 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.650
 as if it were a small mobile 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.959
 computer with a keyboard that we 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.879
 facilitates what would be the search for 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.040
 where online content 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.769
 we want to navigate because logically we will go 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.660
 Well now much faster than 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.819
 We would explain to you that we will explain in 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.950
 another video is how to install this 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.400
 receiver and some basic functions 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.190
 so you can quickly see how 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.110
 update channels and other functions that 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.000
 they will surely be of great help 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.980
 well I hope you liked this 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.980
 video and see you in the next
