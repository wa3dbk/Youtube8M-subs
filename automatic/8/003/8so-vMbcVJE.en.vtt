00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
good chunk of change of time and you

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490 
good chunk of change of time and you
need<00:00:41.820> six<00:00:42.090> players<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> comp<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.320> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
you're scheduling that way in advance so

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.660 
you're scheduling that way in advance so
when<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> heard<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.770> game<00:00:53.010> Galactic

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
when I heard about this game Galactic

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.790 
when I heard about this game Galactic
Emperor<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.360> very<00:00:54.600> excited<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.289> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
Emperor I was very excited because this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.590 
Emperor I was very excited because this
game<00:00:56.100> even<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> box<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.180> mentions<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
game even on the box of mentions that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.810 
game even on the box of mentions that
it's<00:00:57.780> supposed<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> take<00:00:58.410> 90<00:00:58.800> minutes<00:00:58.829> now

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
it's supposed to take 90 minutes now

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.430 
it's supposed to take 90 minutes now
that's<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.210> bit<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.449> an<00:01:00.570> exaggeration

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that's a bit of an exaggeration

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.609 
that's a bit of an exaggeration
it<00:01:01.590> really<00:01:02.129> takes<00:01:02.399> about<00:01:02.579> thirty<00:01:03.619> twenty

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
it really takes about thirty twenty

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.440 
it really takes about thirty twenty
thirty<00:01:04.799> minutes<00:01:05.129> per<00:01:05.280> player<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.299> play

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
thirty minutes per player so if you play

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.960 
thirty minutes per player so if you play
a<00:01:06.510> four<00:01:06.720> player<00:01:06.900> game<00:01:06.960> two<00:01:07.409> hours<00:01:07.740> maybe<00:01:08.010> five

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
a four player game two hours maybe five

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.130 
a four player game two hours maybe five
per<00:01:09.150> game<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.450> might<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.600> able<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.810> squash<00:01:10.110> it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
per game you might be able to squash it

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
per game you might be able to squash it
into<00:01:10.470> two<00:01:10.619> hours<00:01:10.920> too<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.610> still<00:01:11.880> that's<00:01:12.270> much

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
into two hours too but still that's much

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.480 
into two hours too but still that's much
shorter<00:01:12.570> than<00:01:12.960> Twilight<00:01:13.439> Imperium<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> if<00:01:14.369> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
shorter than Twilight Imperium and if it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.460 
shorter than Twilight Imperium and if it
gave<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> same<00:01:15.299> kind<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.630> experience<00:01:16.259> well

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
gave the same kind of experience well

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.660 
gave the same kind of experience well
hey<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.770> always<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.400> shorter<00:01:17.790> game<00:01:17.970> so

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
hey I'm always up for a shorter game so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
hey I'm always up for a shorter game so
my<00:01:20.670> initial<00:01:20.939> impressions<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> game<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.080> I

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
my initial impressions of the game and I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.660 
my initial impressions of the game and I
put<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.409> several<00:01:22.650> times<00:01:22.890> now<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.640> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
put it several times now is it I like it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.330 
put it several times now is it I like it
it's<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.570> fun<00:01:24.810> game<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.470> my<00:01:25.560> top<00:01:25.770> 200<00:01:26.310> games

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
it's a fun game it's in my top 200 games

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.420 
it's a fun game it's in my top 200 games
I<00:01:26.640> think<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.909> very<00:01:27.060> good<00:01:27.500> but<00:01:28.500> my<00:01:28.770> problem<00:01:29.250> is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
I think it's very good but my problem is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.640 
I think it's very good but my problem is
is<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.970> my<00:01:30.150> expectations<00:01:30.450> were<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.079> high

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
is that my expectations were really high

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
is that my expectations were really high
for<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:32.009> game<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.820> didn't<00:01:33.119> fulfill<00:01:33.420> them

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
for this game and it didn't fulfill them

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.539 
for this game and it didn't fulfill them
I<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:34.530> expected<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.369> this

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
I really expected it to be this

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.569 
I really expected it to be this
spectacular<00:01:36.060> game<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.810> Twilight<00:01:37.170> Imperium

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
spectacular game of Twilight Imperium

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.240 
spectacular game of Twilight Imperium
condense<00:01:38.579> them<00:01:38.790> into<00:01:39.000> two<00:01:39.150> hours<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:40.250> don't

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
condense them into two hours I don't

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.819 
condense them into two hours I don't
know<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.670> possible<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.360> think<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.680> had

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
know if it's possible I think they had

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.620 
know if it's possible I think they had
the<00:01:43.920> strip<00:01:44.220> away<00:01:44.340> things<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.360> down<00:01:45.479> in

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the strip away things to get it down in

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
the strip away things to get it down in
the<00:01:45.720> shorter<00:01:45.990> time<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.619> missed<00:01:47.189> those

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the shorter time and I missed those

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.670 
the shorter time and I missed those
things<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.960> say<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.229> game<00:01:49.259> isn't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
things that's not to say the game isn't

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.499 
things that's not to say the game isn't
good<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.070> said<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.610> good<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.060> let's<00:01:51.240> look<00:01:51.360> at

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
good I said it is good so let's look at

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.510 
good I said it is good so let's look at
it<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> bit<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.470> board<00:01:52.710> itself<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.250> kind<00:01:53.430> of

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it a bit the board itself is kind of

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.280 
it a bit the board itself is kind of
nondescript<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.479> big<00:01:54.659> space<00:01:54.990> board

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
nondescript it's just a big space board

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.030 
nondescript it's just a big space board
with<00:01:55.470> Texas

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
with Texas

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.530 
with Texas
we'll<00:01:56.399> come<00:01:56.549> back<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> minute<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
we'll come back to that in a minute and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.230 
we'll come back to that in a minute and

steward role here's the engineer rule

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.349 
steward role here's the engineer rule
everybody<00:02:39.489> gets<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:39.909> what<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.150> rule<00:02:40.329> says

special<00:02:42.909> ability<00:02:43.090> for<00:02:43.390> example<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:43.870> engineer

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
special ability for example the engineer

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.470 
special ability for example the engineer
allows<00:02:44.920> everybody<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.549> build<00:02:45.819> spaceships<00:02:46.150> but

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
allows everybody to build spaceships but

fighter
well<00:02:49.629> that's<00:02:49.780> pretty<00:02:49.930> interesting<00:02:50.049> in<00:02:50.530> that

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
well that's pretty interesting in that

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.500 
well that's pretty interesting in that
and<00:02:50.829> each<00:02:51.159> one<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.370> these<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.730> different<00:02:51.909> the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
and each one of these is different the

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.729 
and each one of these is different the
rule<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:53.049> think<00:02:53.349> is<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.560> most

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
rule that I think is the most

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.740 
rule that I think is the most
interesting<00:02:54.010> is<00:02:54.879> the<00:02:54.940> one<00:02:55.209> that<00:02:55.299> allows<00:02:55.420> you

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
interesting is the one that allows you

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.809 
interesting is the one that allows you
to<00:02:55.780> use<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.200> side<00:02:56.379> of<00:02:56.409> the<00:02:56.590> board<00:02:56.859> here<00:02:57.190> for

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
to use the side of the board here for

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.879 
to use the side of the board here for
resources<00:02:58.450> three<00:02:59.049> dice<00:02:59.260> are<00:02:59.470> rolled<00:02:59.739> and

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
resources three dice are rolled and

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.500 
resources three dice are rolled and
depending<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.639> results<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.120> those<00:03:01.269> dice

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
depending on the results of those dice

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.940 
depending on the results of those dice
you<00:03:01.750> can<00:03:01.780> put<00:03:02.049> them<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.409> three<00:03:02.590> resources

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
you can put them on the three resources

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.640 
you can put them on the three resources
food<00:03:03.790> metal<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.329> energy<00:03:04.659> to<00:03:05.109> determine<00:03:05.560> the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
food metal and energy to determine the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.770 
food metal and energy to determine the
price<00:03:05.920> it's<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.670> most<00:03:06.879> innovative<00:03:07.180> concept

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
price it's the most innovative concept

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.699 
price it's the most innovative concept
of<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.959> game<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.260> I'd<00:03:08.319> like<00:03:08.439> to<00:03:08.560> see

something more along those lines on that

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.720 
use these food cubes to produce energy
and<00:03:24.940> metal<00:03:25.569> cubes<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.500> will<00:03:26.650> then<00:03:26.769> get<00:03:27.549> you

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
and metal cubes that will then get you

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.129 
and metal cubes that will then get you
your<00:03:27.910> spaceships<00:03:28.449> that<00:03:28.690> will<00:03:28.810> get<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:29.019> other

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
your spaceships that will get you other

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.360 
your spaceships that will get you other
things<00:03:29.379> that<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.620> need<00:03:29.799> during<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.159> course

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
things that you need during the course

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.129 
things that you need during the course
of<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.549> game<00:03:30.699> but<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.329> economic<00:03:31.780> markets

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
of the game but the economic markets

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.349 
of the game but the economic markets
pretty<00:03:32.290> interesting<00:03:32.889> there<00:03:33.849> are<00:03:33.940> two<00:03:34.120> ways<00:03:34.329> to

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
pretty interesting there are two ways to

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.990 
pretty interesting there are two ways to
capture<00:03:34.810> planets<00:03:35.739> all<00:03:35.919> over<00:03:36.129> the<00:03:36.220> board<00:03:36.430> one

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
capture planets all over the board one

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.460 
capture planets all over the board one
way<00:03:37.150> is<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.329> way<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:37.720> we<00:03:37.840> all<00:03:38.019> know<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.409> love

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
way is the way that we all know and love

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.770 
way is the way that we all know and love
and<00:03:38.799> that's<00:03:39.310> through<00:03:39.609> military<00:03:40.150> might<00:03:40.419> fly

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
and that's through military might fly

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.349 
and that's through military might fly
your<00:03:40.959> ships<00:03:41.199> around<00:03:41.470> conquer<00:03:42.099> combat<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.120> done

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
your ships around conquer combat is done

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.969 
your ships around conquer combat is done
through<00:03:44.109> basically<00:03:44.620> just<00:03:44.799> straight

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
through basically just straight

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.649 
through basically just straight
six-sided<00:03:45.609> die<00:03:45.760> rolls<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.299> need<00:03:46.419> to<00:03:46.510> get<00:03:46.629> a

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
six-sided die rolls you need to get a

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.449 
six-sided die rolls you need to get a
certain<00:03:46.989> number<00:03:47.079> when<00:03:47.349> you<00:03:47.470> roll<00:03:47.769> some

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
certain number when you roll some

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.129 
certain number when you roll some
spaceships<00:03:48.879> are<00:03:49.000> better<00:03:49.150> than<00:03:49.299> others<00:03:49.569> these

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
spaceships are better than others these

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.080 
spaceships are better than others these
large<00:03:50.470> spaceships<00:03:51.099> take<00:03:51.340> two<00:03:51.579> hits<00:03:51.879> and

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
large spaceships take two hits and

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.390 
large spaceships take two hits and
players<00:03:52.780> have<00:03:53.139> a<00:03:53.379> card<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:53.799> explains

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
players have a card that explains

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.939 
players have a card that explains
everything<00:03:54.729> pretty<00:03:55.540> well<00:03:55.629> on<00:03:56.079> one<00:03:56.590> side<00:03:56.799> it

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
everything pretty well on one side it

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.460 
everything pretty well on one side it
shows<00:03:57.220> all<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.180> combat<00:03:58.569> results<00:03:59.109> and<00:03:59.229> which

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
shows all the combat results and which

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.110 
shows all the combat results and which
order<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.919> ships<00:04:00.159> fire<00:04:00.430> from<00:04:00.729> the<00:04:00.819> huge

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
order the ships fire from the huge

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.149 
order the ships fire from the huge
dreadnought<00:04:01.599> to<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.840> small<00:04:02.139> fighter<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.739> the

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
dreadnought to the small fighter and the

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.979 
dreadnought to the small fighter and the
other<00:04:03.280> side<00:04:03.549> shows<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:04.090> costs<00:04:04.510> for

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
other side shows the costs for

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.420 
other side shows the costs for
spaceships<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.829> how<00:04:05.949> much<00:04:06.099> they<00:04:06.250> cost

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
spaceships and how much they cost

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.399 
spaceships and how much they cost
because<00:04:06.909> not<00:04:07.449> always<00:04:07.690> their<00:04:07.840> energy<00:04:08.229> in<00:04:08.319> the

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
because not always their energy in the

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.319 
because not always their energy in the
game<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:09.010> there's<00:04:09.220> also<00:04:09.400> money<00:04:09.760> which<00:04:10.180> is

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
game but there's also money which is

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.300 
game but there's also money which is
done<00:04:10.510> in<00:04:10.599> little<00:04:10.720> cardboard<00:04:11.079> tokens<00:04:11.590> which<00:04:12.159> I

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
done in little cardboard tokens which I

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.420 
done in little cardboard tokens which I
think<00:04:12.519> work<00:04:12.879> quite<00:04:13.120> well<00:04:13.150> for<00:04:13.329> money<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:15.220> one

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
think work quite well for money so one

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.279 
think work quite well for money so one
way<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.609> conquer<00:04:15.970> planets<00:04:16.329> is<00:04:16.449> by<00:04:16.870> brute<00:04:17.260> force

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
way to conquer planets is by brute force

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.399 
way to conquer planets is by brute force
using<00:04:18.099> spaceships<00:04:18.789> another<00:04:19.419> way<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:19.930> an

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
using spaceships another way and an

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.800 
using spaceships another way and an
interesting<00:04:21.159> way<00:04:21.310> is<00:04:21.519> by<00:04:21.700> using<00:04:21.909> diplomatic

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
interesting way is by using diplomatic

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.269 
interesting way is by using diplomatic
means<00:04:22.990> there's<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.469> card<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.860> lets<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.099> put

00:04:24.269 --> 00:04:24.279 
means there's a card that lets you put

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.210 
means there's a card that lets you put
these<00:04:24.430> diplomatic<00:04:24.909> tokens<00:04:25.300> out<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:25.990> can

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
these diplomatic tokens out and you can

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.070 
these diplomatic tokens out and you can
put<00:04:26.340> them<00:04:26.490> anywhere<00:04:26.850> on<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.210> board<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:27.990> you

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
put them anywhere on the board so you

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.300 
put them anywhere on the board so you
can<00:04:28.110> conquer<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.530> planet<00:04:28.560> that's<00:04:28.980> right<00:04:29.130> next

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
can conquer a planet that's right next

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.880 
can conquer a planet that's right next
to<00:04:29.430> your<00:04:29.550> opponent's<00:04:30.360> home<00:04:30.480> base<00:04:30.680> just<00:04:31.680> by

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
to your opponent's home base just by

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.650 
to your opponent's home base just by
political<00:04:32.250> means<00:04:32.550> now<00:04:33.030> they<00:04:33.300> can<00:04:33.450> probably

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
political means now they can probably

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.720 
political means now they can probably
easily<00:04:34.200> take<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.530> back<00:04:34.710> by<00:04:34.920> moving<00:04:35.130> spaceships

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
easily take it back by moving spaceships

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.670 
easily take it back by moving spaceships
in<00:04:35.880> there<00:04:36.060> but<00:04:36.630> still<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.960> keeps<00:04:37.170> everyone<00:04:37.470> on

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
in there but still it keeps everyone on

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.710 
in there but still it keeps everyone on
their<00:04:37.860> toes<00:04:37.970> some<00:04:38.970> people<00:04:39.300> are<00:04:39.390> not<00:04:39.540> gonna

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
their toes some people are not gonna

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.970 
their toes some people are not gonna
like<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.170> they're<00:04:40.440> not<00:04:40.560> gonna<00:04:40.680> like<00:04:40.860> the

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
like this they're not gonna like the

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.130 
like this they're not gonna like the
fact<00:04:41.160> that<00:04:41.310> political<00:04:42.000> power<00:04:42.180> is<00:04:42.450> just<00:04:43.050> as

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
fact that political power is just as

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.260 
fact that political power is just as
powerful<00:04:43.620> as<00:04:43.710> military<00:04:44.100> Mike<00:04:44.400> but<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:44.970> think

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
powerful as military Mike but I think

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.760 
powerful as military Mike but I think
that<00:04:45.390> shows<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:45.630> good<00:04:45.840> balance<00:04:46.320> it<00:04:46.440> keeps<00:04:46.650> the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
that shows a good balance it keeps the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.320 
that shows a good balance it keeps the
game<00:04:46.920> interesting<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:47.760> board<00:04:48.000> is<00:04:48.120> very

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
game interesting and the board is very

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.690 
game interesting and the board is very
fluid<00:04:48.680> not<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.860> mention<00:04:50.040> there's<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.400> spot<00:04:50.610> in

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
fluid not to mention there's a spot in

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.680 
fluid not to mention there's a spot in
the<00:04:50.760> middle<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.030> board<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.330> becomes<00:04:51.600> a

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
the middle the board that becomes a

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.300 
the middle the board that becomes a
black<00:04:51.900> hole<00:04:51.960> eventually<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.920> when

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
black hole eventually and when

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.920 
black hole eventually and when
spaceships<00:04:53.760> fly<00:04:54.000> into<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:54.330> black<00:04:54.510> hole<00:04:54.570> they

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
spaceships fly into that black hole they

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.870 
spaceships fly into that black hole they
can<00:04:55.080> fly<00:04:55.290> anywhere<00:04:55.680> on<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.860> board<00:04:56.040> so<00:04:56.670> there's

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
can fly anywhere on the board so there's

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.240

points<00:05:01.440> in<00:05:01.530> only<00:05:01.710> two<00:05:01.890> different<00:05:02.220> ways<00:05:02.370> one

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
points in only two different ways one

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.390 
points in only two different ways one
way<00:05:03.330> is<00:05:03.780> by<00:05:03.840> controlling<00:05:04.320> planets<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.100> one

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
way is by controlling planets and one

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.460 
way is by controlling planets and one
one<00:05:05.670> of<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:05.850> roles<00:05:06.090> is<00:05:06.270> picked<00:05:06.510> people<00:05:07.020> score

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
one of the roles is picked people score

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.590 
one of the roles is picked people score
one<00:05:07.680> point<00:05:07.710> for<00:05:08.160> planet<00:05:08.490> they<00:05:08.610> control<00:05:09.030> the

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
one point for planet they control the

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.850 
one point for planet they control the
other<00:05:09.720> way<00:05:09.930> is<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.140> get<00:05:10.260> a<00:05:10.290> victory<00:05:10.590> point

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
other way is you get a victory point

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.750 
other way is you get a victory point
every<00:05:11.220> time<00:05:11.430> you<00:05:11.760> attack<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.710> win<00:05:13.710> you<00:05:14.610> don't

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
every time you attack and win you don't

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.280 
every time you attack and win you don't
get<00:05:14.850> any<00:05:15.150> points<00:05:15.360> if<00:05:15.570> you<00:05:15.660> defend<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.170> win

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
get any points if you defend and win

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.930 
get any points if you defend and win
only<00:05:16.620> by<00:05:16.740> attacking<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.430> winning<00:05:17.669> so<00:05:17.820> that

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
only by attacking and winning so that

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.120 
only by attacking and winning so that
promotes<00:05:18.270> constant<00:05:18.930> battle<00:05:19.320> and<00:05:19.440> although

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
promotes constant battle and although

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.860 
promotes constant battle and although
battle<00:05:20.550> slows<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:20.940> game<00:05:21.060> down<00:05:21.120> slightly

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
battle slows the game down slightly

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.540 
battle slows the game down slightly
I<00:05:21.900> still<00:05:22.350> enjoy<00:05:22.380> games<00:05:22.890> that<00:05:23.100> kick<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.370> up<00:05:23.460> a

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
I still enjoy games that kick it up a

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.100 
I still enjoy games that kick it up a
notch<00:05:23.580> there's<00:05:24.360> another<00:05:24.600> way<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.810> score

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
notch there's another way to score

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.980 
notch there's another way to score
points<00:05:25.470> by<00:05:25.500> having<00:05:25.919> your<00:05:26.510> area<00:05:27.510> filled<00:05:27.810> with

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
points by having your area filled with

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.360 
points by having your area filled with
resource<00:05:28.470> cubes<00:05:28.770> at<00:05:28.890> the<00:05:28.950> end<00:05:29.040> of<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.190> game

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
resource cubes at the end of the game

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.159 
resource cubes at the end of the game
but<00:05:29.520> I'm<00:05:29.640> really<00:05:30.090> not<00:05:30.210> sure<00:05:30.270> why<00:05:30.690> that's<00:05:30.840> there

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
but I'm really not sure why that's there

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.650 
but I'm really not sure why that's there

just<00:05:37.350> doesn't<00:05:37.710> make<00:05:37.770> any<00:05:37.830> sense<00:05:38.450> but<00:05:39.450> the

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
just doesn't make any sense but the

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.480 
just doesn't make any sense but the
