disease and that's the next major stage
in<00:01:20.310> genetics<00:01:20.960> we<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.200> gone<00:01:22.500> from<00:01:22.770> being

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
in genetics we have gone from being

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.120 
in genetics we have gone from being
competitors<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.360> being<00:01:24.600> collaborators<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.740> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
competitors to being collaborators and I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.160 
competitors to being collaborators and I
really<00:01:26.369> feel<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:27.060> what<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.810> need<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
really feel that that's what we need to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.609 
really feel that that's what we need to
do<00:01:28.350> now<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> field<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.520> molecular<00:01:30.000> biology
