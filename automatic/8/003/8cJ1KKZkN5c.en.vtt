within one hour it had flattened and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
within one hour it had flattened and
look<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:40.890> an<00:01:41.040> absolute<00:01:41.369> mess<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.030> guess<00:01:42.720> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
look like an absolute mess I guess it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.569 
look like an absolute mess I guess it
was<00:01:43.020> due<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.229> gravity<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.799> lack<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.280> hair<00:01:44.460> in

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
was due to gravity the lack of hair in

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.639 
was due to gravity the lack of hair in
the<00:01:44.610> first<00:01:45.000> place<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.049> fact<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.619> just

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the first place and the fact that I just

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.740 
the first place and the fact that I just
couldn't<00:01:47.340> stop<00:01:47.549> touching<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.270> tearing<00:01:48.689> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
couldn't stop touching it and tearing it

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.350 
couldn't stop touching it and tearing it
out<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.740> naturally<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> started<00:01:50.729> getting<00:01:51.030> very
