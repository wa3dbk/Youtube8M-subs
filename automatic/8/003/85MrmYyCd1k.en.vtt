00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
it follows the magnet now anybody know

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.830 
it follows the magnet now anybody know
anything<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:34.890> science<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.790> magnetism<00:01:36.330> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
anything about science the magnetism and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
was no metal content in this they would

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.910 
was no metal content in this they would
not<00:01:42.690> be<00:01:42.960> able<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.440> be<00:01:44.220> driven<00:01:45.680> around<00:01:46.680> this

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
not be able to be driven around this

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.570 
not be able to be driven around this
plate<00:01:47.510> as<00:01:48.510> though<00:01:49.230> I'm<00:01:49.410> steering<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.190> guiding

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
plate as though I'm steering and guiding

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.539 
plate as though I'm steering and guiding
it<00:01:52.550> amazing

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.260

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
now that's honeycomb garbage and go into

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.160 
now that's honeycomb garbage and go into
the<00:02:13.400> bigger<00:02:13.640> garbage<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:16.000> put<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.209> cornflake

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
the bigger garbage and put the cornflake

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.900 
the bigger garbage and put the cornflake
there<00:02:18.470> or<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:19.099> know<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.370> wheat<00:02:19.550> flake

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
there or you know the wheat flake

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.130 
there or you know the wheat flake
whatever<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.360> want<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.569> call<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.930> poison

whatever you want to call it poison

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:32.460 
whatever you want to call it poison
flake<00:02:22.060> alright<00:02:24.280> let's<00:02:25.280> do<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.489> again

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:42.090 

see<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:34.990> little<00:02:35.990> less<00:02:37.630> content<00:02:38.630> of<00:02:40.000> metal<00:02:41.000> but

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
see a little less content of metal but

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.810 
see a little less content of metal but
still<00:02:43.100> there's<00:02:43.460> little<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:48.820> magnetized

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
still there's little that is magnetized

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:58.210 
still there's little that is magnetized
to<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:53.510> neck<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.820> is<00:02:55.940> moving<00:02:57.220> completely

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
to the neck and it is moving completely

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:08.490 
to the neck and it is moving completely
