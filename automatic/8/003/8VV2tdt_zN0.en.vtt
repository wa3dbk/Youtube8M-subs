00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
was the Carol's Daughter foam heat

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.369 
was the Carol's Daughter foam heat
styling<00:00:38.910> foam<00:00:39.239> or<00:00:39.510> something<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.960> that

as<00:00:40.440> well<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:41.510> infusium<00:00:42.510> 23<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.270> what

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
as well as infusium 23 I think it's what

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.299 
as well as infusium 23 I think it's what
it's<00:00:45.539> called<00:00:45.780> hair<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.559> deep<00:00:46.800> conditioned

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
it's called hair was deep conditioned

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.150 
it's called hair was deep conditioned
prior<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.739> allowing

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
prior and so right now I'm just allowing

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.630 
prior and so right now I'm just allowing
the<00:00:50.579> rollers<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.180> completely<00:00:51.629> cool<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:53.070> I'm

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the rollers to completely cool so I'm

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.459 
the rollers to completely cool so I'm
gonna<00:00:53.789> wait<00:00:54.000> maybe<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.480> 10<00:00:54.809> minutes<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
gonna wait maybe about 10 minutes and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.260 
gonna wait maybe about 10 minutes and
then<00:00:55.620> I'll<00:00:55.770> remove<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.460> rollers<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.180> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
then I'll remove the rollers but as you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
then I'll remove the rollers but as you
can<00:00:57.390> see<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.780> hair<00:00:57.960> has<00:00:58.170> really<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.770> nice

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
this is our third attempt at doing a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.730 
this is our third attempt at doing a
roller<00:01:05.100> set<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.479> each<00:01:06.750> time<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.260> gets<00:01:07.350> better

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
roller set and each time it gets better

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.940 
roller set and each time it gets better
and<00:01:08.010> better<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.640> foam<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.960> assisted

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and better the foam actually assisted

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.330 
and better the foam actually assisted
with<00:01:11.250> me<00:01:11.850> getting<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.390> rollers<00:01:12.979> into<00:01:13.979> our

it using the end paper so we'll see how

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760 
it using the end paper so we'll see how
this<00:01:20.520> turns<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:21.060> but<00:01:21.780> yeah<00:01:22.290> I'll<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.619> more
