 tutorial let's show you there how 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.470
 is the game's gameplay works the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.519
 game controls 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.310
 Ok, so let's start here by passing the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.050
 Mouse controls the client can do 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.239
 with mouse in the game right 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.149
 you can use to walk you click on 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.520
 a place that our little doll here goes 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.700
 how far you clicked you can 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.370
 simply click hold and ours 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.039
 The little man goes there following the arrow 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.949
 mouse you can also use the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.070
 left mouse button to interact with 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.219
 objects on ok you will interacting with 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.680
 cyclic it interacts with the object until 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.740
 with animals is cyclical he will try 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.540
 attack and some objects there some 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.900
 tools let us have another 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.509
 means of interaction so let here 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.250
 to equip if you can use the button 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.380
 left mouse button or any other 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.070
 thing here that you want to equip or 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.960
 eat 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.810
 shortcut the left button of the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.280
 mouse then it's a team that attacks you 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.619
 will see that there is another action yesterday 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.520
 right-handed mauzinho 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.890
 just press here once and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.490
 ready you had a different action 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.950
 if you press here the left button 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.720
 You would only take if you tightened the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.369
 right you interact a shape 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.189
 different you cover 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.079
 Why do the mouse controls 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.659
 are the ones you can also use 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.320
 the scroll bar and the mouse to 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.350
 and leave it farther away and the camera 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.280
 Your character is very basic this one. 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.320
 control 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.509
 and as you see here gives 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.820
 You do a lot for the keyboard, I 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.479
 I'll show you now that neither 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.520
 walk 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.330
 I do not need to use the mouse to walk 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.470
 Ok I can use the gacc keyboard on w 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.650
 go up 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.840
 is always down to the left and from 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.520
 exit right 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.070
 So you can walk without using the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.440
 mouse another thing cool that effect 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.450
 place the camera closer and place the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.660
 The farther camera you can do this. 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.550
 using the right keyboard arrows to 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.970
 up is closer and down arrow 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.130
 is further you can also use the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.530
 other right and left arrows to 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.720
 right to use the map angle 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.830
 ok another way to do this on the keyboard 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.420
 and using the key that is the key and you 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.080
 You can do this with a mouse, that's it. 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.110
 Click here to turn left and right. 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.110
 right 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.830
 then these quick shortcuts to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.930
 the viewing angle of the map for April 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.020
 Pamper you can just click here 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.600
 with the mouse back to close or 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.310
 press the tab key that is a shortcut as well 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.250
 faster in my opinion because the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.620
 tab the person back he strip you can 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.130
 pause using this pause symbol 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.410
 here or using esc 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.500
 is not that you click is that it will pro 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.959
 pause and what took you out of pause are alright 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.220
 simple commands but in the end help 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.830
 enough 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.630
 another nice command is you use the 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.269
 numbers on the keyboard 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.060
 that part of the letters okay is not 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.550
 the numbers on the boy that has here put 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.700
 one ok there to activate the numbers that 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.500
 stay above the letters there to change that 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.530
 inventory things just click here 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.989
 one is equivalent to this business here is 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.549
 easy he put the pick here in the 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.190
 hands the portal 2 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.760
 he got here two ax again and 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:04.880
 concrete thing back 3 will interact 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.200
 with wood four five and up to ten 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.130
 where at 0 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.000
 he had with grace and if he can at least 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.609
 to interact here and more is not the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.359
 12th business you can interact with 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.130
 that way beauty but some other 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.380
 things to show you 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.030
 You can be here while using a chest 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.200
 you click here on the control 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.700
 tighten here divided saw in the hour of 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.850
 put it back here 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.590
 It's good to take something for 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.630
 split cute you click against 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.680
 clickon you want to split and he 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.320
 got half 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.240
 half-beauty on board or pretending to be 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.900
 I kept everything here and I want to get everything from 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.350
 once 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.919
 just hit shift and click it puts 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.750
 all back where I go 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.400
 tighten shift here beauty 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.970
 I want to take only half of the 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.550
 chest tightening against the half ad hoc and to 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.520
 put of an I can tighten account 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:10.260
 again and clicking already put do not know there 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.380
 four here and simply eat other 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.720
 four beauty then some that 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.790
 commands that you can 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.110
 use to be more agile in gameplay 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.360
 there are some other little things that are a 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.130
 bit more complicated but I will explain 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.060
 For you, too, beauty. 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.950
 if you use here the op 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.590
 is a shortcut that does a great thing that 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.290
 it's work is love the camera does not follow 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.060
 more our little doll another via screen that 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.340
 using contra op 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.620
 squeezes again against the he says 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.460
 the screen and then back to your 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.090
 charm 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.460
 ok if I press here told me I shot 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.380
 The whole game interface is useful 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.180
 For those who do not like to see a lot 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.539
 of thing here but I honestly 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.280
 I prefer to keep the active interface only 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:03.450
 to try to get around to put to 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.430
 take ok have other shortcuts here one 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.440
 little less useful in my opinion but 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.990
 I 'll show you too that the 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:14.150
 control that shows there some 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.500
 de loudi statistics and also has the 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.240
 backspacer tabet space 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.090
 he will show here some 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.650
 game statistics that I do not believe 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.300
 that has so much relevance 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.590
 openly space and take it out again 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.200
 the last thing I have to show 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:36.560
 for you 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:38.840
 is the way to attack and real estate is passive 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.300
 I'm not at all close to him not me 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.730
 then attack your grip space only 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.020
 to finish it it does not attack our 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.730
 little doll does not attack 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.490
 so to do this at the keyboard 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:53.060
 climate that found a space there 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.760
 little doll attacks mobs that are not 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.540
 aggressive and aggressive 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.210
 secretary 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.910
 the space that will already attack him and another 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.140
 way to attack by mouse that way 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.360
 to interact 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.890
 You went mouse over it shows there. 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.720
 any interaction 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.510
