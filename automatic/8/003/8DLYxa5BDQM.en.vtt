00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.819
 W 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.910
 if you still bruise suddenly passed almost to finish 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.930
 in the field is also talking a little bit about the similarities and 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.930
 differences things and no accidents 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.060
 all presentations 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.239
 you 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.499
 was a doubt some differences he created the architecture course in 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.909
 obvious mistake I think these two 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:38.399
 they can interpenetrate how even one works with 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.079
 the engineer how does it work 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.060
 these two are a combination 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.290
 one helps the other professionally we can talk to a thousand in cash 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.660
 can calculated projected and participate in construction that the world is difficult o 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.270
 architect can also participate in the construction he participates also day 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.670
 of projects 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.960
 is to structure and health the service is not so radical it is that the architect 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.030
 he has a training plus a new song I simply have a characteristic 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.990
 more artistic sings 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 the team has a soul the matter that is very strong 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.940
 and then the leadership training this is a long debate 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.930
 we study not only architecture but also physical space building more 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.230
 makes students understand 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.930
 what is certain is that the organism comes to understand how the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.550
 what issues should they observe that here the city function in a way 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.570
 both the work that is in the selection has to have this type of 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.400
 project and knows that people who 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.729
 to last five years 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.140
 the order to the facts in them 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.990
 adi speaks days sanitation experts talk about climate aspects of 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.530
 topography and she has five of them in Chinese society as solutions 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.530
 urban planning or even modeling with the city for whoever wants to, this is how the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.400
 truck driver who lives nearby 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.429
 even if small company the mayor arcenos athas for March 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.209
 have a child 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.220
 and who knows how to write the law establishes it too 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.460
 we say that he wants pf stated that everyone has a bit right because the 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.189
 people live in a built environment 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.639
 We live in the city and we walk through the city. 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.889
 see the city sparse vacations 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.899
 then you have some perception of this the city indicates that as long as you have 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.339
 school life 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:35.279
 do not have to think so much about the area behind has cut its achievements that have 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:37.169
 ariza touch human and 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.969
 if the Social Democrats have presented excesses to cities 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.169
 at the time cities began 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.349
 a human being document begins to build and as it did in cities like 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.279
 is what builds and today how things happened to understand our 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:51.399
 moment too 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.639
 he has this great responsibility to make people feel 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:59.379
 hosted and functionally served in that space he has to say 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.639
 so a training 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.599
 much more suitable for 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.499
 creates the landscaping of this structure 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.920
 the architectural distribution 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.049
 the architectural design the distribution of spaces 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.589
 It's difficult, he's going to the house of everything. 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.619
 plays a social role he will interfere 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:21.049
 in the dynamics of the stadium of the military district already to design today being 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:21.489
 on here 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.480
 this moment is to be prepared that the building that you lift 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.959
 today the generation 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.939
 it generates the change in the direction of the wind they chose a series of questions 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.599
 in one draw 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.859
 architecture has all the technical part involved that is a part of the 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.830
 is that neither the line representatives 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.450
 without her it was as if she were in alfragide the same built structure 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.619
 interest and construction 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:51.459
 heck make turns reality of 100 acres ten 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:57.519
 for the architect he misses a thing often associated with the formation 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.839
 This is the personal life of that young man who has even 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:04.379
 But it's there, it's a little different. 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.340
 the engineer is a bit more professional because he has a load of 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.190
 subject 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.850
 I would say that it is more certain analytic does not involve more guilt but physical more 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.859
 mechanics 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.039
 psp professional training 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.289
 is more in the sense of granting the project 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.229
 knowledge of the techniques for the project 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.569
 already the engineer he knows the techniques for light construction base 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:30.599
 do bugre 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.020
 then it is not enough to know that it is a village or that it is a law and has to know 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.710
 certain number to be able to use should not be anything they have decided 

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:42.749
 fight for so-called constructive techniques year another focus on the issue 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.979
 of construction 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.469
 the civil engineer 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:52.069
 he is the one who will do the structural calculation will do the calculation of the 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.549
 foundations where the building is supported after these calculations 

00:04:56.549 --> 00:05:01.399
 be used from this calculation we have the construction 

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:04.509
 if you will have a resident Syrian leader 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:09.229
 touching this work from its beginning to the end so the focus is a little 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:09.509
 different
