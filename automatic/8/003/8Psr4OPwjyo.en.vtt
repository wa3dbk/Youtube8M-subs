00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.789
 you can contribute to the proper functioning of the project

 fresh scheme consists of five points 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.550
 the training I keep so first thought he had the motivation 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.900
 secondly, meeting an appointment 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.360

 within that do not go well and projects 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 the fact that they demanded it 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.360
 communication 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.490
 on the communication network for all information 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.640
 can listen with 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.130

 your investments for it is you awarded 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.810

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.740
 the group 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.869
 and wanted to be able to learn from other group members 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.220
 so that was if your skills the coach decided to give viper 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.610
 to formulate proposals that help group processes 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.930
 that was three times 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.480
 a little later in the day I was constructive to improve education 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.130
