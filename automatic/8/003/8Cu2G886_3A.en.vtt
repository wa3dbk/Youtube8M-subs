00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
the last evolution on back tech maybe

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.530 
the last evolution on back tech maybe
there<00:00:14.070> might<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.280> one<00:00:14.610> more<00:00:14.790> evolution<00:00:15.269> not

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
there might be one more evolution not

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.599 
there might be one more evolution not
sure<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:16.199> hope<00:00:16.740> not<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.310> don't<00:00:17.430> want<00:00:17.550> to
