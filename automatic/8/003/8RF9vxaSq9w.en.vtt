pool tab here but honestly I mean I
don't<00:01:35.490> even<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.000> lock<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.540> my<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.049> key

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
don't even have the lock for my the key

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
don't even have the lock for my the key
for<00:01:37.500> my<00:01:37.619> lock<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> side<00:01:38.400> right<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.909> I

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
guide where the LV is here as my Center

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.830 
guide where the LV is here as my Center
that's<00:03:01.879> where<00:03:02.090> I'm<00:03:02.180> going<00:03:02.300> to<00:03:02.390> actually<00:03:02.660> put

usually the Maud monograms are all the
way<00:03:22.400> around<00:03:23.060> even<00:03:23.420> on<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.810> bottom<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.319> bag

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
and continues on to the backside I'm

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.660 
and continues on to the backside I'm
just<00:03:27.500> going<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.650> do<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.040> front<00:03:28.220> side<00:03:28.489> of<00:03:28.519> my

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.850 
just going to do the front side of my
bag<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.299> so<00:03:29.510> I'm<00:03:29.660> going<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.930> mark<00:03:30.230> off<00:03:30.470> where<00:03:30.500> I

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
bag and so I'm going to mark off where I

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.319 
bag and so I'm going to mark off where I
want<00:03:31.130> to<00:03:31.190> stop<00:03:31.549> so<00:03:31.790> I'm<00:03:31.910> just<00:03:32.000> going<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.180> use

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
want to stop so I'm just going to use

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.390 
want to stop so I'm just going to use
another<00:03:32.510> piece<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:32.840> tape<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.860> kind<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:34.190> make

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
another piece of tape and kind of make

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.009 
another piece of tape and kind of make
like<00:03:34.430> a<00:03:34.579> straight<00:03:35.000> edge<00:03:35.180> here<00:03:35.510> on<00:03:35.599> the<00:03:35.720> bottom

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
like a straight edge here on the bottom

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.509 
like a straight edge here on the bottom
so<00:03:36.140> they'll<00:03:36.319> basically<00:03:36.440> just<00:03:36.920> come<00:03:37.190> all<00:03:37.430> the

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
so they'll basically just come all the

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.160 
so they'll basically just come all the
way<00:03:37.549> down<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.450> bottom<00:03:38.750> of<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.930> bag

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
way down to the bottom of the bag

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.290 
way down to the bottom of the bag

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
one to two coats but I have to let it

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.370 
one to two coats but I have to let it
dry<00:03:46.260> at<00:03:47.160> least<00:03:47.310> an<00:03:47.550> hour<00:03:47.670> between<00:03:47.970> coats<00:03:48.510> so

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
another coat which I probably will I'll

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:15.229

thinking about in the pink stripe on the
center<00:05:20.550> now<00:05:20.789> but<00:05:21.000> I'm<00:05:21.060> going<00:05:21.210> to<00:05:21.240> make<00:05:21.360> it<00:05:21.510> a

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
center now but I'm going to make it a

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.690 
center now but I'm going to make it a
little<00:05:21.780> bit<00:05:21.900> thinner<00:05:22.169> than<00:05:22.490> filling<00:05:23.490> it<00:05:23.610> in

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
little bit thinner than filling it in

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.550 
little bit thinner than filling it in
completely<00:05:24.419> so<00:05:24.600> I'm<00:05:24.720> going<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:24.930> tape<00:05:25.140> off<00:05:25.350> some

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
completely so I'm going to tape off some

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.529 
completely so I'm going to tape off some
sections<00:05:26.070> and<00:05:26.340> then<00:05:26.820> I'll<00:05:26.910> paint<00:05:27.120> my<00:05:27.180> pink

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
sections and then I'll paint my pink

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:47.630 
sections and then I'll paint my pink
stripe

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.460 

so<00:05:48.640> not<00:05:48.820> too<00:05:49.000> bad<00:05:49.030> so<00:05:49.630> I'll<00:05:49.780> just<00:05:49.930> go<00:05:50.080> back<00:05:50.200> and

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
so not too bad so I'll just go back and

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.140 
so not too bad so I'll just go back and
do<00:05:50.590> some<00:05:50.800> touch-ups<00:05:51.220> with<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:51.580> wet<00:05:51.940> paper

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
do some touch-ups with the wet paper

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.490 
do some touch-ups with the wet paper
towel<00:05:52.480> and<00:05:52.510> kind<00:05:52.870> of<00:05:52.900> straighten<00:05:53.260> up<00:05:53.350> those

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
towel and kind of straighten up those

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:10.710 
towel and kind of straighten up those
edges<00:05:53.860> a<00:05:53.890> little<00:05:53.980> bit<00:05:54.190> and<00:05:54.580> then<00:05:55.150> I'll<00:05:55.270> be<00:05:55.420> done

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
ping I was indecisive on either choosing

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.550 
ping I was indecisive on either choosing
like<00:06:18.460> a<00:06:18.490> hot<00:06:18.760> pink<00:06:19.120> or<00:06:19.420> like<00:06:19.690> a<00:06:19.720> baby<00:06:20.020> pastel

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.430 
like a hot pink or like a baby pastel
pink<00:06:20.800> but<00:06:21.430> I<00:06:21.460> really<00:06:21.790> like<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.480> the<00:06:22.960> color<00:06:23.230> of

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
pink but I really like the the color of

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.080 
pink but I really like the the color of
the<00:06:23.560> baby<00:06:23.800> pink<00:06:24.070> against<00:06:24.490> the<00:06:24.580> brown<00:06:24.820> with

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
the baby pink against the brown with

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.120 
the baby pink against the brown with
like<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.330> white<00:06:25.510> stripe<00:06:25.960> and<00:06:26.380> I<00:06:26.770> didn't<00:06:27.040> do

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
like the white stripe and I didn't do

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.250 
like the white stripe and I didn't do
too<00:06:27.160> bad<00:06:27.490> on<00:06:27.520> my<00:06:27.910> initial<00:06:28.600> I<00:06:28.900> thought<00:06:29.080> I<00:06:29.110> was

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:29.260 
too bad on my initial I thought I was

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.540 
too bad on my initial I thought I was
going<00:06:29.350> to<00:06:29.410> kind<00:06:29.620> of<00:06:29.650> mess<00:06:29.830> up<00:06:30.010> the<00:06:30.130> letter<00:06:30.310> E

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
going to kind of mess up the letter E

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.490 
going to kind of mess up the letter E
but<00:06:30.580> that<00:06:31.570> was<00:06:31.660> pretty<00:06:31.840> easy<00:06:31.930> to<00:06:32.200> kind<00:06:32.470> of

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
but that was pretty easy to kind of

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.650 
but that was pretty easy to kind of
follow<00:06:32.680> the<00:06:33.220> LV<00:06:33.580> pattern<00:06:34.000> already<00:06:34.330> on<00:06:34.450> there

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
follow the LV pattern already on there

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.510 
follow the LV pattern already on there
and<00:06:34.840> just<00:06:34.960> turn<00:06:35.290> it<00:06:35.440> into<00:06:35.590> an<00:06:35.800> e<00:06:36.010> kind<00:06:36.340> of<00:06:36.400> like

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
and just turn it into an e kind of like

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.860 
and just turn it into an e kind of like
how<00:06:36.670> I<00:06:36.700> just<00:06:36.730> have<00:06:37.030> it<00:06:37.060> on<00:06:37.180> one<00:06:37.360> side<00:06:37.630> of<00:06:37.750> the

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
how I just have it on one side of the

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.260 
how I just have it on one side of the
bag<00:06:38.020> I<00:06:38.200> didn't<00:06:38.410> want<00:06:38.560> to<00:06:38.650> do<00:06:38.770> the<00:06:38.980> back<00:06:39.130> side<00:06:39.430> I

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
might at a later date really liked how
