00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.899
 In the growing computer, I want to point out a misunderstanding of people. 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.749
 How much memory do you need on a modern computer? 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.300
 To illustrate this, I will explain the difference between it and storage. 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.090
 Then I have to explain what the memory is doing. 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.660
 Finally, there are some real-world tests, that is, the experience gap in different memory sizes. 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.440
 In order to make this clear, let’s first review 1982. 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.060
 This is a C64 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.640
 With 64KB RAM 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.230
 If you take the computer apart, you can see the memory chip here. 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.900
 But no built-in storage 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.000
 If you want to use any form of software, you need an external storage device 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.980
 For example, you can load and store programs or data to this tape drive. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.760
 Or you can use a floppy drive 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.640
 Now, over time, memory and storage devices have improved a lot. 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.980
 In 1980, we measured memory capacity in kilobytes (KB) 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.440
 In 1990, we measured in megabytes (MB). 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.700
 Today we measure in gigabytes (GB) 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.580
 (I know that 1KB is actually 1024 bytes) 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.960
 As for the storage device 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.470
 Let's start with a floppy disk 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.090
 Then the hard disk 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.690
 Followed by CD and DVD 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.610
 Now is flash 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.530
 Take the memory card for this USB flash drive or camera. 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.540
 They all use flash, even if we call it flash 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.870
 But they are not the memory used on the computer 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.820
 Still only for storing data and software 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.920
 The problem we encountered was on these modern devices, such as this iPad. 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.610
 Or iPhone, the size of the memory is not advertised. 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.650
 No one has any memory 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.910
 What they advertise is the size of the storage space. 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.640
 This storage is flash, but don't forget 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.460
 iPad still retains memory, just like flash 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.200
 The truth is, this original iPad has 256MB of memory. 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.480
 But it has 16GB of storage 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.340
 It’s nothing to say about iPad or iPhone (Note: 16GB is now a version) 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.779
 But the problem is if people want to buy a laptop. 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.060
 If they see a laptop with 2GB of memory, they want 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.760
 "Wow, this is not enough. My iPad has 16GB of RAM." 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.420
 However the problem is 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.920
 On the iPad you see the storage capacity 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.139
 And what you see on the laptop is the actual memory. 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.220
 When these customers come to me, these customers often don’t talk to me smoothly. 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.040
 Because they want a computer with as much storage space as possible 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:39.259
 Because they want to store a lot of photos and music on their computers. 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:40.859
 We are here again to make it clear 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.079
 Let's take a look at the Macbook now. 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.979
 This is the memory chip 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.879
 Not for storage 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.620
 Your music and photos won't be there here 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.240
 This is your hard drive 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.100
 This is a storage device 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.140
 Here, this hard drive has 60GB 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.049
 Your music, photos, and documents will be stored here. 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.760
 In fact, laptops have far more memory than iPads. 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.240
 More storage space 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.059
 So, what are the benefits of having more memory on your computer? 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.600
 Memory is helping the processor work, let me explain 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.659
 Let's talk about working as a person. 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.720
 Take a copy of the white paper and the number, and copy the numbers one by one. 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.700
 You need to look at these numbers and write down as much as possible, then write them down. 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.169
 The speed at which this is done depends on two factors 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.599
 1. How fast can you write? 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.309
 2. How much can you write down? 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:48.120
 Imagine if you write down the entire page at once. 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.919
 How fast to write again 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.340
 Adding more memory can actually increase the speed at which you complete the task. 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.720
 However, there is a pit that most people don’t understand. 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.920
 When you add memory to a certain amount, adding memory will make no sense. 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.559
 Even if I can record hundreds of pages at a time 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.980
 I still can't significantly improve the efficiency of doing this work. 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.150
 Mainly because my writing speed is slower. 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.449
 It works much like a computer, if you don't have enough memory 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.820
 Add more memory to greatly increase the speed of the computer 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.240
 But if you add it to a large enough level, adding memory to your computer will not help. 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.860
 Purely a waste of money 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.760
 This raises the question of how much memory does your computer need? 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.000
 There is no specific answer to this because it is not the computer that determines how much memory to use. 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.240
 In fact, the software you use determines how much memory you need. 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.040
 So even if two people have identical computers 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.440
 But a person uses a different set of software, and the amount of memory required is different from the other party. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.040
 So I have to try to do some real life test scenarios. 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.420
 To show what software determines if additional memory is needed 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.660
 Please look forward to the second part (but there is 2333)
