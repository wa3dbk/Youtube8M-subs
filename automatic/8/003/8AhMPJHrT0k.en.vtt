00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.959
 already and do for the performance of the 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.189
 team rage we will stop making fun of 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.180
 dudes it's not because I've been 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.799
 recruited anything it's just that 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.509
 it's a reference can not the 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.859
 last is like for example at least 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.389

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.340
 and upwind we can love or not 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.080
 love these videos compare is when 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.460
 even success is the embodiment of 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.900
 pure success in its raw state 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.479
 as you say engraved in the rock 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.550
 my little bit early and if not bah me my 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.680
 course it was a little singular 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.699
 the third if you prefer they are 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.590
 realized that I was going to be included at 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.449
 on top of it I redoubled five times 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.490
 in college away no I'm kidding me I 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.690
 did the cockpit in music I 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.240
 I had fun choosing my classmates 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.620
 it was crazy I was ready for the 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.360
 theater I was told you should do 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.650
 actor actors not in us we do not know 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.880
 but in any case you want rather famous 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.419
 that telly everything and so suddenly bah 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.449
 I made them 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.080
 I did a little counter espionage 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.240
 stopped school I started to 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.800
 work at the market and then after I 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.090
 worked and the manna in service of 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.110
 sports I talk to you a little bit 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.000
 sailed but that's why we 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.380
 know each other a little bit better 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.789
 which therefore does not concern my passions I 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.039
 wanted to tell me it's really 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.539
 bursting we are here to take but 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.099
 as you can see on the gameplay 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.360
 to quickly get back on rage and 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.039
 human does not respect anyone 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.960
 they are called the gign to prisoners 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.220
 be careful there is a madman in the map on 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.909
 do not stop the ready set everywhere it is 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.370
 to the right and to the left 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.840
 he respects people and 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.430
 fictitiously there was that of emma he already 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.659
 unlocked creed but the fact is he's the 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.550
 guard because he wants to do the maximum 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.380
 cereal weapons as you saw in 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.700
 the title 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.560
 roma bag the posts the gossip 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.790
 honestly honestly how is this 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.830
 that we can criticize the said clearly 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.990
 it's something huge 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.380
 hallucinating thing is exploding like 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.030
 little fools 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.410
 brief eye conflict it does not have too much
