 we will speak the defense equal the first 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.150
 everything is that you have to learn to 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.880
 play as if real life is , 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.150

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.470
 you always have in mind, because 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.380
 football soccer factors of the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.690
 real life let's go from this you have 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.980
 that when I started playing only at 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.619
 start the game you have to put 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.769
 our attitude in defensive is ultra 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.800
 defensive defensive normal offensive and 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.109
 ultra offensive because you have to put in 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.780
 defensive so you do not get caught with a 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:44.059
 I contrapiÃ© you can go and study 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.069
 our rivals how they play here you see 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.499
 I'm waiting a little bit I'm 

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:50.600
 looking like the raisins and if you start 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:53.089
 some play by the band and so it is 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.499
 but let's help your compis to 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.799
 remove the ball from rivals this 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:00.090
 means by pressing the button on the 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:03.180
 finger i think that 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.940
 r 1 with your classmates your others 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.330
 defenses because they help when you have 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.100
 Your opponent has surpassed the player who 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.950
 you control these two same defenses 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.300
 They help you so that they can help you 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.760
 remove the ball 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.770
 or they make the other rival get 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.660
 nervous and miss the goalie 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.900
 undefended over your team take advantage of it 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.060
 this means that if in these same 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.119
 plays has also surpassed you to 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.979
 all your defenses and all the others 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.110
 players then take advantage with the goalkeeper 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.020
 than to leave that many times 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.140
 it is true that if the player opposites 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.790
 controls volleys or 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.560
 dribbling, you can haggle yourself 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.930
 but good in these players that the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.399
 Goalkeeper helps you not score goal 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.380
 The more you open your rival to mark more 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.060
 mistakes will do this what does it mean 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.260
 that for example here you see that 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.350
 I just know 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:01.240
 it rushes towards the fault that also 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.950
 is to start the play well that you see 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.530
 is a little bottega do then that 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.600
 so I change the band and you'll see 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.210
 the next in the same play that does not 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.950
 has won a goal opportunity but if there 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.920
 a very dangerous occasion that you see 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.310
 that almost almost came to the ball and nothing is going 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.310
 To the next one 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.840
 and well the last one is try to do the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.340
 smaller number of possible because because 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.310
 It is very easy to give cakes and here you see 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.160
 that I do two and immediately causes me a 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.510
 center that luckily you finish goal 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.390
 here you see that it goes to the stick and luckily 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.280
 do not do this nonsense with those with 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.110
 the tacos either and well I hope that you 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.180
 he liked it is secular brito subscribe and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.180
 see you next video goodbye
