00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.550
 this 2014 is the year in which the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.040
 concept of smart home or 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.349
 smartphone is beginning to take 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.839
 more seriously and it seems that his 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.080
 medium-term massification is something 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:18.840
 increasingly feasible for this we will 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.120
 know some devices systems and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.550
 applications that can convert into 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.550
 our dwellings in the houses of the future 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.720
 I would say the big brands are betting 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.210
 for this trend as is the case of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.610
 samsung smart home and the gijÃ³n chat 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.410
 devices to give them orders 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.420
 small and medium-sized enterprises are those 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.900
 are offering us the biggest 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.210
 innovations among these we have the jess 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.160
 recently acquired by google in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.620
 nothing less than 3,200 million dollars 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.150
 driven by former apple engineers 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.790

 but he is learning from our 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.330
 daily routine to configure 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.119

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.540
 energy deactivating only when not 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.390
 we are at home and if that was not enough, 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.759
 wifi connection allows us to control it 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.030
 from a web application or from the
