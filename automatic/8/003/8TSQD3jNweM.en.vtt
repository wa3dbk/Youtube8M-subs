00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.549
 have and linger on the 4th round of the 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.400
 French Cup 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:14.039
 an event for the club nation on 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.730
 hoping to pull the bigger pebbles but 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:23.789
 good we will be satisfied with the sp3 the ace 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.390
 brestoise so a dsr we'll see well 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.239
 remain a match 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.070
 I'm not too hopeful 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.679
 that it will be a good match and fair play and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.489
 then the music a home match 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.980
 it is important 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.900
 quite important to us it's very 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.220
 important to us we will seen 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.660
 top referees we can hope 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.970
 big thing 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.740
 I hope the players are happy 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.720
 with the equipment jersey shorts 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.280
 socks 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.380
 they played the last match pushed 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.650
 which must play for ways to 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.650
 teams in good matches president thank you 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.440
 so Mr. President the butterflies 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.830
 of spe are two against five to 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.470
 simply localised cfa2 and so 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.570
 last season small poucet of the cup 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.070
 of France who loses account psg so after 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.910
 five to locminé after psg knows 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.560
 now it can be the shares share 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.650
 that we are small plus it is so we take 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.570
 do we want to take the thing 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.810
 joy as we are happy we waited 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.090
 a big perfect team and so the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.160
 coach then he'll have to federate 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.510
 until that game there stops a big 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.920
 match but it will serve us 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.480
 experience for the suite for 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.820
 championship that's the goal 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.510
 the cup is bonus cf it is very 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.510
 good day thoroughly and then we never know 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.700
 and so at the level of the players then a 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.850
 jersey outfit shorts socks that's 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.079
 not magical that's more than magic 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.750
 it's a first in addition so 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.259
 well than hope better especially on a 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.390
 time like that is skewed 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.650
 this brief 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.289
 and so the fans is what they 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.420
 will be at the rendezvous so I think of 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.560
 same as the third already quite a lot of 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.600
 world so here I think everyone 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.430
 will be motivated and everyone will be 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.910
 behind us right well good luck 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.010
 Spézet 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.980
 and then good luck thank you so match 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.260
 between the ouch and one against the oust the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.850
 would then fuse the oust and the 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.190
 but this president happy to 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.230
 to move I guess not really on 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.319
 would have preferred to have home but 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.100
 good when one of them we will say that 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.020
 everything is possible 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.650
 The Coupe de France is made to roam 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.530
 so right and the coach then he is 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.540
 happy to play a team of d1 yes 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.980
 because it's a team at our 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.570
 worn as vice versa and for garlic and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.410
 while what is the biggest 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.330
 satisfaction to receive at jo a d2 I 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.620
 think the label has changed sides 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.600
 usually we are always small 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.340
 poucet city name almost the favorite 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.220
 so I think it will be a very tough match 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.709
 difficult to learn the most 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:15.030
 seriously and so that will necessarily 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.030
 a district team in the 5th round 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.380
 what is important is that 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.420
 as for the evening for us it's going to be a 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.030
 opportunity to revive momentum at 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:32.120
 club level now is what 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.470
 it's a draw so there are the teams 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.240
 are going to move and watch you have 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.040
 of the globally public world to garlic and 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:43.730
 it follows yeah I think Sunday 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:46.340
 last and at level 2 of your team 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.000
 it's the same way you'll let off steam 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.990
 weekend of cystic fibrosis which 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.840
 expect this weekend there so we 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.360
 risk of having a little trouble and very good 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.640
 match and then go on the 5th lap 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.190
 for one of the two teams 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.550
 worthy so so Mr. President 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.040
 so of val-dizé drh who therefore receives the 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.770
 president of the eu and this figure and ph 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.470
 mister president happy to receive 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.210
 especially since we exceeded 3 times the guys 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.520
 so obviously we're happy when 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.350
 I 'm happy with the draw because 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.799
 that good it's neighbors and then 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.550
 how long ago I believe 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.790
 that they would do so it'll be 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.800
 the opportunity is so president then of 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.410
 stay fresh happy also to get to 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.610
 this turning the equipment and then and 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.980
 then came a derby 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.630
 she's actually going a derby like 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.700
 you say we're going to move to 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.860
 we will go 10 km to go to val 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.120
 Isère but with great pleasure then 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.930
 it is true that we cut or prefer 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.630
 always receive 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.460
 we moved twice we received 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.230
 which we have been able to defeat 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.480
 penalty it was very difficult 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.950
 and then I would say that now it's 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.360
 that bonus and players had for 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.670
 goal to get the jerseys 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.080
 they have now fled them now 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.880
 it's just a bonus and then a beautiful 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.930
 world match is winner wins and 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.520
 that the best winner who made you 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.540
 a lot of free pub to your jerseys 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.540
