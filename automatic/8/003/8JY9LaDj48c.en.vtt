of<00:00:44.550> summer<00:00:44.960> 717<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.200> believe<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.309> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
of summer 717 I believe that that is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
of summer 717 I believe that that is
actually<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.059> after<00:00:48.690> nationals

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
actually going to be after nationals

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.040 
actually going to be after nationals
which<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:50.550> kind<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.879> unfortunate<00:00:51.270> i<00:00:51.690> wish

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
which is it's kind of unfortunate i wish

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.600 
which is it's kind of unfortunate i wish
it<00:00:52.199> would<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.410> been<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.710> month<00:00:53.100> earlier

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
it would have been like a month earlier

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.180 
it would have been like a month earlier
so<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.480> lot<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.260> these<00:00:55.350> premiere<00:00:55.829> cards

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
so then a lot of these premiere cards

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
so then a lot of these premiere cards
could<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.460> been<00:00:56.579> used<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.180> UM<00:00:57.360> at<00:00:57.390> Nationals

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
could have been used at UM at Nationals

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.459 
could have been used at UM at Nationals
because<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.440> mean<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.340> guys<00:00:59.520> know<00:00:59.579> how<00:00:59.910> big

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
because I mean you guys know how big

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.680 
because I mean you guys know how big
like<00:01:01.469> dragons<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.190> Legends<00:01:02.550> was<00:01:02.850> last<00:01:03.210> year<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
like dragons of Legends was last year it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
like dragons of Legends was last year it
was<00:01:03.719> huge<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.589> far<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> competitive

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
was huge as far as the competitive

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.520 
was huge as far as the competitive
impact<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.970> had<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.330> meta<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:07.020> got<00:01:07.200> sole

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
impact it had on the meta we got sole

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.100 
impact it had on the meta we got sole
charge<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:08.549> card<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:09.119> dominated<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> game

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
charge that card just dominated the game

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.969 
charge that card just dominated the game
it<00:01:10.409> took<00:01:10.740> decks<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.580> sylvans<00:01:12.590> mythic<00:01:13.590> rulers

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it took decks like sylvans mythic rulers

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.920 
it took decks like sylvans mythic rulers
and<00:01:14.340> Fernet<00:01:14.729> ii<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.060> took<00:01:15.240> two<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> those<00:01:15.630> decks

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
and Fernet ii it took two of those decks

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.719 
and Fernet ii it took two of those decks
I<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.439> two<00:01:16.680> different<00:01:17.130> levels<00:01:17.430> like

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
I think that two different levels like

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.429 
I think that two different levels like
two<00:01:17.909> new<00:01:18.090> tears<00:01:18.390> because<00:01:18.900> i<00:01:19.080> think<00:01:19.140> i<00:01:19.380> think

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
two new tears because i think i think

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.289 
two new tears because i think i think
sylvans<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.159> still<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.729> good<00:01:20.880> deck<00:01:21.090> but

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
sylvans was still a really good deck but

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.570 
sylvans was still a really good deck but
like<00:01:21.450> mythic<00:01:21.840> rulers<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.439> infernity<00:01:23.070> went

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
like mythic rulers and infernity went

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.730 
like mythic rulers and infernity went
from<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.970> no<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:24.960> even<00:01:25.170> played<00:01:25.380> them<00:01:25.560> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
from like no one even played them to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.530 
from like no one even played them to
like<00:01:25.890> tier<00:01:26.189> one<00:01:26.430> decks<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.360> obviously

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
like tier one decks and then obviously

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.120 
like tier one decks and then obviously
you<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.900> fire<00:01:28.229> hand<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.590> ice<00:01:28.680> hand<00:01:28.979> which
