 romantic ballets are doomed to 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.230
 suffer 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.130
 they will not be able to live their great love

 [Music] 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 we 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.220
 dabei was speaking the central theme this is 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.750
 that love triumphs over everything is a 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.910
 little like the eternal struggle between the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.100
 good and evil 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.100
 [Music] 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.100
 1 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.720
 ok when we think about all these 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.520
 intrigues were written by men 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.680
 [Laughs] 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.640
 [Music] 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.980
 it's probably due to the fact that 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.280
 women are considered sex 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.280
 low 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.569
 and when we go to the dance act he 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.209
 ya it's in the hunter's cave 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.209
 Oriental who takes away the innocent heroine 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.370
 same direction anyway what is 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.770
 interesting is that as soon as it does 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.229
 intervene exotic characters the 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.340
 choreography becomes more daring and 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.340
 detaches from the classical norm 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.800
 [Music] 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.880
 it's not politically correct but 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.880
 it reflects the thought of the time 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.310
 m 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.020
 the sinister kidnappers or the noble the 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.460
 hero in the romantic ballet the 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.830
 male characters are 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.230
 stereotypes their role has long been 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.540
 limited to wearing the star dancer and to 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:15.250
 highlight it 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.250
 until the arrival of rudolph noureev 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.210
 in the big classic aisles that 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.440
 staging 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.670
 noureev always has radically 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.000
 transformed the main roles 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.830
 male 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.200
 this is the case for example in its version 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.000
 Sleeping Beauty 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.750
 he has profoundly change the image 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.750
 of the male dancer 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:06:16.870

 New York in their choreography in 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.470

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.660
 beyond 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:45.639
 a low skull you can express yourself so much 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:47.409
 things in classical dance with two 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:50.469
 body approaching or merging 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:53.969

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.770
 something that I have to try to 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.949
 reproduce and incorporate in my 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.949
 job 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:41.250
 [Music] 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.990
 eroticism and classical ballet 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.250
 an aspect that could easily 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.530
 to escape the profane 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.629
 yet he is there and for it 

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:53.340

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:02.090
 perfection but exactly what I 

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:04.439
 want it takes time and strength 

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:08.150
 but as long as I do not wait for what I 

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:11.580
 want I do not stop working
