00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 One day a friend asked me why 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.899
 all the books that I have are 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.179
 originals and with 30 270 soles that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.330
 I invest in a book, can I buy 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.860
 three or four total pirate books of is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.860
 the same content 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.600
 hello everyone in the libroferia greets 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.400
 to your friend the bug and before you start 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.770
 with the theme and with my opinion 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.330
 I would like to contextualize them a bit with 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.330
 the reality of my country at least of my 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.540
 city here in Lima the subject of the 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.250
 piracy is like that very expanded in 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.590
 all its variants from clothing movies 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.760
 books and as for the book that is what 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.940
 that we are interested in your sale is done 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.180
 openly in bridges galleries 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.120
 avenues and so on if they become operational 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:59.590
 but as they are a greeting greeting to the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.379
 flag is not to be truly done 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.220
 something about it is not like for 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:09.750
 sadness of the private sector piracy 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.510
 it's something already very 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.870
 normalized within d 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.810
 the consumer buying habit 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.630
 less than my city in my case when 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.940
 it's about movies I have no scruples 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 some in buying pirate with telling him that 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.500
 not 100% of the movie that I have in 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.140
 divide are pirates and haiti 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.830
 but when it comes to books they have 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.590
 to be original yes or yes it does not matter if 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.050
 they are new or if they are used be the thing 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.110
 is that they are original I know I had a 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.390
 time where he printed the pdfs and two 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.690
 rings and instead I have a world 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.479
 aldous huxley happy that the printed 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.550
 that again df in print in my 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.700
 piece but good also that they are of a 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.870
 era when I did not work then 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.690
 he wanted to find me all the means 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.950
 possible to read but just like that 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.849
 the feeling of reading 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.069
 a copy that I have made myself is not the 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.360
 same and it's not a moral issue for the 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.700
 which I do this but because they have seen 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.849
 books pirate binding 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.190
 The copy covers can all 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.099
 pages but they are bad so they can 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.040
 see a little the eagerness of that to have in 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.890
 my stand of original books and nothing of 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.190
 pirate books and I recommend one thing 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.980
 series over ten years ago 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.920
 when I was still in a friend's school 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.930
 my best friend from school gave me a gift 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.239
 copy of the time history of 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.030
 stephen hawkins a book that if he was 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.069
 Wanting to read for a long time and 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.130
 sincerely if I thanked her I read it 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.040
 I did not disgust or anything like that 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.340
 but two years ago I was in a 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.000
 bookstore and I found the original copy 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.880
 of the book that was here 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.730
 and I ended up donating the book that he gave me 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.380
 then I am a horrible person if 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.120
 are you watching this video 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.209
 Robert 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.690
 do not take it as a major or long ago 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.620
 time and you know things 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.810
 on purpose because I do not ride that 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.150
 It bothers me to have a book in my closet 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.579
 pirate and elderly people I do not have that 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.620
 feeling of before and now I am an iceberg 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.909
 of ice with many things even with 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.989
 the titles that will make me a reality 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.989
 how are you from here 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.170
 they have to be original what happens 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.980
 is that I consider this one more garlic leaves 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.739
 small pieces of collection then at 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.200
 acquire a pirate like I do not feel 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.050
 they lose the value they should have 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.500
 good only as I handle things 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:01.730
 as I perceive things I do not know if they will 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:05.000
 other people with the same perception 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.700
 with the same inclination to buy 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.370
 only originals and nothing more than 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.310
 original book concepts thank you 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.200
 to see and see you next week 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.200
 and remember do not admire Tamils
