of<00:02:16.100> these<00:02:16.460> new<00:02:16.670> phones<00:02:16.970> now<00:02:17.450> first<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.870> all

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
of these new phones now first of all

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.980 
of these new phones now first of all
they<00:02:18.500> each<00:02:18.680> have<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.160> 5.1<00:02:19.850> AMOLED<00:02:20.330> screen<00:02:20.690> and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
they each have a 5.1 AMOLED screen and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.790 
they each have a 5.1 AMOLED screen and
that<00:02:21.290> amounts<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.700> 2560<00:02:22.700> x<00:02:22.820> 1440<00:02:23.360> resolution

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
that amounts to 2560 x 1440 resolution

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.440 
that amounts to 2560 x 1440 resolution
that's<00:02:24.800> really<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.190> high<00:02:25.370> pixel<00:02:25.730> density<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.360> a

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
that's really a high pixel density and a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.230 
that's really a high pixel density and a
really<00:02:26.900> tiny<00:02:27.110> screen<00:02:27.590> think<00:02:28.190> about<00:02:28.400> this<00:02:28.610> most

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
really tiny screen think about this most

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.420 
really tiny screen think about this most
big<00:02:29.450> old<00:02:29.600> monitors<00:02:30.020> have<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.740> resolution<00:02:31.040> so

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
big old monitors have that resolution so

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.530 
big old monitors have that resolution so
you're<00:02:31.550> going<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.700> get<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.910> same<00:02:32.180> resolution

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
you're going to get that same resolution

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.200 
you're going to get that same resolution
in<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.290> 5-inch<00:02:33.800> screen<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.640> it's<00:02:34.760> going<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:34.970> look

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
in a 5-inch screen so it's going to look

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.180 
in a 5-inch screen so it's going to look
really<00:02:35.390> really<00:02:35.810> clear<00:02:36.260> another<00:02:36.860> great<00:02:37.130> thing

that 2560 x 1440 resolution now the edge

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.949 
that 2560 x 1440 resolution now the edge
just<00:03:28.070> like<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.430> name<00:03:28.549> implies<00:03:28.670> has<00:03:29.330> two<00:03:29.660> edges

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
just like the name implies has two edges

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.229 
just like the name implies has two edges
on<00:03:30.110> each<00:03:30.350> side<00:03:30.650> unlike<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.400> standard<00:03:31.610> Galaxy

s6<00:03:32.570> now<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.320> cool<00:03:33.590> thing<00:03:33.920> about<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.580> edge<00:03:34.760> is

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
s6 now the cool thing about the edge is

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.970 
s6 now the cool thing about the edge is
that<00:03:35.330> it<00:03:35.420> gives<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.780> notifications<00:03:36.590> shows

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
that it gives you notifications shows

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.710 
that it gives you notifications shows
you<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.340> time<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:38.090> has<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.269> couple

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
you the time and it has a couple

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.750 
you the time and it has a couple
different<00:03:39.140> modes<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.560> has<00:03:39.680> night<00:03:40.040> mode<00:03:40.310> which

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
different modes it has night mode which

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.810 
different modes it has night mode which
offers<00:03:41.120> lower<00:03:41.840> screen<00:03:42.200> resolution<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.040> lower

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
offers lower screen resolution and lower

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.280 
offers lower screen resolution and lower
obviously<00:03:44.330> brightness<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.019> helps

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
obviously brightness and this helps

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.289 
obviously brightness and this helps
conserve<00:03:45.620> battery<00:03:46.130> life<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.030> can<00:03:47.150> also

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
conserve battery life so you can also

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.000 
conserve battery life so you can also
set<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.810> we<00:03:47.930> roll<00:03:48.170> your<00:03:48.290> finger<00:03:48.560> across<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.799> so

set it we roll your finger across it so

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.650 
set it we roll your finger across it so
it<00:03:49.190> actually<00:03:49.340> brights<00:03:49.790> up<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.299> normal

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
it actually brights up to the normal

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.870 
it actually brights up to the normal
thing<00:03:50.930> another<00:03:51.709> really<00:03:52.070> cool<00:03:52.370> feature<00:03:52.430> about

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
things isn't that well at all we'll talk

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.390 
things isn't that well at all we'll talk
about<00:04:39.020> that<00:04:39.139> a<00:04:39.260> little<00:04:39.290> bit<00:04:39.500> more<00:04:39.740> but<00:04:40.280> it

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
about that a little bit more but it

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.100 
about that a little bit more but it
basically<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.850> bounces<00:04:41.300> out<00:04:41.480> due<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:41.960> the

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
basically just bounces out due to the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.750 
basically just bounces out due to the
fact<00:04:42.290> you<00:04:42.530> have<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.800> edge<00:04:43.010> that<00:04:43.310> extra

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
fact you have that edge that extra

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.159 
fact you have that edge that extra
screen<00:04:44.030> will<00:04:44.180> obviously<00:04:44.600> that's<00:04:44.930> going<00:04:45.080> to

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
screen will obviously that's going to

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.620 
screen will obviously that's going to
take<00:04:45.350> up<00:04:45.560> more<00:04:45.980> battery<00:04:46.520> power<00:04:46.610> true<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:47.570> to

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
take up more battery power true so to

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.120 
take up more battery power true so to
compensate<00:04:47.900> with<00:04:48.290> that<00:04:48.560> they've<00:04:48.770> given<00:04:48.980> the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
compensate with that they've given the

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.940 
compensate with that they've given the
edge<00:04:49.340> a<00:04:49.639> little<00:04:49.669> bit<00:04:50.000> bigger<00:04:50.389> battery<00:04:50.990> now<00:04:51.590> one

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
edge a little bit bigger battery now one

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.290 
edge a little bit bigger battery now one
thing<00:04:51.980> that<00:04:52.130> my<00:04:52.310> friend<00:04:52.550> Jonathan<00:04:52.940> touched<00:04:53.120> on

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
thing that my friend Jonathan touched on

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.700 
thing that my friend Jonathan touched on
about<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.600> video<00:04:53.810> is<00:04:53.900> that<00:04:54.139> one<00:04:54.560> of<00:04:54.590> the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
about the video is that one of the

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.200 
about the video is that one of the
technology<00:04:55.310> doesn't<00:04:55.580> seem<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:55.970> really<00:04:56.120> be

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
technology doesn't seem to really be

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.750 
technology doesn't seem to really be
advancing<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:57.050> battery<00:04:57.620> life<00:04:57.830> I<00:04:58.040> mean<00:04:58.370> in<00:04:58.639> all

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
advancing is battery life I mean in all

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.840 
advancing is battery life I mean in all
actuality<00:04:59.000> with<00:04:59.570> my<00:04:59.750> thinking<00:05:00.490> every<00:05:01.490> phone

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
actuality with my thinking every phone

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.510 
actuality with my thinking every phone
that<00:05:02.419> I've<00:05:02.570> actually<00:05:02.780> got<00:05:03.229> from<00:05:03.590> Samsung<00:05:04.130> the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
that I've actually got from Samsung the

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.250 
that I've actually got from Samsung the
battery<00:05:04.820> life<00:05:05.000> just<00:05:05.330> keeps<00:05:05.540> getting<00:05:05.870> worse

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
battery life just keeps getting worse

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.050 
battery life just keeps getting worse
and<00:05:06.590> I'm<00:05:07.010> not<00:05:07.100> even<00:05:07.310> joking<00:05:07.340> about<00:05:07.700> this<00:05:07.880> at

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
and I'm not even joking about this at

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.270 
and I'm not even joking about this at
all<00:05:08.150> my<00:05:08.630> original<00:05:08.870> one<00:05:09.169> I<00:05:09.260> hadn't<00:05:09.650> had<00:05:09.979> awesome

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
all my original one I hadn't had awesome

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.370 
all my original one I hadn't had awesome
stuff<00:05:10.700> I<00:05:10.790> had<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.000> note<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.450> that<00:05:11.930> damn<00:05:12.169> thing

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
stuff I had the note to that damn thing

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.140 
stuff I had the note to that damn thing
would<00:05:12.530> literally<00:05:12.800> last<00:05:13.130> me<00:05:13.370> three<00:05:13.940> days

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
would literally last me three days

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.330 
would literally last me three days
without<00:05:14.389> a<00:05:14.570> charge<00:05:14.900> I'm<00:05:15.350> charging<00:05:15.770> this<00:05:15.979> every

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
without a charge I'm charging this every

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.920 
without a charge I'm charging this every
day<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.729> it<00:05:17.000> seems<00:05:17.240> like<00:05:17.330> with<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.690> new<00:05:17.780> and

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
day and it seems like with the new and

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.050 
day and it seems like with the new and
if<00:05:18.020> I<00:05:18.110> get<00:05:18.169> it<00:05:18.410> I<00:05:18.470> might<00:05:18.590> be<00:05:18.740> charging<00:05:19.190> twice<00:05:20.030> a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
if I get it I might be charging twice a

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.390 
if I get it I might be charging twice a
day<00:05:20.419> so<00:05:21.050> that's<00:05:21.260> a<00:05:21.350> technology<00:05:21.979> that<00:05:22.010> really

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
day so that's a technology that really

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.520 
day so that's a technology that really
needs<00:05:22.820> to<00:05:22.940> be<00:05:23.120> worked<00:05:23.330> on<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:23.600> I<00:05:23.990> guess<00:05:24.500> it's

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
needs to be worked on and I guess it's

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.080 
needs to be worked on and I guess it's
true<00:05:24.830> they<00:05:25.130> keep<00:05:25.310> trying<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.580> make<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:25.880> phones

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
true they keep trying to make the phones

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.280 
true they keep trying to make the phones
you<00:05:26.240> know<00:05:26.360> thinner<00:05:26.660> and<00:05:26.870> thinner<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.229> thinner

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
you know thinner and thinner and thinner

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.840 
you know thinner and thinner and thinner
thing<00:05:27.650> foot<00:05:27.889> in<00:05:27.950> your<00:05:28.070> pocket<00:05:28.430> you<00:05:28.490> guys<00:05:28.639> all

thing foot in your pocket you guys all

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.820 
thing foot in your pocket you guys all
saw<00:05:28.970> the<00:05:29.030> big<00:05:29.360> ass<00:05:29.539> been<00:05:29.870> gate<00:05:30.110> thing<00:05:30.320> flew<00:05:30.620> out

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
saw the big ass been gate thing flew out

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.620 
saw the big ass been gate thing flew out
there<00:05:31.010> and<00:05:31.130> all<00:05:31.220> that<00:05:31.640> but<00:05:32.150> maybe<00:05:32.300> having

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
there and all that but maybe having

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.450 
there and all that but maybe having
a<00:05:32.720> little<00:05:32.930> bit<00:05:33.020> bigger<00:05:33.229> phone<00:05:33.590> with<00:05:34.039> a<00:05:34.070> longer

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
a little bit bigger phone with a longer

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.040 
a little bit bigger phone with a longer
battery<00:05:34.610> life<00:05:34.820> would<00:05:35.539> be<00:05:35.660> something<00:05:35.930> to

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
battery life would be something to

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.529 
battery life would be something to
seriously<00:05:36.440> think<00:05:36.530> about<00:05:36.800> both<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:37.729> galaxy<00:05:38.150> s6

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
seriously think about both the galaxy s6

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.560 
seriously think about both the galaxy s6
and<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:39.140> s6<00:05:39.590> edge<00:05:39.800> both<00:05:40.280> feature<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.760> 16

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
and the s6 edge both feature a 16

megapixel rear facing camera now this is

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.520 
megapixel rear facing camera now this is
the<00:05:43.910> same<00:05:44.150> as<00:05:44.330> previous<00:05:44.539> generations<00:05:45.320> but

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
the same as previous generations but

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.920 
the same as previous generations but
there<00:05:45.710> are<00:05:45.890> some<00:05:46.190> new<00:05:46.400> features<00:05:46.640> a<00:05:47.090> much<00:05:47.660> wider

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
there are some new features a much wider

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.170 
there are some new features a much wider
aperture<00:05:48.350> allows<00:05:48.740> for<00:05:49.400> a<00:05:49.430> lot<00:05:49.490> more<00:05:49.700> light<00:05:50.150> to

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180

enter into the camera which allows for
better<00:05:52.250> close<00:05:52.580> up<00:05:52.610> pictures<00:05:53.120> and<00:05:53.270> more

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
better close up pictures and more

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.330 
better close up pictures and more
blurred<00:05:53.720> background<00:05:54.229> as<00:05:54.410> well<00:05:54.830> as<00:05:54.979> those<00:05:55.160> low

blurred background as well as those low
light<00:05:55.550> situations<00:05:56.240> you'll<00:05:56.419> get<00:05:56.539> a<00:05:56.570> much

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
light situations you'll get a much

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.140 
light situations you'll get a much
clearer<00:05:57.320> picture<00:05:57.919> now<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.460> front<00:05:58.789> facing

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
clearer picture now the front facing

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.300 
clearer picture now the front facing
cameras<00:05:59.479> also<00:05:59.720> improved<00:06:00.320> as<00:06:00.500> well<00:06:00.710> it's<00:06:01.070> gone

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
cameras also improved as well it's gone

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.730 
cameras also improved as well it's gone
from<00:06:01.430> a<00:06:01.580> 2<00:06:01.729> megapixel<00:06:01.850> to<00:06:02.630> a<00:06:02.660> 5<00:06:02.990> megapixel<00:06:03.200> with

from a 2 megapixel to a 5 megapixel with
all<00:06:03.950> those<00:06:04.130> same<00:06:04.400> features<00:06:04.820> one<00:06:05.479> complaint

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
all those same features one complaint

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.909 
all those same features one complaint
that<00:06:06.020> people<00:06:06.380> had<00:06:06.590> on<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.889> previous

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
that people had on the previous

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.370
