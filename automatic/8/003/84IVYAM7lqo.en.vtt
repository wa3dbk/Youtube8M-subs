00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.890
 make this cute bun is on tape 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.690
 You can make it from satin on the ribbon 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.299
 that you wish very easy very 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.889
 simple we do it decorated with the 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.190
 little flowers that we made of the video 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.140
 previous but an idea that we give them 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.930
 you can develop it as 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.030
 you want we will teach you the step 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.510
 step by step each of the petals or 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.789
 the ears of each bun to make 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.929
 the smallest thing that we are going to do we are going to 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.170
 use two color ribbon strips 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:38.239
 it is 3.5 centimeters wide and 8 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.680
 centimeters long we will use 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.840
 six petals to make 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.850
 this little monkey or that flower like you 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.609
 want to say it 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.570
 here we are going to place the two tapes of 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:54.550
 this way one on top of the other we're going to 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.250
 diagonal bend 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.370
 how can you see super easy super 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.210
 simple and this part of the corner 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.450
 we're going to fold it to the center 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.060
 we speak it like that and already with this we have 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.970
 formed our 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.840
 our petal we are going to cut out what 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.840
 we have spare 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.850
 at this time you can already 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.759
 use the roving frame 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.210
 burn the tips of the tape so that 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.590
 they look pretty nice here we have a needle 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.340
 and thread 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:37.119
 We were going to spend sewing 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.270
 super fast super simple as everything 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.030
 that we teach in this channel already have 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.179
 many ideas to renew all 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.900
 those accessories and can sell their 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:55.180
 products we already have here the 6 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.180
 already on the needle and we will produce it 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.820
 from this 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.989
 we organize 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.750

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.480
 colors as you wish is already a 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.760

 Here we have been a few kilitos 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.780

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.560

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.560

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.690
 in the back a circle 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.470
 and finally we are going to use a 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.730
 of our flowers from the previous video 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.730
