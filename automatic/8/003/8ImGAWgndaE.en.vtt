00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939

background and the detailed background

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.520 
background and the detailed background
we're<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.119> trying<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> give<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.930> overall

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
we're just trying to give an overall

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.880 
we're just trying to give an overall
idea<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.119> general<00:01:42.570> topic<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.619> we're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
idea of the general topic that we're

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.380 
idea of the general topic that we're
talking<00:01:44.100> about<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:47.040> background<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.210> might

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
talking about so the background we might

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.050 
talking about so the background we might
start<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.380> phrases<00:01:50.329> such<00:01:51.329> as<00:01:51.570> today

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
start with some phrases such as today

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.990 
start with some phrases such as today
and<00:01:54.590> then<00:01:55.590> we<00:01:55.920> would<00:01:56.100> go<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.399> from<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
and then we would go on from there so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.850 
and then we would go on from there so
today<00:01:57.270> such-and-such<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:58.140> happening<00:01:58.649> and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
today such-and-such is happening and

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.170 
today such-and-such is happening and
this<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.189> big<00:01:59.399> problem<00:01:59.640> or<00:01:59.939> today's

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
this is a big problem or today's

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.580 
this is a big problem or today's
such-and-such<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.810> happening<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.560> a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
such-and-such is happening and this is a

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.950 
such-and-such is happening and this is a
trend<00:02:01.890> or<00:02:02.250> whatever<00:02:03.030> or<00:02:03.270> perhaps<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.750> might

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
trend or whatever or perhaps we might

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.850 
trend or whatever or perhaps we might
start<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.670> as<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:06.210> commonly<00:02:06.810> understood<00:02:09.860> so

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
start with as is commonly understood so

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.790 
start with as is commonly understood so
if<00:02:11.370> your<00:02:11.670> essay<00:02:11.970> question<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.420> asking

might want to start with is it is common
today<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.350> common<00:02:34.740> today<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.190> then<00:02:35.550> just

today it is common today and then just

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.850 
today it is common today and then just
go<00:02:35.970> from<00:02:36.180> there<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:36.540> these<00:02:37.140> are<00:02:37.290> all<00:02:37.410> these<00:02:37.680> are

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
go from there so these are all these are

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.200 
go from there so these are all these are
three<00:02:37.980> different<00:02:38.250> ways<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.400> can<00:02:38.700> start<00:02:39.000> your

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
three different ways you can start your

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.600 
three different ways you can start your
background<00:02:39.840> sentence<00:02:40.320> now<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.130> detailed

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
background sentence now the detailed

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.700 
background sentence now the detailed
background<00:02:42.150> sentence<00:02:42.570> takes<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.110> broad

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
background sentence takes the broad

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.680 
background sentence takes the broad
information<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.880> we've<00:02:45.030> brought<00:02:45.300> up<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.600> the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
information that we've brought up in the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.530 
information that we've brought up in the
background<00:02:46.110> sentence<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.520> narrows<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.150> so

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
background sentence and it narrows it so

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.570 
background sentence and it narrows it so
we're<00:02:49.290> starting<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.680> pinpoint<00:02:49.950> what<00:02:50.430> our

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
we're starting to pinpoint what our

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.840 
we're starting to pinpoint what our
thesis<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.420> going<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.990> be<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:53.250> some<00:02:53.520> ways<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
thesis is going to be so some ways to

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.290 
thesis is going to be so some ways to
begin<00:02:54.000> your<00:02:54.330> detailed<00:02:54.840> background<00:02:55.560> sentences

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
begin your detailed background sentences

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:04.850 
begin your detailed background sentences
could<00:02:57.300> be<00:02:58.100> this<00:02:59.100> can<00:02:59.760> be<00:03:00.240> seen<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:04.380> this<00:03:04.560> can<00:03:04.830> be

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
could be this can be seen so this can be

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.830 
could be this can be seen so this can be
seen<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.850> firstly<00:03:06.180> if<00:03:06.300> we<00:03:06.420> started<00:03:06.720> with<00:03:06.750> a

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
seen so firstly if we started with a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.350 
seen so firstly if we started with a
sentence<00:03:07.370> today<00:03:08.370> such<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.030> such<00:03:09.180> is

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
sentence today such and such is

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.670 
sentence today such and such is
happening<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.050> it's<00:03:10.170> happening<00:03:10.200> all<00:03:10.650> over

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
happening and it's happening all over

this will be proven by analyzing and

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.530 
this will be proven by analyzing and
then<00:05:44.370> we'd<00:05:44.520> go<00:05:44.670> on<00:05:44.700> to<00:05:44.910> state<00:05:45.120> two<00:05:45.300> point

number<00:05:45.750> one<00:05:45.930> and<00:05:46.260> point<00:05:46.890> number<00:05:47.070> two<00:05:47.570> so<00:05:48.570> this

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
number one and point number two so this

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.990 
number one and point number two so this
will<00:05:48.840> be<00:05:48.960> proven<00:05:49.380> by<00:05:49.500> analyzing<00:05:50.250> this<00:05:50.640> and

will be proven by analyzing this and

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:00.170 
will be proven by analyzing this and
this<00:05:52.730> or<00:05:53.730> this<00:05:54.720> will<00:05:55.050> be<00:05:55.200> shown<00:05:58.430> by<00:05:59.430> taking
