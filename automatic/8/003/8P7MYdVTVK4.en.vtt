00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.350
 to 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.449
 very good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.670
 minecraft mode 1.8 in this case it 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:19.039
 called agar point and today I think it will be 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.320
 quite a very special game true 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.079
 musicians has come to minecraft from a 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.419
 very very special way is the truth that 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.680
 it's a pass but yes you have to 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.419
 install it in a somewhat 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.700
 strange is worth the installation I'm going to put 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.140
 at the end of the video however when I 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.120
 have installed going to do what 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.010
 you're going to see from now on it's worth like that 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.559
 that we are not going to go to a player we are going to 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.149
 create a new one so that it is flat 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.920
 equal the type of block that has the 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.719
 map and we'll see each other when we read 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.760
 that well guys we just generated 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.649
 the bad plane as you see is seen from this 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.269
 way is a little strange can not yet 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.429
 move we can not do anything but if 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.379
 we give him the f5 as you see yes we can 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.460
 start moving in this case 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.559
 Well, as you can see we have three views 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.659
 we have this view that is like very 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.010
 far away we have this that where not 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.350
 we can do nothing practically now 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.210
 same and then this one where it is 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.760
 the normal view of mainquÃ© only that 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.650
 we do not see the arm is worth then 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.360
 we have to do being creative 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.640
 let's come to the rest of the rest 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.500
 let's get the sunlight sensor 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.420
 let's put it anywhere and you 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.520
 let's click 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.979
 as you are watching a super is created 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.900
 quartz block panel let's see 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.509
 around here and as you are seeing we already have 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.759
 here a little thing and in this case not 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.130
 we would be here, nothing happens 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.250
 ok we have this this basically 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.990
 It will be the board game winery 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 point me of the radio as you want 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.840
 call it in this case then 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.750
 we will have to do only one little thing 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.930
 for this to work is to give the f5 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.509
 It's worth as you are seeing and it starts to 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.580
 see the slide that is what we 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.250
 we control in principle how are you 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.840
 watching and basically we are in 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.720
 a position in which we are not seen but 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.549
 yes we can move to the island in voucher 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.920
 what is the objective then in this case 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.649
 eat the whole sphere that we can all 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.780
 the balls of experience and so the is 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.130
 line then it will grow after we give it 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.990
 left click 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.580
 we can split in two and when 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.590
 let's be bigger matches in more pieces 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.709
 in the end we will come back together and we will do 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.120
 a much bigger slide and the pussy is 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.580
 that when we are playing in a 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.620
 abraham server a lot of people that 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.269
 may also be playing and that may 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.750
 also eat as long as they are 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.150
 their 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.040
 It's bigger than ours after 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.810
 we have a bar that ends like 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.730
 you see I just joined both the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.050
 lines that I had here right now we have 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.510
 a bar that we can get to put 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.040
 to see the amount of experience that 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.630
 We therefore carry the amount of points 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.130
 and the amount of let's say greatness or what 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.780
 great to see how big it is 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.000
 we are and the points we have then 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.170
 I can put a score one that is going to be the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.120
 next a moment when I'm going to 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.130
 write would be this voucher guys the bar 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.320
 the score board space objective 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.930
 spaces the display spaces sidebar 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.070
 total space more we will put as you see 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.680
 the total mass that we have 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.470
 currently up we have a 93 but 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.760
 as we go eating balls we will go 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.070
 growing up here we have is coveted 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.739
 because only this part was here 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.760
 of the sheep we will have to do something 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.010
 it's good to put a command for example 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.810
 so that too many are not generated 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.370
 to kill all the others and so on 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.200
 before you start playing because if you do not 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.239
 can put in the middle of the game and 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.100
 It can be a little bit, because neither 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.959
 nothing happens but there will still be people 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.970
 who does not like it and then guys 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.290
 because all this experience is 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.269
 obviously complements 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.150
 when we are playing with other people 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.349
 then right now in this mode then 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.540
 I'm playing alone because I'm 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.670
 presenting but I'm going to make you 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.500
 invitation worthy guys throughout the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.260
 today as much throughout the day of 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.060
 tomorrow I will notify on twitter so that 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.329

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.310
 What is my twitter? Well, I'm going to leave one 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.780
 invitation to a server that I'm going to open 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.609
 with this mod 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.409
 and I want everyone who wants 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.819
 then come in for the game in this 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.709
 case then all all are all 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.420
 invited as what country but not 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.950
 I know how many people will be able to enter what 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.480
 better to be able to enter 20 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.939
 people but good equally and they are 20 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.250
 after 20 they are and it is already worth then 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:11.439
 I'm going to organize the game I'm going to use 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.720
 by twitter will surely start at 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.120
 10 minutes have started it therefore 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.130
 I want you to be very attentive to twitter 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.690
 and there from these ways warning 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.180
 the money catches you look at the server is 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.880

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.950
 right part of here from the score and 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.980
 we can see who is the best playing at 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.540
 point and I here in byn craft so yes 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.610

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.940
 right guys, well, let's go with the 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.010
 installation warned us that it will be 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.150
 very, very easy, it's worth just 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.130
 let's open this we 're going to 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.690
 download it from the mediafire address 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.060
 that I will leave in the description of 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.770
 video we're just going to open we 're going to 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.720
 unzip this folder that we have 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.250
 here inside the folder version 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.590
 of minecraft as you are watching carpena 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.090

 to paste vale with you are seeing what we have 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.250
 here just and then let's go to 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.690
 let's say to minecraft awsat let's 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.520
 create a new profile test 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.430
 example, let's see how to analyze 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.680
 Profile will look for the 1.8 release 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.030

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.460
 just the same thing that I taught you to 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.860
 beginning of the video so as you can see 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.570
 been very easy simply because in 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.310
 four steps to play it 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.780
 and nothing else, so yes I have 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.580
