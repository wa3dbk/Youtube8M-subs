00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.820
 and then people show beauty and three ways 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.219
 of giving reason for the fish's 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.480
 first commonplace in the world is 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.359
 simply grab ration and drop in. 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.600
 of the aquarium that we have to understand 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.689
 that these fish have this reason to 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.300
 ask if she will accumulate in the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.900
 Aquarium background enter decaying 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.870
 of composition and this is a problem 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.200
 our fish there, mainly with the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.890
 ammonia issue and everything else then 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.030
 I put a little, they ate me 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.030
 I'll put some more 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:55.170
 this is one of the ways and uses a 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.059
 because you use it that way. 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.370
 I want him to get used to mine. 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.239
 I do not want them to be afraid of 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.140
 me 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.650
 by the time I food for them 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:12.150
 so I do the following way get a 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.630
 amount and I'm releasing slowly 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.630
 here o 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:30.409
 turning attention slowly waiting 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.409
 discovered loose a little more 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.369
 beauty is good, we have to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.780
 understand that we have three types 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.200
 of fish inside an aquarium 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.850
 mainly a Community framework 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.560
 They have these fish are more 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.030
 on the surface 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.590
 fish that swim at the median height of the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.049
 water in the middle of the aquarium, and those 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.690
 other fish that we call the background 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.659
 bottom fish of the corridor hull 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.990
 hours these fish hardly 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.979
 they come get this right up here 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.200
 beauty is what happens 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.989
 there are specific rations for these 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.300
 fish and need fish that 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.290
 there is nothing in the area in the water there shall we say 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.590
 average 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:33.989
 I do the following, I put it inside the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:38.190
 water even then the reason is already 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.950
 sinking always remembering people 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.019
 minimum amount of feed 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.120
 these fish they're going to have to start 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:50.010
 ration in less than three minutes 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.230
 she can not accumulate on the bottom is 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.959
 falling the bottom line only that by 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.190
 amount of fish I have here 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:01.200
 in a little while and have eaten everything 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.820
 quiet beauty then three forms of 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.940
 give ration simply drop here 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.590
 in a small amount line and 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.790
 dropping more 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.920
 or hold and release to the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.079
 few 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.640
 This takes a little more time alone. 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.500
 with the fish it gets more 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.190
 accustomed to your hand they do not have 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.390
 Afraid this is so cool, the delay is 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.329
 little more 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.420
 only the guy in good if you do not have and 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:34.530
 minute to feed your px is 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.560
 better than hopping and hop 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.800
 I do not know to buy 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.319
 It was a parrot, if you do not have one. 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.810
 little minute could finish me their 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.920
 fish in the good I think I have to 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.069
 look for one another another fun there 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.630
 hobby something you like more 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.140
 Beauty, people, I hope I have helped someone. 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.890
 A strong hug, the species does not forget 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.510
