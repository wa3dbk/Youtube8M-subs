game itself but in the Virtual Console
and<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.210> way<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> 3ds<00:00:31.050> displays<00:00:31.830> the

the old Game Boy Color games on its

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.069 
the old Game Boy Color games on its
screen<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.160> does<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> basically

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
screen what it does is it basically

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.780 
screen what it does is it basically
upscales<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.770> fills<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.399> whole

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
upscales it so that it fills the whole

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.569 
upscales it so that it fills the whole
top<00:00:39.180> screen<00:00:39.480> here<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.070> what<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.250> ends<00:00:41.520> up

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
top screen here and what that ends up

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.770 
top screen here and what that ends up
doing<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.149> probably<00:00:42.329> will<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.600> able<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
doing and you probably will be able to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.560 
doing and you probably will be able to
tell<00:00:42.989> -<00:00:43.200> well<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> camera<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.579> what

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
tell - well on the camera here but what

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
tell - well on the camera here but what
it<00:00:45.660> ends<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:45.930> doing<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.350> makes<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.010> image<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it ends up doing is it makes the image a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.840 
it ends up doing is it makes the image a
bit<00:00:47.550> blurry<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.379> not<00:00:49.379> very<00:00:49.620> sharp<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.579> it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
bit blurry and not very sharp so it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.160 
bit blurry and not very sharp so it
doesn't<00:00:51.120> look<00:00:51.210> quite<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:51.570> good<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.020> were

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
doesn't look quite as good as it were

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.319 
doesn't look quite as good as it were
difficult<00:00:52.559> playing<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:54.149> real

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
difficult playing on the the real

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.180 
difficult playing on the the real
hardware<00:00:54.920> or<00:00:55.920> even<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.809> SP<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.079> these<00:00:58.890> play

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
hardware or even the SP here these play

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.760 
hardware or even the SP here these play
them<00:00:59.399> obviously<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.510> Game<00:01:01.140> Boy<00:01:01.170> Color<00:01:01.469> plays

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
them obviously the Game Boy Color plays

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
them obviously the Game Boy Color plays
it<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.039> its<00:01:02.190> native<00:01:02.520> resolution<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:03.270> even<00:01:03.660> on

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it and its native resolution but even on

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.770 
it and its native resolution but even on
the<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.170> SP<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:05.220> plays<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.450> its

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the the SP it plays it and it's a its

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.890 
the the SP it plays it and it's a its
native<00:01:07.320> pixel<00:01:08.040> by<00:01:08.159> pixel<00:01:08.750> resolution<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
native pixel by pixel resolution so it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.030 
native pixel by pixel resolution so it
looks<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.290> sharp<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:10.860> look<00:01:11.010> very

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
looks really sharp and they look very

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.359 
looks really sharp and they look very
nice<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.110> 3ds<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.890> doesn't<00:01:14.220> look<00:01:14.340> like

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
nice but on the 3ds it doesn't look like

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.940 
nice but on the 3ds it doesn't look like
great<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.780> after<00:01:16.320> doing<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> bit<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.770> searching

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
great but after doing a bit of searching

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.100 
great but after doing a bit of searching
online<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.670> friend<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.060> actually<00:01:18.240> ahead<00:01:18.960> and

won't be able to see this through the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.300 
won't be able to see this through the
camera<00:02:08.879> but<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.500> pop<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.649> 3d<00:02:11.009> slider

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
camera but if I just pop the 3d slider

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.640 
camera but if I just pop the 3d slider
up<00:02:11.580> there<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.540> doesn't<00:02:12.780> make<00:02:12.870> anything<00:02:13.140> 3

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
up there it doesn't make anything 3

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.920 
up there it doesn't make anything 3
but<00:02:13.950> what<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.189> does<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.970> keeps<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.689> game

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
but what it does is it keeps the game

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.410 
but what it does is it keeps the game
image<00:02:16.140> flat<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.829> drops<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.340> down<00:02:17.519> probably

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
image flat but it drops it down probably

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.330 
image flat but it drops it down probably
about<00:02:18.689> two<00:02:18.959> or<00:02:18.989> three<00:02:19.079> millimeters<00:02:19.439> or<00:02:19.920> what

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
that's on the right-hand try and explain

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.360 
that's on the right-hand try and explain
what<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.019> mean<00:02:28.049> by<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:29.250> real

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
what I mean by that so in the real

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.119 
what I mean by that so in the real
console<00:02:29.939> you've<00:02:30.180> got<00:02:30.420> your<00:02:30.659> LCD<00:02:31.470> screen<00:02:31.950> and

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
console you've got your LCD screen and

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.210 
console you've got your LCD screen and
then<00:02:32.340> on<00:02:32.819> top<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.359> you've<00:02:33.629> got<00:02:33.840> your

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
then on top of that you've got your

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.149 
then on top of that you've got your
clear<00:02:35.220> plastic<00:02:35.780> protective<00:02:36.780> bit<00:02:36.989> here<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.950> so

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
clear plastic protective bit here and so

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.089 
clear plastic protective bit here and so
it<00:02:38.280> looks<00:02:38.519> like<00:02:38.609> it<00:02:38.939> is<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.959> thing<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.680> LCD

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
it looks like it is the thing the LCD

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.759 
it looks like it is the thing the LCD
screen<00:02:41.159> is<00:02:41.790> actually<00:02:41.939> setting<00:02:42.480> quite<00:02:43.439> a<00:02:43.470> bit
