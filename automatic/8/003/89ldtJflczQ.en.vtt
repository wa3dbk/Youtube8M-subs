think that care so the better it is

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.860 
think that care so the better it is
secured<00:06:13.020> better<00:06:14.010> it<00:06:14.220> is<00:06:14.310> for<00:06:14.370> me<00:06:17.810> so<00:06:18.810> they

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
secured better it is for me so they

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.219
