00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
around the edges but you can pop off

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.420 
around the edges but you can pop off
enough<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.619> take<00:01:28.770> off<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> right<00:01:29.130> thing<00:01:29.280> and

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
do is to make our CNC machine we're

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.990 
do is to make our CNC machine we're
gonna<00:03:33.560> have<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.799> cut<00:03:34.010> out<00:03:34.130> from<00:03:34.400> these<00:03:34.730> joints

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
gonna have to cut out from these joints

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.660 
gonna have to cut out from these joints
something<00:03:38.000> machining<00:03:38.690> wait<00:03:39.019> there's<00:03:39.260> no<00:03:39.670> okay

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670

something machining wait there's no okay
okay<00:03:40.989> it's<00:03:41.989> it's<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.350> machine<00:03:42.500> that<00:03:42.709> cuts<00:03:43.040> out

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
okay it's it's a machine that cuts out

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.410 
okay it's it's a machine that cuts out
stuff<00:03:43.580> okay

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
stuff okay

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.900

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
so in order to make our laser cutter

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.479 
so in order to make our laser cutter
we're<00:03:47.570> gonna<00:03:47.690> have<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.019> cut<00:03:48.230> from<00:03:49.070> here<00:03:49.340> to

a<00:04:16.570> whole<00:04:17.570> bunch<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.930> dirty<00:04:18.109> Jesus<00:04:20.500> we're<00:04:21.500> now

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
a whole bunch of dirty Jesus we're now

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.469 
a whole bunch of dirty Jesus we're now
looking<00:04:21.829> into<00:04:22.160> what<00:04:22.460> exactly<00:04:22.669> aluminum

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
looking into what exactly aluminum

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.110 
looking into what exactly aluminum
powder<00:04:23.630> is<00:04:23.930> used<00:04:23.960> for<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.710> we<00:04:25.699> found<00:04:25.940> some

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
powder is used for and we found some

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.689 
powder is used for and we found some
interesting<00:04:26.270> information<00:04:27.550> aluminum<00:04:28.550> powder

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
interesting information aluminum powder

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.730 
interesting information aluminum powder
may<00:04:29.030> be<00:04:29.090> ignited<00:04:29.419> by<00:04:29.630> Stagg<00:04:29.930> discharge<00:04:30.500> and

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
may be ignited by Stagg discharge and

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.740 
may be ignited by Stagg discharge and
burn<00:04:30.979> extremely<00:04:31.490> high<00:04:31.610> temperatures<00:04:32.120> once

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
burn extremely high temperatures once

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.510 
burn extremely high temperatures once
suspended<00:04:33.259> and<00:04:33.440> dust<00:04:33.620> lay<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:33.889> air<00:04:34.039> cloud<00:04:34.310> is

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
suspended and dust lay and air cloud is

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.450 
suspended and dust lay and air cloud is
readily<00:04:35.150> ignited<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:35.840> very<00:04:36.320> explosive<00:04:36.770> so

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
readily ignited and very explosive so

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.909 
readily ignited and very explosive so
you<00:04:37.550> want<00:04:37.699> like<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.880> laser<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:38.919> absolutely

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
you want like a laser to it absolutely

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:47.590 
you want like a laser to it absolutely
let's<00:04:40.340> do<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:45.100> have<00:04:46.100> no<00:04:46.130> idea<00:04:46.460> yeah<00:04:47.210> it<00:04:47.270> is

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
let's do it I have no idea yeah it is

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:59.950 
let's do it I have no idea yeah it is
Oh<00:04:47.680> oh<00:04:48.880> really<00:04:50.000> yeah<00:04:56.800> that<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:58.460> SD<00:04:59.150> does<00:04:59.660> cloud

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
Oh oh really yeah that the SD does cloud

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.290 
Oh oh really yeah that the SD does cloud
a<00:04:59.990> dust<00:05:00.440> cloud<00:05:00.710> i'ma<00:05:01.250> blow<00:05:01.639> through<00:05:01.910> blow<00:05:02.120> the

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
a dust cloud i'ma blow through blow the

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.370 
a dust cloud i'ma blow through blow the
cloud<00:05:02.600> it's<00:05:02.900> a<00:05:02.960> good<00:05:03.110> thing<00:05:03.260> I'm<00:05:03.350> wearing
