sound kind of weird so what I have added

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.679 
sound kind of weird so what I have added
to<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:33.329> building<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.350> um<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> pretty

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
to this building is um I have a pretty

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:45.560 
to this building is um I have a pretty
sophisticated<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:40.700> cart<00:01:41.700> dispenser<00:01:42.509> system<00:01:44.570> so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
sophisticated a cart dispenser system so

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.210 
sophisticated a cart dispenser system so
let<00:01:46.110> me<00:01:46.140> show<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.409> how<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.740> works<00:01:46.890> so

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
let me show you how it works so

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.539 
let me show you how it works so
basically<00:01:47.970> each<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.840> these<00:01:48.960> tracks<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.829> going

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
basically each of these tracks is going

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.030 
basically each of these tracks is going
in<00:01:50.670> different<00:01:51.000> directions<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> different

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
in different directions to the different

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.649 
in different directions to the different
places<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:54.119> over<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.689> server<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
places all over the server and to get a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.499 
places all over the server and to get a
cart<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.200> simply<00:01:58.799> press<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.399> button<00:01:59.729> then

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
cart you simply press this button then

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.940 
cart you simply press this button then
the<00:02:00.630> cart<00:02:00.869> will<00:02:01.020> drop<00:02:01.290> out<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> ceiling

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the cart will drop out of the ceiling

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.069 
the cart will drop out of the ceiling
and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.700> get<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.180> press<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> other

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
and then you can get in press the other

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.270 
and then you can get in press the other
button<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.710> you're<00:02:05.189> off<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:07.280> apparently

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
button and you're off and apparently

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.580 
button and you're off and apparently
take<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> bit<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.819> damage<00:02:09.030> which<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.810> working

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
take a bit of damage which I'm working

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.309 
take a bit of damage which I'm working
on<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.190> think<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.150> know<00:02:12.209> why<00:02:12.569> it's<00:02:13.170> doing

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
on that I think I know why it's doing

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.960 
on that I think I know why it's doing
that

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.930 
that
um<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:14.990> can<00:02:15.170> pretty<00:02:15.440> much<00:02:15.680> get<00:02:16.340> rid<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.610> that

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
um and I can pretty much get rid of that

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.150 
um and I can pretty much get rid of that
up<00:02:18.820> pretty<00:02:19.820> easily<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:21.080> then<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.800> know<00:02:21.890> when

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
up pretty easily so then you know when

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.310 
up pretty easily so then you know when
you<00:02:22.280> arrive<00:02:22.580> at<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.000> station<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.930> get<00:02:24.110> out<00:02:24.290> of

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
you arrive at the station you get out of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.640 
you arrive at the station you get out of
the<00:02:24.500> cart<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.280> walk<00:02:25.460> up<00:02:25.670> here<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:27.320> cart

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the cart you walk up here and the cart

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.820 
the cart you walk up here and the cart
disappears<00:02:28.370> back<00:02:28.850> into<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.900> cart<00:02:30.200> dispenser

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
disappears back into the cart dispenser

actually operates so I got a secret up

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.630 
actually operates so I got a secret up
secret<00:03:28.910> little<00:03:29.090> hatch<00:03:29.330> here<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:31.160> top

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
now at the same time another cart gets

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.970 
now at the same time another cart gets
called<00:04:03.500> from<00:04:05.019> storage<00:04:06.019> down<00:04:06.260> below<00:04:06.290> so<00:04:06.920> you

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
called from storage down below so you

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.120 
called from storage down below so you
see<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.370> just<00:04:07.580> comes<00:04:08.090> up<00:04:08.299> and<00:04:08.590> ups<00:04:09.590> right<00:04:09.920> in

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
there and it pretty much works the same

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.349 
there and it pretty much works the same
way<00:04:13.580> for<00:04:14.120> each<00:04:14.480> card<00:04:15.049> except<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:17.090> case<00:04:17.330> of

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
way for each card except in the case of

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
all the places are occupied if for some

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.670 
all the places are occupied if for some
reason<00:05:01.070> another<00:05:01.790> cart<00:05:02.180> was<00:05:02.420> to<00:05:03.020> be<00:05:03.170> sent<00:05:03.470> up

basically<00:05:17.030> have<00:05:17.510> a<00:05:17.960> little<00:05:18.560> system<00:05:18.980> here

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
basically have a little system here

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.180 
basically have a little system here
we're<00:05:19.870> up<00:05:20.870> here<00:05:21.290> is<00:05:21.500> where<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:22.010> carts<00:05:24.190> come

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.380 
we're up here is where the carts come
down<00:05:25.430> from<00:05:25.880> each<00:05:26.560> return<00:05:27.560> position<00:05:28.460> so<00:05:29.360> you

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
down from each return position so you

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.440 
down from each return position so you
see<00:05:29.630> it's<00:05:29.780> just<00:05:30.050> a<00:05:30.310> piston<00:05:31.310> here<00:05:31.640> that<00:05:31.850> pulls

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
see it's just a piston here that pulls

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.350 
see it's just a piston here that pulls
it<00:05:32.630> out<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:33.190> lowers<00:05:34.190> it<00:05:34.340> down<00:05:34.520> and<00:05:34.760> that<00:05:34.850> sends

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
it out and lowers it down and that sends

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.690 
it out and lowers it down and that sends
down<00:05:35.480> here<00:05:35.810> same<00:05:36.290> for<00:05:36.560> each<00:05:36.620> one<00:05:36.980> just<00:05:37.220> links

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
down here same for each one just links

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.220 
down here same for each one just links
up<00:05:37.880> together<00:05:38.060> and<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:41.000> connects<00:05:41.630> here<00:05:42.020> this

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:42.230 
up together and the connects here this

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.400 
up together and the connects here this
is<00:05:42.440> for<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:43.150> return<00:05:44.150> trek<00:05:44.480> from<00:05:44.690> up<00:05:44.870> there<00:05:45.170> and

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
is for the return trek from up there and

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.070 
is for the return trek from up there and
it<00:05:45.650> just<00:05:46.010> goes<00:05:46.520> up<00:05:46.820> this<00:05:47.090> hill<00:05:47.510> and<00:05:49.720> drops<00:05:50.720> down

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
it just goes up this hill and drops down

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.540 
it just goes up this hill and drops down
into<00:05:51.140> a<00:05:51.710> little<00:05:52.580> shaft<00:05:53.090> right<00:05:53.420> here<00:05:54.310> so<00:05:55.310> as<00:05:55.430> you

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
into a little shaft right here so as you

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.610 
into a little shaft right here so as you
can<00:05:55.700> see<00:05:55.970> there's<00:05:56.300> carts<00:05:56.930> in<00:05:57.140> there<00:05:57.380> and

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
can see there's carts in there and

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.450 
can see there's carts in there and
there's<00:05:58.220> actually<00:05:58.640> quite<00:05:58.670> a<00:05:58.910> few<00:05:59.180> carts<00:05:59.630> and

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
there's actually quite a few carts and

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.540 
there's actually quite a few carts and
and<00:06:01.460> then<00:06:02.330> when<00:06:02.510> you<00:06:02.630> do<00:06:02.870> call<00:06:03.740> a<00:06:03.800> car<00:06:04.190> it'll

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
and then when you do call a car it'll

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.140 
and then when you do call a car it'll
send<00:06:04.850> a<00:06:05.200> redstone<00:06:06.200> pulse<00:06:06.620> down<00:06:06.860> here<00:06:07.520> which

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
send a redstone pulse down here which

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.850 
send a redstone pulse down here which
will<00:06:08.420> go<00:06:08.660> through<00:06:08.960> this<00:06:10.210> pulse<00:06:11.210> limiter<00:06:11.860> which

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
will go through this pulse limiter which

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.400 
will go through this pulse limiter which
will<00:06:13.760> then<00:06:15.250> release<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.280> cart<00:06:16.670> from<00:06:16.880> up<00:06:17.060> here

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
will then release a cart from up here

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.640 
will then release a cart from up here
just<00:06:18.410> drops<00:06:19.160> down<00:06:19.400> through<00:06:19.850> this<00:06:20.230> gate<00:06:21.230> here

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
just drops down through this gate here

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.670 
just drops down through this gate here
and<00:06:21.800> and<00:06:22.390> goes<00:06:23.390> down<00:06:23.600> there<00:06:23.840> so<00:06:24.290> yeah<00:06:24.440> that's

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
and and goes down there so yeah that's

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.070 
and and goes down there so yeah that's
pretty<00:06:25.040> much<00:06:25.160> how<00:06:25.460> it<00:06:25.490> works<00:06:25.820> just<00:06:26.020> show<00:06:27.020> you

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
pretty much how it works just show you

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:34.980 
pretty much how it works just show you
again<00:06:27.500> how<00:06:28.540> boom<00:06:31.330> so<00:06:32.330> the<00:06:32.540> cart<00:06:32.810> goes<00:06:33.050> up<00:06:33.350> there

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
again how boom so the cart goes up there

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.750 
again how boom so the cart goes up there
bounces<00:06:35.990> off<00:06:36.200> of<00:06:36.230> a<00:06:36.740> couple<00:06:38.050> places<00:06:39.050> and<00:06:39.650> then

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
bounces off of a couple places and then

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.910 
bounces off of a couple places and then
heads<00:06:40.880> back<00:06:41.210> down<00:06:41.240> and<00:06:41.870> apparently<00:06:42.440> son<00:06:42.680> was

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920 
heads back down and apparently son was

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.410 
heads back down and apparently son was
slain<00:06:43.190> by<00:06:43.370> a<00:06:43.400> zombie<00:06:43.670> and<00:06:44.500> if<00:06:45.500> it<00:06:46.250> gets<00:06:47.120> too

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
slain by a zombie and if it gets too

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.320 
slain by a zombie and if it gets too
full<00:06:47.780> it'll<00:06:48.440> just<00:06:48.680> bounce<00:06:48.830> back<00:06:49.160> down<00:06:49.460> and<00:06:49.760> to

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
full it'll just bounce back down and to

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.870 
full it'll just bounce back down and to
this<00:06:50.690> hole<00:06:51.080> here<00:06:51.110> so<00:06:51.890> yeah<00:06:52.310> that's<00:06:52.730> pretty

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 
this hole here so yeah that's pretty

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.980 
this hole here so yeah that's pretty
much<00:06:53.090> how<00:06:53.360> it<00:06:53.390> works<00:06:53.780> um<00:06:54.170> let<00:06:54.920> me<00:06:55.690> get<00:06:56.690> out<00:06:56.900> of

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
much how it works um let me get out of

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.600 
much how it works um let me get out of
here<00:06:57.230> so<00:06:57.770> um<00:06:58.040> so<00:06:58.870> yeah<00:06:59.870> that's<00:07:00.400> that's<00:07:01.400> how

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
here so um so yeah that's that's how

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.300 
here so um so yeah that's that's how
that<00:07:01.820> works<00:07:02.060> and<00:07:02.300> eventually<00:07:03.230> this<00:07:03.680> will

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
that works and eventually this will

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.420 
that works and eventually this will
connect<00:07:04.850> to<00:07:05.150> all<00:07:05.630> kinds<00:07:06.050> of<00:07:06.320> places<00:07:06.560> all<00:07:07.100> love
