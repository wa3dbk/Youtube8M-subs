00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.010
 so if you can make a 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.599
 little oil video 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.599
 the thing here 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.919
 hello everybody, you know I'll read 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.220
 chip is unfortunately now already 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.200
 night night or the dark and is 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:26.440
 Bad for us to make the video but how is it? 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:30.130
 an 11 is about a robot né 2011 2012 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.370
 if he is 1.4 precisely because he has 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.749
 a task would be rather great, right? 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.519
 engine for it looks like it was missing 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:38.649
 a little strength there we are 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.089
 See if you can leave the engine 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.070
 bit more full a little more 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.949
 shabby a sec 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.260
 I 'm here with the mark who we are 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.989
 Doing this alone, I made a point. 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.100
 to film because it is about this 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.069
 type of vehicle 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.929
 our site is karachi dot com 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:59.469
 the email address is that the typical 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:02.610
 typical clothes gmail.com hit bigger 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:05.400
 he gave a stretched out this macchina 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.020
 the engineer caetano álvares north zone 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.720
 from Sao Paulo 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.880
 O are good that the marcinho every day 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.230
 practically passes those same ones that 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.440
 are at school 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.380
 sure what money means and if 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.729
 realized the difference jamanxim much 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.970
 people well but only engines much faster 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.640
 faster recovery but you're right 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.610
 Do you want to test mine now? 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.860
 and then how legal the order 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.720
 There's air conditioning there for you to see. 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.690
 he behaves with water to make a test 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.140
 now it's still a climb and from there we 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.500
 Let's see how it goes with air is breathless and 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.600
 then not spin with from what I saw 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.160
 here the engine has already given the impression that 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.280
 1.6 sensation of 1.67 that in fact he 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.950
 will have a point five and a half but with 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.740
 sure the feel is sometimes 1.6 maybe 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.070
 even a little bit more there 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.560
 the fact 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.129
 good staff is up against the upturn 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.800
 fast 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:16.959
 the engine filled the car you can 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:22.660
 see here with what is now coming 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:25.660
 8 thousand kilometers the car for me one 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.459
 car zero governance kiss 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.020
 Unfortunately we have a traffic 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.830
 here in são paulo and sometimes 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.830
 the image of death 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.740
 I thought the next one here to tremembe 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.330
 and either 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.630
 and still had a bit of delivery 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.630
 br 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:07.580
 this is it here come another test 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.170
 only in the river is to be confirmed remembering that 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.980
 We send it to anywhere in the world. 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.400
 Brazil 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.410
 the installation and it is very simple and 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.530
 How many minutes in a row in this car? 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.590
 but it is useless the maximum 10 minutes only 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.000
 The little manuelzinho photographic that 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.370
 Do you think you'll be able to install more 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.230
 One day I saw you doing everything. 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.230
 calm down there 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.900
 ae 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.540
 here is a face known as pass 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.470
 you already know the behavior of the car 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.960
 the chip and it does not change the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.870
 there is already a way it just today he 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.150
 takes advantage of only one resource that exists 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.010
 already inside the module will only send the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.090
 correct information for it looks only 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.140
 climb 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.420
 he looks at you 70 degrees 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.890
 slope both steep and looks like it 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.890
 was according to the firm and strong 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:11.120
 our almost asking for third car 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.120
 my God 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.590
 it's already full button can jump support 

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:23.810
 the third fastest line here still 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:28.550
 ended up not being Christ has ensured 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:32.770
 Are you taking up your life again? 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.770
 The idea is to arrive one hour and ask for the 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.770
 series 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.330
 good staff is another video there that the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.120
 People are putting there to power. 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.260
 satisfy our customers who do not 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.600
 have the opportunity to take this test 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:57.130
 drive is far in then it's easier 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.250
 you read the good grolsch where to put here 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.770
 there's a lot of difference 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.260
 the chip is right and it will increase a bit 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.570
 the touch that is that force that the car 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.520
 exerts on the rise to power this 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:15.310
 resumed the car got there is here 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:18.500
 practically in the second, finally, third is 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.800
 this money is going 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.640
 there gives to realize the best performance 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.390
 of the vehicle 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.260
