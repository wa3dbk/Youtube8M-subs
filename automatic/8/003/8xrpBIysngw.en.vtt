about forces that pull away when you

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.360 
about forces that pull away when you
turn<00:00:07.910> them<00:00:08.000> loose<00:00:08.770> this<00:00:09.770> one<00:00:09.980> here<00:00:10.190> has<00:00:10.340> a

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
turn them loose this one here has a

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.680 
turn them loose this one here has a
little<00:00:10.549> bit<00:00:10.639> of<00:00:10.730> an<00:00:10.790> issue<00:00:10.910> with<00:00:11.059> that<00:00:11.180> we

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
little bit of an issue with that we

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.910 
little bit of an issue with that we
haven't<00:00:11.840> had<00:00:11.929> him<00:00:12.019> very<00:00:12.230> long<00:00:12.410> so<00:00:12.650> I'm<00:00:12.710> kind<00:00:12.889> of

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
haven't had him very long so I'm kind of

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.310 
haven't had him very long so I'm kind of
going<00:00:13.280> to<00:00:13.400> show<00:00:13.610> you<00:00:13.670> some<00:00:14.000> ways<00:00:14.150> you<00:00:14.420> can<00:00:14.599> go

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
going to show you some ways you can go

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.650 
going to show you some ways you can go
about<00:00:15.349> making<00:00:15.620> it<00:00:15.830> better<00:00:16.029> the<00:00:17.029> absolute<00:00:17.420> best

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
about making it better the absolute best

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.120 
about making it better the absolute best
way<00:00:17.869> to<00:00:17.930> fix<00:00:18.200> it<00:00:18.320> is<00:00:18.439> to<00:00:18.470> teach<00:00:18.770> them<00:00:18.950> to<00:00:18.980> hook

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
way to fix it is to teach them to hook

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.560 
way to fix it is to teach them to hook
on<00:00:19.340> you<00:00:19.460> on<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:19.609> round<00:00:19.789> pen<00:00:19.970> really<00:00:20.240> well<00:00:20.390> and

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
on you on the round pen really well and

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.120 
on you on the round pen really well and
then<00:00:20.750> you<00:00:20.779> know<00:00:21.440> when<00:00:21.619> you<00:00:21.680> turn<00:00:21.830> them<00:00:21.980> loose

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
then you know when you turn them loose

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.740 
then you know when you turn them loose
if<00:00:22.340> they<00:00:22.490> want<00:00:22.670> to<00:00:22.760> run<00:00:22.939> away<00:00:23.090> you<00:00:23.270> would<00:00:23.539> just

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
if they want to run away you would just

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.630 
if they want to run away you would just
put<00:00:24.590> pressure<00:00:24.830> on<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.070> have<00:00:25.160> them<00:00:25.250> come<00:00:25.430> back

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
put pressure on and have them come back

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.640 
put pressure on and have them come back
to<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:25.910> I've<00:00:26.510> started<00:00:26.720> working<00:00:27.170> with<00:00:27.500> this

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
to you I've started working with this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.800 
to you I've started working with this
one<00:00:27.890> on<00:00:28.100> that<00:00:28.340> but<00:00:28.699> I<00:00:28.880> don't<00:00:29.119> think<00:00:29.240> you<00:00:29.390> solid

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
one on that but I don't think you solid

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.439 
one on that but I don't think you solid
enough<00:00:30.019> on<00:00:30.230> that<00:00:30.410> too<00:00:31.340> to<00:00:31.789> try<00:00:32.000> and<00:00:32.119> do<00:00:32.210> it<00:00:32.330> out

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
enough on that too to try and do it out

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.110 
enough on that too to try and do it out
here<00:00:32.689> so<00:00:32.870> what<00:00:33.769> I<00:00:33.800> do<00:00:33.980> with<00:00:34.400> them<00:00:34.580> you<00:00:34.910> know<00:00:35.030> if

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
here so what I do with them you know if

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.639 
here so what I do with them you know if
you<00:00:35.239> think<00:00:35.360> about<00:00:35.540> it's<00:00:35.809> just<00:00:35.870> a<00:00:36.140> habit<00:00:36.380> and

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
you think about it's just a habit and

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.049 
you think about it's just a habit and
what<00:00:36.829> tends<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:37.219> happen<00:00:37.370> with<00:00:37.579> these<00:00:37.730> horses

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
what tends to happen with these horses

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.209 
what tends to happen with these horses
is<00:00:38.210> people<00:00:38.510> take<00:00:38.690> them<00:00:38.840> out<00:00:38.989> to<00:00:39.140> turn<00:00:39.350> out<00:00:39.530> turn

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
is people take them out to turn out turn

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.440 
is people take them out to turn out turn
loose<00:00:40.460> pull<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.730> holder<00:00:40.880> off<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:41.180> walk<00:00:41.270> off

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
loose pull the holder off and walk off

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.180 
loose pull the holder off and walk off
and<00:00:41.570> that<00:00:41.690> horse<00:00:41.870> runs<00:00:42.379> off<00:00:42.559> and<00:00:42.770> pretty<00:00:42.890> soon

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
and that horse runs off and pretty soon

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.770 
and that horse runs off and pretty soon
that<00:00:43.309> horse<00:00:43.489> gets<00:00:43.730> to<00:00:43.850> anticipate<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.570> fact

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
that horse gets to anticipate the fact

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.119 
that horse gets to anticipate the fact
that<00:00:44.870> as<00:00:45.050> soon<00:00:45.200> as<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.410> halter<00:00:45.770> comes<00:00:45.950> off

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
that as soon as that halter comes off

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.740 
that as soon as that halter comes off
you're<00:00:46.850> going<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:47.059> run<00:00:47.180> off<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:47.510> they're

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
you're going to run off and they're

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.029 
you're going to run off and they're
going<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:47.960> head<00:00:48.050> off<00:00:48.170> down<00:00:48.379> there<00:00:48.590> again<00:00:48.710> and

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
going to head off down there again and

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.799 
going to head off down there again and
so<00:00:49.820> all<00:00:50.539> I've<00:00:50.750> done<00:00:50.960> here<00:00:51.379> is<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:51.710> put<00:00:52.360> my<00:00:53.360> foot<00:00:53.570> -

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.240 
all I'm going to do here is act like an
antenna<00:00:59.960> loop<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:00.260> I'm<00:01:00.320> just<00:01:00.440> going<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:00.680> walk

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
antenna loop so I'm just going to walk

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.549 
antenna loop so I'm just going to walk
up<00:01:01.460> here<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:02.050> pull<00:01:03.050> that<00:01:03.140> one<00:01:03.230> off<00:01:03.289> really

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
up here and pull that one off really

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.650 
up here and pull that one off really
quickly<00:01:03.770> yeah<00:01:04.489> see<00:01:04.820> I've<00:01:04.970> done<00:01:05.119> a<00:01:05.180> little<00:01:05.570> bit

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
quickly yeah see I've done a little bit

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.539 
quickly yeah see I've done a little bit
of<00:01:05.750> this<00:01:05.840> with<00:01:06.050> him<00:01:06.170> already<00:01:06.410> when<00:01:07.039> the<00:01:07.280> first

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
of this with him already when the first

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:08.980 
of this with him already when the first
couple<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:07.850> days<00:01:07.909> I<00:01:08.180> tried<00:01:08.450> this<00:01:08.659> when<00:01:08.960> I

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
couple of days I tried this when I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.899 
couple of days I tried this when I
pulled<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:09.409> thing<00:01:09.710> off<00:01:09.890> like<00:01:10.130> that<00:01:10.310> he

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
pulled that thing off like that he

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.170 
pulled that thing off like that he
really<00:01:11.380> pulled<00:01:12.380> back<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:13.670> other<00:01:13.820> thing

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
really pulled back the other thing

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.710 
really pulled back the other thing
that's<00:01:15.049> different<00:01:15.380> today<00:01:15.799> -<00:01:16.330> is<00:01:17.330> quite

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
that's different today - is quite

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.240 
that's different today - is quite
possibly<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.229> fact<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:18.560> I'm<00:01:18.740> standing<00:01:18.950> out

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
possibly the fact that I'm standing out

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.320 
possibly the fact that I'm standing out
here<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.549> middle<00:01:19.700> over<00:01:19.850> one<00:01:20.060> side

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
here in the middle over one side

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.149 
here in the middle over one side
normally<00:01:21.110> I<00:01:21.170> come<00:01:21.350> in<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.590> gate<00:01:21.830> over<00:01:22.130> there

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
normally I come in the gate over there

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.789 
normally I come in the gate over there
so<00:01:22.520> I<00:01:22.549> might<00:01:22.790> just<00:01:22.970> take<00:01:23.150> him<00:01:23.360> over<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.869> the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
so I might just take him over to the

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.149 
so I might just take him over to the
gate<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:26.320> might<00:01:27.320> take<00:01:27.470> him<00:01:27.619> out<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.890> gate<00:01:28.040> and

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
gate I might take him out the gate and

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.620 
gate I might take him out the gate and
bring<00:01:28.280> him<00:01:28.400> back<00:01:28.520> in<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:28.970> he<00:01:29.119> thinks<00:01:29.420> it's<00:01:29.570> a

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
bring him back in so he thinks it's a

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.859 
bring him back in so he thinks it's a
bit<00:01:29.780> more<00:01:30.220> like<00:01:31.220> normal<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.000> we'll<00:01:32.420> see<00:01:32.659> if<00:01:32.750> he

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
bit more like normal and we'll see if he

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.010 
bit more like normal and we'll see if he
can<00:01:33.430> pull<00:01:34.430> away<00:01:34.549> a<00:01:34.640> bit<00:01:34.759> more<00:01:34.939> but<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.150> get<00:01:35.840> the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
this is what I tried to do in the first

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.990 
this is what I tried to do in the first
place<00:03:42.590> but<00:03:42.799> he<00:03:42.980> had<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.400> was<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:43.640> bad<00:03:43.970> I

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
place but he had it was so bad I

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.130 
place but he had it was so bad I
couldn't<00:03:44.269> do<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:44.569> normally<00:03:44.930> what<00:03:45.049> I'd

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
couldn't do it but normally what I'd

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.000 
couldn't do it but normally what I'd
like<00:03:45.319> to<00:03:45.470> do<00:03:45.590> with<00:03:45.709> him

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
like to do with him

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.830 
like to do with him
just<00:03:46.549> come<00:03:46.760> out<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:49.239> drop<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.359> down<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.569> hole

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
just come out and drop it down a hole

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.630 
just come out and drop it down a hole
and<00:03:51.079> let<00:03:51.590> go<00:03:51.769> if<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.129> can<00:03:52.250> do<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.459> with<00:03:52.609> just

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
and let go if you can do that with just

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.789 
and let go if you can do that with just
one<00:03:52.879> holder<00:03:53.420> on<00:03:53.540> there<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.900> they<00:03:54.440> can<00:03:54.620> you

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
one holder on there and they can you

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.500 
one holder on there and they can you
know<00:03:54.829> they<00:03:54.920> they<00:03:55.700> think<00:03:55.940> you've<00:03:56.030> let<00:03:56.209> go<00:03:56.239> and

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
know they they think you've let go and

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.780 
know they they think you've let go and
they<00:03:56.569> run<00:03:56.720> over<00:03:56.959> there<00:03:57.159> but<00:03:58.159> then<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.459> next

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
they run over there but then the next

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.990 
they run over there but then the next
step<00:03:59.030> is<00:03:59.329> I<00:04:00.319> said<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:00.650> was<00:04:00.829> a<00:04:00.859> lot<00:04:01.040> better<00:04:01.069> the

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
step is I said that was a lot better the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.970 
step is I said that was a lot better the
next<00:04:02.359> step<00:04:02.599> is<00:04:03.310> start<00:04:04.310> to<00:04:04.549> take<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.970> off<00:04:05.920> put<00:04:06.920> it

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
next step is start to take it off put it

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.479 
next step is start to take it off put it
back<00:04:07.099> on<00:04:07.840> start<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:09.049> take<00:04:09.319> it<00:04:09.500> off<00:04:09.680> put<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.400> back

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
back on start to take it off put it back

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.089 
back on start to take it off put it back
on<00:04:10.790> till<00:04:11.030> you<00:04:11.150> can<00:04:11.299> get<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.810> where<00:04:11.989> you<00:04:12.709> take<00:04:12.950> it

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
on till you can get to where you take it

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.559 
on till you can get to where you take it
completely<00:04:13.670> off<00:04:13.819> and<00:04:14.150> they're<00:04:14.239> not<00:04:14.389> looking

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
completely off and they're not looking

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.020 
completely off and they're not looking
to<00:04:14.750> leave<00:04:15.100> okay<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:16.489> would<00:04:16.579> be<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.789> next

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
to leave okay that would be the next

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.580 
to leave okay that would be the next
step<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.660> then<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:17.900> get<00:04:18.079> to<00:04:18.260> where<00:04:18.380> you<00:04:18.440> can

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
step and then you get to where you can

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.080 
step and then you get to where you can
take<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.889> off<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.190> they<00:04:19.310> stay<00:04:19.579> here<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:19.910> you

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
take it off and they stay here and you

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.909 
take it off and they stay here and you
can<00:04:20.239> put<00:04:20.359> it<00:04:20.479> back<00:04:20.660> on<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.109> then<00:04:21.169> eventually

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
can put it back on and then eventually

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.939 
can put it back on and then eventually
get<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.430> where<00:04:22.460> you<00:04:22.610> take<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.940> off<00:04:26.740> he<00:04:27.740> doesn't

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
get to where you take it off he doesn't

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.159 
get to where you take it off he doesn't
realize<00:04:28.099> he's<00:04:28.310> Lucia<00:04:28.599> now<00:04:29.599> if<00:04:29.720> I<00:04:29.810> just<00:04:29.990> walk

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
realize he's Lucia now if I just walk

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.930 
realize he's Lucia now if I just walk
off<00:04:30.380> over<00:04:30.650> here<00:04:30.800> just<00:04:30.949> do<00:04:31.099> what<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:31.280> do<00:04:31.430> see

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
off over here just do what you do see

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.610 
off over here just do what you do see
that's<00:04:32.120> this<00:04:32.419> actually<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.900> first<00:04:33.110> day<00:04:33.320> he

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
that's this actually the first day he

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.020 
that's this actually the first day he
hasn't<00:04:33.889> actually<00:04:34.010> just<00:04:34.310> tried<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.550> wheel<00:04:34.849> and

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
hasn't actually just tried to wheel and

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.089 
hasn't actually just tried to wheel and
run<00:04:35.150> off<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:35.539> I've<00:04:36.020> been<00:04:36.410> working<00:04:36.800> on<00:04:36.889> this

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
run off so I've been working on this

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.100 
run off so I've been working on this
just<00:04:37.760> doing<00:04:38.000> that<00:04:38.090> stuff<00:04:38.360> right<00:04:38.599> there<00:04:38.840> this

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
just doing that stuff right there this

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.390 
just doing that stuff right there this
is<00:04:39.169> not<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.530> first<00:04:39.710> day<00:04:39.949> I've<00:04:40.039> done<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.340> but

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
is not the first day I've done it but

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.430 
is not the first day I've done it but
you<00:04:40.520> can<00:04:40.639> see<00:04:40.880> it's<00:04:41.449> so<00:04:41.660> much<00:04:41.690> better<00:04:42.080> man<00:04:42.289> he

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
you can see it's so much better man he

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.740 
you can see it's so much better man he
was<00:04:42.590> pretty<00:04:42.830> bad<00:04:43.070> he<00:04:43.310> would<00:04:43.490> just<00:04:43.729> pull<00:04:44.720> that

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
was pretty bad he would just pull that

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.260 
was pretty bad he would just pull that
halter<00:04:45.229> cleaning<00:04:45.530> out<00:04:45.590> of<00:04:45.650> your<00:04:45.800> hands<00:04:46.270> so

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
halter cleaning out of your hands so

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.189 
halter cleaning out of your hands so
that's<00:04:47.389> getting<00:04:47.599> a<00:04:47.720> lot<00:04:47.840> better<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:48.820> you<00:04:49.820> know

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
that's getting a lot better so you know

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.529 
that's getting a lot better so you know
what<00:04:51.199> I'll<00:04:51.320> probably<00:04:51.530> do<00:04:51.979> is<00:04:52.280> keep<00:04:52.880> working<00:04:53.330> on

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
what I'll probably do is keep working on

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:54.879 
what I'll probably do is keep working on
getting<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:54.020> hook<00:04:54.169> on<00:04:54.320> in<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.500> round<00:04:54.680> pan

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
getting the hook on in the round pan

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.219 
getting the hook on in the round pan
once<00:04:55.639> that's<00:04:55.880> really<00:04:56.180> good<00:04:56.360> then<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:57.020> won't

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
once that's really good then I won't

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.420 
once that's really good then I won't
bother<00:04:57.349> with<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.620> two<00:04:57.770> halters<00:04:58.160> I'll<00:04:58.280> just

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
bother with the two halters I'll just

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.659 
bother with the two halters I'll just
take<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.210> halter<00:04:59.389> off<00:04:59.660> and<00:04:59.840> if<00:04:59.900> he<00:05:00.020> leaves

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
take the halter off and if he leaves

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.770 
take the halter off and if he leaves
August<00:05:01.669> chasing<00:05:01.970> round<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.210> comes<00:05:02.389> back<00:05:02.570> which

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
August chasing round it comes back which

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.240 
August chasing round it comes back which
I<00:05:02.900> do<00:05:02.960> in<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.229> round<00:05:03.409> pen<00:05:03.620> he<00:05:03.770> can<00:05:03.919> do<00:05:04.039> that<00:05:04.190> in

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
I do in the round pen he can do that in

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.040 
I do in the round pen he can do that in
the<00:05:04.340> round<00:05:04.490> pen<00:05:04.699> but<00:05:04.849> just<00:05:05.030> because<00:05:05.630> they<00:05:05.930> have

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
the round pen but just because they have

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.510 
the round pen but just because they have
a<00:05:06.080> head<00:05:06.320> out<00:05:06.470> in<00:05:06.620> these<00:05:06.770> areas<00:05:07.099> like<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.310> you

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
a head out in these areas like that you

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.279 
a head out in these areas like that you
know<00:05:07.639> and<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:07.789> turned<00:05:08.000> out<00:05:08.150> like<00:05:08.270> this

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
know and it turned out like this

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.839 
know and it turned out like this
this<00:05:09.530> is<00:05:09.650> not<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.919> place<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.159> try<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:10.550> get<00:05:10.760> it

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
this is not the place to try to get it

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.300 
this is not the place to try to get it
done<00:05:11.030> anyway<00:05:11.990> hope<00:05:12.289> that<00:05:12.500> helps<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:12.949> I'll<00:05:13.070> see
