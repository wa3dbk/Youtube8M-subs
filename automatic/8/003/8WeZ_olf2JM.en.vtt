00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 or accompanies me to Javier Gandolfi who is 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.190
 living with fans what 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.379
 important not also sometimes you have to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.690
 leave the field to live with the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.330
 amateurs how much trouble this is 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.440
 good evening before everything is always good 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.350
 share when we have out there week 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.740
 that we do not have a date for the concacaf 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.119
 so it's good to be close to the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.670
 people 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.130
 we know that I do not come to support every 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.410
 time we have to play here from local 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.820
 visit also so it's nice 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.800
 share with done outside the stadium 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.540
 is open back with marshal in the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.820
 saga you can see the whole panorama in 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.680
 in front of you as it is as is 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.879
 setting the equipment as it is as it has gone 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.879
 improving the last dates 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.480
 the truth that we had many changes 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.829
 people who have been in the selection 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.530
 so 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.269
 we all the first matches 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.399
 now the team are counting again the 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.559
 defensive solidity that I show in 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.269
 previous tournaments and I also think that 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.549
 we are being forceful then 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.980
 we are working we have people 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.040
 injured 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.650
 we know that we are all important 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.320
 what 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.820
 I think we 're on the right path 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.340
 as I say to you there was not ripped from the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.840
 better way but the team already showed 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.540
 another face here from home against pumas like that 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.930
 that now comes a difficult game of 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.700
 visit let's hope to continue adding knowing 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.350
 what is going to be a difficult tournament like it was 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.900
 the last tournament 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.290
 seven points have been added in five 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.670
 dates with a game pending until the 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.650
 moment have been successful 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.970
 comes this weekend's game 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.640
 a complicated game always in the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.030
 region as well as I tell you is a 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.570
 difficult opponent a complicated stadium but 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.670
 we are going to hike 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.940
 we know that the rival out there also 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.910
 is 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.610
 going through a delicate moment in 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.160
 As for points, he has not added the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.550
 points that they wanted so I have 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.910
 what to take advantage 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.570
 how well we are raising 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.950
 think that it's going to be difficult but if 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.120
 we do things like we did a hundred 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.430
 weeks surely have a 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.340
 possibility of winning that of losing to see 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.580
 finally we know that you are knowledgeable about 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.690
 the good wines which is your favorite 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.810
 what do you recommend to an applicant 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.450
 winemaker like me 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.590
 how I like it from time to time 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.340
 like meat out there weekend 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.769
 accompany him with a glass of wine 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.720
 if I have you say I like malbec grape 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.690
 but 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:53.810
 the truth and lots and lots of cutting 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:56.000
