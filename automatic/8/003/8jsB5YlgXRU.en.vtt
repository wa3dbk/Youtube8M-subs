00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.990 
is a very difficult mini mission I found
out<00:03:32.870> because<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:34.070> hammer<00:03:34.250> doesn't<00:03:34.520> last<00:03:34.730> for

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.120 

you<00:03:44.150> can<00:03:44.270> get<00:03:44.390> points<00:03:44.780> jumping<00:03:45.530> over<00:03:45.710> barrels

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
you can get points jumping over barrels

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.010 
you can get points jumping over barrels
that's<00:03:46.460> not<00:03:46.580> gonna<00:03:46.700> help<00:03:46.880> your<00:03:47.090> score<00:03:47.420> really

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
that's not gonna help your score really

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.380 
that's not gonna help your score really
because<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.350> need<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.620> get<00:03:48.740> points<00:03:49.180> using<00:03:50.180> the

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
because you need to get points using the

because you need to get points using the
hammer<00:03:50.950> as<00:03:51.950> far<00:03:52.160> as<00:03:52.190> i<00:03:52.370> understand<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:55.340> so

hammer as far as i understand it and so

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.760 
hammer as far as i understand it and so
you<00:03:55.760> have<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:55.940> go<00:03:56.060> get<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.330> second<00:03:56.690> hammer<00:03:56.870> and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
you have to go get the second hammer and

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.199 
you have to go get the second hammer and

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
maybe it's better off that you're

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.500 
maybe it's better off that you're
watching<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:08.780> second<00:04:09.490> playthrough<00:04:10.490> and<00:04:11.420> I

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
watching this second playthrough and I

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.550 
watching this second playthrough and I
screwed<00:04:11.720> up<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.930> first<00:04:11.959> one<00:04:12.350> because<00:04:12.440> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
screwed up the first one because the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.080 
screwed up the first one because the
hatch<00:04:12.680> stage<00:04:12.920> took<00:04:13.190> me<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.340> lot<00:04:13.520> of<00:04:13.580> tries<00:04:13.850> the

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
hatch stage took me a lot of tries the

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.789 
hatch stage took me a lot of tries the
last<00:04:14.270> time<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.780> little<00:04:15.470> embarrassing<00:04:15.980> when

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
last time a little embarrassing when

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.690

whenever<00:04:43.190> possible<00:04:47.410> let's<00:04:48.410> go<00:04:48.530> this<00:04:48.710> way

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
whenever possible let's go this way

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.350 
whenever possible let's go this way
first<00:04:49.220> collect<00:04:49.670> all<00:04:49.820> the<00:04:49.910> items<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.210> are

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
first collect all the items that are

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.850 
first collect all the items that are
lower<00:04:50.600> on<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.930> stage<00:04:51.170> because<00:04:51.470> that<00:04:51.590> seems<00:04:51.770> to

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
lower on the stage because that seems to

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.190 
lower on the stage because that seems to
be<00:04:51.920> where<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.190> fireballs<00:04:52.730> congregate<00:04:53.600> and

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
be where the fireballs congregate and

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.140 
be where the fireballs congregate and
maybe<00:04:54.830> if<00:04:54.920> I<00:04:54.980> can<00:04:55.130> escape<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.490> higher<00:04:55.850> terrain

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
maybe if I can escape to higher terrain

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.630 
maybe if I can escape to higher terrain
sooner<00:04:56.930> rather<00:04:57.050> than<00:04:57.260> later<00:04:57.320> I<00:04:57.800> can<00:04:58.400> avoid

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
sooner rather than later I can avoid

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:08.740 
sooner rather than later I can avoid
them<00:05:06.700> so<00:05:07.700> this<00:05:07.910> level<00:05:08.210> I<00:05:08.240> have<00:05:08.330> to<00:05:08.420> collect

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
them so this level I have to collect

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.240 
them so this level I have to collect
Colleen's<00:05:09.230> lost<00:05:09.440> items<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:09.950> get<00:05:10.460> 3000<00:05:11.120> points

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
Colleen's lost items and get 3000 points

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.120 
Colleen's lost items and get 3000 points
it's<00:05:13.250> not<00:05:13.400> just<00:05:13.610> one<00:05:13.730> or<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:13.970> other<00:05:14.920> so<00:05:15.920> if<00:05:16.040> I

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
it's not just one or the other so if I

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.190 
it's not just one or the other so if I
can<00:05:16.280> destroy<00:05:16.610> a<00:05:16.730> fireball<00:05:17.210> or<00:05:17.390> just<00:05:17.840> remove

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
can destroy a fireball or just remove

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.680 
can destroy a fireball or just remove
two<00:05:18.410> more<00:05:18.560> bolts<00:05:18.980> that<00:05:19.640> should<00:05:19.850> do<00:05:19.970> me<00:05:22.510> but<00:05:23.510> the

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
two more bolts that should do me but the

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.540 
two more bolts that should do me but the
question<00:05:24.020> is<00:05:24.140> was<00:05:24.410> it<00:05:24.440> fast<00:05:24.830> enough<00:05:26.170> yes<00:05:27.170> I

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
question is was it fast enough yes I

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.380 
question is was it fast enough yes I
don't<00:05:28.550> think<00:05:28.730> it's<00:05:28.820> getting<00:05:29.000> these<00:05:29.090> stars

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
don't think it's getting these stars

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.820 
don't think it's getting these stars
just<00:05:29.600> because<00:05:29.840> I<00:05:29.930> previously<00:05:30.200> earned<00:05:30.500> them<00:05:30.740> I

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
just because I previously earned them I

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.080 
just because I previously earned them I
think<00:05:30.890> it<00:05:31.190> would<00:05:31.280> actually<00:05:31.340> would<00:05:31.700> show<00:05:31.940> me

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
think it would actually would show me

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.460 
think it would actually would show me
what<00:05:32.300> that<00:05:32.330> particular<00:05:32.660> is<00:05:33.530> worth<00:05:34.960> 2<00:05:35.960> 4<00:05:36.140> 10

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
what that particular is worth 2 4 10

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.210 
what that particular is worth 2 4 10
