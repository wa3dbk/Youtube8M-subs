00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.230
 Marketing of McDonald's Austria and 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.929
 we have a very interesting question 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.910
 get from andreas long works the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.190
 why is the citizens looking at the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.929
 do not look like the one you put in 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.789
 get the hand after us this 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.680
 really ask many many people ask 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.390
 Let's take a look today why that 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.250
 That's the way it is and we're going to do it now 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.140
 first in our restaurant and look 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.510
 live on us as a citizen 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.609
 Cooked with us is now always at 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.160
 us in the kitchen and the farmer now 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.600
 to netzer and a hamburger royal with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.860
 cheese for us to prepare 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.140
 you are welcome 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.630
 The first step is now that 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.470
 Print live chat is one of them 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.090
 our meat will come to the grill 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.300
 while the meat is being grilled 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.910
 the bun consoled herberger 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.700
 garnished on the top of the bread 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.000
 with ketchup mustard fresh onions and 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.110
 cheddar cheese and then it works 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.650
 over to the barbecue again 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.700
 The meat is as ready grint and 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.920
 is still seasoned with salt and pepper 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.290
 now comes for everyone needs now 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.090
 comes the second cheese slices and then 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.090
 I say already finished and hamburger 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.060
 Thank you, our burger brings fresh 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.860
 from the grill and the brandy and france 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.530
 into the photo studio so we are now in 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.630
 photo studio await our photographer there 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.710
 No and our football is always on us 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.120
 the two are really one 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.830
 well-rehearsed team and make since 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.400
 some years the photos of ours 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.170
 naturalise 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.770
 Unfortunately, our citizens from the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 restaurant quickly fail and 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.130
 taking photos 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.720
 beautiful was good I would be the same 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.670
 Rheinbahn will be there soon 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.560
 So we have this light here now 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.850
 building we have identical like 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.940
 then we can do the two citizens well 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.200
 compare 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.660
 at that time the photo of our restaurant 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.850
 berger continues now 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.950
 that's the one from the store and in 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.369
 identical to the same construction then comes 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.200
 the citizen of the team that's the tip 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.000
 our football is going to be maybe 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.080
 again to the citizen for the fotoshooting 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.509
 to prepare 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.730
 before maestro, of course, it was about 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.840
 speed as the preparation about 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.700
 lasted three minutes 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.650
 I will go with teamwork 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.780
 preparation for several hours to one 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.700
 photoshooting citizen really perfect 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.049
 Look what may be important 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.360
 to say that we are synonymous for 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.890
 Photoshoot exactly the same ingredients as 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.170
 use in the restaurant so we have 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.590
 here are our buns the bands we have 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.540
 the meat counter star mustard ketchup 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.810
 onion and also our good jetta 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.780
 Cheese why is now with the cucumbers 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.320
 straight forward and not pretty 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.690
 in the center 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.030
 we want to show that we have two cucumbers 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.340
 in the product and everything we have one 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.510
 Burger have the amount of choice show 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.250
 we also stop in front 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.160
 So that the customer sees what he gets 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.230
 everything else under the bread 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.170
 shell hidden now pushes 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.239
 exactly 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.340
 Now the lid is put back on 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:14.620
 exactly to the positions by name 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:17.860
 wanted now is actually is 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.049
 I finished, yes, I never really did 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.400
 so barth 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.630
 yes the photo that the caj just 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.790
 I think that was shot 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.530
 pretty perfect but still needs 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.239
 still a bit fine and 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.640
 that's why we are now at the wm from 11 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.459
 this is our partner in things 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.470
 Bildbearbeitung is the first one here 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.610
 a place that looked like this before 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.180
 Okay then, or the color is on 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.440
 bit approached was adjusted and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.670
 these red spots are retouched and 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.480
 Here we have a place in the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.680
 Cucumber you should take away and 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.280
 the color is a bit different 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.660
 as learned before also emerged 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.280
 strong points so now we are 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.739
 really wonderful the comparison 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.300
 between the two citizens and the first 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.200
 The same difference in the eye 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.000
 jump is certainly the biggest 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.349
 difference of citizens from the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.870
 restaurant or in a box 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.970
 packed to keep warm and in this 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.260
 boxing is a bit steamy and 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.840
 it just makes that happen 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.549
 Bread shrinks a bit 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.440
 the second big difference is the 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.720
 that we really all at the photo shoot 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.729
 ingredients that would otherwise be covered under the bread 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.320
 are hiding forward with it 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.360
 the guest in the restaurant really good 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.820
 can recognize what all too aunt in 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.169
 That burger inside is yes that one 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.000
 to the main differences 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.430
 andreas thanks again for your question 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.210
 I hope we come for this today 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.210
 answer you
