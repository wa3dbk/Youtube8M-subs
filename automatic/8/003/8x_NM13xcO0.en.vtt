00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.539
 to ward off this lesson and flush the 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.670
 right attitude and I show that 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:20.630
 position for possibility for mainz 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.539
 also the correct attitude of the guitar in 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.890
 the seating position is the following guitars 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.809
 house is he still the truth 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.309
 turned 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:33.579
 maybe significantly further most 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.530
 of you have done it so far 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.989
 when I go to the guitar house 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.199
 I 'll take my body now 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.929
 strong in the way and have so erich 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.940
 laborious global scars must come the 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:52.399
 Attitude of the hand becomes inevitable here 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.260
 very uncomfortable around now on the 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.719
 distance for example from therefore find 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.670
 Come like it on a very tour 10 o'clock 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.170
 from today case I would have here now 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.780
 so fingers squeezed 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.330
 if I have to build a house I have 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.120
 The whole thing will have to go in one too 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.640
 do not turn your head and of course and 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.100
 hannes here just put the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.030
 Fingertips comfortable on the distance from 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.820
 three chicks you get so on the 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.280
 possibility to play your destination 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.520
 the intestine were now of course is a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.310
 more important is when playing 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.229
 The editor is used again and again 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.850
 be to update the deep snow because 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.890
 there, of course, he has to be there 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.710
 now he comes back upstairs 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.020
 The access of young people is also very good 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.109
 good and the right hand has one as well 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.680
 very natural natural access to 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:49.159
 so you should be digital 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.590
 in the sitting position have the 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.990
 existing positions is out there after 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.119
 inclined in front what mostly the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.219
 natural attitude when standing anyway 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.540
 it is because here with the scope 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.890
 the snack on the corpus refuse 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.500
 contras to go forward 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.030
 the correct position of the curve pages 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.120
 to let him find that he is not like that 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.530
 Far above, o2 customers are digitally against 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.020
 created is how to make it as always but 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.820
 jazz and saw meant of course 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.310
 damn it came to me a chance here 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.920
 then his work duties go up 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.060
 back is definitely not a day 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.220
 in this course I would like to mediate 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.010
 is digital too far down wants that 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.200
 unknown gaps on the playing position 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.209
 is very different then at one 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.260
 seated position I want that too 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.570
 do not recommend 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.700
 june the golden middle in this species 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.700
 as is probably the right one
