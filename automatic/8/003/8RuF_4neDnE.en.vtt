00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello my dear circulating I'm with 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.029
 you my name is andré we are 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.880
 beginning another video of the channel was 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.920
 pirates and yes and this is a 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.440
 that's a photo of my penguin 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.230
 plush handle this during this 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.090
 her video making this quick video that 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.490
 in fact I'm only doing half of that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.949
 video because as you know right but 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.320
 in the past week I increased one 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.420
 new frame here on the channel that the frame 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.939
 continue more than I put some 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.710
 information I mentioned in the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.540
 weekly chapter but did not fit 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.309
 because my limit is 15 minutes there 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.160
 all that story you already know then 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.129
 You will come two things that I took back 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.320
 of that video is from the weekly chapter and a 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.670
 bit and I will put this video is are 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.829
 comments on the power of the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.230
 travel and others are some comments 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.460
 about the power of the rain is then has 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.670
 these two information that I wanted 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.329
 to put there the seagull of 90 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:03.090
 time it was only the gravatá in the silence of the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:05.460
 top wheel saw and I wanted to add a 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.040
 information in this video also about the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.560
 coming up with official figures is that I 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.630
 I even thought I'd say that. 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 video of yesterday's video cut it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 yesterday was actually the video Video 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.479
 weekly cap but that I ended up 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.950
 forgetting about the case is to forget 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.140
 even note on the notepad of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.210
 notes there and I remembered that I wanted to 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 talk about the cause as the names 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.140
 artificial I wanted in my opinion 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.570
 about how the names are made with 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.630
 these evils are made we saw that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.799
 there is that site in this 7 saeb I do not know 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.680
 as a right arm 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.810
 the fansite that is the deal is klaus who 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.280
 is producing more and in this 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 chapter we saw that it is one thing 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 liquid medium which had right to a 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 little apple that press the china fell 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.100
 nothing at the pond hiss 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.050
 Well, that's when I think it's like 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.730
 which I think are sometimes made more 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.550
 I think that site has some 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.740
 chemical component what there is ox 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.050
 clear gear did exactly what it says on the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.120
 help of the poisons of gases is a 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.160
 mad scientist then he should know 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.590
 how does that chemical component that 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.479
 joining with some other things, right? 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.880
 with and with the knowledge of the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.280
 students of the tone of the minutes are also them 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.100
 would get assistance to do so is mariz 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.400
 more means ah the site is a liquid 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.500
 which could be mixed in the water or already 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.110
 could be a liquid already with water that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.450
 they would use this liquid to irrigate 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.340
 and watering the trees they had 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.860
 in that greenhouse and there doing so 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.650
 grow sometimes more and I think they 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.420
 need the contact dwarfs because 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.130
 they have an average income of 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.370
 gardening also the knowledge 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.950
 of the contact dwarves along with the site is 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.440
 the chemical components but would give a 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.190
 as a result of the largest in this name 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.780
 official 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.480
 I do not know if it was said like that. 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.640
 made more of your tone just talking here 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.110
 something that has already been spoken or a 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.640
 something that has nothing to do and has already been 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.530
 spoken and have nothing to do but I think 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.450
 which are the simple action is that of 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.280
 way they are made more and I wanted to 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.720
 listen to your opinion there do not let 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.519
 this topic for discussion also if you 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.690
 want to discuss this here in the 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.370
 description of the information search in the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.590
 dialog box that always leaves your 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.820
 comments in the comments dialog 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.769
 comments and that's what I wanted to talk about 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.120
 if you want to discuss it 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.890
 and other matters also I 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.780
 I'll also put this video under power 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.239
 of the car tribe shown some 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.060
 comments and on the power of rain 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.620
 It's also okay to give more 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.140
 what's the page doing let's 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.480
 Talking, chatting, that's it. 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.050
 I now stayed with the excerpts that I 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.430
 I took the weekly chapter 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.680
 two things I wanted to talk about 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.540
 respect of the trunk we saw the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.060
 concern that he has with his 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.040
 subordinates is how the bank 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.840
 when he saw that a friend of his was going to be 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.790
 attacked and stood in front and we 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.400
 saw this also contributed when he 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.640
 he learned that the subordinates there 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.650
 they were being attacked by rock or 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.020
 had to finish the sentence 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.330
 they are 180 cases let's go then 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.310
 talk clothes and cares a lot I 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.610
 I think this is a feature of the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.710
 dollar not only of these two but of all is 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.180
 of all the family's team than it rains 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.490
 nor to worry about their 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.560
 and they saw that the nephew 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.299
 I was impeded and I went upstairs to 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.799
 help that fellow I do not think 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.660
 This is a very cool feature. 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.820
 that the Quixote family has what country 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.040
 It's us at least I like it very much. 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.110
 more of them as villains is one thing 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.270
 Strange says he likes pestle no more 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.980
 Anyway, I like talking about travel sobral. 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.900
 as the name of his face is good to distrust 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.450
 because it is also common to play as in 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.430
 today is because it is the way he 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.080
 moves is the way he moves one 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.870
 especially on the last pages 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.150
 reminded me a lot of the way the 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.910
 Move it half way there. 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.040
 that the colonel of air and oenology and 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.750
 The way the work moved reminded me. 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.060
 He put it there is the way he 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.400
 move is not mine and if it keeps molengão yes 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.530
 his head turning popular over the 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.870
 Owl's head, his way is that month. 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.730
 I do not know if I do not eat the 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.040
 meteorology the sky as a limit to 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.410
 deserved that he has no control 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.740
 a strange guy anyway is net goals 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.169
 it's disgusting semedo I do not know how to play 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.700
 it was as in mythology I was not going to stay 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.830
 so surprises so I think more 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.990
 it seemed more dosage I was not going to stay 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.910
 so surprised agent just the power 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.010
 the rain can be any break 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.290
 confidence was the hair bugs have to 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.980
 protect the Flemish family is out 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.000
 work could not and everything 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.590
 this time the is or is not is now the 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.600
 necessary I think it is necessary that 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.940
 her power to speak the following let's go 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.950
 make a contract from there what she 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.210
 talk is a contract to them that they 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.520
 is that they will close 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.530
 and this time the contract was that she spoke 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.450
 for the dwarfs transformed into 1500 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.910
 she was not to leave them 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.740
 defeated in all who were in that 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.020
 official towers including software 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.970
 is also bruised in the sullen 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.860
 Let's see some crew and a little bit of 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.510
 here as always fighting with the presence 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.680
 of you on another tire 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.480
 Thank you too, because it should always be 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.120
 young man and I commented down here to help me 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.830
 on the disclosure because I stay, I'll stay 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.480
 I will be eternally grateful for you

 do not forget to also 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.540
 take a look down at your discretion 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.120
 You have all my partners.
