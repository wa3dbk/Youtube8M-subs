what<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:51.570> got<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.989> know<00:02:54.110> should<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.140> be

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
what we got you know should it be

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
beans and we throw them in if the beans

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.940 
beans and we throw them in if the beans
are<00:03:15.090> too<00:03:15.269> big<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:16.769> can<00:03:16.920> break<00:03:17.070> them<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.310> half

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
are too big you can break them in half
