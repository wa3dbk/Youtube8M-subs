it was pretty crazy we were coming off

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.629 
it was pretty crazy we were coming off
the<00:00:06.610> Black<00:00:06.820> Hills<00:00:07.120> and<00:00:07.450> and<00:00:08.410> the<00:00:09.190> dogs<00:00:09.400> were

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
ride is what explains about 900 miles of

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.500 
ride is what explains about 900 miles of
this<00:00:17.200> race<00:00:17.440> and<00:00:17.710> and<00:00:17.920> we<00:00:18.789> were<00:00:18.880> flying<00:00:19.000> and<00:00:19.390> I

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
this race and and we were flying and I

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.609 
this race and and we were flying and I
had<00:00:19.630> seen<00:00:19.840> a<00:00:19.869> couple<00:00:20.050> moose<00:00:20.289> and<00:00:20.470> there<00:00:20.560> are

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
had seen a couple moose and there are

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.870 
had seen a couple moose and there are
moose<00:00:20.800> tracks<00:00:20.830> everywhere<00:00:21.340> and<00:00:21.580> I<00:00:21.609> think<00:00:21.730> that

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
moose tracks everywhere and I think that

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.339 
moose tracks everywhere and I think that
was<00:00:21.970> part<00:00:22.179> of<00:00:22.210> the<00:00:22.300> reason<00:00:22.570> the<00:00:22.660> dogs<00:00:22.869> were<00:00:23.080> at

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
was part of the reason the dogs were at

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.349 
was part of the reason the dogs were at
a<00:00:23.920> higher<00:00:24.160> level<00:00:24.189> at<00:00:24.699> that<00:00:24.820> point<00:00:25.090> they<00:00:25.269> were

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
a higher level at that point they were

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.060 
a higher level at that point they were
just<00:00:25.570> there<00:00:25.689> smell<00:00:26.080> smelling<00:00:26.560> it<00:00:26.650> all<00:00:26.769> and<00:00:26.949> and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
just there smell smelling it all and and

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.480 
just there smell smelling it all and and
pretty<00:00:28.029> excited<00:00:28.449> about<00:00:28.509> it<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:28.900> I<00:00:29.859> knew<00:00:30.250> and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
pretty excited about it and I knew and

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.640 
pretty excited about it and I knew and
that<00:00:30.910> it<00:00:31.240> was<00:00:31.390> a<00:00:31.419> hypothesis<00:00:32.050> possibility<00:00:32.560> of

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
that it was a hypothesis possibility of

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.280 
that it was a hypothesis possibility of
running<00:00:33.040> so<00:00:33.430> I<00:00:33.550> was<00:00:33.790> at<00:00:34.030> high<00:00:34.210> alert<00:00:34.450> and<00:00:34.750> I

stop I got them stopped
we<00:01:13.630> were<00:01:13.750> inching<00:01:14.110> for<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.409> little<00:01:14.560> bit<00:01:14.740> and

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
we were inching for it a little bit and

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.499 
we were inching for it a little bit and
at<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.369> point<00:01:15.610> it<00:01:15.790> was<00:01:15.880> all<00:01:16.060> up<00:01:16.150> to<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.360> moose

at that point it was all up to the moose

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.240 
at that point it was all up to the moose
you<00:01:17.229> know<00:01:17.350> he<00:01:17.680> had<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:17.890> make<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.070> decision

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
you know he had to make the decision

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.649 
you know he had to make the decision
whether<00:01:18.580> he<00:01:18.850> was<00:01:18.970> going<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.180> dive<00:01:19.330> off<00:01:19.540> the

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
whether he was going to dive off the

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.090 
whether he was going to dive off the
side<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:19.960> trail<00:01:20.200> where<00:01:20.710> he<00:01:20.770> was<00:01:20.920> going<00:01:21.040> to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
side of the trail where he was going to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.999 
side of the trail where he was going to
come<00:01:21.280> right<00:01:21.460> at<00:01:21.610> us<00:01:21.790> and<00:01:22.119> he<00:01:23.079> came<00:01:23.290> right<00:01:23.619> at<00:01:23.829> us

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
come right at us and he came right at us

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.590 
come right at us and he came right at us
and<00:01:24.159> it<00:01:24.369> was<00:01:24.520> one<00:01:24.700> of<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.909> one<00:01:25.420> of<00:01:25.450> the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
and it was one of the one of the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.649 
and it was one of the one of the
scariest<00:01:25.990> moments<00:01:26.140> that<00:01:27.100> I've<00:01:27.220> ever<00:01:27.369> had

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
scariest moments that I've ever had

thought here we go here goes this is the

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.289 
thought here we go here goes this is the
end<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.130> all<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.430> know<00:01:33.579> and<00:01:33.820> I<00:01:33.939> literally
