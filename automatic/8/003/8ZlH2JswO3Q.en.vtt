00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
 (န္တ law) 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.261
 The Louvre in Paris 

00:00:06.261 --> 00:00:08.007
 The 18th century great 

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.020
 The French artist 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.657
 Watteau painting Pilgrimage to Cythera 

00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:15.149
 &gt;&gt; i'm watching our Rococo art 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.352
 Rococo painting of the main topics 

00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:19.259
 The lifestyle of elite 0 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:20.628
 &gt;&gt; This is designed to do 

00:00:20.628 --> 00:00:22.693
 Cythera is a Greek island 

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:24.690
 Goddess Aphrodite was born and where she 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.061
 they believe 

00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:28.046
 &gt;&gt; Cythera is to represent the love goddess 

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:30.321
 In relation to the mythical island 

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:33.667
 &gt;&gt; See the statue of Cupid's bow 

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.185
 Cotton soon 

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:36.924
 Rose vines may be found 

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:39.105
 Here is the definition of frankly remember anything 

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.853
 &gt;&gt; do not see this Cupid sitting on the side of the bottom 

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:43.523
 The arrows in his quiver on earth 

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:44.844
 Despite anything here 

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.674
 because 

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:48.487
 Love is already 

00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:50.676
 &gt;&gt; sitting bashfully girl's skirt 

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:53.516
 Gently pull သာသာလေး found 

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:56.213
 &gt;&gt; himself, although he did not love moves beyond 

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:58.347
 Her Male Friend 

00:00:58.347 --> 00:01:00.049
 But She still love child 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.013
 Sit delicate frame 

00:01:02.013 --> 00:01:03.918
 &gt;&gt; This is a little like me 

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:05.676
 If he can not seem to stay 

00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:07.998
 &gt;&gt; for the boat to break down fat သွားနေတာကို 

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:10.560
 Try these. Did they go to Cythera 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.909
 Or from Cythera 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.298
 out 

00:01:14.298 --> 00:01:15.565
 &gt;&gt; studied art history scholars 

00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:17.565
 Disputing တော်တော်ကြာပါပြီ 

00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:19.246
 &gt;&gt; for its investment, 

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:22.927
 The closer you notice 

00:01:22.927 --> 00:01:23.927
 &gt;&gt; Order ဟုတ်သားပဲ 

00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:25.543
 Try the midst of painting 

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:26.707
 The woman voluntarily 

00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:29.239
 Holding the man's shoulder was reported 

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:30.456
 see 

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.723
 No he did not do anything to make asparagus 

00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:35.252
 This afternoon I think being in the form of a look back, 

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:36.995
 I see hands together 

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:39.733
 Like in the 18th century is an independent 

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.893
 Beautiful outline of a statue of a woman shown Uncovered 

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.563
 Look at the ship on the head 

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.363
 So, maybe, Cupid 

00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:49.663
 Ship's head is covered with a red silk scarf 

00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:52.267
 We saw broad garland 

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:53.646
 Rowing 

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.017
 And they're not 

00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:56.882
 Cythera or ready to be taken to the Cythera 

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.019
 ငါတော့ I think they have been like to go to Cythera 

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.326
 Because Watteau 

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:03.279
 Is trying to show us to a place where no 

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:05.234
 The image we see black 

00:02:05.234 --> 00:02:07.462
 Perhaps the island of Cythera 

00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:09.949
 &gt;&gt; Our small Torch 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.721
 Puti taken for a few weeks 

00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:14.573
 The island's four straight 

00:02:14.573 --> 00:02:17.933
 In other words, statue of Aphrodite 

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:21.133
 The means that we see 

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:24.408
 The island of Cythera, I would think the island 

00:02:24.408 --> 00:02:26.990
 This nice လွမ်းမောဖွယ် 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.552
 The pictures in this island was left alone in the past 

00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:32.409
 &gt;&gt; This is possible but 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.376
 two possible 

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:36.451
 This painting is not very accurate, 

00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:38.915
 The real story is not dead 

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:40.207
 &gt;&gt; I think you're right 

00:02:40.207 --> 00:02:43.258
 Here to show the love 

00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:45.589
 And forms one of a pair 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.463
 are 

00:02:47.463 --> 00:02:50.208
 Sometimes face-to-face 

00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:52.171
 Sometimes together 

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.929
 Sometimes, you'll draw a one 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.229
 Watteau Corruption, Drama getting mad 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:58.804
 Here, we see 

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:00.577
 In this perspective, it might hang 

00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:02.181
 &gt;&gt; Next, remember that you must 

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.348
 This painting by Watteau 

00:03:04.348 --> 00:03:06.675
 To participate at the Royal Academy of Art 

00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:07.951
 Could draw 

00:03:07.951 --> 00:03:11.136
 In this painting, for royalty 

00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:13.222
 I intend to ခမ်းခမ်းနားနား 

00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:15.559
 &gt;&gt; This is a new art form, 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.307
 called the fete galante 

00:03:17.307 --> 00:03:20.142
 Elite to resort 

00:03:20.142 --> 00:03:21.926
 &gt;&gt; Interestingly Watteau 

00:03:21.926 --> 00:03:24.324
 The Art Academy, I was a little late 

00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:27.367
 Private Commission to intervene 

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:30.008
 But you accept that time 

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.137
 no fete galante 

00:03:32.137 --> 00:03:34.420
 Because the painting is quite arrogant 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.645
 The addition of a new type 

00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:38.139
 So after receiving Painting 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.554
 Academy is split into two teams, faulty 

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.521
 Consider 

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:44.858
 This is totally against the actual ' 

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:48.083
 Reubens painting 

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:51.023
 France found out the painting Poussion 

00:03:51.023 --> 00:03:52.998
 &gt;&gt; this is a painting, sketch, 

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:55.255
 The most important, To maintain a clear sketch 

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:57.770
 I have already pre-formatting 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.308
 It is important to complete foresees 

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.329
 The paint job is not the most important 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.888
 The idea received a painting teacher 

00:04:05.888 --> 00:04:08.771
 Reubens' group 

00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:10.475
 Color is the most important 

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.251
 This painting is pleasing to the eye causes color 

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.907
 If you see three Watteau 

00:04:15.907 --> 00:04:18.548
 Reubenist idea recipients သိသာတယ် 

00:04:18.548 --> 00:04:20.255
 &gt;&gt; If you see this Rubeunists 

00:04:20.255 --> 00:04:21.616
 No questions already era 

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:23.888
 &gt;&gt; Yes, of course you see here 

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.308
 Pale sketch 

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:28.164
 Is gradually moved to the background 

00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:30.693
 If you see beautifully embellish 

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:32.354
 I can see the artist's skill 

00:04:32.354 --> 00:04:34.274
 This Reubens's Baroque masterpiece 

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.059
 Really 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:38.613
 Watteau's Rococo masterpiece 

00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:40.845
 &gt;&gt; So we called Rococo era 

00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:43.305
 This Enciene Regime 

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:46.891
 The tribes of the French nobles of his day over the last time 

00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:48.186
 &gt;&gt; nobles seed France 

00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:50.556
 Before the Revolution a century 

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.449
 Families. This revolution 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.699
 The old system has been eradicated to defeat ethnic 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.788
 We now see a new world 

00:04:57.788 --> 00:04:59.408
 Opened to 

00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:03.159
 &gt;&gt; Here we play out the image of royalty 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.411
 They created a mystery to the world 

00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:08.406
 A miracle can be found on the landscape of the world 

00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:18.226
 (Piano)
