so you know the bumper blindages right
after<00:03:51.980> all<00:03:52.070> these<00:03:52.190> years<00:03:52.250> but<00:03:54.220> anyhow<00:03:55.220> like<00:03:55.310> I

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
after all these years but anyhow like I

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.040 
after all these years but anyhow like I
have<00:03:55.610> been<00:03:55.730> kind<00:03:55.910> of<00:03:56.000> going<00:03:56.630> at<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.020> I

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
have been kind of going at it and I

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.210 
have been kind of going at it and I
think<00:03:57.440> I'm<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.650> little<00:03:57.830> change<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.070> direction

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
think I'm a little change of direction

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.880 
think I'm a little change of direction
here<00:03:58.700> I<00:03:59.110> got<00:04:00.110> a<00:04:00.140> little<00:04:00.260> bit<00:04:00.440> more<00:04:00.560> work<00:04:00.709> to<00:04:00.800> do

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
here I got a little bit more work to do

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.380 
here I got a little bit more work to do
on<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.070> rocker<00:04:01.250> panels<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.970> then<00:04:02.060> I'm<00:04:02.180> should

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
on the rocker panels and then I'm should

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.030 
on the rocker panels and then I'm should
be<00:04:02.510> done<00:04:02.690> with<00:04:02.870> all<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.110> welding<00:04:03.500> underneath

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
be done with all the welding underneath

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.170 
be done with all the welding underneath
and<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:04.340> think<00:04:04.550> I'm<00:04:04.670> gonna<00:04:04.760> wait<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.000> pull<00:04:05.120> the

and I think I'm gonna wait and pull the
car<00:04:05.360> off<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.480> rotisserie<00:04:07.060> probably<00:04:08.060> next

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270

and<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.490> just<00:06:01.669> happened<00:06:01.940> to<00:06:02.000> catch<00:06:02.120> it<00:06:02.360> and<00:06:02.450> so<00:06:02.570> I

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
and I just happened to catch it and so I

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.880 
and I just happened to catch it and so I
thought<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:02.900> heck<00:06:03.020> with<00:06:03.200> this<00:06:03.440> I'm<00:06:03.680> gonna

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.000 
thought the heck with this I'm gonna
protect<00:06:04.220> it<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:04.550> so<00:06:04.729> it's<00:06:04.880> all<00:06:05.030> epoxy<00:06:05.479> now<00:06:06.010> I

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010
