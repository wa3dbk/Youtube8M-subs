00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.280 
because of the shale but because DNA
only<00:01:40.619> has<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> half-life<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.579> 521<00:01:42.509> years<00:01:42.840> even

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
only has a half-life of 521 years even

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.980 
only has a half-life of 521 years even
in<00:01:43.500> perfect<00:01:44.100> conditions<00:01:44.820> basically<00:01:45.780> every

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
in perfect conditions basically every

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.770 
in perfect conditions basically every
521<00:01:46.860> years<00:01:47.189> half<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> DNA<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> grade<00:01:48.540> so

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
521 years half of the DNA to grade so

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.090 
521 years half of the DNA to grade so
after<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> thousand<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.530> forty-two<00:01:49.860> years

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
after a thousand and forty-two years

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.880 
after a thousand and forty-two years
there<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.369> only<00:01:50.430> 25%<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> DNA<00:01:51.869> after<00:01:52.380> 46

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
there was only 25% of the DNA after 46

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.209 
there was only 25% of the DNA after 46
million<00:01:53.280> point<00:01:54.090> zero<00:01:54.600> zero<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:55.049> percent<00:01:55.710> of

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
million point zero zero one percent of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.149 
million point zero zero one percent of
the<00:01:56.369> DNA<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.360> we're<00:01:57.630> pretty<00:01:58.140> much<00:01:58.530> millions<00:01:59.009> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
the DNA so we're pretty much millions of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.709 
the DNA so we're pretty much millions of
years<00:01:59.310> late<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.759> party<00:02:00.060> even<00:02:00.479> though

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
years late for that party even though

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.749 
years late for that party even though
DNA<00:02:01.290> doesn't<00:02:01.680> survive<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.130> fossil<00:02:02.490> ation
