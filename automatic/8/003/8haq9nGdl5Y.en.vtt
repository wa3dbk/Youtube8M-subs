00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.210 
doing the roll which is good and that
has<00:01:43.680> been<00:01:43.860> confirmed<00:01:44.369> by<00:01:44.820> treyarch<00:01:45.600> um<00:01:46.220> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
has been confirmed by treyarch um and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.700 
has been confirmed by treyarch um and
that's<00:01:48.060> about<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.290> all<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> know

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
that's about it like that's all I know

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
that's about it like that's all I know
and<00:01:50.159> my<00:01:50.310> thoughts<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.659> it's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and my thoughts about it is I think it's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.120 
and my thoughts about it is I think it's
kind<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.799> good<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.320> think<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
kind of good but I think I think that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.649 
kind of good but I think I think that
the<00:01:56.219> problem<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> lot<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> things

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the problem is that with a lot of things

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.270 
the problem is that with a lot of things
are<00:01:57.780> try<00:01:57.990> adding<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.590> they're<00:01:58.740> trying<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.130> go

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
are try adding that they're trying to go

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.069 
are try adding that they're trying to go
for<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.520> really<00:01:59.880> strategic<00:02:00.090> kind<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.899> thing

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
for a really strategic kind of thing

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.510 
for a really strategic kind of thing
which<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> said<00:02:01.680> about<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.280> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
which is what I said about the the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
which is what I said about the the
Blackbird<00:02:02.969> kill<00:02:03.270> streak<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.750> my<00:02:03.899> previous

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
Blackbird kill streak in my previous

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.380 
Blackbird kill streak in my previous
video<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.430> strategic<00:02:06.240> but

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
video you know it's really strategic but

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.089 
video you know it's really strategic but
no<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.990> Call<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.170> Duty<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.619> really<00:02:07.950> that

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
no one in Call of Duty is really that

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.550 
no one in Call of Duty is really that
strategic<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> think<00:02:09.390> rather<00:02:09.780> than<00:02:09.959> being<00:02:10.259> a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
strategic so I think rather than being a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.900 
strategic so I think rather than being a
strategy<00:02:11.160> move<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
strategy move that the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.000 
strategy move that the
we'll<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.210> be<00:02:12.330> absolutely<00:02:13.050> hauled<00:02:13.500> out<00:02:13.740> just

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
we'll just be absolutely hauled out just

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.940 
we'll just be absolutely hauled out just
to<00:02:14.130> be<00:02:14.250> annoying<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.170> probably<00:02:16.590> piss

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
to be annoying and just probably piss

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.980 
to be annoying and just probably piss
people<00:02:17.370> off<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> problem

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
people off and that I have a problem

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.550 
people off and that I have a problem
with<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.580> dive<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:21.210> definitely<00:02:21.780> what

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
with so that the dive is definitely what

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.900 
with so that the dive is definitely what
I<00:02:22.590> predict<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.070> going<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.280> happen<00:02:23.520> people<00:02:23.760> are

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
I predict is going to happen people are

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.280 
I predict is going to happen people are
just<00:02:24.000> going<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.180> dive<00:02:24.480> everywhere<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.200> not

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
just going to dive everywhere and not

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.710 
just going to dive everywhere and not
play<00:02:25.470> properly<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.130> kind<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.490> shit

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
play properly and all this kind of shit

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.660 
play properly and all this kind of shit
so<00:02:27.720> hopefully<00:02:27.990> there's<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> window<00:02:29.370> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
so hopefully there's like a window of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.300 
so hopefully there's like a window of
like<00:02:30.120> maybe<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.510> couple<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.440> seconds<00:02:31.830> or<00:02:31.980> more

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
like maybe a couple of seconds or more

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.980 
like maybe a couple of seconds or more
than<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.610> second<00:02:33.000> more<00:02:33.210> than<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.450> few<00:02:33.570> seconds

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
than a second more than a few seconds

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.780 
than a second more than a few seconds
wait<00:02:34.290> until<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:35.070> do<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.340> again<00:02:35.580> like

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
wait until you can do it again like

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.370 
wait until you can do it again like
example<00:02:36.360> if<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.540> don't<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:36.870> Marathon<00:02:37.350> on

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
example if you don't have Marathon on

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.780 
example if you don't have Marathon on
you<00:02:37.620> have<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.890> wait<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> while<00:02:38.310> before<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.640> can

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
you have to wait a while before you can

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.730 
you have to wait a while before you can
sprint<00:02:39.090> again<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:40.050> hopefully<00:02:40.410> it's<00:02:40.590> something

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
sprint again so hopefully it's something

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.710 
sprint again so hopefully it's something
like<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.310> because<00:02:41.520> I<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:41.940> really<00:02:42.240> see<00:02:42.570> this

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
like that because I can really see this

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.030 
like that because I can really see this
just<00:02:43.170> being<00:02:43.410> used<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.950> annoy<00:02:44.190> people<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.890> but

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
just being used to annoy people so but

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.070 
just being used to annoy people so but
hopefully<00:02:47.460> it<00:02:47.580> won't<00:02:47.790> be<00:02:47.880> somebody<00:02:48.810> said<00:02:49.050> it

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
hopefully it won't be somebody said it

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.840 
hopefully it won't be somebody said it
might<00:02:49.290> even<00:02:49.440> be<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.650> perk<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.280> I'm<00:02:50.610> not

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
might even be a perk but I'm not

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.990 
might even be a perk but I'm not
confident<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.540> that's<00:02:51.630> true<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:53.640> that's<00:02:53.850> my

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
confident that that's true so that's my

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.550 
confident that that's true so that's my
thoughts<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:55.730> like<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.180> can't<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.320> see

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
thoughts on that like it's I can't I see

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.710 
thoughts on that like it's I can't I see
it<00:02:58.710> being<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.580> spam<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.090> annoy<00:03:00.240> people

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
it being is just a spam and annoy people

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.260 
it being is just a spam and annoy people
and<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.290> that's<00:03:01.410> my<00:03:01.590> thoughts<00:03:01.860> on<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.430> I

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
and and that's my thoughts on that so I
