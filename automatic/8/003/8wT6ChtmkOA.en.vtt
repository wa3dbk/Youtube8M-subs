as<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.770> are<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.579> see<00:01:47.759> right<00:01:48.149> there<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
as you are going to see right there I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.789 
as you are going to see right there I
don't<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> guys<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.680> on

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
don't know if you guys can see that on

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.840 
don't know if you guys can see that on
camera<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.020> isn't<00:01:52.470> tripwire<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.759> can

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
camera but it isn't tripwire so you can

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.270 
camera but it isn't tripwire so you can
see<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> arrow<00:01:54.299> come<00:01:54.659> straight<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.140> me<00:01:55.439> so

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
see the arrow come straight at me so

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.889 
see the arrow come straight at me so
you'd<00:01:56.430> want<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> break<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.869> can

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
you'd want to break this and you can

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.359 
you'd want to break this and you can
actually<00:01:58.110> get<00:01:58.350> these<00:01:58.560> hooks<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.979> everything

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
actually get these hooks and everything

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.639 
actually get these hooks and everything
and<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> trip<00:02:00.570> wire<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.049> string<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.590> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
and the trip wire is just string so you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.440 
and the trip wire is just string so you
can<00:02:01.799> take<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:02.909> right<00:02:03.060> behind<00:02:03.210> here

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
can take that and then right behind here

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.880 
can take that and then right behind here
that's<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.140> filled<00:02:04.439> with<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> few

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that's just this filled with a few

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560 
that's just this filled with a few
arrows<00:02:05.189> it's<00:02:05.460> five<00:02:05.670> arrows<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.060> filled<00:02:06.479> with

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
arrows it's five arrows is filled with

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.900 
arrows it's five arrows is filled with
and<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.500> there's<00:02:07.950> some<00:02:08.129> redstone<00:02:08.399> right

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and then there's some redstone right

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.020 
and then there's some redstone right
there<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.920> see<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.459> leads<00:02:11.700> from

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
there you can see that just leads from

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790 
there you can see that just leads from
the<00:02:12.390> trip<00:02:12.840> wire<00:02:12.989> back<00:02:13.319> there

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the trip wire back there

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.170 
the trip wire back there
brings<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> redstone<00:02:14.760> down<00:02:15.060> here<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
brings the redstone down here to the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.920 
brings the redstone down here to the
dispenser<00:02:18.180> right<00:02:18.330> there<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.630> then<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.810> got

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
dispenser right there and then you got

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.040 
dispenser right there and then you got
your<00:02:18.960> chest<00:02:19.380> which<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.970> also<00:02:20.970> right<00:02:21.750> there

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
your chest which is also right there

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.040 
your chest which is also right there
week<00:02:22.620> at<00:02:22.830> another<00:02:23.280> trip<00:02:24.000> boy<00:02:24.180> right<00:02:24.540> there<00:02:24.570> so

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
week at another trip boy right there so

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.050 
week at another trip boy right there so
we<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.230> break<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:26.460> going<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.640> fire<00:02:26.850> one

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
we can break that it's going to fire one

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.460 
we can break that it's going to fire one
as<00:02:27.270> soon<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.630> break<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.960> as<00:02:28.020> well<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.350> be

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
as soon as you break it as well so be

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.920 
as soon as you break it as well so be
careful<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.360> then<00:02:30.360> we'll<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.690> look

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
careful that and then we'll just look

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.690 
careful that and then we'll just look
ahead<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.440> look<00:02:31.650> into<00:02:31.800> our<00:02:31.920> chest<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:32.430> got

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
ahead and look into our chest and we got

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.860 
ahead and look into our chest and we got
eight<00:02:33.210> bones<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:34.050> that's<00:02:34.170> pretty<00:02:34.530> bad<00:02:35.870> pretty

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
eight bones so that's pretty bad pretty

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.690 
eight bones so that's pretty bad pretty
bad<00:02:37.170> little<00:02:37.590> loot<00:02:37.920> thing<00:02:38.190> right<00:02:38.370> there<00:02:38.520> but

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
bad little loot thing right there but

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.450 
bad little loot thing right there but
thankfully<00:02:39.180> on<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.540> seed<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.800> but

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
thankfully on this seed we have to but

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:51.860 
thankfully on this seed we have to but
then<00:02:41.730> what's<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:44.480> piston<00:02:50.330> I'm<00:02:51.330> actually<00:02:51.540> not

to our second one let's just get out to
this<00:03:20.580> area<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.000> believe<00:03:21.180> it's<00:03:21.300> over<00:03:21.390> here

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
this area and I believe it's over here

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.100 
this area and I believe it's over here
yep<00:03:23.489> there<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:23.970> okay<00:03:24.510> let's<00:03:24.660> see<00:03:24.810> what<00:03:24.840> Lou

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
yep there it is okay let's see what Lou

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.890 
yep there it is okay let's see what Lou
we<00:03:25.260> get<00:03:25.380> from<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.650> one<00:03:25.860> if<00:03:26.070> any<00:03:26.660> i'm<00:03:27.660> guessing

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
we get from this one if any i'm guessing

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.960 
we get from this one if any i'm guessing
the<00:03:28.110> entrances<00:03:28.680> on<00:03:28.830> this<00:03:29.220> side<00:03:29.459> but<00:03:29.610> it's<00:03:29.730> got

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
the entrances on this side but it's got

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.020 
the entrances on this side but it's got
to<00:03:30.090> be<00:03:30.150> underground<00:03:30.480> i'd<00:03:30.930> imagine<00:03:32.930> we'll<00:03:33.930> go

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
to be underground i'd imagine we'll go

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.229 
to be underground i'd imagine we'll go
we'll<00:03:36.030> break<00:03:36.270> in<00:03:36.420> here<00:03:36.690> ah<00:03:36.780> ok<00:03:37.290> ah<00:03:38.239> the

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
we'll break in here ah ok ah the

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.580 
we'll break in here ah ok ah the
entrance<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.630> right<00:03:39.690> there<00:03:40.020> just<00:03:40.230> cover<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.470> up

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
entrance is right there just cover it up

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.350 
entrance is right there just cover it up
ok<00:03:40.860> I'm<00:03:41.250> really<00:03:41.580> bad<00:03:41.700> find<00:03:41.970> an<00:03:42.060> entrance

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
ok I'm really bad find an entrance

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.170 
ok I'm really bad find an entrance
anyways<00:03:42.989> let's<00:03:43.260> go<00:03:44.250> down<00:03:44.400> here<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.940> we'll

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
anyways let's go down here and we'll

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.570 
anyways let's go down here and we'll
loop<00:03:45.420> around<00:03:45.950> will<00:03:46.950> step<00:03:47.190> on<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.400> pressure

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
loop around will step on the pressure

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.970 
loop around will step on the pressure
plate<00:03:47.760> because<00:03:48.270> we<00:03:48.390> know<00:03:48.510> that's<00:03:48.720> there<00:03:49.020> at<00:03:49.800> in

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
plate because we know that's there at in

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.130 
plate because we know that's there at in
this<00:03:50.100> chest<00:03:50.430> we<00:03:50.610> got<00:03:50.760> some<00:03:51.120> rotten<00:03:51.360> flesh<00:03:51.600> some

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
this chest we got some rotten flesh some

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.270 
this chest we got some rotten flesh some
bones<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:53.060> lot<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.150> bones<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.800> loop<00:03:56.040> isn't

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
bones a lot of bones so the loop isn't

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.540 
bones a lot of bones so the loop isn't
amazing<00:03:56.820> but<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.660> know<00:03:58.080> it's<00:03:58.260> it's<00:03:58.470> ok<00:03:58.950> then

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
amazing but you know it's it's ok then

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.460 
amazing but you know it's it's ok then
we<00:03:59.670> got<00:03:59.820> our<00:04:02.030> we've<00:04:03.030> got<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.350> think

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
we got our we've got that so I think

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.380 
we got our we've got that so I think
it's<00:04:04.800> just<00:04:05.070> those<00:04:05.250> two<00:04:05.610> earths<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.270> know

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
it's just those two earths you know

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.030 
it's just those two earths you know
randomly<00:04:06.930> I'm<00:04:07.020> not<00:04:07.170> really<00:04:07.290> sure<00:04:07.410> I'm<00:04:07.680> not<00:04:07.800> too

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
randomly I'm not really sure I'm not too

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.120 
randomly I'm not really sure I'm not too
sure<00:04:08.430> but<00:04:09.390> maybe<00:04:09.660> it's<00:04:09.870> up<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.110> there<00:04:10.380> because

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
sure but maybe it's up to there because

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.229 
sure but maybe it's up to there because
when<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.340> did<00:04:11.550> that<00:04:11.580> it<00:04:11.790> looked<00:04:11.820> like<00:04:12.090> it

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
when I did that it looked like it

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.060 
when I did that it looked like it
extends<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.320> piston<00:04:13.590> then<00:04:13.709> pulls<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:14.010> back

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
extends the piston then pulls it back

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.970 
extends the piston then pulls it back
out<00:04:14.780> hmm<00:04:15.780> oh<00:04:15.900> yeah<00:04:16.109> here<00:04:16.320> we<00:04:16.410> go<00:04:16.440> no<00:04:17.750> wait<00:04:18.830> no<00:04:19.830> I

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
out hmm oh yeah here we go no wait no I

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.159 
out hmm oh yeah here we go no wait no I
guess<00:04:20.160> it's<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:20.489> that's<00:04:21.390> just<00:04:21.570> break<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.049> and

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
guess it's not that's just break it and

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.990 
guess it's not that's just break it and
get<00:04:22.380> in<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.370> guys<00:04:23.490> know<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.880> can

get in so you guys know that you can

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.279 
get in so you guys know that you can
break<00:04:24.210> in<00:04:24.390> there<00:04:24.539> and<00:04:24.660> stuff<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:24.990> get<00:04:25.140> that

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
break in there and stuff and get that
