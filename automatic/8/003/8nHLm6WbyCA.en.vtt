00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 you know the tried and tested problem me 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.500
 have a business card and i have 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.900
 do not bother this business card 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.059
 type in if it takes me 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.000
 mistakes and so on and so on 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.699
 there is the app world card mobile 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.830
 It's not cheap but it's worth it 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.240
 definitely for people who deal with a lot 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.000
 working together 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.990
 it just looks like this here and if i did 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.630
 now here just in the camera 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.199
 go and my business card with me 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.380
 take 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.300
 you see the camera there are a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.280
 few features and that's what I'm saying here 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.469
 once I can do it all right afterwards 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.940
 can be cut or the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.680
 hand means when I activated the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.570
 have that the photo only then recorded 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.820
 when the card is stabilized 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.829
 So let's just do it and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.719
 Choose this card here and say 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.610
 take a picture if the whole smooth 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.890
 is and you hear the picture was taken 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.899
 and now the app recognizes where the card is 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.149
 I have to go here again at 90 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.219
 Turn it to fit her then 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.750
 i can say the app ok the card 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.609
 is a german map so take it 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.110
 Kindly in German and I can without 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.460
 Add another photo if I still have one 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.470
 would like to add more information 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.810
 then I click on then this is the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.250
 German perfect this app is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.799
 By the way, in German but as you can see 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.570
 not so complete and here it looks 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.850
 app automatically carries it all in here 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.840
 the contacts 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.119
 it's not always perfect though 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.490
 you see the phone number was recognized 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.780
 even if yes up here is again 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.880
 with a phone number in it that is 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.110
 not quite so perfect but that can 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.119
 any tricks that I can be 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.829
 So just leave here if 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.450
 I now always have the original card to her 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.360
 look a place 29 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.400
 here is a comma the comma exactly 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.590
 income so we just make 2 more 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.659
 9 out and if we continue here 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.520
 we can go down this all 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.049
 Check and if needed very easy 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.790
 change by just typing 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.259
 and we can set that up 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.970
 Save in the iphone contacts with 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.649
 want and when I finish on now 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.200
 Of course I can also click 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.790
 Just add a photo when I go to 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.259
 Example say why take a photo 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.390
 just to see the logo here 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.610
 I can easily bring in one 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.140
 take a photo I use that and last 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.720
 here in the icon one of this company 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.530
 click I have the whole thing now 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.120
 set as icon directly 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.160
 Let's look at the name Kathleen 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.209
 Proske and all these data, the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.520
 hereby in there 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.530
 when we finish clicking yes 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.970
 contact saved here i can now 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.819
 also easy to import contacts 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.590
 from icloud and many other stuff and 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.000
 Of course, even if I am here now 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.350
 and then go with this contact 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.610
 You can work here like everyone else 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.380
 I only have this one now 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.580
 have created an ethics council and can 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.310
 the whole example to the iCloud 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.260
 upload or dropbox I can do that 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.050
 easily sort them into groups 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.080
 if I have several contacts now and 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.550
 Of course I can do it, too 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.200
 not the 70 degrees indicate 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.880
 but the bottom can be this whole 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.900
 of course, just somewhere 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.090
 sink 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.410
 for example by e-mail over here i 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.750
 must of course select before the contact 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.069
 or about itunes export all over 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.360
 possibilities that exist here 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.269
 to share contact 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.920
 that's pretty great so we have 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.880
 created these contacts but it works 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.069
 Of course we need that 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.050
 of course also in the contacts and there 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.430
 really takes this app around wonderfully 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.260
 that means if we now in the 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.260
 contacts app go and we are looking now 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.180
 Just go to Kathleen and I have 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.290
 then do not put this contact before then 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.840
 See, I already have a bit of it 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.739
 but this contact is here 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.500
 registered 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.040
 as you can see 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.870
 it is not exactly here now 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.610
 photo so not ours you see me 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.290
 I really played around and yes 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.709
 once it is the one with the logo yes 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.050
 exactly the he created my grad here 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.850
 and yes I just think great because the 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.470
 app works really amazing 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.510
 good even if you have something now 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.800
 experimented and the whole 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.480
 contacts have repeatedly entered 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.920
 It will not be that great though 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.330
 that was only so with me otherwise 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.610
 Of course, it only comes in once and 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.690
 should actually synonymous duplicate 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.780
 Automatically recognize we can 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.860
 for example, certain shipments of e 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.810
 go mails 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.510
 I have just now from here 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.720
 my from my service contact for 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.130
 my sim card here the address the 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.830
 here at the end is when I this 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.720
 copy as an appendage to for example of 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.549
 an e-mail and back to the 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.200
 Change app is not a problem 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.870
 I just go here under signature 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.880
 and wear here will be automatic 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.250
 entered from the store the whole 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.080
 and realize and the whole will 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.979
 automatically recognized as well and me 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.510
 can create a contact here 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.220
 from this signature if I like now 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.300
 many e-mails with signatures get done 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.830
 no problem I can completely 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.330
 simply out complete signature-a 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.890
 Of course, contact can be created 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.229
 also add a photo if one 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.490
 it is or add the name 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.560
 because now grad still missing but 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.000
 in principle, you know how it is 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.580
 Of course, there is also work 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.580
 contacts running on qr-codes and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.340
 also for this i have a feature here and 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.479
 Although under qr code is not here 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.150
 problem if I now have a qr-code 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.350
 but for some reason and of course 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.940
 I can also easily from one 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.520
 photo which I have created before 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.840
 I easily remove the contact 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.130
 For example, if I am somewhere now 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.229
 he said he is one 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.610
 business card says yes but i need 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.560
 It's not that short 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.360
 take a picture and you can do that later 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.260
 to enter everything in peace in the 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.760
 Settings you can still a few 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.140
 set things as the names sorted 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.330
 can be and how the whole 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.430
 should be saved on the iphone 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.289
 or where it is still stored 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.090
 should be and how synchronized 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.080
 shall be 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.970
 and of course there is one more 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.800
 Help and information are also very 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.500
 are detailed even if for one 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.090
 great app if you need it 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.980
 I can only recommend link stands 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.560
 Of course in the video description one 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.270
 very thoughtful app too and i hope 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.240
 you like it you can do something with it 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.980
 just start saying in the 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.390
 comments what do you think job needs 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.190
 you like that if you have a lot with us now 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.380
 business cards I work finds 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.060
 personally really great because I do 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.710
 now and then with business cards in contact 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.270
 come and then do not always type 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.910
 and there it is really a great app 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.070
 even if she is in English or 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.930
 so but she works and that the 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.710
 The main thing, yes, then it was already who 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.030

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.230
 I thank you for seeing something and me 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.030
 Hope we see each other in the course 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.030
 next video is good again
