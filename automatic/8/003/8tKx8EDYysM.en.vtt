00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
losing even the moonlight before the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.160 
losing even the moonlight before the
twilight<00:02:17.010> hour<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.970> horrible<00:02:18.690> because<00:02:18.960> I'm

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
twilight hour it is horrible because I'm

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.960 
twilight hour it is horrible because I'm
then<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.740> just<00:02:19.890> find<00:02:20.310> out<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.730> way<00:02:20.820> I'd

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
then I have to just find out the way I'd

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.280 
then I have to just find out the way I'd
have<00:02:21.120> tortured<00:02:21.420> through<00:02:21.600> man<00:02:21.780> yep

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.000 

I<00:02:26.379> think<00:02:27.189> that's<00:02:27.430> probably<00:02:27.730> populated<00:02:28.420> this

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
I think that's probably populated this

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.589 
I think that's probably populated this
oh<00:02:30.069> you<00:02:30.670> think<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:30.849> across<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.090> bridge<00:02:31.390> thing

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
oh you think so across the bridge thing

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.020 
oh you think so across the bridge thing
is<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.290> this<00:02:32.560> though<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.220> think<00:02:33.790> it's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
is this is this though I think it's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.309 
is this is this though I think it's
where<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.150> ended<00:02:34.329> up<00:02:34.420> during<00:02:34.930> one<00:02:35.049> of<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.170> last

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
play test where I ended up getting

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.830 
play test where I ended up getting
completely<00:02:37.329> screwed<00:02:37.659> Oh<00:02:37.870> run<00:02:38.709> out<00:02:38.860> of
