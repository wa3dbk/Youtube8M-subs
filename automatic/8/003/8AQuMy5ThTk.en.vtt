00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:17.289
 this place becomes more and more noisy but almost acquired I believe 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.140
 that it would finally be necessary to find another accommodation 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
 as to the location of the Arab league and especially later 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.239
 why atlantic 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.739
 there is no right to security and our house 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.080
 but it is not framed 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.080
 As a reminder 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.730
 I do not worry too much 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.730
 we will find a solution I did not notice 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.340
 why not follow, so I always have to be 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.400
 practice 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400
 m 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.760
 not both 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.520
 but that could have gone very wrong 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.090
 e 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.870

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.390
 you see them both if I love you what is a good way to 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.869
 to have a new house without doing anything and how but how 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:14.259
 I panicked 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.429
 what we could more easily 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.489
 affi started and bettencourt 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.000

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.519

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.299
 it does not allow red 18th 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.969
 yet he is ready for anything 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.199

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.729

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.149
 she had come and presented and explained 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.759
 but it is still too early to say whether he thought it would be appropriate to press 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.929

 the 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.769
 the proof 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.769

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.759
 m the world returns 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:01.819
 Winning stone all marveled practice for m it's better for you 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.090
 to see nothing and say nothing after what happened a new night was 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.879
 very very expensive but it's also true for you 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.789
 public works and who said we could not rely on the little he 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:12.610
 must believe it 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.069
 you absolutely wanted to have great apix work to say because it 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.080
 brought me back from right 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.039
 in fact it is not the look 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.039

 Yes 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.069
 there he could not bear the argument any longer 30 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.310
 and what does it mean for when the call that meets in 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.310
 the afternoon 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.020
 it's bullshit 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.430
 it's a bit of a hassle for why you only have one question 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.499
 time told this story 

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:56.919

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:10.650
 when I was even smaller 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.650
 before telling this with another question is what is the recipe 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.479
 I thought then that it was already not pulling the rope for a 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.479
 qualification this 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.869

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:44.150
 credit 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.669
 one thing is certain quantity never embarrassed to find excuses 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:51.780
 while bringing him 40 this was not an excuse it's a way of doing 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.849
