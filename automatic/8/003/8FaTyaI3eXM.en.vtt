00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
lick number 39 is called burnout in the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.860 
lick number 39 is called burnout in the
previous<00:00:09.290> lick<00:00:09.530> we<00:00:09.740> had<00:00:10.040> a<00:00:10.430> fair<00:00:11.300> amount<00:00:11.330> of

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
previous lick we had a fair amount of

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.830 
previous lick we had a fair amount of
rhythmic<00:00:13.210> syncopated<00:00:14.210> stuff<00:00:14.480> and<00:00:14.690> a<00:00:14.720> little

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
rhythmic syncopated stuff and a little

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.030 
rhythmic syncopated stuff and a little
bit<00:00:15.050> of<00:00:15.110> speed<00:00:15.350> this<00:00:15.530> time<00:00:15.740> we're<00:00:15.890> going<00:00:15.980> to

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
bit of speed this time we're going to

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.560 
bit of speed this time we're going to
flip<00:00:16.279> those<00:00:16.550> and<00:00:16.760> we're<00:00:16.850> gonna<00:00:17.000> have<00:00:17.180> just<00:00:17.210> a

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
flip those and we're gonna have just a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.859 
flip those and we're gonna have just a
tiny<00:00:17.810> bit<00:00:18.080> of<00:00:18.230> that<00:00:18.550> easier<00:00:19.550> stuff<00:00:19.939> and<00:00:20.180> then<00:00:20.779> a

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
tiny bit of that easier stuff and then a

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.330 
tiny bit of that easier stuff and then a
whole<00:00:21.110> lot<00:00:21.320> of<00:00:21.349> speed<00:00:21.740> we're<00:00:22.070> gonna<00:00:22.160> be

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
whole lot of speed we're gonna be

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.089 
whole lot of speed we're gonna be
playing<00:00:22.550> at<00:00:23.029> bar<00:00:23.329> number<00:00:23.540> nine<00:00:23.989> at<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:24.800> very

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
playing at bar number nine at the very

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.979 
playing at bar number nine at the very
end<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.279> a<00:00:25.369> 12<00:00:25.640> bar<00:00:25.820> progression<00:00:26.360> bars<00:00:26.779> 9

end of a 12 bar progression bars 9

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.260 
end of a 12 bar progression bars 9
through<00:00:27.230> 12<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:28.189> we're<00:00:28.640> gonna<00:00:28.790> pour<00:00:29.090> on<00:00:29.239> the

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
through 12 and we're gonna pour on the

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.210 
through 12 and we're gonna pour on the
speed<00:00:29.689> just<00:00:30.079> a<00:00:30.230> little<00:00:30.439> bit<00:00:30.590> into<00:00:30.860> this<00:00:30.980> and

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
speed just a little bit into this and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.190 
speed just a little bit into this and
we're<00:00:31.340> just<00:00:31.430> gonna<00:00:31.579> keep<00:00:31.849> our<00:00:32.029> foot<00:00:32.930> on<00:00:33.110> the

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
we're just gonna keep our foot on the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.229 
we're just gonna keep our foot on the
accelerator<00:00:33.230> all<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.730> way<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.000> end<00:00:35.149> just

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
accelerator all the way to the end just

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.270 
accelerator all the way to the end just
in<00:00:35.510> time<00:00:35.690> to<00:00:35.899> hit<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.079> turnaround<00:00:36.440> I'm<00:00:37.010> gonna<00:00:37.160> be

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
in time to hit a turnaround I'm gonna be

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.369 
in time to hit a turnaround I'm gonna be
playing<00:00:37.399> in<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:37.670> key<00:00:37.850> of<00:00:37.879> B<00:00:37.969> flat<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.629> listen

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
playing in the key of B flat and listen

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.439 
playing in the key of B flat and listen
in<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.920> demonstration<00:00:40.550> as<00:00:40.760> you<00:00:40.879> can<00:00:41.030> hear<00:00:41.300> the

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
in the demonstration as you can hear the

00:00:41.449 --> 00:01:13.460 
in the demonstration as you can hear the
5<00:00:41.960> chord<00:00:42.289> approaching<00:00:42.710> at<00:00:42.829> bar<00:00:42.980> number<00:00:43.190> 9

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.840 

this<00:01:14.470> look<00:01:14.710> we're<00:01:14.890> gonna<00:01:14.980> use<00:01:15.490> some<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.790> the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
this look we're gonna use some of the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.340 
this look we're gonna use some of the
same<00:01:16.060> things<00:01:16.270> that<00:01:16.330> we<00:01:16.450> did<00:01:16.600> last<00:01:16.810> time<00:01:17.140> but

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
same things that we did last time but

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.170 
same things that we did last time but
this<00:01:17.710> time<00:01:17.770> when<00:01:18.190> we<00:01:18.310> launch<00:01:18.550> into<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.970> really

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
this time when we launch into the really

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.290 
this time when we launch into the really
fast<00:01:19.450> part<00:01:19.780> we're<00:01:20.770> gonna<00:01:20.980> run<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.550> speed<00:01:21.940> all

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
fast part we're gonna run that speed all

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.910 
fast part we're gonna run that speed all
the<00:01:22.540> way<00:01:22.660> up<00:01:22.870> to<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.140> end<00:01:23.320> of<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.530> chorus

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
the way up to the end of the chorus

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.440 
the way up to the end of the chorus
leaving<00:01:24.460> just<00:01:24.670> enough<00:01:24.820> time<00:01:25.150> for<00:01:25.210> our

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
leaving just enough time for our

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.970 
leaving just enough time for our
turnaround<00:01:25.750> so<00:01:26.020> let's<00:01:26.200> look<00:01:26.380> at<00:01:26.530> how<00:01:26.680> we<00:01:26.740> get

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
turnaround so let's look at how we get

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.680 
turnaround so let's look at how we get
into<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:27.400> we<00:01:27.910> start<00:01:28.270> off<00:01:30.300> same<00:01:31.300> way<00:01:31.480> we've

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
into that we start off same way we've

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.600 
into that we start off same way we've
been<00:01:31.720> doing<00:01:31.980> but<00:01:32.980> then<00:01:33.130> we're<00:01:33.280> gonna<00:01:33.370> do<00:01:33.580> a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
been doing but then we're gonna do a

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.180 
been doing but then we're gonna do a
shortened<00:01:34.150> version<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.780> those<00:01:35.260> reverse<00:01:35.860> three

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
shortened version of those reverse three

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.830 
shortened version of those reverse three
note<00:01:36.340> licks<00:01:36.550> we're<00:01:36.700> gonna<00:01:36.820> do<00:01:36.970> one<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.420> B<00:01:39.840> then

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
note licks we're gonna do one on B then

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.070 
note licks we're gonna do one on B then
one<00:01:41.080> on<00:01:42.630> another<00:01:43.630> one<00:01:43.900> on<00:01:44.020> B

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.720 

then<00:01:47.710> we're<00:01:47.830> gonna<00:01:47.920> jump<00:01:48.250> right<00:01:48.310> into<00:01:48.640> our

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
then we're gonna jump right into our

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.219 
then we're gonna jump right into our
hammer-ons<00:01:49.210> we're<00:01:49.330> gonna<00:01:49.420> walk<00:01:49.750> down<00:01:49.990> into

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.800 

ending<00:01:55.009> on<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.130> B<00:01:55.340> string<00:01:55.399> there<00:01:55.880> then<00:01:56.659> we're

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
ending on the B string there then we're

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.370 
ending on the B string there then we're
gonna<00:01:56.899> repeat<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:57.649> lick<00:01:57.950> twice

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.240 

and<00:02:03.159> so<00:02:03.369> we're<00:02:03.490> gonna<00:02:03.580> use<00:02:03.670> those<00:02:04.950> quick<00:02:05.950> notes

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
and so we're gonna use those quick notes

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.210 
and so we're gonna use those quick notes
into<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:06.850> bend<00:02:09.539> kind<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.660> as<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> way<00:02:10.929> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
into that bend kind of as a way to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.030 
into that bend kind of as a way to
signal<00:02:12.220> what's<00:02:13.150> coming<00:02:13.510> next<00:02:13.800> what<00:02:14.800> comes

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
signal what's coming next what comes

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.800 
signal what's coming next what comes
next<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.700> speed<00:02:16.060> which<00:02:16.420> we're<00:02:16.630> going<00:02:16.750> to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
next is the speed which we're going to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.510 
next is the speed which we're going to
use<00:02:17.110> all<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.770> way<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.190> end<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
use all the way to the end of the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.240 
use all the way to the end of the
measure<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.569> here's<00:02:19.780> how<00:02:19.959> we<00:02:20.020> do<00:02:20.319> this<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.160> what

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
measure so here's how we do this is what

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.830 
measure so here's how we do this is what
we<00:02:21.370> do<00:02:21.489> during<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.970> fastest<00:02:22.480> part<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.750> this

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
we do during the fastest part of this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.710 
we do during the fastest part of this
leg<00:02:23.020> we<00:02:23.560> do<00:02:23.739> lick<00:02:23.980> one<00:02:24.190> into<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.000> normal

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
leg we do lick one into the normal

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.320 
leg we do lick one into the normal
hammer<00:02:25.989> ons

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.340 

then<00:02:32.330> we're<00:02:32.420> gonna<00:02:32.510> do<00:02:32.660> almost<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.110> same

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
then we're gonna do almost the same

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.900 
then we're gonna do almost the same
thing<00:02:33.680> we're<00:02:34.070> gonna<00:02:34.190> start<00:02:34.670> like<00:02:34.850> one<00:02:35.030> again

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
thing we're gonna start like one again

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.070 
thing we're gonna start like one again
then<00:02:37.910> we're<00:02:38.030> going<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.180> do<00:02:38.270> the<00:02:38.390> hammer<00:02:38.630> ons<00:02:38.840> in

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
then we're going to do the hammer ons in

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.350 
then we're going to do the hammer ons in
the<00:02:39.170> in<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.560> upper<00:02:39.860> position

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.860 

so<00:02:45.140> again<00:02:45.410> we've<00:02:45.620> added<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.910> what<00:02:47.450> we<00:02:47.570> did

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
so again we've added that to what we did

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.450 
so again we've added that to what we did
the<00:02:48.080> first<00:02:48.110> time<00:02:48.560> with<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.890> speed<00:02:49.130> we've<00:02:49.310> done

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
the first time with the speed we've done

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.030 
the first time with the speed we've done
these<00:02:49.610> back-to-back<00:02:49.940> hammer<00:02:50.630> ons<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:51.680> we're

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
these back-to-back hammer ons so we're

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.940 
these back-to-back hammer ons so we're
almost<00:02:52.310> running<00:02:52.670> out<00:02:52.910> of<00:02:52.940> space<00:02:53.240> in<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.540> bar

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
almost running out of space in the bar

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.830 
almost running out of space in the bar
so<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.010> get<00:02:55.220> us<00:02:55.340> through<00:02:55.610> we're<00:02:56.210> gonna<00:02:56.330> do<00:02:56.600> lick

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
so to get us through we're gonna do lick

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.170 
so to get us through we're gonna do lick
one<00:02:57.050> one<00:02:57.350> more<00:02:57.530> time<00:02:57.590> but<00:02:58.520> we're<00:02:58.640> gonna<00:02:58.730> run<00:02:59.060> it

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
one one more time but we're gonna run it

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180 
one one more time but we're gonna run it
right<00:02:59.480> into<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.840> end<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.320> then<00:03:00.650> just<00:03:00.980> hit<00:03:01.160> a

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
right into the end and then just hit a

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.140 
right into the end and then just hit a
note<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.760> highlight<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.240> turn<00:03:02.450> around<00:03:07.150> okay

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
note to highlight the turn around okay

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.430 
note to highlight the turn around okay
so<00:03:08.420> that's<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.660> kind<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.870> thing<00:03:09.020> that<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.230> do

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
so that's the kind of thing that you do

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.410 
so that's the kind of thing that you do
when<00:03:09.740> you've<00:03:09.920> miscalculated<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:11.030> you've

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
when you've miscalculated and you've

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.380 
when you've miscalculated and you've
played<00:03:12.290> fast<00:03:12.680> way<00:03:12.980> too<00:03:13.040> far<00:03:13.370> into<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.790> bar<00:03:14.000> but

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
played fast way too far into the bar but

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.360 
played fast way too far into the bar but
you<00:03:14.480> still<00:03:14.750> want<00:03:14.960> to<00:03:15.340> acknowledge<00:03:16.340> that

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
you still want to acknowledge that

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.680 
you still want to acknowledge that
you've<00:03:16.670> reached<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.090> end<00:03:17.150> there<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:20.510> way

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
you've reached the end there so that way

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.600 
you've reached the end there so that way
you<00:03:20.750> still<00:03:21.170> fit<00:03:21.590> what<00:03:21.770> you're<00:03:21.920> doing<00:03:22.250> into<00:03:22.520> the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
you still fit what you're doing into the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.340 
you still fit what you're doing into the
progression<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:23.720> let's<00:03:23.930> take<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.200> whole

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
progression so let's take the whole

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.250 
progression so let's take the whole
thing<00:03:24.410> from<00:03:24.680> start<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:25.130> finish<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:26.110> see<00:03:27.110> how

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
thing from start to finish and see how

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.340 
thing from start to finish and see how
all<00:03:27.440> these<00:03:27.590> pieces<00:03:27.830> fit<00:03:28.160> together
