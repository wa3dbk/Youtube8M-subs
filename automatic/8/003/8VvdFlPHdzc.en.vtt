00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.569
 this type of project allows 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.560
 students can go beyond what is inside 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.560
 of the classroom 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:19.000
 the big project seeks to captivate 50 children 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.630
 to the world of literature in new 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.489
 Hamburg 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.619
 in the classic of life literature a 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.239
 great project is a job that we 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.590
 we have developed in partnership 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:30.040
 we call it a project 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.070
 multidisciplinary and had as the beginning the 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.770
 idea English classes of construction 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.610
 from a game the app to devices 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.129
 furniture 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.410
 and then with their idea of ​​creating a 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.790
 game that a character passed through 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.980
 different worlds 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.870
 we came to the conclusion that the book 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.520
 interesting would be the little prince 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.570
 how are we, a river school 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.270
 bilingual 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.820
 we decided to work the version in 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.989
 of the little prince whose original 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.940
 in French 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.280
 before that they could choose 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.500
 what version would they read air 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.439
 the old version the current version 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.380
 some even chose the digital version and 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:11.799
 thereafter they then created a 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.840
 text that was the story wanted then 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.569
 go through this game because there at the beginning 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.009
 the idea came from the game that was 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.530
 proposed english class 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.899
 from then on that which instigates them 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.329
 to play is that we were building the 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.329
 elements of the game together they have decided 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.969
 by all parties who construct this 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:35.709
 game and from then on we went 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:38.319
 making connections between the game and 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:40.959
 story of the little prince so they 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.670
 history has created the character who 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:45.069
 by different planets that will 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.619
 experiencing different adventures and 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.709
 reading result arrived at this 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.740
 which was a re-reading of what 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:54.110
 they 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.299
 they were story strife while working 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.310
 small prince different traditions and 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.689
 carolina platforms broadens 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.790
 possibilities for reading and 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.930
 interpretation of their students 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.300
 I think a book should not be just for 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.009
 example it has inside so it has to 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.319
 reflect on what is written there 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.630
 are reflecting will not be a book 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.180
 good you become eternally responsible 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.849
 for what you captivate because I think 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.849
 that this project captivated students of 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.860
 a very intense form because they 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.110
 became very involved not only with the 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.630

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.299
 We were talking and talking. 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.510
 understanding as the final result 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.650
 that it will be a game that they will be the
