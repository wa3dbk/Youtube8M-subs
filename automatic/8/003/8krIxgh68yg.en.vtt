results you know these really aren't new
concepts<00:00:12.210> but<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:13.190> think<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> definition

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
concepts but I think the definition

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.430 
concepts but I think the definition
around<00:00:15.059> them<00:00:15.210> are<00:00:15.330> changing<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.960> very

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
around them are changing in very

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.250 
around them are changing in very
dramatic<00:00:16.920> ways<00:00:17.180> for<00:00:18.180> years<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.990> far<00:00:19.230> too

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
dramatic ways for years and in far too

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.830 
dramatic ways for years and in far too
many<00:00:19.410> organizations<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.670> cios<00:00:21.330> agenda<00:00:21.689> was

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
many organizations the cios agenda was

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.890 
many organizations the cios agenda was
focused<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.320> cost<00:00:22.680> reduction<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.900> results

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
focused on cost reduction and results

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.500 
focused on cost reduction and results
were<00:00:25.250> measured<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.430> terms<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:27.000> stable

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
were measured in terms of stable

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.300 
were measured in terms of stable
production<00:00:27.840> services<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.619> system

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310

availability<00:00:29.820> but<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.810> reality<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.529> today

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
availability but the reality is today

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.160 
availability but the reality is today
these<00:00:32.430> things<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:32.969> simply<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.870> price

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
these things are simply the the price

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.100 
these things are simply the the price
for<00:00:34.550> getting<00:00:35.550> into<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> game<00:00:36.090> they<00:00:36.780> offer<00:00:36.930> no

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
for getting into the game they offer no

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
for getting into the game they offer no
competitive<00:00:37.829> advantage<00:00:38.370> or<00:00:38.579> no

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
competitive advantage or no

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.780 
competitive advantage or no
differentiation<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.950> we're<00:00:41.100> that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
differentiation I think that we're that

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.010 
differentiation I think that we're that
we're<00:00:41.969> at<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.230> point<00:00:43.230> where<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:45.270> demands<00:00:45.690> being

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
we're at a point where the demands being

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.720 
we're at a point where the demands being
placed<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> CIO<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> change

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
placed on the CIO are going to change

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.510 
placed on the CIO are going to change
and<00:00:48.239> change<00:00:48.539> dramatically<00:00:49.260> we're<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
and change dramatically we're going to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.330 
and change dramatically we're going to
see<00:00:50.760> CIOs<00:00:51.390> asked<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:52.050> more<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:53.010> deliver

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
see CIOs asked to do more to deliver

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.490 
see CIOs asked to do more to deliver

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
presentation today is the IT

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
presentation today is the IT
transformation<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.600> Applied<00:01:28.259> Materials<00:01:28.640> not

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
transformation of Applied Materials not

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.770 
transformation of Applied Materials not
just<00:01:29.909> changing<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.930> IT<00:01:31.439> organization<00:01:31.759> but

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
just changing the IT organization but

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.429 
just changing the IT organization but
transformation<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> business

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
transformation of the business

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
transformation of the business
enterprise<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.369> believe<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
enterprise I believe that's the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
enterprise I believe that's the
challenge<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> opportunity<00:01:37.430> facing

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
challenge and the opportunity facing

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.270 
challenge and the opportunity facing
today's<00:01:38.729> CIOs<00:01:39.439> but<00:01:40.439> before<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.860> into<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
today's CIOs but before I get into the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.889 
today's CIOs but before I get into the
specifics<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> transformation<00:01:42.540> at

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
specifics of the transformation at

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.359 
specifics of the transformation at
applied<00:01:43.140> materials<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.130> to

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
applied materials I really like to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.399 
applied materials I really like to
provide<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.299> little<00:01:45.479> background<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:46.020> who<00:01:46.259> we

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
provide a little background on who we

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.990 
provide a little background on who we
are<00:01:48.710> applied<00:01:49.710> materials<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> global<00:01:50.880> leader

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
are applied materials is a global leader

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.289 
are applied materials is a global leader
and<00:01:51.329> nano<00:01:51.780> manufacturing<00:01:52.399> we<00:01:53.399> first<00:01:53.909> applied

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and nano manufacturing we first applied

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.450 
and nano manufacturing we first applied
these<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.540> breakthrough<00:01:54.960> technologies<00:01:55.920> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
these a breakthrough technologies to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.520 
these a breakthrough technologies to
dramatically<00:01:57.180> reducing<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> cost<00:01:58.290> per

dramatically reducing the cost per

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.980 
dramatically reducing the cost per

so in the IT governance realm we

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.110 
so in the IT governance realm we
