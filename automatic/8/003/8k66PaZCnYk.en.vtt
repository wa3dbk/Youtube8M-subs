guys<00:03:51.500> well<00:03:51.799> that's<00:03:51.979> the<00:03:52.220> very<00:03:52.459> simple<00:03:52.879> setup

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
guys well that's the very simple setup

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.990 
guys well that's the very simple setup
to<00:03:53.389> defeat<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.900> very<00:03:54.259> powerful<00:03:55.099> setup<00:03:55.519> of<00:03:55.669> the

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
to defeat the very powerful setup of the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.569 
to defeat the very powerful setup of the
trophy<00:03:56.449> system<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.139> sentry<00:03:57.709> gun<00:03:57.889> used<00:03:58.340> in

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
trophy system and sentry gun used in

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.369 
trophy system and sentry gun used in
just<00:03:58.849> about<00:03:59.090> every<00:03:59.479> competitive<00:03:59.959> match<00:04:00.139> that

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
just about every competitive match that

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.409 
just about every competitive match that
you<00:04:00.470> see<00:04:00.709> it's<00:04:00.979> very<00:04:01.459> powerful<00:04:01.699> but<00:04:02.150> like<00:04:02.269> I

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
you see it's very powerful but like I

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.449 
you see it's very powerful but like I
said<00:04:02.479> there's<00:04:02.900> just<00:04:03.109> a<00:04:03.229> very<00:04:03.470> simple<00:04:03.739> solution

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
said there's just a very simple solution

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.339 
said there's just a very simple solution
to<00:04:04.489> deal<00:04:04.759> with<00:04:04.939> it<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:05.120> I'm<00:04:05.810> not<00:04:06.049> really<00:04:06.109> sure

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
to deal with it so I'm not really sure

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.990 
to deal with it so I'm not really sure
why<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.709> took<00:04:06.889> people<00:04:07.099> such<00:04:07.489> a<00:04:07.519> long<00:04:07.759> time<00:04:07.970> to

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
why it took people such a long time to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.909 
why it took people such a long time to
catch<00:04:08.269> on<00:04:08.449> to<00:04:08.479> it<00:04:08.659> maybe<00:04:09.199> it's<00:04:09.409> because<00:04:09.560> I<00:04:09.739> play

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
catch on to it maybe it's because I play

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.129 
catch on to it maybe it's because I play
a<00:04:10.129> ton<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.459> pubs<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.269> actually<00:04:11.479> do<00:04:11.900> see

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
a ton of pubs and you actually do see

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.199 
a ton of pubs and you actually do see
people<00:04:12.470> use<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.829> black<00:04:13.009> hat<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.250> lot<00:04:13.459> so<00:04:13.729> I<00:04:13.939> know

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
people use the black hat a lot so I know

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.909 
people use the black hat a lot so I know
I<00:04:14.299> kind<00:04:14.599> of<00:04:14.629> think<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.900> come<00:04:15.049> or<00:04:15.530> competitive

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
I kind of think that come or competitive

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.499 
I kind of think that come or competitive
players<00:04:16.159> should<00:04:16.370> play<00:04:16.549> pubs<00:04:16.789> because<00:04:17.359> you

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:17.509 
players should play pubs because you

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.509 
players should play pubs because you
really<00:04:17.780> do<00:04:17.959> learn<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.440> lot<00:04:18.769> more<00:04:19.009> about<00:04:19.220> the
