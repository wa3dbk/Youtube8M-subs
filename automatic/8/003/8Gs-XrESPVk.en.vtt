 from netflix or wherever my videos 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.739
 to have any problem with delay 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.750
 to get someone to prove is the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.720
 use of gestures that has been implemented with 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.799
 lassad 7.7 let's suppose I want 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.760
 move this clock to another page 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.769
 just grabbed it and moved the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.290
 tablet side by side automatically 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.230
 the pages back changes and I can leave 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.390
 the clock on the page you want too 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.390
 it works in what is the browser 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.000
 as you can see text also small 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.430
 you can not read very well we're 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.650
 used to clicking the screen to 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.090
 to get bigger with this 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.830
 technology that is using seam are 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.400
 you just squeeze two fingers the 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.170
 screen 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.080
 and you move it for kant and back 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.420
 and second larger or tiny 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.360
 what I tell them is something that 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.910
 I found it easier to do this than 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.700
 move your hand and click on the screen and 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.920
 I do well useful and it's a technology that 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.120
 I think we 're going to see in all the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.830
 tablets that go to the market of 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.140
 forward another thing would be to speak a 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.430
 momentary though in the unboxing the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.110
 mentions that this tablet also with the 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.380
 ability to be used as a control 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.560
 remote and end up with three very useful there 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.940
 that demonstrate a moment how it works 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.040
 or what the application looks like is the 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.860
 application is called smart we see when 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.320
 they open them 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.640
 this is the screen that you are going to see 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.150

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.280
