00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.950 
you off here with the military-grade GPS
that's<00:02:02.790> much<00:02:03.000> different<00:02:03.210> than<00:02:03.540> my<00:02:03.630> car<00:02:03.869> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that's much different than my car a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.899 
that's much different than my car a
little<00:02:04.140> bit<00:02:04.259> different<00:02:04.470> than<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.909> these

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
little bit different than that these

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.730 
little bit different than that these
will<00:02:06.150> actually<00:02:06.299> allow<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.320> down<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
will actually allow you to get down to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.319 
will actually allow you to get down to
the<00:02:07.920> exact<00:02:08.399> spot<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:08.910> earth<00:02:08.940> where<00:02:09.299> you

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.329 
the exact spot on the earth where you

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.060 
the exact spot on the earth where you
are<00:02:09.570> there's<00:02:09.810> no<00:02:09.959> fudge<00:02:10.200> factor<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.890> this

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
are there's no fudge factor in that this

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.759 
are there's no fudge factor in that this
is<00:02:11.250> our<00:02:11.459> latest<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.209> greatest<00:02:12.530> computer<00:02:13.530> here

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
is our latest and greatest computer here

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.110 
is our latest and greatest computer here
it<00:02:14.130> will<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.579> everything<00:02:15.000> that

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
it will do everything that

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.809 
it will do everything that
this<00:02:16.540> big<00:02:16.810> guy<00:02:16.840> here<00:02:17.290> will<00:02:17.470> do<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:18.310> it's<00:02:18.549> about

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
this big guy here will do but it's about

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.850 
this big guy here will do but it's about
a<00:02:18.879> third<00:02:19.239> of<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.420> size<00:02:19.599> this<00:02:20.019> basically<00:02:20.530> hooks

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
a third of the size this basically hooks

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.369 
a third of the size this basically hooks
up<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.099> another<00:02:21.730> radio<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.450> we<00:02:22.810> can<00:02:22.959> use<00:02:23.140> this

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
up to another radio and we can use this

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.080 
up to another radio and we can use this
and<00:02:23.680> back<00:02:23.799> weather<00:02:24.040> observations<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.879> kind

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
and back weather observations that kind

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.940 
and back weather observations that kind
of<00:02:25.150> thing<00:02:25.330> this<00:02:25.629> is<00:02:25.780> our<00:02:25.930> laser<00:02:26.200> rangefinder

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
of thing this is our laser rangefinder

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.820 
of thing this is our laser rangefinder
it<00:02:27.340> actually<00:02:27.849> will<00:02:28.450> send<00:02:28.840> out<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.019> laser<00:02:29.500> beam

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
it actually will send out a laser beam

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.009 
it actually will send out a laser beam
and<00:02:30.069> you<00:02:30.849> just<00:02:31.209> look<00:02:31.420> through<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.659> just<00:02:31.840> like<00:02:31.989> a

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
and you just look through it just like a

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.569 
and you just look through it just like a
pair<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.319> regular<00:02:32.560> binoculars<00:02:33.220> hit<00:02:33.489> the

pair of regular binoculars hit the

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.520 
pair of regular binoculars hit the
button<00:02:33.909> and<00:02:34.060> it'll<00:02:34.720> tell<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.019> how<00:02:35.049> far<00:02:35.500> away

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
button and it'll tell you how far away

something<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.250> one<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.849> things<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.209> we

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
something is one of the things that we

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.660 
something is one of the things that we
as<00:02:37.540> weather<00:02:37.750> guys<00:02:37.989> use<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.379> as<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.890> if<00:02:39.280> we<00:02:39.489> have

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
as weather guys use it as is if we have

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.009 
as weather guys use it as is if we have
clouds<00:02:39.970> in<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.299> sky<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.690> we<00:02:40.750> don't<00:02:40.930> know

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
clouds in the sky and we don't know

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.130 
clouds in the sky and we don't know
exactly<00:02:41.470> how<00:02:41.790> high<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.849> up<00:02:43.150> they<00:02:43.360> are<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.959> can

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
exactly how high the up they are you can

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.809 
exactly how high the up they are you can
actually<00:02:44.560> look<00:02:45.190> through<00:02:45.400> here

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
actually look through here

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.300 
actually look through here
hit<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.540> button<00:02:47.049> bounce<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.739> off<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.190> it'll

for<00:04:58.750> us<00:04:58.870> is<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.289> it<00:04:59.650> can<00:04:59.830> give<00:04:59.949> us<00:04:59.979> winds

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
for us is that it can give us winds

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.900 
for us is that it can give us winds
temperature<00:05:01.930> pressure<00:05:02.440> all<00:05:03.190> from<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.610> safety

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
small camera is mounted on it so it also

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.080 
small camera is mounted on it so it also
acts<00:05:08.259> as<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.560> for<00:05:08.919> reconnaissance<00:05:09.250> element<00:05:09.940> for

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
us before we send out our guys so we

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.290 
us before we send out our guys so we
sent<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.430> little<00:05:12.610> bird<00:05:12.789> up<00:05:12.940> there<00:05:12.970> without
