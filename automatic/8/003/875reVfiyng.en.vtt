00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:16.499
 I should never have been thrown into this stupid adventure. 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.459
 It would be better if I gave the bear a bear trap. 

00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:21.499
 You call that nice hat? 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.708
 Red, come on! 

00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:06.167
 Watch the dynamite. 

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:08.499
 They're going to an explosive factory. 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.541
 Ah! 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.917
 Haha. 

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:27.125
 Fuck, we did it! 

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.209
 And we're out to sea! 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:30.167
 What are you talking about? 

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:32.833
 The waves are dragging us out! 

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:33.459
 Yes, yes! 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.958
 The Bermuda Triangle, we're coming! 

00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.750
 What will we do then? 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.417
 I do not know. 

00:01:38.417 --> 00:01:41.334
 But at least we have sushi. 

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:42.708
 Ah! 

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:43.958
 See you in Japan! 

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.499
 You stink! 

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.708
 Rowing kayak trip! 

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:53.499
 The Vuhu! 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:54.125
 Could you shut up? 

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:56.250
 I don't know if you realize, 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.541
 ... We are. 

00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:58.917
 I think it's called "good." 

00:01:58.917 --> 00:01:59.499
 It's not funny! 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:00.791
 With a stupid sword ... 

00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:03.083
 We're in the middle and we're gonna die here ... 

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:04.083
 ... I'm gonna miss Pink's birthday! 

00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:05.500
 Why are you doing all these crazies for him ... 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.167
 I don't understand. 

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:07.541
 Who cares? 

00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:08.791
 She's a girl! 

00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:11.417
 I'm in love with her, okay? 

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:12.292
 That's why! 

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:14.958
 What does this mean? 

00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:18.583
 Wait, you really don't know what love means? 

00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:19.375
 Of course you don't know. 

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:21.750
 It's a feeling that you feel when you see someone. 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.459
 In the depths of your heart begins to strike ... 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.499
 ... you'il feel very happy. 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.917
 She's the most powerful and wonderful ... 

00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:30.499
 ... one of the emotions. 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:31.917
 You mean the bar lifting? 

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:32.417
 No! 

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:33.791
 Dude, I'm in love all day, then. 

00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:35.042
 You're a total idiot! 

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:36.499
 I don't do that to get up. 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.334
 I just need to go online and look at your mom's photos. 

00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:39.708
 Shut up! 

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:43.292
 I'm doing this because I think she likes me. 

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:44.499
 Oh, no, man. 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:45.250
 He likes me. 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.083
 What? 

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:46.500
 Yeah, man. 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.125
 She's always throwing me this dirty look. 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:50.459
 Because he hates you! 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.666
 Red, every girl in the world is super cool ... 

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:54.334
 ... doesn't think she's hot. 

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:54.791
 Yeah, they think so. 

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:56.958
 I beat all the bullies in the daytime in the kindergarten ... 

00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:57.625
 ... do you think? 

00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:59.499
 To save my life. 

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:03.499
 What? 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:03.750
 No. 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.750
 Dude, I was trying to impress all those girls. 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.292
 What? 

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:09.042
 Yeah, it worked. 

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:10.875
 You beat me up, you embarrassed me, my ex-girlfriends ... 

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:14.042
 ... fucked, fucked my bed, stole my stuff, my food ... 

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:15.209
 You ate and took my money for years! 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.708
 The whole time I thought you were my friend ... 

00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:21.500
 I've been friends with you for ...! 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.292
 Wow, you must feel pretty stupid. 

00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:26.499
 Fuck you! 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:27.917
 Ah! 

00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:32.499
 You're such a jerk! 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.833
 That he made me think we were friends ... 

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:34.791
 ...I cant believe! 

00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:37.334
 If you weren't a fucking loser ... 

00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:41.375
 ... maybe we could be friends! 

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:42.334
 I'm loser? 

00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:44.833
 I got you looking at Animal Planet and masturbating! 

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:46.499
 He was a one-time! 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:50.500
 You're doing racism against the elephants! 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.499
 20 fucking years with you ... 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.125
 ... I can't believe I'm stuck! 

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:56.499
 I'm not your friend anymore! 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:57.167
 Beautiful! 

00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:58.499
 You're not mine! 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:03:59.000
 Great! 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.541
 Excellent! 

00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:00.459
 Good. 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.791
 I'm glad! 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
