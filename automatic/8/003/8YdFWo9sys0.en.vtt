this is an LS a motor which why don't
you<00:00:55.199> give<00:00:55.350> us<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.710> little<00:00:55.860> more<00:00:55.949> info<00:00:56.370> about

you give us a little more info about

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.729 
you give us a little more info about
that<00:00:56.760> motor<00:00:56.969> sure<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> LSA<00:00:58.199> motor<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.590> the

that motor sure the LSA motor is the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.000 
that motor sure the LSA motor is the
sister<00:00:59.190> motor<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.730> zr1<00:01:00.480> corvette<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> C<00:01:01.590> is

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
sister motor to the zr1 corvette it C is

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.460 
sister motor to the zr1 corvette it C is
a<00:01:02.190> Cadillac<00:01:02.730> equivalent<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:04.350> less

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
a Cadillac equivalent it's a little less

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.679 
a Cadillac equivalent it's a little less
boost<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.220> little<00:01:05.519> less<00:01:05.610> horsepower<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.450> fix

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
boost so little less horsepower we fix

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.730 
boost so little less horsepower we fix
that<00:01:06.869> problem<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.229> took<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> motor<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that problem we took the motor to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
that problem we took the motor to
hennessey<00:01:08.010> performance<00:01:08.960> we're<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.170> be

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
hennessey performance we're going to be

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.320 
hennessey performance we're going to be
running<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.740> little<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.220> boost<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> 001

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
running a little more boost in the 001

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
running a little more boost in the 001
runs<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> we're<00:01:13.740> expecting<00:01:13.890> around<00:01:14.250> 600

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
runs so we're expecting around 600

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
runs so we're expecting around 600
horsepower<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.659> rear<00:01:16.110> tire<00:01:16.409> 600<00:01:16.890> pound

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
horsepower at the rear tire 600 pound

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.149 
horsepower at the rear tire 600 pound
feet<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.220> torque<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.420> obviously

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
feet of torque now this is obviously

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.859 
feet of torque now this is obviously
unproven<00:01:20.159> chassis<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.090> guys<00:01:21.210> really

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
unproven chassis but you guys really

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.810 
unproven chassis but you guys really
made<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.680> old<00:01:22.979> Corvette<00:01:23.400> work<00:01:23.610> well

what kind of you know pumps are you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.999 
what kind of you know pumps are you
looking<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.030> over<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.140> what's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
looking to get over and you know what's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.980 
looking to get over and you know what's
your<00:01:29.159> biggest<00:01:29.720> difficulty<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> you're

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.280 
looking to face with this car much much
like<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> Corvette<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> think<00:01:33.869> weights<00:01:34.110> going

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
like the Corvette I think weights going

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.020 
like the Corvette I think weights going
to<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.439> an<00:01:34.500> issue<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.850> very

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
to be an issue you know it's a very

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
to be an issue you know it's a very
heavy<00:01:36.210> car<00:01:36.450> from<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> factory<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.829> far<00:01:38.070> as

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
heavy car from the factory as far as

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
heavy car from the factory as far as
getting<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> handling<00:01:38.850> sorted<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.360> think
