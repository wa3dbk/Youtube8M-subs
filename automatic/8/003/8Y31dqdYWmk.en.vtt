school if they can see how important
that<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.630> actually<00:01:09.810> foster<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.530> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that is and can actually foster it in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.350 
that is and can actually foster it in
their<00:01:10.799> children<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:11.760> they're<00:01:11.909> gonna<00:01:12.060> give

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
their children then they're gonna give

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.200 
their children then they're gonna give
their<00:01:12.570> kids<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.990> leg<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.820> really<00:01:14.820> becoming

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
their kids a leg up and really becoming

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.450 
their kids a leg up and really becoming
successful<00:01:15.560> contributing<00:01:16.560> adults<00:01:16.680> part<00:01:17.340> of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
successful contributing adults part of

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.609 
successful contributing adults part of
literacy<00:01:17.909> now<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.270> how<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> use<00:01:18.689> technology<00:01:19.350> so

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
literacy now is how to use technology so

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.649 
literacy now is how to use technology so
that's<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.040> component<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.240> think<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that's one component of this I think the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.620 
that's one component of this I think the
e-readers<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:23.369> useful<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
e-readers are really useful in the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.530 
e-readers are really useful in the
literacy<00:01:24.960> events<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.850> focus

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
literacy events because they do focus

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.499 
literacy events because they do focus
primarily<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:28.229> reading<00:01:29.130> books<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.299> there's

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
primarily on reading books so there's

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.630 
primarily on reading books so there's
not<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.750> lot<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.079> other<00:01:31.350> distractions<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:32.400> there

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
not a lot of other distractions on there

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.920 
not a lot of other distractions on there
it<00:01:32.820> doesn't<00:01:33.090> feel<00:01:33.180> overwhelming<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.869> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
it doesn't feel overwhelming that you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.160 
it doesn't feel overwhelming that you
have<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.790> stack<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.000> pages<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
have a stack of pages that you have to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.440 
have a stack of pages that you have to
get<00:01:37.320> through<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.520> great<00:01:38.700> tool<00:01:39.060> so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
get through it's a really great tool so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420 
get through it's a really great tool so
that<00:01:39.479> they<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.930> make<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> font<00:01:40.500> larger<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that they can make the font larger and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.999 
that they can make the font larger and
define<00:01:42.299> words<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:43.079> go<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> build<00:01:43.799> their

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
define words as they go and build their

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.920 
define words as they go and build their
children's<00:01:44.430> vocabulary<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.420> would<00:01:45.630> encourage

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
children's vocabulary I would encourage

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.440 
children's vocabulary I would encourage
any<00:01:46.350> PTA<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.829> put<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.189> event<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.909> easy

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
any PTA to put this event on it's easy
