00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
throughout my experiences and I guess it

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.559 
throughout my experiences and I guess it
is<00:02:41.010> for<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.340> better<00:02:41.489> because<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:42.269> know<00:02:42.360> if<00:02:42.450> I

time for something that you care about

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.790 
time for something that you care about
so<00:05:11.590> like<00:05:12.040> for<00:05:12.220> example<00:05:12.310> with<00:05:13.300> your<00:05:13.570> family<00:05:14.230> he

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
so like for example with your family he

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.560 
so like for example with your family he
believes<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:15.580> believe<00:05:15.880> this<00:05:16.000> as<00:05:16.150> well<00:05:16.360> that

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
believes and I believe this as well that

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.450 
believes and I believe this as well that
you<00:05:16.600> can<00:05:16.810> always<00:05:17.110> find<00:05:17.350> time<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:18.040> spend<00:05:18.160> time

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.430 
you can always find time to spend time
with<00:05:18.520> your<00:05:18.730> family<00:05:18.790> even<00:05:19.750> if<00:05:19.870> you're<00:05:20.020> so<00:05:20.260> busy

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440
