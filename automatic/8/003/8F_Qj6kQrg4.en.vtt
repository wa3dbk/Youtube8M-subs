00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.990
 WOV and we continue with you in this lesson 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.710
 conception tools knowing editing 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.319
 the first tool that we are with you 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:16.139
 consider this blur tool 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.279
 that is, it is essentially the same as blurry 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.249
 only one more point sold 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.289
 tool 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.069
 which i can apply 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:26.759
 specific area 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.929
 but nail the lead 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.929
 let's bring a portrait 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.730
 girls and choose a fom portrait and 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.920
 example you want to blur your hair then 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.820
 there is to make this hair structure a little 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.200
 almost disappeared 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.530
 we call 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.260
 here we had 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.710
 photo exhibition is obtained 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.030
 i.e 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 the structure disappeared hair blurred 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.710
 Further 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.950
 tool sharpness on the contrary add 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.900
 sharpness 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.620
 for example you want to add childishness on 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 the choice 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.820
 we just spend a few times and lips 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.490
 getting sharper 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.200
 here we had 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.200
 so here we have turned 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.180
 here you can again 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120
 as in past instruments 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.640
 adjust the size 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.659
 the form is and the softness of the edges and so on and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.000
 intensity 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.870
 i.e. open exposure 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.540
 next tool 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.840
 finger 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.110
 useful to correct which 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.620
 that ohh cornet and 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.470
 premiere can 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.440
 to fix 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.280
 nose shape 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 if neat 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.570
 very useful 5 tools if they 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.570
 to use 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.910
 here we had it 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.620
 that's what he doubts he gives 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.509
 flour 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:17.349
 allows us either 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.590
 discolor or vice versa adds 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.129
 light and our images 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.919
 bleaching examples if 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.349
 estate intensity is one hundred percent what 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.329
 he will just make images 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.959
 black and white 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.090
 and they say the attack is carried out and it turns out that the crown 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.090
 deed than budget 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.879
 me intensity would with this exposure then 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.479
 there we are just slightly in this case at 50 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.479
 percent and over 20 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:55.789
 Further 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.799
 saturation on the contrary adds light 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.769
 That is, it is clear if you think that 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.499
 our images are missing she 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.259
 colors you can just take this 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:08.150
 tool 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.519
 and add 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.519
 on colors using it 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.389
 further tools and which 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.389
 our lighting is called 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.609
 allows us to point 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.339
 dedicate some objects that we 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.289
 how 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:32.289
 shine accordingly 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:36.839
 so here we have turned 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.829
 here was such 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.779
 there is a range here that is we can 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:42.849
 lighten the shadows the average price and 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.759
 accordingly holy if we 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.759
 choose those of him that we had will 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.599
 if we choose medium tones 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.009
 that is, those who will be completely 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.009
 other 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.399
 here in general so how would 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:02.459
 advice 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.779
 percentage of kenya 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.629
 we'll drop shadows again adjusting 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.469
 degrees of impact she appreciates this 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:10.520
 us all that 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.829
 concerns 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.389
 egg prices background and so on 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.680
 if that is the lightest areas 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.709
 images are usually the sun and other 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.959
 leave the plots 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.639
 next next tool 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.130
 dimming the opposite 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.880
 side by anton allows just 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.880
 shade images selectively 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.599
 here we had 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.599
 that's what we did 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:40.940
 same 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.780
 what's in the previous cinema tool 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.800
 construction sites 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.139
 further red-eye donation but itâ€™s understandable here 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.029
 Duma 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:48.589
 if you have a nuance of red eyes 

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:50.979
 just click on the matches and all that 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.199
 automatically do 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.479
 as the next tool 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.259
 dot collection 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:59.650
 works 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.509
 for me in a strange way 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.349
 so don't dwell on it 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:04.680
 I will 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.780
 perfectly 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.850
 incapable of any logic 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.879
 tool 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.849
 but most likely because there 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.279
 works completely different 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:16.979
 yes and bloat 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.080
 if you want to fix loans 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.490
 forms who is it 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.490
 Istomin will be useful to you 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.189
 I think it is clear 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:28.789
 inflate images and 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.509
 opposite tool 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.229
 vice versa 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.229
 reduces everything to one point 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.530
 further cage tools 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.650
 choose there will be light on the image 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.830
 in this case it adds the palette 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.580
 and then it is the color you can use 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.169
 example tire tying 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:51.710
 that is, after all, those grew to the network 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.020
 brilliant red light example 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.580
 carry color and flower 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.289
 well just pick a pipette click it 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.639
 of images 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.639
 and then the jack grow as you need 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.460
 following families text 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.699
 I think everyone clearly add text 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:12.129
 any definite any 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.830
 choose to sew size style color 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.499
 and 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:18.859
 add inscriptions to your images like 

00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:21.859
 whatever 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.259
 the next arm segment 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:27.759
 allows us to move 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.430
 images just pinch 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.300
 move the same as 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.639
 we will she 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.710
 navigator 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.710
 it is more convenient to use it 

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:43.610
 just holding down the spacebar 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.719
 with any tool like that 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:46.490
 City 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.199
 clamp and space key 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.379
 and move the same as with 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.379
 mysterious how much 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.159
 and the latest cement 

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:00.009
 this is a magnifier tool allowing you to run 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:01.960
 Yes, and removes 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.470
 but what do our images push 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.809
 6 distance away 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:08.149
 we lower 

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.649
 approaching 

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:13.559
 and the last part is the choice 

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:15.569
 here I think it is clear if you want 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.369
 paint or fill background percent 

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:20.039
 some part of the image 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.289
 open up 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:23.659
 choose need light 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:26.729
 either from the palette 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:29.909
 either from the plot and so on and so forth 

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:32.909
 But you also need to choose a shade 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.840
 how does that circle mean it in which you 

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.110
 can choose any shade 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.330
 further along the channels of the massacre you can 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.089
 choose any shade 

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:45.039
 protocol requires 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:47.009
 just choosing 

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:49.319
 or both bookmarks and images 

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:51.610
 here he takes all the colors 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.370
 which on the image congress and 

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.840
 lays out them she component that is 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.949
 these are the kent of which our 

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:00.129
 images you can choose any of them and 

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:03.559
 further use 

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:06.139
 on this all the more detail with cement 

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:08.269
 We will consider specific lessons 

00:08:08.269 --> 00:08:10.080
 on specific examples 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.339
 see you 

00:08:11.339 --> 00:08:14.429
 on site online photoshop.com all for now
