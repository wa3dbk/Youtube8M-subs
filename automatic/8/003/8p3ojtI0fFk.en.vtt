 subscribers and viewers of my channel me 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.310
 name is Valdai all look at him 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.539
 extraordinary unscheduled podcast which 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.119
 also happened dedicated to some 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.029
 sad news channel and the thing is 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.650
 that yesterday I found how much but after 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 work in the evening, I saw that I have you to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.070
 opinion of copyright infringement later 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.780
 in such red text itself 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.059
 it is written that when we write pressure 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.340
 read more that a certain studio with 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.430
 beer is a certain super company knows about 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.640
 record label in germany filed 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.440
 on me on my channel strike for 12 series 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.989
 from mafia 2 called 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.910
 damn irish in the moment video 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.280
 with this will be reno although on our website and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.230
 You can still watch it but the essence 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.600
 is not that the bottom line is that no shorter 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.329
 got to the bottom of me something that I have on 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.280
 the ninth minute of the video will leave some 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.890
 composition of music well that is how 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.450
 part of the gameplay of the game is protection on 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.020
 radio stations when the main character goes 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.650
 car there somewhere here and so on and 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.869
 own for that musical 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.320
 songs got it dug out to me 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.000
 strike 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.229
 shorter copyright strike the only thing 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.909
 choose the line of this food opinion 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.009
 violation of rights which is registered by itself 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.530
 imposing some kind of fine on the channel 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.610
 some functions cut into it but 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.140
 moments not like have a blade 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.130
 almost all the functions we 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.470
 let's talk more 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.790
 but the fact is that I already understood the appeal 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.380
 your affiliate program ie 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.860
 principle try to get problem 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.060
 I will try to strike me off 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.250
 in advance but not the fact that they will receive 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.770
 about 50 to 50 chance because the music 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.590
 offer them flies she in the game me in 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.659
 my vidos sounded and in theory 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.689
 there's nothing you can do but still 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.130
 let's cross the cams and we will be sick 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.470
 for me, I would hope that everything will work out 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.540
 successful here as for the functions 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.430
 channel that I had cut it 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.259
 for example the most important function is more 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.770
 long videos that is now channel bye 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.289
 I have 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.700
 wait strike is not worth it if 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:07.320
 appeal we will not take into consideration 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.879
 until February 15, 2016 that is, half a year 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.670
 will hang us on the strike channel and 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.650
 if we do not consider the operation within 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.080
 half a year can't blow to the canal 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.420
 pain long videos i.e. more than 20 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.099
 minutes so that as it was in the moment 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.870
 consideration of the appeal you in the future 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.819
 if it does not approve it to us 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.019
 will get large such variable format 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.030
 the channel that is now the videos will be 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.280
 leave no longer than 15 minutes because 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.290
 just no longer yet 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.700
 it's a strike to release long videos 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.739
 videos so i think i will 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.950
 shoot the series as usual in his 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.420
 standard format 30-45 minutes but with 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.890
 this will divide them into pieces and let 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.049
 type instead of one series there are two or three 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.760
 short for 15 minutes is obtained such 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.380
 the thread points because just 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.670
 in a different way yet not like the type of opinion 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.340
 in for rent work differently therefore 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.049
 have to do so further what else was 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.329
 truncated external annotations in principle this 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.610
 I don’t give a damn good name 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.170
 when there you type there also 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.910
 go to our website and throw a link to 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.190
 externally some source on our site 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.989
 outwardly yes it is me that is this principle 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.170
 feature I especially did not need, I particularly 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.700
 not worried that she cut down here but what 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.889
 very interesting that even in settings 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.030
 Arizona Privacy Function 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.230
 There is this precisely the function that 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.720
 allowed me to shoot in advance 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.639
 videos for you up for viewers 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.230
 in advance we will allow to flood them on the channel 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:21.120
 season night poured put that 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.239
 retired here and then later 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.850
 quietly you sign them there 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.930
 add annotations to them there 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.579
 stand on a timer and automatically they 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.840
 published in due time now 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.700
 this is not the case now all the videos 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.799
 cowardly forest channel is already published 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.780
 for you open access that is other 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.000
 words make it easier to schedule 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.620
 Sorry that is when I am honest now 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.690
 saying I don’t know how to do it 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.069
 just hitting the canal once a day 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.010
 immediately a pack of 15 minute videos 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.510
 actually will try to am but you 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.090
 should be parked for maintenance 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.519
 see them watch basically as a matter of fact 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.079
 by the amount of time that will be 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.730
 give channel nothing changes if 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.160
 I will also try to lower two 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.840
 half hour or there 40-minute series in 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.370
 the day will just really be divided into 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.680
 parts and now they will most likely come out 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.989
 not scheduled or was 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.939
 before 9 am and 6 pm to Moscow 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.400
 Moscow time on when 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.260
 it will turn out because before the Knox is gone 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.489
 will not manage to surrender in advance so that they 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.650
 hung on the canal waiting in the wings 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.970
 went out on time at the feast just when they 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.310
 do not fill immediately published 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.690
 automatic men such are the cases here 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.039
 here is the sad news actually wanted 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.840
 tell you because anyway 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.759
 this is on the next such global and 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.940
 certainly not a very nice change 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.770
 where the channel and until this issue is resolved 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.020
 that is to say either before February 15, 1020 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.699
 either during the day come on for 10 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.590
 days since the filing of the appeal I fell off 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.690
 just today at the time of recording 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.160
 podcast 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.099
 here actually will be on the channel such here 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.289
 small changes in output format 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.419
 video in time and duration 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.680
 video yes and when we will go 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.270
 can now go away when i have 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.979
 It will turn out to be filled in, that is, as soon as 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.289
 on poured but immediately published 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.330
 for you automatically now such here 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.039
 channel constraints imposed but 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.630
 actually what to do about the owner 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.570
 They are about Balotelli I had a lot 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.280
 various percent violations 70 75 of 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.229
 I challenged them successfully, that is, they all 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.250
 actually merged with this they are mine 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.770
 tilida wires and 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.090
 the argument was won in my direction but there have been 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.180
 such violations that hung me in 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.409
 six months and then filmed by machine 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.120
 there were also times when we allowed 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.470
 swallowed spoke no dick like there 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.909
 used my music and me not 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.979
 worried in short had music 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:23.570
 delete here actually and roughly speaking 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.159
 on the slit does not matter I'm just wing 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.590
 once canal one day before 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.560
 Yesterday it turns out and I see that I have 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.289
 construction and everything to do 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.120
 Sometimes I think that this filter will be 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.710
 very happy well to ordinary viewers and 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.259
 channel subscribers to those who are for me 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.680
 sick and remains faithful let's say so 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.300
 channels difficult minutes up including 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.949
 I ’m asking for support because before 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.500
 noses so you canal annoying 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.180
 the pancake came only together and together 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.090
 I think we can win 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.860
 wire and how you stand and 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.280
 continue to continue to be loved 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.680
 by deed 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.020
 but actually everything that is to look for is 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.090
 there is no more news, except for 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.610
 the fact that 25 days worked without days off 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.080
 finally my three days off and bin by 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.389
 the idea can rest rejoice but here 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.220
 they are addressed to such events as bad 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.719
 like copyright strike on anyway 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.310
 was i will try to get enough sleep and 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.080
 rest and gain strength with fresh 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.689
 forces already 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.909
 start shooting for you new and current 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.460

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:23.469
 have planned for samarin nearest 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.849
 autumn i would be leaders end of august very 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:27.039

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.349
 actually wait everything will be great all 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.639
 will be cool but just maybe couldn't 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:33.819
 other format that is, the videos will be 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.550
 divided into parts by July 15 to 14 minutes 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.349
 how is it that so then these are 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.330
 I think I will do my best 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.490
