00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
now I'm not really gonna get try and

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.440 
now I'm not really gonna get try and
absorb<00:01:38.439> like<00:01:38.920> with<00:01:39.159> wings<00:01:39.490> because<00:01:39.909> people

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
absorb like with wings because people

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.539 
absorb like with wings because people
are<00:01:40.570> like<00:01:40.810> oh<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.500> wings<00:01:41.740> aren't<00:01:41.950> absorbent

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
are like oh the wings aren't absorbent

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.160 
are like oh the wings aren't absorbent
makes<00:01:42.909> it<00:01:43.060> Pat<00:01:43.179> bad<00:01:43.420> well<00:01:43.689> no<00:01:43.869> that's<00:01:44.020> not

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
makes it Pat bad well no that's not

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.260 
makes it Pat bad well no that's not
necessarily<00:01:44.829> true<00:01:44.979> because<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.970> wings<00:01:46.119> are

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
necessarily true because the wings are

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.550 
necessarily true because the wings are
gonna<00:01:46.390> be<00:01:46.569> on<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.780> others<00:01:47.170> out<00:01:47.319> of<00:01:47.380> your

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
gonna be on the others out of your

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.840 
gonna be on the others out of your
underwear<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:48.009> they're<00:01:48.130> not<00:01:48.250> gonna<00:01:48.340> leak<00:01:48.670> that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
underwear so they're not gonna leak that

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.330 
underwear so they're not gonna leak that
bar<00:01:49.149> so<00:01:49.630> yeah<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.740> I'm<00:01:50.860> just<00:01:50.920> gonna<00:01:51.130> like

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
bar so yeah so I'm just gonna like

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.690 
bar so yeah so I'm just gonna like
squirt<00:01:51.850> one<00:01:52.119> of<00:01:52.210> these<00:01:52.329> on<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:57.130> it's<00:01:57.250> absorbing

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
squirt one of these on so it's absorbing

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.199 
squirt one of these on so it's absorbing
pretty<00:01:58.090> fast

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
pretty fast

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:10.800 
pretty fast
all<00:02:01.209> right<00:02:05.220> do<00:02:06.220> another<00:02:06.399> one<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:10.569> is

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
all right do another one so this is

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.670 
all right do another one so this is
really<00:02:11.079> difficult

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
really difficult

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.229 
really difficult
I<00:02:11.709> couldn't<00:02:12.370> get<00:02:12.489> my<00:02:12.549> camera<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.030> position

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
I couldn't get my camera in position

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.760 
I couldn't get my camera in position
where<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.780> could<00:02:13.989> just<00:02:14.049> sit<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.530> down<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.950> told<00:02:15.220> it

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:38.910 

the<00:02:21.280> most<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.730> staying<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:37.920> staying

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
the most of it staying and this staying

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.810 
the most of it staying and this staying
in<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.130> middle<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.390> pad<00:02:40.570> good<00:02:41.670> I'm<00:02:42.670> just

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
in the middle of the pad good I'm just

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:50.040 
in the middle of the pad good I'm just
kind<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.000> like<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.790> basically<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.570> is<00:02:49.840> not

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
kind of like it's basically this is not

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.830 
kind of like it's basically this is not
absorbing<00:02:50.710> out<00:02:51.010> as<00:02:51.490> much<00:02:51.760> but<00:02:52.300> it's<00:02:52.630> still

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
absorbing out as much but it's still

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.740 
absorbing out as much but it's still
absorbing<00:02:53.650> really<00:02:54.070> quickly<00:02:54.460> so<00:02:55.240> it's<00:02:55.360> really

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
absorbing really quickly so it's really

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.060 
absorbing really quickly so it's really
well<00:02:55.900> when<00:02:56.080> you're<00:02:56.110> like<00:02:56.440> grieving<00:02:56.650> you're<00:02:56.980> on

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
well when you're like grieving you're on

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.090 
well when you're like grieving you're on
it<00:02:57.220> but<00:03:01.110> I'm<00:03:02.110> going<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.290> show<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:02.830> once

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
it but I'm going to show you this once

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.449 
it but I'm going to show you this once
I've<00:03:03.280> done<00:03:03.460> squeezing<00:03:04.360> liquid

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.099 

so<00:03:12.459> let's<00:03:12.819> just<00:03:12.999> test<00:03:13.269> this<00:03:13.420> little<00:03:13.810> big<00:03:13.930> guy

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
so let's just test this little big guy

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.379 
so let's just test this little big guy
thing<00:03:14.409> you<00:03:15.400> know<00:03:15.519> that's<00:03:15.670> bad<00:03:15.879> in<00:03:16.090> your<00:03:16.180> body

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
thing you know that's bad in your body

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.899 
thing you know that's bad in your body
so<00:03:16.780> that's<00:03:17.139> probably<00:03:17.349> why<00:03:17.680> it's<00:03:18.459> not<00:03:18.670> going

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
so that's probably why it's not going

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.899 
so that's probably why it's not going

light protection like I would recommend

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:16.620

so like why would you need them to

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.770 
so like why would you need them to
absorb<00:04:29.889> anything<00:04:30.300> it's<00:04:31.300> just<00:04:31.330> gonna<00:04:31.570> be<00:04:31.750> like

it's bad but like I understand like it

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.149 
it's bad but like I understand like it
might<00:04:48.280> leak<00:04:48.520> out<00:04:48.699> sides<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.389> bit<00:04:49.509> more<00:04:49.979> it's<00:04:50.979> not

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.159 
might leak out sides a bit more it's not
really<00:04:51.520> necessary<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.389> worry<00:04:52.599> about<00:04:52.870> whether

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
really necessary to worry about whether

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.260 
really necessary to worry about whether
the<00:04:53.409> way

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
the way

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.670 
the way
