00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:34.040
 why do you feel about Donetsk and how I am doing 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:34.040
 These are the corps. Well, I will say so for

 making the case I take the board edge and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:49.730
 and 53 centimeters here are such reiki 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.350
 thick here is 25 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.420
 one side I dance on the butt well on 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.180
 saw

 pressing against the rip fence from the other 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.090
 me remains 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.220
 knocked down 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.850
 which is more primitive conductor literally 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.460
 here reiki screwed between them and the angle 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.110
 clearly 90 degrees and 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:24.680
 and size 320 millimeters my size 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:28.020
 it turns out such a treak 515 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.650
 millimeters and 515 millimeters these 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.009
 that's 24 and a half with these two hundred and forty 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.409
 five millimeters like that 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.570
 assemble in front slats 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.720
 front panel i am doing extra 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.289
 here is such a little river along here 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.250
 longitudinal slotted notch to 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:02:04.590
 you could hang your finger a collection of parables 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:09.330
 the collection is used by the company api and he 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.320
 lays down well lays here on on 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.320
 top notch 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:25.430
 nowhere any gap between here such a gap 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.430
 but above and below the tongues opens 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.450
 gate valve 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.870
 cleaned up hanging fingers compilation and with 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.350
 springs and bees learn to put in here 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.480
 a piece of foam rubber so that it 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.480
 closed twitter trained but not 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.110
 But she well enough firmly NATO 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.120
 flowing foam here will insert 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.100
 visit this year this way 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.320
 collect pollen 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.730
 thing that I started last year 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:05.519
 split hairs I have a broad wide house 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:09.120
 now wide easy come out amateur on 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:12.359
 it does not become normal to go catcher 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.140
 This is a collection of slots here form but 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:19.470
 the bee climbs into all the cracks except here 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.100
 here and here comes himself gray here 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.260
 grayed out through the bars it turns out you need 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.950
 was there about 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.620
 its thin strips and foam on top 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.129
 Skiing in the GRU to him 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:38.299
 pin down and created tormented against 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:43.909
 Kadyrov Well, inconveniently, I will probably do 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:45.980
 john i'm an easy stranger a few 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.099
 another construction will be wooden 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.859
 liners do then straight here will be 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:55.370
 the plane will be more accurate between the body and 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:59.209
 between the bottom and how much the driver is doing 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:05.349
 on all the same on the lower entrance so that they do not 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:05.349
 interfered well so far so I gathered 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:14.389
 jerk hear I liked how 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.049
 We do about these here hull easily 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.410
 quickly then I'm in them harry for but this 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.780
 will be 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.460
 there will be the following videos I will try scam 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:29.780
 plan everything in one or more 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:36.440
 parts take off so here again 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:39.470
 my sizes are 515 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.990
 this is the top and bottom rake 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:50.289
 and 245 side 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:53.210
 25 foam 25 in nature no but 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:56.690
 surfacing I stretch the nichrome thread 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.530
 sometime I'll take a video too and connect 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:05.150
 still old soviet machine chargers 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.810
 for 12 volt batteries and and through 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.800
 no one to blame 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:12.050
 excellent less likely to dissolve 2 to 25 i 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:17.120
 ordered comrades just yesterday I 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.090
 He brought about the programs I opened yet 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.740
 counted 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.810
 right amount of sheets away here 10 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:31.060
 of things 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:38.730

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:46.330
 2 store extensions 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:50.080
 30-30 store extensions fail 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.410
 I counted the number of parts I needed 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.450
 and ordered on cutting 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:02.370
 cut in order to cheapen dramatically 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.370
 outdated there and would not be free 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:13.260
 cut under 300 here such here yes 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:17.680
 320 demanded i brought home unloaded and 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:23.800
 on trimming these are the details here details me 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:27.160
 these already cut here still jumped but 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.250
 pertsovki them times to him on trimming 320 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.000
 millimeters berets 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:36.960
 Excellent although the cut width is indicated 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.010
 broach 305 millimeters but 320 takes 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:45.220
 no problem for further show video 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:47.740
 It means two sizes because in fact 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.540
 get two bills right now on this 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.540
 I'll show you the case 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:59.140
 two different accounts 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:02.340
 front here is front shield front shields 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:08.470
 and rear side two side 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:16.120
 front shield width 515 millimeters in 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:17.550
 10500 15 millimeters height 320 width 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.920
 lateral 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:24.450
 these four slats here are four hundred and ninety 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:29.620
 five millimeters well and understandable in this 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:35.530
 a320 stores exactly the same size 515 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:42.750
 but at 165 and amazing 515,490 to 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:47.430
 515 by 165 two walls and door temka 500 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:50.020
 495 by 165 is for store extensions 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.800
 I'll try to show now 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:57.700
 so that you can really see that 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:08:00.850
 trimming takes 320 millimeters yesterday 

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:04.720
 specifically a few left blanks 

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:06.810
 so that today is 5 short 

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.810
 roller
