the testing for the system any technical
issues<00:00:22.820> we<00:00:23.180> might<00:00:23.359> have<00:00:23.480> encountered<00:00:23.600> or

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
issues we might have encountered or

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.330 
issues we might have encountered or
things<00:00:24.350> that<00:00:24.410> we<00:00:24.560> feel<00:00:24.740> need<00:00:24.920> to<00:00:25.010> be<00:00:25.130> addressed

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
things that we feel need to be addressed

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.630 
things that we feel need to be addressed
to<00:00:25.580> increase<00:00:26.240> the<00:00:26.450> success<00:00:26.720> of<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.170> mission

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
to increase the success of the mission

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.279 
to increase the success of the mission
it's<00:00:28.640> looking<00:00:28.820> at<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.180> top<00:00:29.360> five<00:00:29.630> centimeters

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
it's looking at the top five centimeters

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.529 
it's looking at the top five centimeters
of<00:00:30.320> moisture<00:00:30.980> in<00:00:31.100> the<00:00:31.220> soil<00:00:31.430> and<00:00:31.760> that's

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
of moisture in the soil and that's

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.689 
of moisture in the soil and that's
important<00:00:32.989> because<00:00:33.110> that<00:00:33.350> that<00:00:34.100> layer<00:00:34.430> of

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
important because that that layer of

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.670 
important because that that layer of
moisture<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:35.449> part<00:00:35.899> of<00:00:35.960> what<00:00:36.140> controls<00:00:36.530> our

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
moisture is part of what controls our

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.030 
moisture is part of what controls our
climate<00:00:37.600> water<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:38.809> everything<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.590> all<00:00:39.770> of<00:00:39.920> us

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
climate water is everything to all of us

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.520 
climate water is everything to all of us
so<00:00:40.670> once<00:00:41.060> we<00:00:41.210> conduct<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:41.840> mission<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:42.380> gain

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
so once we conduct this mission and gain

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.770 
so once we conduct this mission and gain
some<00:00:42.560> information<00:00:43.370> about<00:00:43.910> soil<00:00:44.360> moisture

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
some information about soil moisture

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.110 
some information about soil moisture
will<00:00:45.320> be<00:00:45.440> able<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.739> better<00:00:45.920> forecast<00:00:46.550> climate

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
will be able to better forecast climate

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.630 
will be able to better forecast climate
will<00:00:47.660> be<00:00:47.780> able<00:00:47.899> to<00:00:48.050> better<00:00:48.320> forecast<00:00:48.950> droughts

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
will be able to better forecast droughts

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.030 
will be able to better forecast droughts
and<00:00:49.880> floods<00:00:50.239> those<00:00:51.050> are<00:00:51.230> critical<00:00:51.620> elements

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
and floods those are critical elements

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.459 
and floods those are critical elements
of<00:00:52.130> course<00:00:52.399> for<00:00:52.550> farming<00:00:53.030> for<00:00:53.270> food<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:54.260> it'll

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
of course for farming for food and it'll

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:55.870 
of course for farming for food and it'll
also<00:00:54.620> help<00:00:54.739> us<00:00:54.980> understand<00:00:55.430> how<00:00:55.489> carbon

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
also help us understand how carbon

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.240 
also help us understand how carbon
interacts<00:00:56.510> with<00:00:56.630> the<00:00:56.780> planet<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:57.649> that<00:00:57.920> we

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
interacts with the planet so that we

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.430 
interacts with the planet so that we
understand<00:00:58.820> better<00:00:59.149> what<00:00:59.660> climate<00:01:00.020> change

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
understand better what climate change

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.319 
understand better what climate change
might<00:01:00.649> be<00:01:00.770> impacted<00:01:01.280> by<00:01:01.399> carbon<00:01:01.790> uptake<00:01:01.910> or

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
might be impacted by carbon uptake or

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.389 
might be impacted by carbon uptake or
carbon<00:01:02.690> dioxide<00:01:03.110> uptake<00:01:05.860> when<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:06.890> started<00:01:07.280> to

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
carbon dioxide uptake when I started to

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.760 
carbon dioxide uptake when I started to
understand<00:01:07.850> that<00:01:08.060> spacecraft<00:01:08.750> our<00:01:09.170> robots<00:01:09.590> I

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
understand that spacecraft our robots I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.410 
understand that spacecraft our robots I
thought<00:01:09.950> well<00:01:10.039> this<00:01:10.159> is<00:01:10.340> great<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.789> can<00:01:11.030> work<00:01:11.240> I

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
thought well this is great I can work I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.820 
thought well this is great I can work I
got<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.720> job<00:01:11.900> offer<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.350> I<00:01:12.409> thought<00:01:12.560> well<00:01:12.680> who

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
got the job offer and I thought well who

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.250 
got the job offer and I thought well who
turns<00:01:13.070> down<00:01:13.159> a<00:01:13.280> job<00:01:13.520> offer<00:01:13.760> at<00:01:14.030> NASA<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:15.229> I

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
turns down a job offer at NASA and to I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.840 
turns down a job offer at NASA and to I
didn't<00:01:15.619> get<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.740> work<00:01:15.950> with<00:01:15.979> robots<00:01:16.430> in<00:01:16.610> space

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
didn't get to work with robots in space

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.950 
didn't get to work with robots in space
this<00:01:17.030> is<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.330> best<00:01:17.510> thing<00:01:17.659> I<00:01:17.750> could<00:01:17.930> ever

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
this is the best thing I could ever

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.109 
this is the best thing I could ever
imagine<00:01:20.560> when<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:21.590> was<00:01:21.799> younger<00:01:22.070> there<00:01:22.880> weren't

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
imagine when I was younger there weren't

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.000 
imagine when I was younger there weren't
a<00:01:23.210> lot<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.840> know<00:01:23.960> ethnic<00:01:24.350> role<00:01:24.560> models<00:01:24.950> for

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
a lot of you know ethnic role models for

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.060 
a lot of you know ethnic role models for
me<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.340> certainly<00:01:25.760> didn't<00:01:26.060> know<00:01:26.180> any<00:01:26.409> I<00:01:27.409> didn't

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
me I certainly didn't know any I didn't

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.710 
me I certainly didn't know any I didn't
know<00:01:28.130> any<00:01:28.340> other<00:01:28.400> African<00:01:28.970> Americans<00:01:29.540> that

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
know any other African Americans that

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.109 
know any other African Americans that
were<00:01:29.900> in<00:01:30.170> science<00:01:30.680> at<00:01:30.830> all<00:01:31.040> because<00:01:31.430> society

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
were in science at all because society

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.609 
were in science at all because society
had<00:01:32.270> been<00:01:32.420> limited<00:01:32.990> writing<00:01:33.290> opportunities

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
had been limited writing opportunities

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.020 
had been limited writing opportunities
at<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.310> time<00:01:34.490> there<00:01:34.670> weren't<00:01:34.790> a<00:01:34.880> lot<00:01:34.909> of

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
at that time there weren't a lot of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.850 
at that time there weren't a lot of
people<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:35.479> could<00:01:35.540> reach<00:01:35.810> out<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.020> or<00:01:36.259> look<00:01:36.530> to

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
people I could reach out to or look to

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.420 
people I could reach out to or look to
for<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.250> kind<00:01:37.549> of<00:01:37.640> example<00:01:38.979> over<00:01:39.979> time<00:01:40.220> that

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
for that kind of example over time that

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.070 
for that kind of example over time that
certainly<00:01:40.790> changed<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.450> can<00:01:41.600> feel<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:41.930> now

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
certainly changed and I can feel it now

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.109 
certainly changed and I can feel it now
I<00:01:42.110> mean<00:01:42.439> imagine<00:01:42.770> people<00:01:43.130> like<00:01:43.430> myself<00:01:43.640> for

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
I mean imagine people like myself for

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.969 
I mean imagine people like myself for
people<00:01:44.750> who<00:01:44.840> can<00:01:45.020> help<00:01:45.140> mentor<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:45.590> certainly

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
people who can help mentor I certainly

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.030 
people who can help mentor I certainly
mentor<00:01:46.340> from<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.030> variety<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.570> different

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
mentor from a variety of different

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.069 
mentor from a variety of different
backgrounds<00:01:49.040> but<00:01:49.220> it's<00:01:50.210> easily<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.570> best<00:01:50.810> job

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
backgrounds but it's easily the best job

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.780
