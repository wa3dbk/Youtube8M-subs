00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
box trial with it when they go camping

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.020 
box trial with it when they go camping
and<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.930> about<00:00:28.140> making<00:00:28.380> camping<00:00:28.980> better

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.370 

usually<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.300> take<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.510> box<00:00:33.690> trailer<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.230> get

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
usually you take a box trailer you get

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.690 
usually you take a box trailer you get
there<00:00:34.620> unload<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.100> stuff<00:00:35.309> out<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
your box travel is just in the way so a

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920 
your box travel is just in the way so a
mark<00:00:37.649> rang<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> idea<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.840> we

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
mark rang with the idea of what can we

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.360 
mark rang with the idea of what can we
do<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.290> boxtroll<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.950> said<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:41.280> about

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
do with a boxtroll I said what about

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.430 
do with a boxtroll I said what about
maybe<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:42.030> you're<00:00:42.149> tuning<00:00:42.390> into<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.719> pool<00:00:43.200> table

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
maybe if you're tuning into a pool table

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.770 
maybe if you're tuning into a pool table
you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.800> use<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> repeat<00:00:44.370> pong<00:00:44.550> table<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.600> way

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you can use a repeat pong table that way

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.970 
you can use a repeat pong table that way
you've<00:00:45.989> got<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.200> gear<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.860> you've

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
got something to do with it so we

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.479 
got something to do with it so we
decided<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.530> morning<00:00:49.739> we've<00:00:50.010> been<00:00:50.039> out<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
pieces there and then now hopefully in a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.799 
pieces there and then now hopefully in a
couple<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.280> hours<00:00:59.640> time<00:00:59.879> you'll<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.270> what

will be a fantastic creation that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.609 
will be a fantastic creation that
hopefully<00:01:02.550> gets<00:01:02.760> us<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.149> four<00:01:03.870> X<00:01:03.989> Orleans<00:01:04.409> or

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
hopefully gets us to four X Orleans or

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:21.990 
hopefully gets us to four X Orleans or
exhale<00:01:06.350> roll<00:01:07.350> back

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.020 

so<00:02:30.659> we<00:02:31.379> decided<00:02:31.739> just<00:02:31.980> as<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.519> matter<00:02:32.940> of

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
so we decided just as a matter of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.000 
so we decided just as a matter of
locking<00:02:33.930> off<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.200> top<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:34.440> our<00:02:34.530> heads<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.830> we

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
locking off the top of our heads that we

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.039 
locking off the top of our heads that we
decided<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.489> rather<00:02:35.700> than<00:02:36.090> running<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.870> net

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
decided that rather than running the net

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.440 
decided that rather than running the net
off<00:02:37.290> for<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.190> catch<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.519> balls<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.060> maybe<00:02:39.209> we

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
off for to catch the balls and maybe we

00:02:39.450 --> 00:03:03.920 
off for to catch the balls and maybe we
can<00:02:39.629> convert<00:02:40.019> this<00:02:52.250> Bank<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.900> too<00:02:55.170> far<00:03:02.930> getting

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
can convert this Bank is too far getting

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.069 
can convert this Bank is too far getting
there<00:03:04.609> using<00:03:05.609> an<00:03:05.760> ID<00:03:06.000> Pam<00:03:06.239> flew<00:03:06.510> out<00:03:06.660> Cobb<00:03:06.870> and

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
there using an ID Pam flew out Cobb and

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.539 
there using an ID Pam flew out Cobb and
laid<00:03:07.230> out<00:03:07.349> which<00:03:07.530> was<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.890> sign<00:03:08.099> of<00:03:08.129> law<00:03:08.370> we'll

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
laid out which was the sign of law we'll

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.759 
laid out which was the sign of law we'll
be<00:03:08.640> using<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:09.000> for<00:03:09.030> X<00:03:09.299> Holland<00:03:09.660> for<00:03:10.650> our
