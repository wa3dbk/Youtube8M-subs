00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
Joseph karate who will be behind the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.219 
Joseph karate who will be behind the
camera<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.549> right<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.790> right<00:01:42.229> let's

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
camera I can get right all right let's

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.899 
camera I can get right all right let's
do<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.439> right<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.040> for<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.280> test<00:01:44.549> I'm<00:01:44.790> gonna

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
do this right so for this test I'm gonna

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.420 
do this right so for this test I'm gonna
be<00:01:45.030> sitting<00:01:45.240> out<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.689> I'm<00:01:45.960> gonna<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.500> by

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
be sitting out there I'm gonna be by

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.490 
be sitting out there I'm gonna be by
full<00:01:47.700> feet<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.150> gonna<00:01:48.540> stab<00:01:48.810> maybe<00:01:49.020> 20<00:01:49.320> times

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
full feet out gonna stab maybe 20 times

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.890 
full feet out gonna stab maybe 20 times
