00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
like a world world at war map it's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.330 
like a world world at war map it's
really<00:01:12.630> big<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.170> has<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> lot<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> sniper<00:01:13.920> spots

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
which i don't really see the point to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.289 
which i don't really see the point to
since<00:01:16.890> they<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.400> ruin<00:01:17.729> sniping<00:01:18.180> in

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
since they really ruin sniping in

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.340 
since they really ruin sniping in
general<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:18.960> we'll<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.310> actually<00:01:21.110> if<00:01:22.110> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
general but we'll see it actually if you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.810 
general but we'll see it actually if you
think<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> big<00:01:23.189> square<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
think about it's like a big square and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.630 
think about it's like a big square and
is<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.560> big<00:01:25.560> line<00:01:25.770> through<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> middle<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
is a big line through the middle and

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.340 
is a big line through the middle and
through<00:01:27.240> them<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.659> middle<00:01:28.049> there's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
through them that middle there's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
through them that middle there's
actually<00:01:28.740> auto<00:01:28.920> deterrence<00:01:29.460> which<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> called

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
actually auto deterrence which is called

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
actually auto deterrence which is called
dead<00:01:30.540> man's<00:01:30.570> LED<00:01:31.079> or<00:01:31.229> no<00:01:31.380> man's<00:01:31.650> land<00:01:31.799> where

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
dead man's LED or no man's land where

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.280 
dead man's LED or no man's land where
you<00:01:32.670> could<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:32.909> risk<00:01:33.299> going<00:01:33.630> through<00:01:34.049> but

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you could really risk going through but

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.270 
you could really risk going through but
you<00:01:34.560> could<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> chance<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.250> getting

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you could have a chance of getting

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.580 
you could have a chance of getting
killed<00:01:35.579> by<00:01:35.729> auto<00:01:35.970> turrets<00:01:36.390> they<00:01:37.020> really<00:01:37.439> don't

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
killed by auto turrets they really don't

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.530 
killed by auto turrets they really don't
suggest<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:38.250> through<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
suggest going through but that's a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.030 
suggest going through but that's a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
nothing for it it's just a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179 
nothing for it it's just a
close-quarters<00:01:55.140> map<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.740> doesn't<00:01:55.979> look<00:01:56.040> like

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
close-quarters map it doesn't look like

know it's something new and now my

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.870 
know it's something new and now my
opinion<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.979> all<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.850> don't

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
opinion on on all this is if you don't

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.550 
opinion on on all this is if you don't
like<00:02:03.149> black<00:02:03.390> ops<00:02:03.659> already<00:02:04.020> i<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.380> think

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
like black ops already i don't think

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.959 
like black ops already i don't think
this<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.979> change<00:02:05.040> anything<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.850> is

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
this is going to change anything this is

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.219 
this is going to change anything this is
not<00:02:06.119> going<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.360> fix<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.689> multiplayer<00:02:07.170> or

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
not going to fix the multiplayer or

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.109 
not going to fix the multiplayer or
anything<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:08.759> some<00:02:08.970> new

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
anything like that this is just some new

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
anything like that this is just some new
maps<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.050> if<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.319> don't<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.530> black<00:02:10.830> ops<00:02:11.069> now

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
maps so if you don't like black ops now

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860 
maps so if you don't like black ops now
this<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.790> probably<00:02:12.180> not<00:02:12.300> going<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.569> change

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
this is probably not going to change

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.330 
this is probably not going to change
anything<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:13.739> can<00:02:13.860> check<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.220> the
