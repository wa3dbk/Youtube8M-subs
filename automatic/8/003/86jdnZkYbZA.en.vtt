00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
best way to go with an esper is either

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.339 
best way to go with an esper is either
as<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:37.680> hybrid<00:05:38.070> or<00:05:38.430> pure<00:05:38.820> DPS<00:05:39.270> leaning<00:05:40.169> more

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
as a hybrid or pure DPS leaning more

as a hybrid or pure DPS leaning more
towards<00:05:40.770> hybrid<00:05:41.159> because<00:05:41.430> you<00:05:42.000> get<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:42.270> wider

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 
towards hybrid because you get the wider
