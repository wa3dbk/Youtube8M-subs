parameter<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.440> steer<00:02:21.709> axle<00:02:21.920> at<00:02:22.430> this

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
parameter for the steer axle at this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.120 
parameter for the steer axle at this
point<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:24.020> begin<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.440> press<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:25.010> release

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.940 
point you can begin to press and release
the<00:02:25.580> minus<00:02:26.030> key<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:27.050> lower<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.530> parameter

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
the minus key to lower that parameter

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.690 
the minus key to lower that parameter
down<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:29.380> typically<00:02:30.380> we<00:02:30.590> suggest<00:02:31.100> setting

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
down and typically we suggest setting

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.080 
down and typically we suggest setting
this<00:02:31.820> parameter<00:02:32.390> at<00:02:32.570> about<00:02:32.810> 20<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.470> 25%<00:02:34.090> above

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
this parameter at about 20 to 25% above

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.110 
this parameter at about 20 to 25% above
what<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.450> normally<00:02:35.600> run<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.110> your<00:02:36.350> tires

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.080 

now<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.110> set<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.650> low<00:02:43.830> parameter<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.640> simply

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
now to set the low parameter you simply

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.869 
now to set the low parameter you simply
press<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.660> release<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.959> mode<00:02:46.349> key<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:46.950> drop

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
press and release the mode key and drop

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.170 
press and release the mode key and drop
the<00:02:48.330> load<00:02:48.540> down<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:50.489> desired<00:02:50.849> level

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
the load down to the desired level

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.180 
the load down to the desired level
typically<00:02:51.780> we<00:02:52.019> suggest<00:02:52.440> setting<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.860> low<00:02:53.010> at

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
typically we suggest setting the low at

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.550 
typically we suggest setting the low at
about<00:02:53.250> 10%<00:02:53.910> below<00:02:54.390> which<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.930> normally<00:02:55.080> run

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
about 10% below which you normally run

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.040 
about 10% below which you normally run
in<00:02:55.590> your<00:02:55.800> tires<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.430> then<00:02:57.180> simply<00:02:57.629> repeat<00:02:58.019> the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
in your tires and then simply repeat the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.550 
in your tires and then simply repeat the
process<00:02:58.379> for<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.760> remaining<00:03:00.030> axles<00:03:00.690> bearing

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
process for the remaining axles bearing

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.350 
process for the remaining axles bearing
in<00:03:01.680> mind<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:02.040> your<00:03:02.250> high<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.489> low<00:03:02.879> pressure

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
in mind that your high and low pressure

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:16.730 
in mind that your high and low pressure
settings<00:03:03.930> are<00:03:04.230> set<00:03:04.830> axle<00:03:05.430> specific

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.940 

you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.270 

now<00:03:25.210> we<00:03:26.210> repeat<00:03:26.390> this<00:03:26.750> same<00:03:27.020> process<00:03:27.590> again<00:03:27.770> in

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
now we repeat this same process again in

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.160 
now we repeat this same process again in
the<00:03:29.060> event<00:03:29.330> that<00:03:29.450> there<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.720> trailer

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
the event that there is a trailer

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.290 
the event that there is a trailer
associated<00:03:30.980> with<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:31.280> particular<00:03:31.490> tractor
