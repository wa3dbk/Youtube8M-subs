00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.200
 and today 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.850
 Y 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.419
 you think you'll leave you always thought of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.419
 betray us as he did date 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.590
 tyra was not like that he was an ordinary person 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.590
 and current 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.670
 he just let himself be invaded by panic and 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:51.870
 I suspect nobody wants to die 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.120
 everyone wants to go home for that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.530
 when he got hurt and went into the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.629
 despair and panic your heart will 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.940
 split in two 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.440
 I went 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.440
 the culprit of his death 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:18.500
 you also want to go home 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:22.390
 yes of course I want to go back and 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.390
 leave this damn hell 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.150
 then you can go 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.020
 I can go 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.210
 if you eat these chips hetaira 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.790
 but he told us nothing 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.060
 but with this if the one in your hand your 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.090
 mantras and with us we would have in 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.900
 our hands a total of six plus the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.880
 it has today or broken are yours 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.040
 all of the chips you need to 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.950
 leave this island 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.220
 If one of us dies, one can 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.220
 leave 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.670
 that's why you have to kill me 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.090
 this is the best thing besides 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.400
 I do not have a place to return to 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.380
 I only had you here when I was 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.130
 alone 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.290
 even if we were not online 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.560
 our hearts if they were 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.930
 even if the world was virtual you 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.010
 saved 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.770
 and here you did the same, you saved me still 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.850
 when I was about to die 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:45.240
 now I understand everything 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.240
 you are and hope to survive 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.950
 tape 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.460
 if you stay alive 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.930
 if you survive 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:01.790
 then I will not mind 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.680
 so you say do not be silly, do you think that 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.540
 I would go from this island using tea as 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:13.069
 chemical sacrifice you think I'm like that 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:18.010
 I will not leave you I would never leave you alone or in 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.010
 this world nor in the virtual 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.840
 you are simic or the game chemistry 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.130
 I finally did I can meet you 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.130
 chemical 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.060
 I always wanted to meet you
