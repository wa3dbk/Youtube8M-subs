energy<00:00:05.609> story<00:00:06.529> and<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.710> use<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.919> couple<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.130> key

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
energy story and I use a couple of key

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.810 
energy story and I use a couple of key
selects<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.610> min<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:08.970> some<00:00:09.269> glow<00:00:09.870> stick<00:00:10.080> and

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
selects a min and some glow stick and

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.129 
selects a min and some glow stick and
really<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:11.910> going<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.269> talk<00:00:12.420> so<00:00:12.690> let's<00:00:12.990> take

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
really just going to talk so let's take

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:37.260 
really just going to talk so let's take
a<00:00:13.170> look<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:19.189> there<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.250> go

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.400 

okay<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:38.330> can<00:00:38.510> see<00:00:38.630> here<00:00:38.810> what<00:00:38.930> I<00:00:38.960> did<00:00:39.140> was<00:00:39.320> I

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
okay you can see here what I did was I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.650 
okay you can see here what I did was I
tweaked<00:00:39.710> out<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:40.040> pattern<00:00:40.430> on<00:00:40.880> a<00:00:40.940> piece<00:00:41.120> on<00:00:41.600> a

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
tweaked out the pattern on a piece on a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.720 
tweaked out the pattern on a piece on a
piece<00:00:41.870> of<00:00:41.989> foamboard<00:00:42.200> oh<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:43.040> can<00:00:43.280> use<00:00:43.430> this

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
piece of foamboard oh you can use this

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.950 
piece of foamboard oh you can use this
is<00:00:43.850> just<00:00:43.970> to<00:00:44.030> make<00:00:44.150> a<00:00:44.180> template<00:00:44.570> to<00:00:44.720> make<00:00:44.840> it

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
is just to make a template to make it

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.830 
is just to make a template to make it
easier<00:00:45.350> for<00:00:45.670> cutting<00:00:46.670> it<00:00:46.790> for<00:00:46.970> moving<00:00:47.570> around

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
easier for cutting it for moving around

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.200 
easier for cutting it for moving around
the<00:00:47.989> plastic<00:00:48.170> I<00:00:48.790> originally<00:00:49.790> thought<00:00:49.820> I<00:00:50.030> would

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
the plastic I originally thought I would

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.810 
the plastic I originally thought I would
make<00:00:50.390> each<00:00:50.600> half<00:00:51.080> of<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.680> sword<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.460> energy

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
make each half of the sword the energy

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.580 
make each half of the sword the energy
sword<00:00:53.110> individually<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.199> then<00:00:54.290> assemble

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
sword individually and then assemble

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.840 
sword individually and then assemble
them<00:00:54.680> together<00:00:54.770> I<00:00:54.980> ended<00:00:55.220> up<00:00:55.280> changing<00:00:55.489> that

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
them together I ended up changing that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.840 
them together I ended up changing that
and<00:00:56.410> making<00:00:57.410> it<00:00:57.620> all<00:00:57.800> one<00:00:58.040> piece<00:00:58.280> it<00:00:58.489> was<00:00:58.610> much

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
and making it all one piece it was much

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.689 
and making it all one piece it was much
easier<00:00:59.090> and<00:00:59.420> much<00:00:59.570> much<00:01:00.019> sturdier<00:01:00.320> but<00:01:00.739> you

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
easier and much much sturdier but you

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:02.890 
easier and much much sturdier but you
know<00:01:01.790> make<00:01:01.940> your<00:01:02.030> template<00:01:02.360> not<00:01:02.480> a<00:01:02.540> foam<00:01:02.720> board

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
know make your template not a foam board

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.980 
know make your template not a foam board
of<00:01:03.110> paper<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:04.360> then<00:01:05.360> you<00:01:05.600> know<00:01:05.750> put<00:01:05.900> that

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
of paper and then you know put that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.469 
of paper and then you know put that
template<00:01:06.320> on<00:01:06.530> your<00:01:06.560> plastic<00:01:07.160> as<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.640> guide<00:01:07.970> see

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
template on your plastic as a guide see

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.260 
template on your plastic as a guide see
it<00:01:08.570> looks<00:01:08.720> like<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:12.399> so<00:01:13.399> elated<00:01:13.700> I<00:01:13.940> laid<00:01:14.119> it

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
it looks like this so elated I laid it

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.249 
it looks like this so elated I laid it
out<00:01:14.360> on<00:01:14.649> plastic<00:01:15.649> eighth<00:01:15.920> inch<00:01:16.190> and<00:01:16.430> then<00:01:17.259> two

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
out on plastic eighth inch and then two

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.480 
out on plastic eighth inch and then two
of<00:01:18.410> them<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:18.710> need<00:01:18.830> two<00:01:18.979> sheets<00:01:19.190> because

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
of them you need two sheets because

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.320 
of them you need two sheets because
we're<00:01:19.670> gonna<00:01:19.789> sandwich<00:01:20.000> those<00:01:20.180> sheets

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
we're gonna sandwich those sheets

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.880 
we're gonna sandwich those sheets
together<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.110> then<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:21.320> cut<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.560> out<00:01:21.710> with<00:01:21.860> a

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
together and then I cut it out with a

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.560 
together and then I cut it out with a
jigsaw<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.759> know<00:01:22.850> use<00:01:23.000> any<00:01:23.149> kind<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.420> tool

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
jigsaw you know use any kind of a tool

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.300 
jigsaw you know use any kind of a tool
to<00:01:23.600> cut<00:01:23.869> out<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:23.990> plastic<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.070> can<00:01:28.130> see

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
to cut out that plastic and you can see

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.560 
to cut out that plastic and you can see
this<00:01:28.399> little<00:01:28.610> extra<00:01:28.820> piece<00:01:28.910> in<00:01:29.210> between<00:01:29.479> the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
this little extra piece in between the

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.910 
this little extra piece in between the
blades<00:01:29.720> there<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.200> really<00:01:30.440> need<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:30.770> for

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
blades there you really need that for

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.650 
blades there you really need that for
the<00:01:30.979> strength<00:01:31.220> on<00:01:31.399> this<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:32.300> I'll<00:01:32.390> clean<00:01:32.630> it

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
the strength on this and I'll clean it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.870 
the strength on this and I'll clean it
up<00:01:32.840> with<00:01:33.050> a<00:01:33.080> file<00:01:33.410> or<00:01:33.860> some<00:01:34.250> kind<00:01:34.399> of<00:01:34.430> a<00:01:34.520> sander

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
up with a file or some kind of a sander

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.150 
up with a file or some kind of a sander
to<00:01:34.910> make<00:01:35.509> it<00:01:35.630> look<00:01:35.750> good<00:01:35.899> and<00:01:36.080> then<00:01:36.380> two<00:01:36.979> pieces

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
to make it look good and then two pieces

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.889 
to make it look good and then two pieces
now<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.460> made<00:01:37.610> two<00:01:37.729> of<00:01:37.759> these<00:01:37.940> sandwich<00:01:38.720> them

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
now you made two of these sandwich them

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.070 
now you made two of these sandwich them
together<00:01:38.990> with<00:01:39.650> a<00:01:39.680> spacer<00:01:40.220> in<00:01:40.250> between<00:01:40.369> them

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
together with a spacer in between them

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.780 
together with a spacer in between them
barely<00:01:42.080> eight<00:01:42.380> inch<00:01:42.560> spacer<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.130> then<00:01:43.460> caulk

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
barely eight inch spacer and then caulk

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.280 
barely eight inch spacer and then caulk
the<00:01:43.820> two<00:01:44.060> together<00:01:44.210> we<00:01:44.720> want<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:44.960> little<00:01:45.110> bit<00:01:45.229> of

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
the two together we want a little bit of

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.320 
the two together we want a little bit of
a<00:01:45.350> space<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:45.740> between<00:01:45.770> those<00:01:46.189> two<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.060> we<00:01:47.180> can

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
a space in between those two so we can

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.350 
a space in between those two so we can
put<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:48.409> fluid<00:01:48.590> from<00:01:48.920> one<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.610> those<00:01:49.700> glow

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
put the the fluid from one of those glow

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.460 
put the the fluid from one of those glow
sticks

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
sticks

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.380 
sticks
I<00:01:51.500> bought<00:01:52.159> a<00:01:52.189> bunch<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.490> glow<00:01:52.640> sticks<00:01:52.939> broke

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
I bought a bunch of glow sticks broke

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.780 
I bought a bunch of glow sticks broke
them<00:01:53.570> open<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.080> then<00:01:54.619> poured<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.369> glue<00:01:55.759> to

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
them open and then poured the glue to

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.630 
them open and then poured the glue to
glow<00:01:56.180> inside<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.990> sword<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:58.040> that's<00:01:58.280> about<00:01:58.369> it

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
glow inside the sword so that's about it

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.760 
glow inside the sword so that's about it
I<00:01:58.700> cut<00:01:59.000> holes<00:01:59.210> and<00:01:59.479> then<00:01:59.900> once<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.320> stuff<00:02:00.560> is

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
I cut holes and then once the stuff is

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.249 
I cut holes and then once the stuff is
inside<00:02:01.700> then<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.299> plugged<00:02:02.720> up<00:02:02.840> those<00:02:03.020> holes
