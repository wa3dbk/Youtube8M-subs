00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.099
 jesus christ is much more than estoril open 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.770
 is much more than a memory 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.379
 even here it is perceived 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.869
 I spent a moment 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.129
 resurrected from the dead 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.539
 iniesta 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.409
 brought new video for each person 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:22.669
 calling 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.589
 continually inviting each of us to be part of his family 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.270
 even if the screen always has that domain of defense and the city hall 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.800
 every year when it finally finished packing all the population 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.240
 the way I still feel I do not need it 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.250
 So I remember Christmas interfering. 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.990
 I really felt very sad. 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.560
 in my little daughter girl who had three years in the campaign 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 was helping me small human trade 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.160
 when she made me an interesting 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.900
 she secured in her little hands a baby Jesus after she 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.940
 Besides that 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.600
 This is the real Jesus. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.970
 I could not even 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.100
 there since she was so early 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 later after being released 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.220
 our intention is to show and dominate by the middle of the psi 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.660
 feeling the lack of maintenance of about 500 rpm 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.940
 and suddenly I felt a strong desire from her 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 although I really did not know very well how to do 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.300
 I just said 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.620
 the Blues 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.450
 It's not right 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.540
 I'm dealing with just like porcelain baby 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.180
 the driver as seated this celebration 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.060
 and also 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.200
 my own life 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.520
 But now I feel I need you a lot. 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.980
 the gentlemen 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.880
 with my whole life and let me know who really wants more 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.920
 although it takes precedence of five months 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 I'm sure he heard me and answered 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.969
 This changed much more than just the meaning of Christmas. 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.569
 here has not changed - said 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:28.539
 they are made 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:51.019
 and I scored
