00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.129
 Today is drum instructor Yoshikazu Ikewaki This time I'm sitting this time 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.070
 I would like to introduce bell instrument called lessons video attached to the instrument called Kangwon 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.210
 I'm sorry 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:28.340
 Pou dou dou sounds like this when it comes to high end 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:30.350
 You get in the middle is just a such a sound I have was also next to something in Yokomo 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.430
 I can beat 4 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:37.180
 after 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.980
 I wonder if I look at the heel to this heel 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.980
 Check it out and put it in the bass 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:57.190
 I'm not going to use it as much as I am, but I can also make sounds with heels 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:57.190
 You can also change the sound by suppressing the order cormorant cat in Atofukurahagi 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:07.770
 Hey this kind of thing is changing 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.880
 Bus First, at this point ship harbor you or can is full use when I play many such of the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.790
 Drum and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.850
 It looks like the end 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.850
 eh 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.930
 Second rhythm and balance 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:29.370
 Right here 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.370
 When I can do almost Dawn I expect some pretty fast songs 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:58.340
 Good time and good time ago 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:00.400
 I also spread the width of the see you I mean whether a like me to I cymbals Toka wind chime play 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.400
 I will 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 th 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:23.170
 It is interesting that I think that the range of the performance will also expand, so it is because the company is not the opposite 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.170
 It sounds like it's like using it again 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.680
 ãƒ¼ 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.360
 I will not do any kind of correspondence 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.800
 It is praised that there is such a thing 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.240
 I think 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.720
 I was also small fingered 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.080
 I want to ring 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.700
 I use various techniques 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.280
 Yeah 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.650
 Various 5 patterns will be able to do that 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.170
 That's right 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.280
 (2) You can actually do something quite like this with a rhythm like Basto Pao. 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.420
 Because I will stand 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.290
 ko is the day 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.290
 Sound of snare if opened 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:21.200
 Or I made intense 6 pretty Hey easier 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:25.040
 There are many possibilities This is possible by all means 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.010
 I think it would be interesting to hit the ground floor of those who are interested 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.409
 Hmm 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:36.079
 In structure and whether the parent anymore really newspaper 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:39.650
 It is a box that is worn beautifully . There is a hole in the back and strings of guitar etc. in the inside. 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:42.590
 As a bell or something like this sounds 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.510
 Has been two sealed 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.510
 I say a box in Spanish 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.170
 Cajon 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.100
 Or say I either I think the real or Nikaho wheat better way 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.230
 Whole volume fraction or phone but I have not you What fan 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.110
 Because it is quite good to carry 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:07.380
 Hey Toka when the drum set dont have 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:12.510
 Rider house car that drum set does not enter 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:15.120
 The cafe and cover are tense when playing in that place 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:21.169
 That's how it feels like that 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.169
 It was me I also Ah youtube was moving to say something like this in the Cajon 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.500
 Only had to look at there I also If you are interested in if so whether you are delivering now lessons video 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.009
 I'm happy 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.669
 Then 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.669
