00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
to put that into my calculator just to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.840 
to put that into my calculator just to
keep<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.680> hand<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.869> what<00:01:34.670> we're<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
we're doing apples so five apples going

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.450 
we're doing apples so five apples going
to<00:01:47.430> four<00:01:47.729> baskets<00:01:48.439> right<00:01:49.439> now<00:01:49.590> five<00:01:49.890> apples<00:01:50.280> go

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
to four baskets right now five apples go

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.120 
to four baskets right now five apples go
into<00:01:50.759> one<00:01:51.149> basket<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.990> am<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.170> saying<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.770> 20

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
into one basket what am I saying so 20

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.920 
into one basket what am I saying so 20
go<00:01:53.280> into<00:01:53.490> four<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.939> that's<00:01:54.119> my<00:01:54.299> setup<00:01:54.780> because

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
go into four so that's my setup because

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.709 
go into four so that's my setup because
i<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.680> want<00:01:55.860> some<00:01:56.250> baskets<00:01:56.729> work<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.360> two

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
i don't want some baskets work with two

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.630 
i don't want some baskets work with two
apples<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.530> some<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:58.920> three<00:01:59.250> because

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
apples in it and some with three because

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.730 
apples in it and some with three because
that<00:01:59.820> gets<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.479> annoying<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.590> is

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that gets really annoying and this is

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.569 
that gets really annoying and this is
the<00:02:01.860> fastest<00:02:02.340> way<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.590> i<00:02:05.369> did

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
the fastest way to do it so and i did

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.730 
the fastest way to do it so and i did
the<00:02:05.790> complete<00:02:06.360> opposite<00:02:06.869> one<00:02:07.200> right<00:02:07.469> there

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the complete opposite one right there

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.619 
the complete opposite one right there

price check this now remember this is
unit<00:03:13.380> price<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:14.610> regular<00:03:15.030> price<00:03:15.299> so<00:03:15.860> we

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
unit price and like regular price so we

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.940 
unit price and like regular price so we
will<00:03:17.160> be<00:03:17.400> making<00:03:17.579> slight<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.420> will<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.769> will

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
will be making slight I will it will

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.670 
will be making slight I will it will
we'll<00:03:20.760> be<00:03:20.880> making<00:03:21.209> more<00:03:21.420> because<00:03:21.840> people<00:03:22.170> buy

percent under because I'm I do that and

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.750 
percent under because I'm I do that and
so<00:03:54.030> 46<00:03:54.690> k<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.380> let's<00:03:55.560> see<00:03:55.799> how<00:03:55.829> much<00:03:56.190> profit<00:03:56.489> we

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
so 46 k so let's see how much profit we

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.530 
so 46 k so let's see how much profit we
made<00:03:57.000> okay<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:57.870> we<00:03:58.170> made<00:03:58.380> 24<00:03:59.340> k<00:03:59.670> approximately

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
made okay so we made 24 k approximately

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.000 
made okay so we made 24 k approximately
in<00:04:00.720> one<00:04:01.260> minute<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:01.889> 24<00:04:02.489> k<00:04:02.790> +<00:04:03.030> 1<00:04:03.060> minute<00:04:03.569> that's

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
in one minute so 24 k + 1 minute that's

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.580 
in one minute so 24 k + 1 minute that's
really<00:04:05.010> really<00:04:05.459> good<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:06.150> if<00:04:06.959> we<00:04:07.079> multiply

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
really really good and if we multiply

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:14.150 
really really good and if we multiply
that<00:04:08.069> by<00:04:08.510> 60<00:04:11.060> we<00:04:12.060> get<00:04:12.440> 1<00:04:13.440> million<00:04:13.709> four<00:04:14.130> hundred

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
that by 60 we get 1 million four hundred

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.340 
that by 60 we get 1 million four hundred
and<00:04:14.609> forty<00:04:14.910> thousand<00:04:15.480> per<00:04:16.079> hour<00:04:16.940> so<00:04:18.350> let's

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
and forty thousand per hour so let's

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.490 
and forty thousand per hour so let's
just<00:04:19.590> say<00:04:19.739> 1<00:04:20.039> million<00:04:20.519> through<00:04:21.030> 1.5<00:04:21.959> million

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
just say 1 million through 1.5 million

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.850 
just say 1 million through 1.5 million
per<00:04:23.280> hour<00:04:23.550> are<00:04:23.940> actually<00:04:24.780> no<00:04:24.930> 1.4<00:04:25.620> million

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
per hour are actually no 1.4 million

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.530 
per hour are actually no 1.4 million
because<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.610> think<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:27.000> did

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
because I think I did

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.510 
because I think I did
I a<00:04:27.630> little<00:04:28.170> bit<00:04:28.320> under<00:04:28.620> price<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:29.190> think<00:04:29.460> I

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
I a little bit under price I think I

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.800 
I a little bit under price I think I
just<00:04:29.550> got<00:04:29.880> lucky<00:04:30.030> because<00:04:30.300> someone<00:04:30.720> was

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
just got lucky because someone was

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.680 
just got lucky because someone was
selling<00:04:30.990> them<00:04:31.170> a<00:04:31.350> bit<00:04:31.620> under<00:04:31.920> price<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:32.910> let's

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
selling them a bit under price so let's

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
selling them a bit under price so let's
just<00:04:33.870> say<00:04:34.050> one<00:04:34.320> mil<00:04:34.530> thru<00:04:34.890> 1.4<00:04:35.100> mil<00:04:35.970> per<00:04:36.420> hour

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
just say one mil thru 1.4 mil per hour

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.470 
just say one mil thru 1.4 mil per hour

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
on runescape it requires just a bit

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.090
