00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.400 

all<00:00:01.199> righty<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:02.090> just<00:00:03.090> got<00:00:03.360> done<00:00:03.600> putting<00:00:04.259> most

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
all righty I just got done putting most

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.680 
all righty I just got done putting most
of<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.150> components<00:00:06.150> into<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.660> board<00:00:08.690> here's

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
of the components into the board here's

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:19.820 
of the components into the board here's
my<00:00:09.900> board<00:00:17.930> back<00:00:18.930> up<00:00:19.199> quite<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.500> bit<00:00:19.710> of

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
my board back up quite a bit of

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.420 
my board back up quite a bit of
soldering<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> do<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:22.430> in

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
soldering you have to do to this in

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.900 
soldering you have to do to this in
anyway<00:00:24.380> it's<00:00:25.380> kind<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.980> tough<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.519> from<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
anyway it's kind of tough to do from the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.929 
anyway it's kind of tough to do from the
picture<00:00:27.390> there's<00:00:27.630> some<00:00:27.869> online<00:00:28.939> documents

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
picture there's some online documents

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.729 
picture there's some online documents
too<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.949> kind<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> used<00:00:32.489> them<00:00:32.669> both<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.739> also

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
too so I kind of used them both I also

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.209 
too so I kind of used them both I also
get<00:00:35.640> online<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.360> pulled<00:00:36.630> up<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:37.219> resistor

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
get online and pulled up a resistor

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.350 
get online and pulled up a resistor
color<00:00:38.489> chart<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:40.550> capacitors<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:42.030> was

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
color chart the capacitors on here was

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.520 
color chart the capacitors on here was
it<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.440> kind<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> confusing<00:00:45.110> because<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.379> get

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
it was kind of confusing because you get

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
it was kind of confusing because you get
some<00:00:46.710> green<00:00:46.980> ones<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.969> these<00:00:48.239> yellow

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
some green ones there and these yellow

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.189 
some green ones there and these yellow
ones<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:49.110> kind<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.649> tan<00:00:49.950> colour<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:51.719> orange

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
ones are kind of tan colour and orange

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.850 
ones are kind of tan colour and orange
each<00:00:52.469> looking<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> things<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.969> anyway<00:00:54.860> how

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
each looking the things but anyway how

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.540 
each looking the things but anyway how
many<00:00:56.100> -<00:00:57.170> pretty<00:00:58.170> much<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.620> looked<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.430> this

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
many - pretty much I just looked at this

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.180 
many - pretty much I just looked at this
picture<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.440> matched<00:01:01.440> everything<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
picture it matched everything up the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.109 
picture it matched everything up the
best<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.579> could<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.120> picture

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
best I could with that picture

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.820 
best I could with that picture
so<00:01:06.119> anyway<00:01:06.540> there's<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.110> board<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.470> don't<00:01:07.500> have

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
so anyway there's the board I don't have

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.330 
so anyway there's the board I don't have
any<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.659> ICS<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> yet

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
any of the ICS here in it yet

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.789 
any of the ICS here in it yet
I'm<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.720> plug<00:01:12.960> those<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.710> I'm

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
I'm not going to plug those in so I'm

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.890 
I'm not going to plug those in so I'm
ready<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.310> start<00:01:15.210> running<00:01:15.479> through<00:01:15.780> my

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
ready to start running through my

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.990 
ready to start running through my
calibration<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.920> testing<00:01:16.979> things<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
calibration and testing things so I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.649 
calibration and testing things so I
don't<00:01:18.090> bun<00:01:18.439> burn<00:01:19.439> those<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.369> still<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
don't bun burn those up I still have to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
don't bun burn those up I still have to
switch<00:01:23.000> my<00:01:24.000> headphone<00:01:24.509> jack<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.189> here's<00:01:26.520> all

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
switch my headphone jack and here's all

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.609 
switch my headphone jack and here's all
your<00:01:26.880> volume<00:01:28.220> knobs<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.939> volume

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
your volume knobs and volume

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.990 
your volume knobs and volume
potentiometers<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.479> my<00:01:33.770> pzo<00:01:34.770> buzzer<00:01:35.369> there

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.950 

so<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.720> my<00:01:39.869> meter<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.799> anyway<00:01:41.630> that's<00:01:42.630> per

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
so in my meter but anyway that's per

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.560 
so in my meter but anyway that's per
where<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:43.710> at<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:44.670> my<00:01:44.909> next<00:01:45.149> step<00:01:45.390> would

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
where I'm at now now my next step would

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.260 
where I'm at now now my next step would
be<00:01:45.630> gathered<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:46.649> some<00:01:46.680> wire<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.119> go

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
be gathered up some wire so I can go

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.609 
be gathered up some wire so I can go
ahead<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.479> start<00:01:48.810> putting<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.140> these<00:01:49.320> pots

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
ahead and start putting all these pots

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.100 
ahead and start putting all these pots
on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.820> board

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
on the board

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.030 
on the board
my<00:01:52.500> switches<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.280> whatnot<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.799> then<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.890> could

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
my switches and whatnot and then I could

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.469 
my switches and whatnot and then I could
hook<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.219> up<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> my<00:01:56.520> coil<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.180> then<00:01:57.299> some

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
hook it up to my coil and then some

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.170 
hook it up to my coil and then some
power<00:01:57.719> tests<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:59.189> then<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.610> course<00:01:59.820> an<00:02:00.000> X

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
power tests and then of course an X

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.630 
power tests and then of course an X
would<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.680> working<00:02:01.680> on<00:02:01.799> my<00:02:01.920> box<00:02:02.189> I'm<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.579> to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
would be working on my box I'm going to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.539 
would be working on my box I'm going to
mount<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.439> far<00:02:04.680> things<00:02:05.159> went<00:02:05.369> real

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
mount it in but so far things went real

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.990 
mount it in but so far things went real
smooth<00:02:05.939> really<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.670> take<00:02:08.879> your

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
smooth really you just really take your

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.669 
smooth really you just really take your
time<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:09.929> really<00:02:10.170> need<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.349> take<00:02:10.530> your

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
time you just really need to take your

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.910 
time you just really need to take your
time<00:02:10.920> because

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
time because

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.089 
time because
this<00:02:12.310> kids<00:02:12.580> definitely<00:02:13.050> not<00:02:14.050> for<00:02:14.319> beginners<00:02:14.470> I

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
this kids definitely not for beginners I

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.550 
this kids definitely not for beginners I
mean<00:02:15.670> like<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.060> doesn't<00:02:16.270> say<00:02:16.599> this<00:02:16.870> resistor

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
mean like it doesn't say this resistor

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.900 
mean like it doesn't say this resistor
goes<00:02:18.310> here<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:20.470> get<00:02:20.709> old<00:02:20.890> resistors<00:02:21.459> in<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.670> bag

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
goes here you get old resistors in a bag

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.660 
goes here you get old resistors in a bag
you<00:02:22.750> have<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.020> figure<00:02:23.230> out<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.590> value<00:02:24.130> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
you have to figure out the value and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.130 
you have to figure out the value and
then<00:02:24.880> it'll<00:02:25.120> show<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.330> what<00:02:25.540> value<00:02:25.959> goes

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
then it'll show you what value goes

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.860 
then it'll show you what value goes
where<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.940> polarities<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.120> whatnot<00:02:28.510> things

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
where and polarities and whatnot things

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.140 
where and polarities and whatnot things
like<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.319> so<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.430> do<00:02:30.640> have<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.910> have<00:02:31.030> a

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
like that so you do have to have a
