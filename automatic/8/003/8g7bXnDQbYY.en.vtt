 kinder bueno cake 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.280

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.590
 facebook divided recipes to where it is 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.560
 become a real catchphrase 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.590
 to make it we need 150 g of 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.439

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.930
 then we will need a jar of vanillin 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.789
 broken or a spreadable cream you can 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.010
 find the md and that remembers so much 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.570
 the flavor of the kinder bueno and for the 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.300
 decoration is a couple of tablespoons of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.570
 nutella chopped hazelnuts and of the kinder 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.660
 instead of mold we will use the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.399
 very famous crafty Greek mold it was for 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.989
 the first thing we put in a saucepan the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.780
 butter and let it melt on fire 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:55.620
 low or microwave 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:58.760
 we put the eggs in a bowl 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.760
 sugar and mix 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.470
 after letting it cool 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.420
 add to the melted butter some drops of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.010
 vanilla flavoring 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.880
 mix and add the thread to the 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.880
 egg and sugar mixture 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:37.220
 also add the milk and milk 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.120
 sifted flour to which we already have 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.120
 added the yeast 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.770
 naturally absorbed the whole 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.810
 flour we just have to pour the 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.539
 compound in the buttered mold e 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.360
 floured we use in a preheated oven 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.509
 for 20 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.550
 always do the toothpick test when there 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.830
 our base will be ready and cooled 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.569
 turn the long solo e over 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.569
 let's do it with the we create a cocoa 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.800
 we reveal to drink and the cake is already 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.420
 we just have to decorate it with 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.640
 nutella and a syringe for sweets 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.290
 like this thin we create circles 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.890
 starting from the center and then arriving 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.890
 on the outside 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.970
 then with the help of a toothpick 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.970
 we give a formal decoration 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.600
 then we also add hazelnuts 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.600
 chop along the edges and in the middle 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:53.319
 and finally we complete with pieces of 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:55.120

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.849
