sorts of ways I don't have to tell you

so<00:00:59.879> garden<00:01:00.210> centers<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.600> already<00:01:00.930> part<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
so garden centers are already part of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.020 
so garden centers are already part of
the<00:01:01.260> solution<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.190> maybe<00:01:02.399> there<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:02.760> you

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
the solution but maybe there is more you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 
the solution but maybe there is more you
could<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.390> doing<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.989> whatever<00:01:04.260> you're<00:01:04.439> doing

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
could be doing and whatever you're doing

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.550 
could be doing and whatever you're doing
maybe<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.850> could<00:01:06.030> make<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> better<00:01:06.420> known<00:01:06.750> so

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
maybe you could make it better known so

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.929 
maybe you could make it better known so
i'm<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> show<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.070> 10<00:01:08.490> real<00:01:08.700> life

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
but we know that there are lots of tough

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.760 
but we know that there are lots of tough
non-natives<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.899> practically<00:01:55.290> take<00:01:55.590> care

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
non-natives that practically take care

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.179 
non-natives that practically take care
of<00:01:55.860> themselves<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.790> daylilies<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.540> hostas

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
of themselves the daylilies the hostas

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.230 
of themselves the daylilies the hostas
but<00:01:59.189> they're<00:01:59.340> not<00:01:59.430> being<00:01:59.670> promoted<00:01:59.939> as

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
but they're not being promoted as

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.030 
but they're not being promoted as
eco-friendly<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.290> guess<00:02:01.560> that's<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
eco-friendly and I guess that's up to

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.670 
eco-friendly and I guess that's up to
you<00:02:02.329> now<00:02:03.329> when<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.540> promote<00:02:03.930> these<00:02:04.110> plans<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
you now when I promote these plans I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.940 
you now when I promote these plans I
sometimes<00:02:05.189> use<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.549> term<00:02:05.750> self-sustaining

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
sometimes use the term self-sustaining

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.169 
sometimes use the term self-sustaining
because<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.099> conveys<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.849> not<00:02:09.119> just

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
because it conveys that it's not just

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.750 
because it conveys that it's not just
eco-friendly<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.379> also<00:02:10.560> low<00:02:10.890> maintenance
