00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.380 

yeah<00:00:13.639> I<00:00:14.049> want<00:00:15.049> to<00:00:15.110> show<00:00:15.259> you<00:00:15.320> another<00:00:16.180> part<00:00:17.180> of

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
yeah I want to show you another part of

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.689 
yeah I want to show you another part of
this<00:00:17.480> system<00:00:17.779> that's<00:00:18.199> kind<00:00:18.439> of<00:00:18.500> unique<00:00:18.680> if<00:00:19.099> you

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
this system that's kind of unique if you

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.159 
this system that's kind of unique if you
have<00:00:19.939> a<00:00:19.970> case<00:00:20.390> a<00:00:21.579> combination<00:00:22.579> case<00:00:22.849> or<00:00:23.239> if<00:00:23.930> you

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
have a case a combination case or if you

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.100 
have a case a combination case or if you
if<00:00:24.410> you<00:00:24.619> have<00:00:25.119> you<00:00:26.119> need<00:00:26.270> to<00:00:26.390> make<00:00:26.570> transfer

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
if you have you need to make transfer

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.560 
if you have you need to make transfer
dies<00:00:27.320> this<00:00:27.980> used<00:00:28.400> to<00:00:28.520> be<00:00:28.640> my<00:00:28.789> worst<00:00:29.029> nightmare

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
dies this used to be my worst nightmare

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.990 
dies this used to be my worst nightmare
I<00:00:29.809> would<00:00:30.469> have<00:00:30.680> a<00:00:30.710> ceramic<00:00:31.160> bridge<00:00:31.640> that<00:00:31.910> I

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
I would have a ceramic bridge that I

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.569 
I would have a ceramic bridge that I
needed<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.419> do<00:00:32.599> precision<00:00:32.989> attachments<00:00:33.829> and<00:00:33.980> I

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
needed to do precision attachments and I

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.080 
needed to do precision attachments and I
would<00:00:34.730> use<00:00:35.079> something<00:00:36.079> like<00:00:36.579> utility<00:00:37.579> wax<00:00:37.760> red

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
would use something like utility wax red

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.180 
would use something like utility wax red
utility<00:00:38.600> wax<00:00:38.809> and<00:00:39.020> I<00:00:39.050> apply<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.410> utility<00:00:39.980> wax

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
utility wax and I apply the utility wax

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.510 
utility wax and I apply the utility wax
into<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.270> Crown's<00:00:41.750> then<00:00:42.110> use<00:00:42.739> some<00:00:42.949> Doorly

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
into the Crown's then use some Doorly

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.090 
into the Crown's then use some Doorly
and<00:00:43.789> make<00:00:43.940> some<00:00:44.120> little<00:00:44.270> pins<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.410> don't

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
and make some little pins and I don't

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.569 
and make some little pins and I don't
know<00:00:46.190> how<00:00:46.340> you<00:00:46.400> do<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.790> transfer<00:00:47.210> dies<00:00:47.470> but

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
know how you do the transfer dies but

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.850 
know how you do the transfer dies but
imagine<00:00:49.579> if<00:00:49.700> you<00:00:49.850> will<00:00:50.060> you<00:00:50.989> take<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.290> threaded

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
imagine if you will you take a threaded

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.260 
imagine if you will you take a threaded
pin<00:00:55.329> some<00:00:56.329> of<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:56.510> hot<00:00:56.690> melt<00:00:56.930> material<00:00:58.270> put

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
pin some of the hot melt material put

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.660 
pin some of the hot melt material put
the<00:00:59.420> hot<00:00:59.570> melt<00:00:59.780> material<00:01:00.290> into<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.770> coping<00:01:01.040> I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.889 

like<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.820> push<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:05.180> make<00:01:05.299> sure<00:01:05.329> it<00:01:05.570> goes<00:01:05.689> all

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
like to push it make sure it goes all

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.870 
like to push it make sure it goes all
the<00:01:05.930> way<00:01:06.079> in<00:01:06.320> if<00:01:06.439> you<00:01:06.530> have<00:01:06.710> an<00:01:07.070> especially

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
the way in if you have an especially

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.929 
the way in if you have an especially
long<00:01:08.180> crown<00:01:09.189> it'll<00:01:10.189> give<00:01:10.430> some<00:01:10.610> rigidity

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
long crown it'll give some rigidity

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.670 
long crown it'll give some rigidity
because<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.540> is<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:11.689> little<00:01:11.990> bit<00:01:12.079> flexible<00:01:12.320> and

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
because it is a little bit flexible and

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.289 
because it is a little bit flexible and
that's<00:01:12.799> what<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:12.950> like<00:01:13.189> about<00:01:13.219> it<00:01:13.579> if<00:01:13.969> you<00:01:14.090> had<00:01:14.270> a

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
that's what I like about it if you had a

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.739 
that's what I like about it if you had a
larger<00:01:15.100> gun<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.369> larger<00:01:16.700> melt<00:01:16.939> gun<00:01:17.180> you

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
larger gun a larger melt gun you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.120 
larger gun a larger melt gun you
wouldn't<00:01:17.990> be<00:01:18.049> able<00:01:18.229> to<00:01:18.289> get<00:01:18.439> down<00:01:18.649> into<00:01:18.889> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
wouldn't be able to get down into the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.340 
wouldn't be able to get down into the
Crown's<00:01:19.459> so<00:01:20.359> you<00:01:20.450> can<00:01:20.630> go<00:01:20.749> right<00:01:20.959> into<00:01:21.170> the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
Crown's so you can go right into the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.410 
Crown's so you can go right into the
very<00:01:21.530> tip<00:01:21.799> and<00:01:22.009> come<00:01:22.249> out<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.549> just<00:01:22.789> put<00:01:23.209> it<00:01:23.299> in

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
very tip and come out and just put it in

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.319 
very tip and come out and just put it in
all<00:01:23.719> in<00:01:23.899> one<00:01:24.109> seamless<00:01:24.759> flow<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.090> dyes

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
all in one seamless flow and the dyes

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.879 
all in one seamless flow and the dyes
will<00:01:26.569> come<00:01:26.719> out<00:01:26.869> really<00:01:27.200> nice<00:01:27.439> and<00:01:27.469> beautiful

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
will come out really nice and beautiful

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:30.669 
will come out really nice and beautiful
the<00:01:28.670> bridges<00:01:29.119> come<00:01:29.329> off<00:01:29.479> real<00:01:29.779> clean<00:01:30.170> there's

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
the bridges come off real clean there's

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.279 
the bridges come off real clean there's
a<00:01:30.770> little<00:01:31.069> bit<00:01:31.219> of<00:01:31.369> flexibility<00:01:32.029> that<00:01:32.929> the

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
a little bit of flexibility that the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.889 
a little bit of flexibility that the
margins<00:01:33.770> don't<00:01:34.009> break<00:01:34.399> and<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:35.270> happens<00:01:35.749> in

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
margins don't break and it happens in

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.550 
margins don't break and it happens in
just<00:01:36.619> seconds<00:01:37.389> so<00:01:38.389> there<00:01:38.630> we<00:01:38.749> have<00:01:38.959> ready<00:01:39.350> to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
just seconds so there we have ready to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.789 
just seconds so there we have ready to
pour<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.159> you<00:01:40.850> have<00:01:41.029> a<00:01:41.060> nice<00:01:41.359> rigid<00:01:41.869> result<00:01:42.649> at

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
pour and you have a nice rigid result at

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.359 
pour and you have a nice rigid result at
the<00:01:42.829> end<00:01:44.259> these<00:01:45.259> threaded<00:01:45.590> pins<00:01:45.920> hold<00:01:46.249> the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
the end these threaded pins hold the

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.519 
the end these threaded pins hold the
material<00:01:46.789> into<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.090> die<00:01:47.329> stone<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:47.990> it's

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:48.529 
material into the die stone and it's

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:49.959 
material into the die stone and it's
great<00:01:48.770> because<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.249> has<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.429> little<00:01:49.700> bit<00:01:49.880> of

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
great because it has a little bit of

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.349 
great because it has a little bit of
flexibility<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:50.869> now<00:01:51.799> we<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:52.909> some<00:01:53.119> dyes

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
flexibility so now we have some dyes

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.139 
flexibility so now we have some dyes
that<00:01:53.959> will<00:01:54.590> release<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.009> Crown's<00:01:55.490> but<00:01:55.939> yet

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
that will release the Crown's but yet

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.569 
that will release the Crown's but yet
the<00:01:56.329> margin<00:01:56.810> are<00:01:56.929> still<00:01:57.200> in<00:01:57.349> stone<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:57.950> the

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
the margin are still in stone and the

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.010 
the margin are still in stone and the
ceramic<00:01:59.060> doesn't<00:01:59.389> break<00:01:59.569> and<00:01:59.779> you<00:01:59.840> have<00:01:59.990> a

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
ceramic doesn't break and you have a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.249 
ceramic doesn't break and you have a
real<00:02:00.289> nice<00:02:00.469> accurate<00:02:01.149> durable<00:02:02.149> model<00:02:02.959> that

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
real nice accurate durable model that

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.230 
real nice accurate durable model that
you<00:02:03.349> can<00:02:03.499> put<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.310> bridge<00:02:04.579> off<00:02:04.849> and<00:02:05.119> on

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
you can put the bridge off and on

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.320 
you can put the bridge off and on
without<00:02:06.609> super-accurate<00:02:07.609> without<00:02:08.060> any

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
without super-accurate without any

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:31.390 
without super-accurate without any
breakage<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.560> anyway<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.069> just<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.580> easy

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.459 

you
