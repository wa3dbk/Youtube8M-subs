00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
back it's engraved in and i would get

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.050 
back it's engraved in and i would get
this<00:02:27.760> figure<00:02:28.240> if<00:02:28.480> you're<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.350> halo<00:02:29.680> fan<00:02:30.060> but

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
then again if you think recons for noobs

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.110 
then again if you think recons for noobs
i<00:02:33.450> do<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.830> game<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:36.070> have<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:36.970> don't
