in<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.070> wisp<00:03:26.220> tiny<00:03:26.640> before<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.000> I've<00:03:27.090> seen<00:03:27.239> it

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
in the wisp tiny before and I've seen it

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.240 
in the wisp tiny before and I've seen it
a<00:03:27.390> couple<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.690> times<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.709> very<00:03:28.950> it's<00:03:29.160> very

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
a couple of times it's very it's very

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.370 
a couple of times it's very it's very
similar<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.760> TC<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.420> fact<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.840> don't<00:03:30.959> know<00:03:31.110> for

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
similar to TC in fact I don't know for

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.540 
similar to TC in fact I don't know for
sure<00:03:31.410> but<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:31.800> think<00:03:32.040> they've<00:03:32.160> gotten<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.519> just

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
sure but I think they've gotten it just

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.009 
sure but I think they've gotten it just
from<00:03:32.790> watching<00:03:33.090> his<00:03:33.209> replays<00:03:33.600> because<00:03:33.870> it's

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
from watching his replays because it's

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.540 
from watching his replays because it's
pretty<00:03:34.140> much<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.470> same<00:03:34.500> build<00:03:34.860> phase<00:03:35.340> boots

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
pretty much the same build phase boots

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.880 
pretty much the same build phase boots
drum<00:03:36.150> Yasha<00:03:36.870> then<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.470> normally<00:03:37.709> get<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
drum Yasha then you normally get the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.310 
drum Yasha then you normally get the
items<00:03:38.250> go<00:03:38.370> back<00:03:38.550> for<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.850> Manta<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.959> nice<00:03:40.110> as<00:03:40.290> a

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
items go back for the Manta so nice as a

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.289 
items go back for the Manta so nice as a
BKB<00:03:40.680> thrown<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.160> there<00:03:41.280> if<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.459> need<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.730> but

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
BKB thrown in there if you need it but

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.850 
BKB thrown in there if you need it but
the<00:03:42.690> thing<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.019> was<00:03:43.110> surprising<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.709> me<00:03:43.830> is

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
the thing that was surprising to me is

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.650 
the thing that was surprising to me is
that<00:03:44.040> he<00:03:44.310> didn't<00:03:44.519> stop<00:03:44.760> there<00:03:45.060> like<00:03:45.330> normally

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
that he didn't stop there like normally

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.210 
that he didn't stop there like normally
the<00:03:45.780> game<00:03:45.900> ends<00:03:46.200> at<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.380> point<00:03:46.620> but<00:03:46.799> no<00:03:46.980> he

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
the game ends at that point but no he

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.479 
the game ends at that point but no he
gets<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.489> butterfly<00:03:47.970> he<00:03:48.570> gets<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.900> Daedalus<00:03:49.489> he

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
gets a butterfly he gets a Daedalus he

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.759 
gets a butterfly he gets a Daedalus he
could<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:50.910> had<00:03:51.110> it's<00:03:52.110> weird<00:03:52.380> with<00:03:52.530> tiny

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
could have had it's weird with tiny

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.110 
could have had it's weird with tiny
because<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.070> could<00:03:53.250> get<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.400> divine<00:03:53.700> rapier

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
because you could get a divine rapier

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.610 
because you could get a divine rapier
but<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.570> it<00:03:54.720> really<00:03:54.930> been<00:03:55.080> that<00:03:55.110> good<00:03:55.350> he's

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
but is it really been that good he's

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.140 
but is it really been that good he's
already<00:03:55.830> kidding<00:03:56.250> for<00:03:56.430> like<00:03:56.519> poor<00:03:56.760> hunter

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
already kidding for like poor hunter

well<00:04:34.210> at<00:04:34.270> this<00:04:34.390> event<00:04:35.220> but<00:04:36.220> I've<00:04:36.310> been<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.430> big

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
well at this event but I've been a big

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.460 
well at this event but I've been a big
fan<00:04:36.790> of<00:04:36.820> them<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.330> actually<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.140> was<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.260> one

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
fan of them I actually that was the one

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.470 
fan of them I actually that was the one
team<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.920> picked<00:04:39.190> DK<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.550> beat<00:04:39.760> them<00:04:39.970> in<00:04:40.060> a<00:04:40.120> 2-1

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
team I picked DK to beat them in a 2-1

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.760 
team I picked DK to beat them in a 2-1
but<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.690> thought<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:41.020> could<00:04:41.110> go<00:04:41.200> either<00:04:41.320> way<00:04:41.410> and

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
but I thought it could go either way and

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.590 
but I thought it could go either way and
then<00:04:42.160> today<00:04:42.370> again<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.760> picked<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.270> picked

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
then today again I picked I picked

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.140 
then today again I picked I picked
against<00:04:44.110> Navi<00:04:44.440> so<00:04:44.740> I'm<00:04:45.220> not<00:04:45.490> gonna<00:04:45.700> be<00:04:45.910> fooled

against Navi so I'm not gonna be fooled

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.580 
against Navi so I'm not gonna be fooled

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
a third time I'm gonna have to go with

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.100 
a third time I'm gonna have to go with
Navi<00:04:47.890> in<00:04:47.980> the<00:04:48.070> grand<00:04:48.250> finals<00:04:48.610> solely<00:04:48.820> because

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
Navi in the grand finals solely because

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.480

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
me

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.640 
me
so<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.150> mean<00:04:52.690> most<00:04:52.930> people<00:04:53.170> seem<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.440> think<00:04:53.530> that

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
so I mean most people seem to think that

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.230 
so I mean most people seem to think that
LGD<00:04:54.100> is<00:04:54.220> just<00:04:54.370> gonna<00:04:54.490> sweep<00:04:54.910> through<00:04:55.120> you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
don't think that's gonna happen if

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.860 
don't think that's gonna happen if
anybody<00:04:57.820> knows<00:04:58.030> how<00:04:58.210> to<00:04:58.270> beat<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.540> Chinese

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.230 
anybody knows how to beat the Chinese
teams<00:04:59.110> encephalo<00:04:59.650> Navi<00:04:59.950> right<00:05:00.100> now<00:05:00.250> I<00:05:00.460> am

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
teams encephalo Navi right now I am

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.450 
teams encephalo Navi right now I am
hoping<00:05:01.570> for<00:05:01.750> Navi<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.050> lose<00:05:02.230> because<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:03.190> want

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
hoping for Navi to lose because I want

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.880 
hoping for Navi to lose because I want
to<00:05:03.520> see<00:05:03.670> Navi<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.090> IG<00:05:04.330> play<00:05:04.600> again<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.770> I

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
to see Navi and IG play again and I

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.560 
to see Navi and IG play again and I
think<00:05:05.950> I<00:05:06.250> think<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.640> we're<00:05:07.120> most<00:05:07.240> likely

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
think I think that we're most likely

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.880 
think I think that we're most likely
going<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:07.720> see<00:05:07.810> that<00:05:07.990> in<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.200> losers<00:05:08.770> bracket

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
going to see that in the losers bracket

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.340 
going to see that in the losers bracket
so<00:05:09.340> that<00:05:09.580> would<00:05:10.150> be<00:05:10.240> an<00:05:10.330> amazing<00:05:10.810> setup<00:05:11.050> into

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
so that would be an amazing setup into

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.660 
so that would be an amazing setup into
the<00:05:11.440> grand<00:05:11.650> finals<00:05:12.040> then<00:05:12.190> you<00:05:12.280> get<00:05:12.400> to<00:05:12.490> see<00:05:12.610> an

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
the grand finals then you get to see an

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.550 
the grand finals then you get to see an
avi<00:05:12.880> of<00:05:12.940> us<00:05:13.060> LGD<00:05:13.450> face<00:05:13.660> twice<00:05:13.900> as<00:05:14.110> well<00:05:14.230> so
