with a new one for the season which was
happen<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.770> was

happen to be the one that was that was
destroyed<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.710> had<00:01:10.920> been<00:01:11.130> we

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
destroyed and so it we had been we

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.940 
destroyed and so it we had been we
maintained<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.689> far<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> other

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
maintained it as far as all the other

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590 
maintained it as far as all the other
developments<00:01:14.549> or<00:01:14.670> modifications<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.360> we've

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
developments or modifications that we've

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.230 
developments or modifications that we've
done<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.170> two<00:01:16.619> current<00:01:17.310> car<00:01:17.490> we're<00:01:17.850> racing

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
done to the two current car we're racing

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.289 
done to the two current car we're racing
so<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:19.259> pretty<00:01:19.530> close<00:01:19.740> its<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:21.180> was

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
so it's it's pretty close its it was

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.660 
so it's it's pretty close its it was
stripped<00:01:21.570> down<00:01:21.720> quite<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> lot<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.520> do

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
stripped down quite a lot and so we do

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.010 
stripped down quite a lot and so we do
there's<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.060> lot<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.270> assembly<00:01:24.659> work<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> be

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
there's a lot of assembly work to be

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.740 
there's a lot of assembly work to be
done<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.979> once<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.000> finished<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.420> should<00:01:27.630> be

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
done but once it's finished it should be

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.740 
done but once it's finished it should be
just<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:29.009> good<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> older<00:01:29.750> we've

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
just as just as good as the older we've

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.289 
just as just as good as the older we've
had<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.990> come<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.939> disassemble<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> crash

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
had to come in and disassemble the crash

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.929 
had to come in and disassemble the crash
car<00:01:33.570> quite<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:35.369> some

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
car quite a bit to just you know some

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.340 
car quite a bit to just you know some
parts<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.360> need<00:01:36.390> some<00:01:36.780> parts<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.110> don't

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
parts that we need some parts we don't

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440 
parts that we need some parts we don't
just<00:01:38.009> sort<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.729> what's<00:01:38.939> damaged<00:01:39.329> and

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
just sort of see what's damaged and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
what's not and a lot of those parts will

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
what's not and a lot of those parts will
some<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.630> them<00:01:42.720> i<00:01:42.840> should<00:01:42.990> say<00:01:43.200> will<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.470> into

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
some of them i should say will go into

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.929 
some of them i should say will go into
the<00:01:43.950> car<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> we're<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.549> race<00:01:44.759> at

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the car that we're going to race at

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.910 
the car that we're going to race at
mosport<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> lot<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.619> did<00:01:46.740> today

mosport so a lot of what we did today

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.180 
mosport so a lot of what we did today
was<00:01:47.250> more<00:01:48.000> disassembly<00:01:48.659> now

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
was more disassembly now

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.100 
was more disassembly now
just<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.460> last<00:01:49.640> three<00:01:50.480> three<00:01:50.810> or<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.080> hours

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
just the last three three or so hours

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.380 
just the last three three or so hours
he's<00:01:51.560> actually<00:01:51.860> sort<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.670> migrated<00:01:53.180> over<00:01:53.240> to

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
he's actually sort of migrated over to

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.620 
he's actually sort of migrated over to
the<00:01:53.650> new<00:01:54.650> car<00:01:54.920> should<00:01:55.670> say<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:56.030> whole<00:01:56.240> new<00:01:56.390> car

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the new car should say a whole new car

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.550 
the new car should say a whole new car
and<00:01:57.400> started<00:01:58.400> started<00:01:58.760> assembling<00:01:59.120> so<00:01:59.630> it's

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
and started started assembling so it's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.280 
and started started assembling so it's
going<00:02:01.040> along<00:02:01.130> pretty<00:02:01.250> good<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:03.080> know<00:02:03.140> the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
going along pretty good you know the

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.120 
going along pretty good you know the
interiors<00:02:03.710> coming<00:02:04.010> along<00:02:04.190> fairly<00:02:04.820> well<00:02:06.130> some

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
interiors coming along fairly well some

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.410 
interiors coming along fairly well some
of<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.280> bodywork<00:02:07.610> starting<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:07.970> be<00:02:08.060> put<00:02:08.270> on

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
of the bodywork starting to be put on

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.500 
of the bodywork starting to be put on
now<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.979> that's<00:02:10.190> that's<00:02:10.460> a<00:02:10.610> lot<00:02:10.790> of<00:02:10.820> lot<00:02:11.480> of

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
now and that's that's a lot of lot of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.300 
now and that's that's a lot of lot of
the<00:02:11.660> work<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:11.960> we<00:02:12.020> knew<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.680> body<00:02:12.890> art<00:02:13.130> takes

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the work that we knew the body art takes

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.920 
the work that we knew the body art takes
a<00:02:13.400> lot<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.670> fit<00:02:13.850> all<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.150> stuff<00:02:14.450> out<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.840> way

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
a lot to fit all that stuff out the way

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.350 
a lot to fit all that stuff out the way
you'd<00:02:15.080> like<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.440> be<00:02:15.650> fitted<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:17.120> we<00:02:17.240> do

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
you'd like it to be fitted and we do

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.930 
you'd like it to be fitted and we do
have<00:02:17.540> spares<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.800> most<00:02:19.040> harder<00:02:19.430> already<00:02:19.730> fit

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
have spares the most harder already fit

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.270 
have spares the most harder already fit
so<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.210> will<00:02:20.780> be<00:02:20.810> thrown<00:02:21.740> together<00:02:21.920> fairly

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
so it will be thrown together fairly

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.910 
so it will be thrown together fairly
fairly<00:02:23.030> quickly<00:02:23.390> but<00:02:23.570> i<00:02:24.230> think<00:02:24.770> tomorrow

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
fairly quickly but i think tomorrow

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.590 
fairly quickly but i think tomorrow
about<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.520> time<00:02:25.700> you'll<00:02:26.090> be<00:02:26.150> able<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.450> see

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
about this time you'll be able to see

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.120 
about this time you'll be able to see
more<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.990> race<00:02:27.140> car<00:02:27.320> than<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.590> do<00:02:27.740> right<00:02:27.770> now

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
more of a race car than you do right now

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.970 
more of a race car than you do right now
the<00:02:28.940> guys<00:02:29.120> know<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.480> cars<00:02:29.690> inside<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:30.800> they

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
the guys know the cars inside so they

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.190 
the guys know the cars inside so they
pretty<00:02:31.640> much<00:02:31.730> just<00:02:31.910> know<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.960> you<00:02:33.110> don't

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
pretty much just know that you don't

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.420 
pretty much just know that you don't
have<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.410> be<00:02:33.470> told<00:02:33.680> what<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.950> do<00:02:34.070> next<00:02:34.220> they

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
have to be told what to do next they

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.450 
have to be told what to do next they
know<00:02:34.610> they<00:02:35.420> know<00:02:35.570> what<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.810> do<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.340> what<00:02:37.340> they

together fairly quickly for most of the
time<00:02:41.300> just<00:02:41.870> we've<00:02:42.620> been<00:02:42.740> working<00:02:43.520> with<00:02:43.670> these
