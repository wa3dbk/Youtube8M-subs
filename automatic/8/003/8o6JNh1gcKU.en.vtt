lava<00:00:41.460> short<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> car<00:00:42.420> was<00:00:42.570> really

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
lava short but the car was really

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.860 
lava short but the car was really
useless<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.500> every<00:00:43.739> game<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.360> changed<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
useless in every game so I changed a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.119 
useless in every game so I changed a
little<00:00:46.050> bit<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> commercial

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
little bit and this is a commercial

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.750 
little bit and this is a commercial
plane<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:47.760> now<00:00:47.840> it<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.129> nothing<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
plane right now it is nothing you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.209 
plane right now it is nothing you
usually<00:00:51.360> see<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.870> later<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.829> has<00:00:53.190> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
usually see you later so it has to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.369 
usually see you later so it has to
double<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.940> removal<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
double up by the removal it is just a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.350 
double up by the removal it is just a
very<00:00:55.530> strong<00:00:55.649> removal<00:00:56.250> card<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.180> can

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
very strong removal card because you can

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
very strong removal card because you can
combine<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.840> also<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.230> minions<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> stack<00:00:59.399> up

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
combine it also if minions to stack up

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.880 
combine it also if minions to stack up
the<00:00:59.850> attack<00:01:00.539> power<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.199> kill<00:01:01.530> bigger

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the attack power so you can kill bigger

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.979 
the attack power so you can kill bigger
minion<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.210> card<00:01:03.750> i<00:01:03.870> would

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
minion so this is like a a card i would

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.320 
minion so this is like a a card i would
play<00:01:04.830> an<00:01:04.890> area<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:05.670> shell<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.030> eggs<00:01:06.210> just

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
play an area of my shell and eggs just

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.120 
play an area of my shell and eggs just
because<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.049> versatile<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.920> very

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
because it's so versatile and it's very

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.810

very<00:01:08.220> strong<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:11.130> doubles<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:11.700> i

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
very strong the doubles on which i

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.929
