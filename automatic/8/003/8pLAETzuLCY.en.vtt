00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
the priest color as this is supposed to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.940 
the priest color as this is supposed to
be<00:00:53.330> subtle<00:00:53.630> I<00:00:55.300> then<00:00:56.300> work<00:00:56.810> the<00:00:57.079> same<00:00:57.380> brown

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
be subtle I then work the same brown

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.819 
be subtle I then work the same brown
shade<00:00:58.400> into<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:59.090> crease<00:00:59.390> using<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.410> slat

shade into the crease using a slat
slanted<00:01:01.520> brush<00:01:01.600> I'd<00:01:02.600> add<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.200> to<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.560> crease

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
slanted brush I'd add this to the crease

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.130 
slanted brush I'd add this to the crease
to<00:01:04.070> create<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.670> sharpened<00:01:05.360> cut<00:01:05.750> crease<00:01:06.140> effect

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
to create a sharpened cut crease effect

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.919 
to create a sharpened cut crease effect
now<00:01:09.140> onto<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.619> eyeliner<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:11.119> pin-up<00:01:11.390> look<00:01:11.539> is

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
now onto the eyeliner the pin-up look is

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.620 
now onto the eyeliner the pin-up look is
all<00:01:12.170> about<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.649> dramatic<00:01:13.429> liner<00:01:13.759> I<00:01:14.149> always

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
all about a dramatic liner I always

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.639 
all about a dramatic liner I always
begin<00:01:15.319> from<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.069> outer<00:01:16.280> corner<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.909> my<00:01:17.030> eye

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
begin from the outer corner of my eye

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.099 
begin from the outer corner of my eye
creating<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.829> triangle<00:01:19.759> shape<00:01:19.789> at<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.509> outer<00:01:20.659> V

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
creating a triangle shape at the outer V

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.069 
creating a triangle shape at the outer V
I<00:01:21.409> then<00:01:22.399> work<00:01:22.789> from<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.210> inner<00:01:23.420> corner<00:01:23.569> of<00:01:23.929> my

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
I then work from the inner corner of my

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.889 
I then work from the inner corner of my
eye<00:01:24.289> and<00:01:24.770> slowly<00:01:25.579> join<00:01:25.999> the<00:01:26.270> two<00:01:26.569> points

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
eye and slowly join the two points

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.120 
eye and slowly join the two points
together

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
together

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.289 
together
I<00:01:30.590> find<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.740> way<00:01:31.979> really<00:01:32.399> helps<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.939> control

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
I find this way really helps to control

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
I find this way really helps to control
the<00:01:33.630> shape<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> liner<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:39.470> then<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.710> over

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the shape of the liner I then go over

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.600 
the shape of the liner I then go over
the<00:01:41.250> liquid<00:01:41.670> eyeliner<00:01:42.179> with<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> gel<00:01:43.170> liner

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
the liquid eyeliner with a gel liner

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
the liquid eyeliner with a gel liner
this<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.789> used<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> create<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.780> more<00:01:46.049> intense

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
this is used to create a more intense

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.809 
this is used to create a more intense
black<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.299> also<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> create<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:49.020> thicker<00:01:49.439> line

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
black and also to create a thicker line

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.880 
black and also to create a thicker line
so<00:01:50.819> the<00:01:50.939> liquid<00:01:51.360> liner<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:52.049> acts<00:01:52.289> as<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> guide

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
so the liquid liner just acts as a guide

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.240 
so the liquid liner just acts as a guide
and<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.149> build<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.720> top<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
and I can build on top of that to make a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.999 
and I can build on top of that to make a
more<00:01:56.579> dramatic<00:01:56.819> cat<00:01:57.479> eye

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
more dramatic cat eye

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.609 
more dramatic cat eye
