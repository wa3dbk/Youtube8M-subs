00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.080
 define the position and shape and size will be sufficient to trace 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.080
 on the ground the perimeter of the swimming pool of your choice 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.779
 then excavate according to the type of bottom you prefer 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.519
 a series of concrete blocks are positioned along the perimeter 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.160
 will serve to support to seem like the future cars absolutely used 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.260
 self-supporting in strengthened steel 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 patented and guaranteed 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.490
 the panels are supported by steel uprights called the buttresses 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.730
 the family a turate is therefore fixed edimburgo born no welding 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.650
 avoiding weak points and dangerous polishing in the joints 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.650
 that appear in traditional steel pools 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.400
 the possible prefabricated acrylic block staircase available in 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.229
 different colors and shapes must be foreseen already in the design phase 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.630
 fiberglass is added to the steel panel 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.030
 a second wall reinforced polyester panel having the function of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.440
 covering and aesthetic coverage of the structure 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.340
 allowing a smooth and homogeneous surface 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 in addition to thermally insulating the tank from the ground 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.210
 proceed with the niche to house the light headlights 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.810
 follow the assembly of the bath accessories the first accessory screen appeal 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.250
 these are openings located along the upper edge of the tub yes 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.110
 they collect the Indian quatrain at the filtration system to be 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.960
 purified 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.100
 it is important that the skimmers and are positioned correctly hey number 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.120
 enough 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.810
 to avoid savings areas for the correct use of the pool is 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.350
 determining the filtration system to be sized according to the size 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.750
 expected delusion of the pool 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.450
 filtration plant purifies the water before being apprentice in the pool 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.949
 the entire system is then connected through the assembly of the appropriate ones 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.999
 piping 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.059
 the filtration system is housed in the technical room located in 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.999
 garden 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.669
 prefabricated masonry walls buried after laying 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.549
 Concrete block pillars are then positioned at a distance 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.050
 from each other 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.640
 the approximately one and a half meter in support of the edge writes the possible pavement 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.209
 a lower perimeter concrete curb 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.700
 will surround the pool 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.819
 distributing tasks 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.620
 the lidel concrete slab was the bottom of the pool 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.889
 making it aesthetically perfect 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:59.409
 backfill of the perimeter pool of the pool hey complete coverage of the space 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.999
 cockpit 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:04.399
 then the last upper perimeter reinforced curb 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.399
 and any concrete screed 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:12.439
 once the structural part has been completed, the inner lining in PVC is laid 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.899
 shaped in a perfect finish 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.899
 takes the pool totally waterproof

 the color varies from solid colors to those that reflect the fine mosaic 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.439
 as in this case 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:30.239
 site eat delivery vents and white or colored lighthouses 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.179
 italy are an important accessory 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.949
 hey thanks to a perfect lighting the pool becomes one 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.089
 suggestive scenery on warm summer evenings 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:46.109
 follows the installation of the edge supplied shaped according to the shapes of the perimeter 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.469
 of the chef pool 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.279
 laying the flooring for the solarium 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:57.719
 concludes the pool the reconstructed rock does not fear the weather and the most extreme 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.550
 technical temperatures 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.680
 antislip 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.809
 be pleasant to the touch 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.809
 it's time to fill the pool 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.909
 the pressure of the ferrara water derives vat and black pvc perfectly on the walls 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.339
