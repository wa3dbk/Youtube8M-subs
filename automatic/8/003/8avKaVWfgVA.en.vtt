CES 2015 and audio pipe is unveiling
their<00:00:08.639> new<00:00:09.320> low<00:00:10.320> frequency<00:00:10.950> mid<00:00:11.280> Marine

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
their new low frequency mid Marine

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.390 
their new low frequency mid Marine
allowed<00:00:12.660> speakers<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.679> what's<00:00:13.980> unique<00:00:14.280> about

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
allowed speakers so what's unique about

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.599 
allowed speakers so what's unique about
these<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:15.059> they<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:16.049> very<00:00:16.440> similar<00:00:16.830> in<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
these is they are very similar in a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.390 
these is they are very similar in a
sense<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:18.180> their<00:00:18.420> car<00:00:19.050> versions<00:00:19.560> now<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.250> to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
sense to their car versions now not to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220 
sense to their car versions now not to
say<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.640> couldn't<00:00:20.939> be<00:00:21.000> used<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.480> car<00:00:21.630> but

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
say this couldn't be used in a car but

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.099 
say this couldn't be used in a car but
what<00:00:22.680> makes<00:00:22.890> these<00:00:23.070> unique<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.600> these

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
what makes these unique is that these

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.920 
what makes these unique is that these
speakers<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.560> made<00:00:26.039> out<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:27.150> carbon<00:00:27.630> fiber

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
speakers are made out of a carbon fiber

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.560 
speakers are made out of a carbon fiber
cone<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.590> yes<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.519> real<00:00:29.849> carbon<00:00:30.210> fiber

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
cone and yes this is a real carbon fiber

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690 
cone and yes this is a real carbon fiber
cone<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.679> not<00:00:31.830> an<00:00:31.949> overlay<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.399> don't

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
cone this is just not an overlay I don't

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.340 
cone this is just not an overlay I don't
know<00:00:32.759> if<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.210> right<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
know if you can see right there that the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.650 
know if you can see right there that the
actual<00:00:34.590> light<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.100> bleeding<00:00:35.700> through<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
actual light is bleeding through the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.180 
actual light is bleeding through the
carbon<00:00:37.079> fiber<00:00:37.350> there<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.040> actually

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
carbon fiber there so you can actually

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.799 
carbon fiber there so you can actually
see<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.730> real<00:00:38.910> carbon<00:00:39.180> fiber<00:00:39.420> this

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
see that it's real carbon fiber this

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.950 
see that it's real carbon fiber this
makes<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.230> extremely<00:00:41.160> light<00:00:41.629> very<00:00:42.629> durable

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
makes this extremely light very durable

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.830 
makes this extremely light very durable
this<00:00:43.379> dust<00:00:43.620> cap<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.040> rock<00:00:44.520> solid<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.450> benefit

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
this dust cap is rock solid the benefit

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660 
this dust cap is rock solid the benefit
of<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.020> too<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.530> will<00:00:46.710> hold<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.100> really

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
of this too is this will hold up really

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.029 
of this too is this will hold up really
well<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> Sun<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.050> Sun<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.500> beat<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.860> this

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
well in the Sun the Sun can beat on this

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.680 
well in the Sun the Sun can beat on this
you're<00:00:50.489> not<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> break<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.120> carbon

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
you're not going to break down carbon

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.689 
you're not going to break down carbon
fiber<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.710> makes<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> speaker<00:00:53.219> more<00:00:53.430> water

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
fiber this makes the speaker more water

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.299 
fiber this makes the speaker more water
resistant<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.620> used<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.890> lot<00:00:56.129> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
resistant this can be used in a lot of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
resistant this can be used in a lot of
different<00:00:56.640> applications<00:00:57.109> some<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> their

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
different applications some of their

obviously in boats that's typical most
people<00:01:30.840> usually<00:01:31.049> are<00:01:31.350> running<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.740> white<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
people usually are running a white or a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.880 
people usually are running a white or a
black<00:01:32.520> grille<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.630> are<00:01:33.840> paintable<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.680> well

metal dome titanium tweeter and what's

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.389 
metal dome titanium tweeter and what's
cool<00:02:04.590> about<00:02:04.619> too<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.100> don't<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.340> you

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
cool about too is I don't know if you

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.249 
cool about too is I don't know if you
actually<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:05.969> channels<00:02:06.479> here<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.140> if

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
actually see little channels here but if

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.510 
actually see little channels here but if
you're<00:02:07.380> hosing<00:02:07.560> down<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.829> boat<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.429> gets

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
will help the water run right

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.149 
will help the water run right
instead<00:02:12.659> of<00:02:12.749> settling<00:02:13.140> right<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.920> tweeter

one<00:02:57.629> unique<00:02:58.079> thing<00:02:58.139> about<00:02:58.500> these<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.980> the

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
one unique thing about these is the

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.819 
one unique thing about these is the
controls<00:03:00.060> on<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.389> amplifier<00:03:00.719> are<00:03:01.169> actually

controls on the amplifier are actually

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.220 
controls on the amplifier are actually
on<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.250> back<00:03:02.430> side<00:03:02.790> we<00:03:03.299> flip<00:03:03.629> this<00:03:03.810> right<00:03:03.870> up

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
on the back side we flip this right up

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.020 
on the back side we flip this right up
here<00:03:04.409> so<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:04.889> see<00:03:05.010> your<00:03:05.159> game<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.639> high<00:03:05.790> pass

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
you've set everything up

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.379 
you've set everything up
you<00:03:22.470> said<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.799> properly<00:03:23.189> now<00:03:23.759> you've<00:03:23.939> mounted

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
you said it properly now you've mounted

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.149 
you said it properly now you've mounted
your<00:03:24.479> amplifier<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.229> now<00:03:25.500> your<00:03:25.709> customer

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
your amplifier and now your customer

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.399 
your amplifier and now your customer
really<00:03:26.400> doesn't<00:03:27.329> have<00:03:27.419> anything<00:03:27.689> to<00:03:27.930> access

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
really doesn't have anything to access

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.559 
really doesn't have anything to access
to<00:03:28.560> mess<00:03:28.799> with<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.189> gains<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.090> know<00:03:30.419> they

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
to mess with the gains so you know they

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.210 
to mess with the gains so you know they
can't<00:03:30.840> really<00:03:30.989> fumble<00:03:31.530> with<00:03:31.650> them<00:03:31.829> they're

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
can't really fumble with them they're

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.649 
can't really fumble with them they're
going<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.430> be<00:03:32.579> set<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:32.970> way<00:03:33.090> they<00:03:33.239> are<00:03:33.389> where

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
going to be set the way they are where

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.390 
going to be set the way they are where
you've<00:03:33.840> left<00:03:34.019> them<00:03:34.290> unless<00:03:34.799> they<00:03:35.040> unless

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
you've left them unless they unless

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.460 
you've left them unless they unless
they've<00:03:35.609> actually<00:03:35.819> undid<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:36.659> amplifier<00:03:37.259> and

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
they've actually undid the amplifier and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.379 
they've actually undid the amplifier and
adjusted<00:03:37.829> them<00:03:37.949> themselves<00:03:38.400> they<00:03:38.849> also<00:03:39.060> have

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
adjusted them themselves they also have

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:45.349 
adjusted them themselves they also have
the<00:03:39.930> remote<00:03:40.229> bass<00:03:40.530> knob<00:03:40.799> capability<00:03:42.560> for<00:03:44.359> your

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
the remote bass knob capability for your

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.259 
the remote bass knob capability for your
sub<00:03:45.569> control<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.459> like<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.489> said<00:03:47.699> this<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.150> the

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
sub control and like I said this is the

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.729 
sub control and like I said this is the
new<00:03:48.419> lineup<00:03:48.659> right<00:03:49.079> at<00:03:49.169> the<00:03:49.229> moment<00:03:49.349> they<00:03:49.590> have

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
new lineup right at the moment they have
