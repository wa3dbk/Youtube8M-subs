sculpt<00:00:41.510> I've<00:00:42.510> got<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> say<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> think<00:00:43.379> she<00:00:43.500> looks

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
sculpt I've got to say I think she looks

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.110

better<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.190> game<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> figure

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
better in the game then as a figure

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.819 
better in the game then as a figure
though<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.480> think<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.559> face<00:00:46.800> is

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
though I think it's because the face is

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.139 
though I think it's because the face is
so<00:00:47.460> pale<00:00:47.760> white<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:50.280> anyway<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.879> got<00:00:51.030> the
