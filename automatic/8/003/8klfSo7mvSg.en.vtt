so there aren't much light elements that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.730 
so there aren't much light elements that
are<00:01:09.270> epic<00:01:09.659> I'm<00:01:10.080> guessing<00:01:10.439> because<00:01:10.500> the

legendaries<00:05:00.389> you<00:05:00.479> can<00:05:00.630> read<00:05:00.840> as<00:05:01.050> if<00:05:02.039> this<00:05:04.880> yep

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
legendaries you can read as if this yep

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.020 
legendaries you can read as if this yep
you<00:05:06.389> can<00:05:06.570> now<00:05:06.720> be<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.020> crystal<00:05:07.380> dragon<00:05:07.610> so<00:05:08.610> my

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
you can now be the crystal dragon so my

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.600 
you can now be the crystal dragon so my

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
guess is with the crystal dragging what

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.510 
guess is with the crystal dragging what
you<00:05:11.729> need<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:11.970> breed<00:05:12.210> is<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:15.380> is<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.650> Emperor
