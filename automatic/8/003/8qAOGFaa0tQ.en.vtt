that courier was carrying the designs
for<00:00:42.950> a<00:00:43.340> new<00:00:43.370> chalice<00:00:44.329> of<00:00:44.480> corruption<00:00:44.989> which<00:00:45.170> we

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
for a new chalice of corruption which we

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.810 
for a new chalice of corruption which we
should<00:00:45.530> all<00:00:45.649> know<00:00:45.829> what<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:46.040> means

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820

that's<00:00:47.030> that's<00:00:47.480> not<00:00:47.690> good<00:00:48.760> it's<00:00:49.760> what<00:00:49.879> we<00:00:50.000> have

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
that's that's not good it's what we have

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.580 
that's that's not good it's what we have
to<00:00:50.239> do<00:00:50.329> is<00:00:50.570> run<00:00:50.809> around<00:00:50.930> here<00:00:51.200> and<00:00:51.260> talk<00:00:51.559> to

think<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:56.989> can<00:00:57.140> threaten<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.680> punch<00:00:57.920> one<00:00:58.100> of

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
think you can threaten to punch one of

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.310 
think you can threaten to punch one of
them<00:00:58.340> in<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.489> face<00:00:58.699> but<00:00:59.090> the<00:00:59.420> idea<00:01:00.110> is<00:01:00.199> that

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
them in the face but the idea is that

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.200 
them in the face but the idea is that
you're<00:01:00.559> supposed<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:00.920> be<00:01:01.070> subtle<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:02.090> you're

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
you're supposed to be subtle and you're

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.139 
you're supposed to be subtle and you're
supposed<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.770> subtly<00:01:03.770> try<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:04.519> dig<00:01:04.789> out<00:01:04.939> the

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
supposed to subtly try and dig out the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.849 
supposed to subtly try and dig out the
answers<00:01:05.539> that<00:01:05.749> you<00:01:05.840> want<00:01:05.869> out<00:01:06.529> of<00:01:06.590> these

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:06.859 
answers that you want out of these

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:08.160 
answers that you want out of these
people

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
people

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.730 
people
but<00:01:09.310> sadly<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:11.029> can<00:01:11.240> actually<00:01:11.539> just<00:01:12.259> threaten

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
but sadly you can actually just threaten

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.919 
but sadly you can actually just threaten
to<00:01:12.859> punch<00:01:13.009> people<00:01:13.279> and<00:01:13.729> get<00:01:14.060> bad<00:01:14.270> responses

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
to punch people and get bad responses
