00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.100 
you've got the one with the the pin one
and<00:02:01.219> I'll<00:02:01.340> just<00:02:01.549> use<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:01.850> one<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.689> I<00:02:02.719> added<00:02:02.929> a

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
and I'll just use that one so I added a

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.779 
and I'll just use that one so I added a
few<00:02:03.140> more<00:02:03.530> drops<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.069> will<00:02:04.280> start<00:02:04.670> to

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
few more drops and it will start to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.499 
few more drops and it will start to
break<00:02:05.149> up<00:02:06.609> and<00:02:07.609> it<00:02:07.700> will<00:02:07.759> never<00:02:07.969> get<00:02:08.269> into<00:02:08.390> a

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
break up and it will never get into a

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.210 
break up and it will never get into a
proper<00:02:08.720> pace<00:02:08.989> well<00:02:09.289> that's<00:02:09.619> what<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:09.799> think

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
proper pace well that's what I think

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.640 
proper pace well that's what I think
anyway<00:02:10.510> you<00:02:11.510> can<00:02:11.690> kind<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:11.989> whisk<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.470> like

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
anyway you can kind of whisk it like

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.699 
anyway you can kind of whisk it like
you're<00:02:12.830> whisking<00:02:13.010> an<00:02:13.400> egg<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.870> find<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:14.959> helps

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.650

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
so that seems mixed enough to me and it

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.440 
so that seems mixed enough to me and it
will<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.620> few<00:02:22.310> bits<00:02:22.549> in<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.970> but<00:02:23.150> yeah

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
will have a few bits in it but yeah

will have a few bits in it but yeah
doesn't<00:02:23.900> matter
