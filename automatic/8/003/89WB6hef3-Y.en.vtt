00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.890
 so hello to all five in minecraft 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.520
 that you did not know yet is that now 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.250
 already here 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.930
 the third video of it and I have mine 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.970
 picked out a few things again 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.349
 could be interesting if the 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.250
 at both consequences has not yet seen 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.049
 the world now at the end of the video 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.520
 just link in the credits 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.740
 click on them and they liked that 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.300
 then there are more of them 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.680
 then in this video also same 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.029
 like last time please play one 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.250
 Write a comment how many of the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.039
 what you knew is 3 4 5 4 out of 5 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.420
 5 and 5 we are like that and of course 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.470
 who knows what things I still here 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.809
 have not presented, nor 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.520
 in a previous video then you can 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.140
 I like to write a pn with the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.130
 thing and then he may come even 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.660
 in the next video in it 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.250
 in this video as well as two things 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.750
 I'll take it like that or you 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.040
 have sent have got the rest 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.840
 By the way, I'm already a bit on the side 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.640
 selected or just already knew 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 so my go off with fuck numero 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.399
 One when you effectively use your swords 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.170
 does not want to waste there 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.360
 it a little trick and that one 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.550
 small example which it is a zombie c2c 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.660
 Schlagmann the first here and that 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.760
 with a goldsmith he looks for the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.899
 durability goes down for now 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.969
 we have a zombie more than that 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.170
 half of the shelf life needed but 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.399
 You can do that cleverly now 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.600
 on the second for the hit and 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.179
 queue queue 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.350
 Queue wait then is the death and 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.119
 does not even have that much 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.369
 consumes easily and explains 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.560
 though if we pug then beats if you 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.609
 short time red and marked as red and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.319
 for that time you will 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.639
 invulnerable somehow so that you stop 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.689
 not so many punches in a short time 

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:26.639
 to be able to defy 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.889
 and problem that mob can brush down 

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:30.209
 and that's why it 's already inserted 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.619
 that they were in a certain time 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.869
 get hurt after a blow 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.579
 However, the durability of 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.359
 weapons because the blow is the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.990
 completed cdu advice 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.299
 Accordingly, then counted 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.859
 and therefore will keep you handy 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.869
 faster therefore consumes clever 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:49.909
 clever and effective practical sword 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.909
 use and then you have more of it 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.099
 then next there are also items 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.509
 you do not have to grab it or you're done 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.309
 buy to use them 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.899
 because there is the following when you go to 

00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:02.609
 crafting cable goes for gold 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.979
 inserts and in the middle a redstone 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.179
 pure skin then one sees only one man 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.950
 actually gets the time 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.409
 I can see that out again 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.410
 whole is synonymous with a compass 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.240
 just done 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.350
 this one also shows the spot without 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.670
 that we ever had this item 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.040
 We have purchased practically 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.310
 Just go and tell us again 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.300
 get out take a bag and like 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.830
 we are not at the moment with that 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.320
 Compass too if only once completely 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.840
 short for example need such and that 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.430
 was also a small trick in the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.510
 last video walls happen to be middle 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.970
 Mouse clicked on it 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.250
 well ok then next you can completely 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.800
 chilled over water jump over it 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.020
 which one willi betz takes and before them 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.550
 It has to be placed on the floor 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.260
 you do not practice very little that is not quite 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.600
 so easy so just jump 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.070
 the pad put on it land immediately 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.750
 further jumps again place on it 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.040
 then and then immediately it has to be right 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.430
 this is a game altogether 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.440
 cheap transport method next 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.850
 can also make me with stones 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.290
 However, this is only a block 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.560
 deep water because you have the otherwise 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.240
 logically can not place 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.830
 the means of way very well you have 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.160
 So first of all they collect so very differently 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.510
 out again is not true then again 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.520
 Next, a one thing 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.340
 sent by bada hd found the 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.860
 I really great sand this little fakt 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.780
 if you do not place an ambos on it 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.630
 placed and then a switch then 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.640
 put the ignition does not happen 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.510
 that means it does not explode 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.060
 broken as well as in water then as 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.520
 last of that now may not have been 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.350
 I have also been sent one 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.000
 a thing you even without speed 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.680
 oceans evernote very fast 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.290
 you can just move on 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.360
 two times two tunnels 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.370
 I already have it myself 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.100
 think about it from time to build 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.200
 underneath is ice and 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.670
 there are raptors on it and the clippers 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.900
 make sure you do not have that much 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.910
 has space up and then if you can 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.010
 sprinting about it here as well 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.200
 still hip or the jackets otilia taste 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.100
 pressed one comes extremely fast 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.720
 forward if you then but only 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.209
 running normally sees the difference 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.680
 and this jumping still exists 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.660
 a worst boost to the front 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.949
 So that's an interesting thing 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.209
 of course, must first build times 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.859
 a bit elaborate but so you can 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.300
 if you're upset the time 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.430
 drive away and I like to deny you 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.060
 so the water was already from 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.729
 this video 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.370
 I am for watching and first 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.789
 have packed comments 15 and immediately 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.930
 see us in the next video and created so 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.090
 and a thing where I still very fast 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.259
 say until the end is here and that 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.580
 we noticed the video was up 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.289
 dysfunctional the problem was mine 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.729
 microphone has switched to one 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.009
 worse quality i have the food 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.449
 afterwards noticed and I have the 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.340
 imitate completely new and 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.990
 Therefore, do not be surprised 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.539
 see original but so forward 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.970
 handy and as compensation 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.229
 Now there are a few ticks example 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:04.250
 numero one, I'll just give it a second 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:06.050
 Left struck constantly on it like 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.410
 In the water you can do it again 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.410
 is funny
