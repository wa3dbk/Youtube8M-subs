00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
like this I picked two completely

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.630 
like this I picked two completely
different<00:00:55.469> yarns<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.460> see

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
different yarns just so you can see

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
duper simple you're basically instead of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.439 
duper simple you're basically instead of
forming<00:01:01.620> one<00:01:01.949> big<00:01:02.340> knot<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> middle<00:01:02.969> which

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
forming one big knot in the middle which

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.399 
forming one big knot in the middle which
you<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.660> normally<00:01:04.019> do

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
you would normally do

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.100 
you would normally do
you're<00:01:04.799> gonna<00:01:04.949> form<00:01:05.220> two<00:01:05.489> overhead<00:01:06.240> knots<00:01:06.600> one

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you're gonna form two overhead knots one

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.649 
you're gonna form two overhead knots one
here<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.880> overhand<00:01:09.270> knot<00:01:09.450> is

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
here and one there the overhand knot is

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.330 
here and one there the overhand knot is
the<00:01:09.780> first<00:01:10.049> knot<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.380> probably<00:01:10.710> ever<00:01:10.920> learned

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the first knot you probably ever learned

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.380 
the first knot you probably ever learned
and<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> goes<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.150> this

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and it goes like this

you look nice I would like to wrap
myself<00:01:16.229> around<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.909> forming<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
myself around you so you do forming a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.670 
myself around you so you do forming a
simple<00:01:19.110> overhand<00:01:19.950> knot<00:01:20.659> that<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:22.110> says<00:01:22.470> hey

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
simple overhand knot that one says hey

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.960 
simple overhand knot that one says hey
well<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.460> too

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
I would like to reciprocate so it wraps

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.780 
I would like to reciprocate so it wraps
around<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:28.380> yarn<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.509> forms<00:01:30.509> its<00:01:30.900> own<00:01:31.790> not

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
around that yarn and forms its own not

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.330 
around that yarn and forms its own not
now<00:01:33.630> you've<00:01:33.810> got<00:01:33.960> these<00:01:34.079> two<00:01:34.259> knots<00:01:34.500> that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
now you've got these two knots that

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.920 
now you've got these two knots that
doesn't<00:01:35.670> look<00:01:35.790> very<00:01:35.820> inviting<00:01:36.090> for<00:01:36.630> your

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
doesn't look very inviting for your

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.270 
doesn't look very inviting for your
fabric<00:01:37.259> does<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> well<00:01:37.890> watch<00:01:38.509> pull<00:01:39.509> each<00:01:39.659> end

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
fabric does it well watch pull each end

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.639 
fabric does it well watch pull each end
director<00:01:41.509> look<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:44.600> beautiful<00:01:45.649> centered

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
director look at that beautiful centered
