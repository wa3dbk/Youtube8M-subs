00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.970
 interesting story the beginning

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.400
 bed does not matter in the end a rare story 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.570
 let's see how this story should have 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.160
 finished let's go today mother I'm afraid that 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.800
 I will never find a princess who is 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.380
 truly true and now it's 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:15.530
 starting to rain my love you deserve 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.910
 a princess as true as she is and 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.860
 while the prince was complaining 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.500
 everything that gives and the storm was in 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.960
 his point came a knock on the door 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.340
 of the castle the prince opened the door 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.170
 to meet the wettest one and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.080
 muddy young woman less like a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.540
 princess who would have never seen hello if 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.690
 I separated from my traveling companions 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.729
 during this terrible storm I can 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.080
 please enter to leave the rain what 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.330
 I feel but we only allow it 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.610
 entrance to the true princesses a 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.570
 day the woman at the door does not give 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.659
 defeated touched even stronger this time 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.250
 I am a real princess please 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.470
 let me in to get out of this rain 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.870
 the beginning was confused I could 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.280
 It is soaked muddy and now annoying 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.560
 young to be really a true 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.760
 clear princess that you can enter very 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.430
 Grosa I say precious or thank you I'm so 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.500
 tired soaked and hungry that barely 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.209
 I could sleep on this trip what 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.600
 I really need refuge for this 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.600
 night but mother she that clear clear 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.790
 because you do not eat something and you get hot in 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.489
 the fire while we prepare a good 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.770
 fourth for what happens is tonight les 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.110
 I thank you very much but mother 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.150
 theory do not worry honey I have the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.030
 perfect way to test if it's a 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.800
 true princess 1 so while the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.239
 soaked princess was drying the queen 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.600
 He ordered his servants to prepare a 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.220
 bed with 20 more mattresses 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.200
 and then added 20 more soft duvets 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.780
 then the queen took a small one 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.500
 green pea and put it under that 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.020
 pile of mattresses and quilts more not a 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.520
 true princess is sensitive so 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.160
 if she feels that little chichero 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.620
 underneath all that we will know what is 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.300
 a true princess because not better 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.220
 we call the realm of the one who says he is and 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.960
 we ask if it is a princess this is 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.790
 the only way the next morning to the 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.670
 breakfast the prince the queen waited 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.930
 anxious the arrival of the princess 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.340
 finally she came crawling down 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.780
 stairs with what the prince thought 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.760
 which were very promising bags 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.810
 under those swollen eyes 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.120
 good morning dear as you slept last night 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.400
 sadly I could not sleep well for 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.260
 nothing thanks for the room but there was 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.030
 one like rock or bulge under those 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.130
 mattresses that did not matter how I 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.069
 They moved I could not be comfortable 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.849
 and I really never could sleep 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.170
 the proof that everything was a test only 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.370
 a true princess would be so 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.469
 sensitive to know that the pea 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.499
 I was there you passed and now we know 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:46.049
 that you are a true princess 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:49.139
 I appeared at your door soaked dirty 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:52.349
 and exhausted and you decided to put me 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:59.760
 to test if everything was a test but you 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:04:02.249
 you passed so no and now if not we do not 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.709
 let's marry what is happening to 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:06.930
 you are the worst thing that someone 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.340
 I've never done it because I wanted to 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.889
 marry someone who treat the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.780
 women that way because I'm a 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:18.019
 Prince, what did you tell me yesterday? 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.019
 at night so I remember good day 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.289
 but I hope you 're the only true 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.080
 princess in these lands yes but you do not 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.660
 the only prince I'm going to look for someone 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.180
 friendlier and if he found someone else 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.770
 kind a good prince who respected her 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.020
 and that did not hold her stupid and new 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.560
 tests they lived happy for 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.980
 always and never eating peas 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.720
 so the moral of the story 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.730
 always be good with people and 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.960
 Do not hide the vegetables under your 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.960
 bed the end
