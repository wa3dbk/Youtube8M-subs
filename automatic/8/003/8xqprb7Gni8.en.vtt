00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.550
 okay patrick rivet had already tried a seat leon supercopa 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.879
 barcelona description impression to be missed with the exception of the notion of 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.760
 essential competition for such a race car so to see 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.050
 what that gives in any case and we responded present the proposal 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.630
 of seafrance to pilot the car invited to dijon 3rd test of the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.630
 season in the company of all the cadors of the discipline 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.989
 purpose of the maneuver take full advantage of this privilege take a maximum of 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.999
 pleasure on its results objectives 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.430
 but with the secret hope of not being too arrested 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.130
 stopped 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.270
 taped in Finland what would be a shame for a representative of the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.820
 high speed television 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.790
 after free practice at his graduation work and gift tracking 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.700
 and renowned author remains of his best 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.050
 we had managed to make this period of my car the difference 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.580
 compared to a road car nothing is irreversible in supercopa it can 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.930
 everything set and completely transformed behavior in the ideal 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.850
 it would have been necessary to describe what cars were doing 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.000
 mid-way out of each turn as do the right numbers or 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.660
 diabetic my teammates a weekend roland a had to be content with 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.270
 interpret it but fears about what could do the trick 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.310
 to find the right set-up on the wet 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.920
 a nice effort reduced to nothing with a dry track for qualifying and a 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.770
 apprentice pilot who not only did not exploit the new tires and 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.250
 which moreover continue to brake like in the wet, that is to say with 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.030
 the same pressures and the same benchmarks balance of operations 15th not 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.689
 less than two and a half seconds of the world cup for boilers 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.759
 and especially the feeling of having ruined all the work of the team 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.630
 only consolation time 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.420
 before penultimate on the grid one should escape the pitfalls of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.900
 first turn it's free 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.539
 nothing to report no problem 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.450
 so they will be able to turn first but still 15th 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.310
 two stocks go back up when Jerome Cebrian 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.960
 why she also in the sets 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.780
 We win 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.400
 two places and one more in the first round when Michel Barnier 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 returns to the pits with a puncture 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.990
 the operation in the rest of the usa few loops later 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.979
 gold we are fighting with the fatah carlos marmol over there obviously 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.899
 more efficient than the scene yet to untie we are now kim 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.440
 ki-duk good 8th finding the opening on pascal destembert in delicacy 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.180
 with his tires an unexpected result 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.860
 i want to share it with the help of jean ireland everyone naam station 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.860
 seibert at the church 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.900
 the meters are reset the next day 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.860
 finally not quite since we are the victims and not 15th on 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.599
 the starting grid this time he will have to watch his back 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.659
 this is indeed this time for the 40 minute race we take care to his 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.399
 advantage on the net I'm proud 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:47.329
 before he gets it back very quickly no matter what put an end to 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.329
 projects of the opening 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.299
 m 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.689
 later it is the turn of AurÃ©lien happy to return to our ideas 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.689
 much faster not bothering him in a world 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:26.289
 face to face with the car is still as pleasant to drive as one 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.979
 shadow on the board the game becomes aware that it was impossible to finish 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.509
 eleventh of the second race but more than the result I will remember mostly 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.509
 the pleasure gained control of this car 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.990
 business meal it was crazy 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.990
 the details of this drug lasts with a pub ad in Senegal on the other hand 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.770
 they go to health 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.190
 on the contrary
