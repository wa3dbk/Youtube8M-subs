for<00:04:12.940> that

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
for that

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.470 
for that
just<00:04:16.670> keep<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.150> direct<00:04:17.840> heat<00:04:18.609> away<00:04:19.609> from<00:04:19.850> the

just keep the direct heat away from the
meat<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:22.340> though<00:04:22.670> I<00:04:22.910> do<00:04:23.090> think<00:04:23.570> it's<00:04:23.810> really

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
meat this though I do think it's really

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.960 
meat this though I do think it's really
cool<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.630> second<00:04:27.260> rack<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.860> just<00:04:28.550> pops

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
cool it's a second rack that just pops

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.800 
cool it's a second rack that just pops
into<00:04:29.330> those<00:04:29.480> holes<00:04:31.270> so<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.389> gives<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.780> a

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
into those holes so it gives you a

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.640 
into those holes so it gives you a
second<00:04:33.800> level<00:04:34.100> there<00:04:34.810> if<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:36.050> wanted<00:04:36.350> to

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
it and then move it up here so that is
