 Hello, I am Olga Ivanova 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.160

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.060
 right no want to tell you about 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.430
 bee area 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.940
 swarming is natural and breeding 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.730
 bees when part of a family member is separated 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.210
 from the main family and along with the young 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.460
 uterus flies out of the hive bees swarm 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.370
 usually in the morning either in 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.950
 noon it is important to see in time to take off and 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.700
 swarm and catch it if the beekeeper 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.520
 will miss 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.630
 2 will fly somewhere in the forest in the hollow 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.790
 populate we lose it when the bees 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.640
 crashes they usually settle on 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.399
 some tree near the hives from 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.579
 whom they took off 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:58.520
 then their intelligence men they fly away to 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.649
 looking for a new home when the beekeeper 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.840
 will take off and the swarm he uses 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:07.189
 special ointment to attract natca and 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.530
 area where she caught a swarm area 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:14.840
 is brought under the tree where the chelas sit 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:17.659
 and ointments and there come the uterus and along with 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.130
 it comes in people and if the bees are sitting 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.709
 quiet in the area 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.350
 that means the uterus with them can 

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:28.399
 close the area and carry deep 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.259
 this is the wintering room for bees wintering 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.619
 it is cool there they are usually kept 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.619
 day 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.500

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:07.459
 we swarm periodically and take off here 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:12.090
 with such a device we dig and catch and 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:15.690
 then we populate it in a new house 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.980

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.980
