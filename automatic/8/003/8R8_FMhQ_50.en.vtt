know<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> skybox<00:01:42.000> environments<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
know in the skybox environments and I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.240 
know in the skybox environments and I
said<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.200> were<00:01:43.259> three<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.159> i'm

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
said there were three of these so i'm

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.190 
said there were three of these so i'm
guessing<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.790> central<00:01:45.360> lockup<00:01:45.750> may<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.020> off

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
guessing the central lockup may be off

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.289 
guessing the central lockup may be off
to<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> side<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> sanctuary<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.790> maybe<00:01:48.090> it'll

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
to the side of sanctuary or maybe it'll

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.100 
to the side of sanctuary or maybe it'll
be<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.570> sixth<00:01:49.229> map

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
be on the sixth map

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.400 
be on the sixth map
announced<00:01:50.770> yet<00:01:51.010> but<00:01:51.040> some<00:01:51.900> you<00:01:52.900> know<00:01:52.930> so

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
announced yet but some you know so

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.400 
announced yet but some you know so
that's<00:01:53.620> really<00:01:54.490> cool<00:01:54.700> but<00:01:55.510> then<00:01:55.720> what<00:01:56.320> you

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
that's really cool but then what you

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.780 
that's really cool but then what you
have<00:01:56.440> to<00:01:56.620> think<00:01:56.770> about<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.160> like<00:01:57.310> okay<00:01:57.670> if

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
have to think about is like okay if

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.580 
have to think about is like okay if
we're<00:01:57.970> only<00:01:58.090> forging<00:01:58.510> in<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.720> skybox<00:01:58.930> we<00:01:59.380> need

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
we're only forging in the skybox we need

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.340 
we're only forging in the skybox we need
like<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:01.270> know<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.510> be<00:02:01.660> able<00:02:01.750> to<00:02:01.960> make<00:02:02.110> our<00:02:02.320> own

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
like you know to be able to make our own

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.740 
like you know to be able to make our own
terrain<00:02:02.860> so<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.790> cool<00:02:04.030> thing<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.360> Dana<00:02:04.600> you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
terrain so the cool thing that Dana you

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.150 
terrain so the cool thing that Dana you
talked<00:02:05.050> about<00:02:05.140> was<00:02:05.410> that<00:02:05.440> they're<00:02:05.710> adding<00:02:06.070> a

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
talked about was that they're adding a

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.460 
talked about was that they're adding a
lot<00:02:06.460> of<00:02:06.790> like<00:02:07.540> functionality<00:02:08.229> as<00:02:08.380> far<00:02:08.649> as<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:09.190> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
lot of like functionality as far as a a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.440 
lot of like functionality as far as a a
variety<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:11.500> new<00:02:12.100> like<00:02:12.490> natural<00:02:13.030> terrain

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
variety of new like natural terrain

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.300 
variety of new like natural terrain
objects<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.140> we<00:02:14.260> got<00:02:14.410> like<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> taste<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.190> that

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
objects so we got like a taste of that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.010 
objects so we got like a taste of that
on<00:02:15.460> Ford<00:02:15.730> Island<00:02:15.880> back<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.300> Halo<00:02:16.450> 4<00:02:16.690> we<00:02:16.810> got<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
on Ford Island back in Halo 4 we got the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.680 
on Ford Island back in Halo 4 we got the
big<00:02:17.200> rocks<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.740> trees<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.330> sounds

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
big rocks and the trees but it sounds

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.570 
big rocks and the trees but it sounds
like<00:02:19.780> we're<00:02:19.959> going<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.140> really<00:02:20.320> see<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:21.550> know

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
like we're going to really see you know

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.480 
like we're going to really see you know
a<00:02:21.700> lot<00:02:22.090> more<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:23.620> know<00:02:23.709> be<00:02:23.920> able<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.250> kind

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
a lot more and you know be able to kind

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.660 
a lot more and you know be able to kind
of<00:02:24.630> build<00:02:25.630> our<00:02:25.930> own<00:02:25.959> terrain<00:02:26.770> up<00:02:27.160> in<00:02:27.550> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
of build our own terrain up in the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.870 
of build our own terrain up in the
skybox<00:02:27.940> space<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:29.230> um<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:30.310> know<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.790> of

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
skybox space so um you know and of

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.690 
skybox space so um you know and of
course<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.930> can<00:02:32.080> also<00:02:32.200> like<00:02:32.470> coagulation<00:02:33.459> was

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
course you can also like coagulation was

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.250 
course you can also like coagulation was
one<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.000> maps<00:02:34.180> they<00:02:34.390> announced<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:35.170> know

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
one of the maps they announced you know

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.620 
one of the maps they announced you know
that<00:02:35.440> Canyon<00:02:35.920> gives<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.400> lot<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.610> open<00:02:37.150> space<00:02:37.180> to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
that Canyon gives a lot of open space to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.750 
that Canyon gives a lot of open space to
forge<00:02:37.900> in<00:02:38.080> also<00:02:38.950> if<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.220> don't<00:02:39.430> want<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.670> do

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
forge in also if you don't want to do

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.790 
forge in also if you don't want to do
that<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:40.060> suppose<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:41.380> they've<00:02:41.530> said<00:02:41.770> that

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
that I suppose I and they've said that

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.430 
that I suppose I and they've said that
you<00:02:42.700> know<00:02:42.790> these<00:02:43.390> structure<00:02:43.900> pieces<00:02:44.350> and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
you know these structure pieces and

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.840 
you know these structure pieces and
whatnot<00:02:44.680> are<00:02:44.770> going<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.070> be<00:02:45.160> available<00:02:45.430> across

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
whatnot are going to be available across

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.360 
whatnot are going to be available across
the<00:02:46.120> board<00:02:46.330> on<00:02:46.480> all<00:02:46.989> six<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.380> these<00:02:47.470> maps<00:02:47.709> so

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
the board on all six of these maps so

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.979 
the board on all six of these maps so
but<00:02:48.880> then<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.209> course<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.510> other<00:02:49.630> question

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
but then of course the other question

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.470 
but then of course the other question
you're<00:02:50.350> probably<00:02:50.590> wondering<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.520> okay<00:02:51.880> like

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
you're probably wondering is okay like

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.750 
you're probably wondering is okay like
if<00:02:52.780> I'm<00:02:53.200> in<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.440> skybox<00:02:53.739> I'm<00:02:54.250> making<00:02:54.610> my<00:02:54.730> own

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
if I'm in the skybox I'm making my own

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.180 
if I'm in the skybox I'm making my own
train<00:02:55.180> that's<00:02:55.390> cool<00:02:55.630> but<00:02:56.230> that's<00:02:56.890> going<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.100> be

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
train that's cool but that's going to be

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.130 
train that's cool but that's going to be
really<00:02:57.400> object<00:02:57.549> intensive<00:02:58.269> right<00:02:58.510> what's

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
really object intensive right what's

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.020 
really object intensive right what's
that<00:02:59.230> going<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.470> do<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.620> my<00:02:59.830> budget<00:03:00.280> well<00:03:00.850> so

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
that going to do to my budget well so

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.870 
that going to do to my budget well so
the<00:03:01.150> cool<00:03:01.330> thing<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:01.750> budget<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.470> gone<00:03:02.880> um

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
the cool thing is that budget is gone um

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.830 
the cool thing is that budget is gone um
instead<00:03:04.830> you're<00:03:05.830> tied<00:03:06.459> down<00:03:06.730> by<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.600> know<00:03:07.630> the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
instead you're tied down by you know the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.860 
instead you're tied down by you know the
hard<00:03:08.049> object<00:03:08.440> limit<00:03:08.769> and<00:03:08.920> like<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:10.120> you<00:03:10.780> know

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
hard object limit and like the you know

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.080 
hard object limit and like the you know
the<00:03:11.019> limitations<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:12.040> okay<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.519> know<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.850> can

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
the limitations of okay you know you can

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.490 
the limitations of okay you know you can
place<00:03:13.269> this<00:03:13.480> many<00:03:13.720> walls<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.350> many

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
place this many walls and that many

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.380 
place this many walls and that many
blocks<00:03:14.769> we're<00:03:15.400> not<00:03:15.610> sure<00:03:15.910> if<00:03:15.940> those

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
blocks we're not sure if those

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.240 
blocks we're not sure if those
limitations<00:03:16.840> are<00:03:17.170> being<00:03:17.440> changed<00:03:17.709> or<00:03:18.040> if<00:03:18.130> it's

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
limitations are being changed or if it's

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.770 
limitations are being changed or if it's
still<00:03:18.400> going<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.549> be<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.760> standard<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:19.299> 100

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
still going to be the standard like 100

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.470

blocks 50 walls you know they haven't

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.360 
blocks 50 walls you know they haven't
talked<00:03:22.720> about<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:22.959> it's<00:03:23.290> hard<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.560> say<00:03:23.739> but<00:03:24.310> I

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
talked about that it's hard to say but I

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.370 
talked about that it's hard to say but I
wouldn't<00:03:25.269> be<00:03:25.360> surprised<00:03:25.660> there<00:03:26.019> may<00:03:26.350> be

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
wouldn't be surprised there may be

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.880 
wouldn't be surprised there may be

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
bumped up a little bit but also kind of

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.190 
bumped up a little bit but also kind of

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
tying in with that is the addition of

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.650 
tying in with that is the addition of
this<00:03:32.350> performance<00:03:33.070> meter<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:33.970> in<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.510> past

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
this performance meter so in the past

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.430 
this performance meter so in the past
you<00:03:34.959> know<00:03:36.330> avoiding<00:03:37.330> frame<00:03:37.600> rate<00:03:37.810> performance

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
you know avoiding frame rate performance

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.590 
you know avoiding frame rate performance

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
thing in Halo games you know if the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.550 
thing in Halo games you know if the
engines<00:03:43.150> trying<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.570> render<00:03:43.780> too<00:03:44.080> many<00:03:44.260> forge

objects<00:03:45.010> at<00:03:45.160> once<00:03:45.280> it'll<00:03:45.580> suffer<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.329> little

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
chug and frame rate it'll slow down so

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.509 
chug and frame rate it'll slow down so
they're<00:03:49.900> giving<00:03:50.230> us<00:03:50.320> this<00:03:50.500> little<00:03:50.829> bar<00:03:51.130> right

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
they're giving us this little bar right

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.910 
they're giving us this little bar right
under<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.940> like<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.390> monitor<00:03:52.750> shield<00:03:53.530> bar<00:03:53.769> at

under the like the monitor shield bar at
the<00:03:54.010> top<00:03:54.070> of<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.370> screen<00:03:54.549> that<00:03:55.180> shows

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
the top of the screen that shows

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.690 
the top of the screen that shows
performance<00:03:56.829> on<00:03:56.950> it's<00:03:57.070> basically<00:03:57.340> just<00:03:57.430> this

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
performance on it's basically just this

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.460 
performance on it's basically just this
little<00:03:57.850> green<00:03:58.090> bar<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:58.599> like<00:03:58.690> if<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.080> starts

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
little green bar and like if it starts

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.690 
little green bar and like if it starts
to<00:03:59.500> fill<00:03:59.709> up<00:03:59.739> with<00:03:59.920> red

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
to fill up with red

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.610 
to fill up with red
be<00:04:01.060> like<00:04:01.209> okay<00:04:01.510> your<00:04:01.660> performance<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.500> going

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
be like okay your performance is going

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.470 
be like okay your performance is going
to<00:04:02.680> be<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.770> bit<00:04:02.920> more<00:04:03.040> poor<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.879> would<00:04:04.360> imagine

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
to be a bit more poor I would imagine

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.570 
to be a bit more poor I would imagine
that<00:04:05.080> given<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.470> we're<00:04:05.680> working<00:04:05.830> with<00:04:06.129> much

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
that given that we're working with much

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.750 
that given that we're working with much
newer<00:04:06.970> hardware<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:08.440> performance<00:04:09.160> issues

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
newer hardware that performance issues

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.509 
newer hardware that performance issues
will<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.180> would<00:04:10.750> think<00:04:11.019> be<00:04:11.379> slightly<00:04:11.860> easier<00:04:12.129> to

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
will I would think be slightly easier to

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.729 
will I would think be slightly easier to
avoid<00:04:12.760> anyways<00:04:13.300> but<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.110> you<00:04:14.170> know<00:04:14.319> you'll<00:04:14.590> get

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
avoid anyways but so you know you'll get

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.500 
avoid anyways but so you know you'll get
that<00:04:14.890> meter<00:04:15.160> so<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.459> won't<00:04:15.670> be<00:04:15.790> like<00:04:15.940> sitting

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
that meter so you won't be like sitting

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.140 
that meter so you won't be like sitting
there<00:04:16.660> like<00:04:16.810> trying<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:18.070> see<00:04:18.430> is<00:04:18.609> this<00:04:18.880> frame

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
there like trying to see is this frame

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.580 
there like trying to see is this frame
rate<00:04:19.299> dropping<00:04:19.540> when<00:04:19.780> i<00:04:19.810> do<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:19.989> i<00:04:20.139> can<00:04:20.410> tell

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
rate dropping when i do that i can tell

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.280 
rate dropping when i do that i can tell
you<00:04:21.040> know<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:22.330> will<00:04:22.479> have<00:04:22.660> this<00:04:22.780> meter<00:04:23.080> the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
you know so it will have this meter the

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.010 
you know so it will have this meter the
added<00:04:23.800> functionality<00:04:24.030> they've<00:04:25.030> also<00:04:25.180> you

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
added functionality they've also you

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.379 
added functionality they've also you
know<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.340> in<00:04:27.340> their<00:04:27.550> little<00:04:27.729> list<00:04:28.090> they

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
know the in their little list they

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.510 
know the in their little list they
showed<00:04:28.720> they<00:04:29.470> showed<00:04:29.710> some<00:04:29.740> features<00:04:30.220> like

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
showed they showed some features like

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.140 
showed they showed some features like
snap<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:31.150> ground<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.840> align<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:32.470> ground<00:04:33.150> also

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
snap to ground and align to ground also

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.960 
snap to ground and align to ground also
like<00:04:34.330> movement<00:04:34.660> snap<00:04:35.490> in<00:04:36.490> some<00:04:36.820> of<00:04:36.880> these

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
like movement snap in some of these

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.000 
like movement snap in some of these
features<00:04:37.180> it's<00:04:37.540> like<00:04:37.720> you<00:04:38.410> know<00:04:38.500> you<00:04:38.560> can<00:04:38.800> kind

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
features it's like you know you can kind

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.129 
features it's like you know you can kind
of<00:04:39.070> think<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.910> okay<00:04:40.360> i<00:04:40.389> think<00:04:40.660> i<00:04:40.900> know<00:04:40.960> what

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
of think of okay i think i know what

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.140 
of think of okay i think i know what
that<00:04:41.260> means<00:04:41.470> but<00:04:41.740> it's<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.669> you<00:04:42.820> know<00:04:42.940> we<00:04:43.060> don't

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
that means but it's it you know we don't

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.760 
that means but it's it you know we don't
know<00:04:43.330> exactly<00:04:43.510> how<00:04:44.260> that's<00:04:44.470> going<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.710> be

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
know exactly how that's going to be

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.320 
know exactly how that's going to be
implemented<00:04:45.070> exactly<00:04:45.760> how<00:04:45.850> those<00:04:46.000> features

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
implemented exactly how those features

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.719 
implemented exactly how those features
are<00:04:46.389> going<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.630> work<00:04:46.720> just<00:04:47.320> yet<00:04:47.500> but<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:48.669> know

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
are going to work just yet but you know

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.690 
are going to work just yet but you know
it's<00:04:49.120> pretty<00:04:49.419> cool<00:04:49.570> so<00:04:50.070> another<00:04:51.070> big<00:04:51.669> thing

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
it's pretty cool so another big thing

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.280 
it's pretty cool so another big thing
they<00:04:52.000> talked<00:04:52.210> about<00:04:52.300> was<00:04:52.600> like<00:04:52.870> having

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
they talked about was like having

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.310 
they talked about was like having
cleaner<00:04:53.770> smoother<00:04:54.400> forge<00:04:55.020> objects<00:04:56.020> you<00:04:56.229> know

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
cleaner smoother forge objects you know

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.200 
cleaner smoother forge objects you know
like<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.620> textures<00:04:57.070> on<00:04:57.220> these<00:04:57.340> objects<00:04:57.729> so

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
like the textures on these objects so

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.790 
like the textures on these objects so
you<00:04:58.300> can<00:04:58.419> kind<00:04:58.630> of<00:04:58.660> get<00:04:58.840> like<00:04:58.990> a<00:04:59.050> more<00:04:59.320> coherent

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
you can kind of get like a more coherent

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.409 
you can kind of get like a more coherent
book<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.280> your<00:05:00.370> forge<00:05:00.669> maps<00:05:00.910> it<00:05:01.090> wasn't<00:05:01.300> always

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
book to your forge maps it wasn't always

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.690 
book to your forge maps it wasn't always
easy<00:05:01.540> in<00:05:01.960> Halo<00:05:02.320> 4<00:05:02.590> or<00:05:02.830> halo<00:05:03.100> reach<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.520> make

easy in Halo 4 or halo reach to make

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.659 
easy in Halo 4 or halo reach to make
like<00:05:03.880> really<00:05:04.150> clean<00:05:05.190> coherent<00:05:06.190> looking<00:05:06.460> maps

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
like really clean coherent looking maps

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.760 
like really clean coherent looking maps
so<00:05:07.389> it<00:05:07.570> looks<00:05:07.780> like<00:05:07.930> they're<00:05:08.080> taking<00:05:08.350> steps<00:05:08.590> to

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
so it looks like they're taking steps to

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.409 
so it looks like they're taking steps to
do<00:05:08.889> that<00:05:09.070> we've<00:05:09.280> only<00:05:09.430> seen<00:05:09.700> a<00:05:09.760> couple<00:05:09.880> of

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
their objects they look to be the halo 4

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.480 
their objects they look to be the halo 4

have all the halo 2 standard modes but

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.010 
have all the halo 2 standard modes but
then<00:05:54.220> we're<00:05:54.340> also<00:05:54.490> getting<00:05:54.700> infection<00:05:55.419> race

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
then we're also getting infection race

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.379 
then we're also getting infection race
and<00:05:56.380> ricochet<00:05:56.860> on<00:05:57.070> top<00:05:57.550> of<00:05:57.700> that<00:05:57.789> and<00:05:57.970> then

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
and ricochet on top of that and then

00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:59.760 
and ricochet on top of that and then
getting<00:05:58.599> things<00:05:58.900> like<00:05:59.080> the<00:05:59.200> assault<00:05:59.410> rifle

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
getting things like the assault rifle

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.050 
getting things like the assault rifle
the<00:05:59.860> silence<00:06:00.190> SMD<00:06:00.550> begun

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
the silence SMD begun

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.090 
the silence SMD begun
ucil<00:06:01.360> and<00:06:01.510> so<00:06:02.320> you<00:06:02.380> know<00:06:02.590> there's<00:06:02.770> gonna<00:06:02.919> be<00:06:03.070> a

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
ucil and so you know there's gonna be a

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.340 
ucil and so you know there's gonna be a
ton<00:06:03.490> of<00:06:03.550> stuff<00:06:03.880> to<00:06:03.910> work<00:06:04.240> with<00:06:04.270> and<00:06:04.720> I<00:06:05.110> think

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
ton of stuff to work with and I think

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.409 
ton of stuff to work with and I think
that<00:06:05.470> this<00:06:05.590> is<00:06:05.889> really<00:06:06.790> going<00:06:07.030> to<00:06:07.090> have<00:06:07.210> a<00:06:07.240> lot

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
that this is really going to have a lot

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.690 
that this is really going to have a lot
of<00:06:07.480> longevity<00:06:08.250> even<00:06:09.250> if<00:06:09.340> there's<00:06:09.490> not<00:06:09.639> a

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
of longevity even if there's not a

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.120 
of longevity even if there's not a
dedicated<00:06:10.270> forged<00:06:10.750> canvas<00:06:11.139> but<00:06:11.710> you<00:06:11.980> know<00:06:12.070> you

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
dedicated forged canvas but you know you

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.980 
dedicated forged canvas but you know you
get<00:06:12.340> all<00:06:12.430> the<00:06:12.550> skybox<00:06:13.000> based<00:06:13.270> of<00:06:13.389> origin<00:06:13.720> so<00:06:13.870> we

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
get all the skybox based of origin so we

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.140 
get all the skybox based of origin so we
should<00:06:14.169> be<00:06:14.260> able<00:06:14.320> to<00:06:14.500> really<00:06:15.190> make<00:06:15.400> maps<00:06:15.700> for

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
should be able to really make maps for

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.879 
should be able to really make maps for
you<00:06:16.389> know<00:06:16.510> any<00:06:16.810> number<00:06:17.410> of<00:06:17.440> different<00:06:17.740> game
