series I'm gonna focus around domination
only<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> game<00:00:29.250> mode<00:00:29.429> domination<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.330> TDM

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
not hard point or uplink just because

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.130 
not hard point or uplink just because
uplink<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.100> runs<00:00:35.460> totally<00:00:36.059> different<00:00:36.600> retreat

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140

uplink runs totally different the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
uplink runs totally different the
domination<00:00:40.170> uplink<00:00:40.680> same<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.070> hardpoint

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
domination uplink same with hardpoint

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.880 
domination uplink same with hardpoint
retreat<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> runs<00:00:42.809> totally<00:00:43.170> different<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.829> you

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
retreat it runs totally different so you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.830 
retreat it runs totally different so you
know<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.579> guys<00:00:44.700> are<00:00:44.760> planning<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.660> play

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
know if you guys are planning on to play

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.229 
know if you guys are planning on to play
hard<00:00:46.110> point<00:00:46.350> retreat<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.309> won't<00:00:47.670> work<00:00:48.030> out

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
hard point retreat this won't work out

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.569 
hard point retreat this won't work out
for<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.050> know<00:00:49.320> domination<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
for you so you know domination is the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.520 
for you so you know domination is the
game<00:00:50.760> oh<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.329> towards<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.410> is

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
game oh that I go towards because it is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.709 
game oh that I go towards because it is
easy<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> learn<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> spawns<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
easy to learn the spawns if you have a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.779 
easy to learn the spawns if you have a
and<00:00:54.930> B<00:00:55.110> through<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> spine<00:00:55.860> at<00:00:56.010> sea<00:00:56.250> same<00:00:56.670> if

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
and B through the spine at sea same if

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
and B through the spine at sea same if
you<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.030> C<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.420> B<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.989> spawn<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.649> so

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you have C and B they spawn at a so

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.619 
you have C and B they spawn at a so
that's<00:00:59.070> why<00:00:59.190> domination<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> best<00:01:00.420> game

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that's why domination is the best game

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
that's why domination is the best game
out<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.020> opinion<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.829> series<00:01:02.190> on

all I don't want to upload you know
different<00:01:19.439> game<00:01:19.890> modes<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.729> think

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
different game modes because I think

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
different game modes because I think
domination<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
domination is the way to go it's a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.560 
domination is the way to go it's a
simple<00:01:23.520> game<00:01:23.700> oh<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.939> don't<00:01:24.090> know<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.450> guys

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
simple game oh I don't know if you guys

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
simple game oh I don't know if you guys
like<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> play<00:01:25.110> uplink<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.770> know<00:01:26.009> if<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.250> guys

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
like to play uplink I know if you guys

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.580 
like to play uplink I know if you guys
understand<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> concept<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.990> oh<00:01:28.020> so

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
understand the concept of that oh so

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.649 
understand the concept of that oh so
that's<00:01:28.710> why<00:01:28.860> I'm<00:01:28.920> gravitating<00:01:29.700> gravitating

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that's why I'm gravitating gravitating

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.530 
that's why I'm gravitating gravitating
towards<00:01:31.049> domination<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.000> game<00:01:33.240> plays

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
towards domination so this game plays

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.690 
towards domination so this game plays
actually<00:01:34.079> not<00:01:34.320> mine<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> frontal

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
actually not mine this is the frontal

into the strategy how to get a DNA bomb
on<00:02:04.860> retreat<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.450> playing<00:02:06.899> domination<00:02:07.590> I'm

on retreat so on playing domination I'm
going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> treat<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.280> Fox<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.729> guys<00:02:08.910> are

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
going to treat the Fox you guys are

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.820 
going to treat the Fox you guys are
going<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.569> want<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:09.989> its<00:02:10.229> alpha<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
going to want to have its alpha and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.500 
going to want to have its alpha and
Bravo<00:02:11.250> those<00:02:11.520> are<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.760> flags<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.209> are<00:02:12.300> most

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
Bravo those are the flags that are most

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.340 
Bravo those are the flags that are most
important

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
important

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.770 
important
because<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.620> think<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.400> C<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.540> most

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
because I think that C is the most

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.690 
because I think that C is the most
comfortable<00:02:16.350> spot<00:02:16.740> at<00:02:16.950> least<00:02:17.130> for<00:02:17.370> me<00:02:17.550> you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
comfortable spot at least for me you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.220 
comfortable spot at least for me you
know<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.850> can't<00:02:18.210> really<00:02:18.390> deal<00:02:18.750> with<00:02:18.840> alpha

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
know I can't really deal with alpha

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.070 
know I can't really deal with alpha
because<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:20.430> spawns<00:02:20.850> are<00:02:21.090> sometimes<00:02:21.480> you

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
because the spawns are sometimes you

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.320 
because the spawns are sometimes you
know<00:02:22.260> very<00:02:22.800> funky<00:02:23.400> at<00:02:23.550> all<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.790> us<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.150> that's

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
know very funky at all of us so that's

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.200 
know very funky at all of us so that's
why<00:02:24.480> i<00:02:24.510> prefer<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:26.040> easiest<00:02:26.550> because

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
why i prefer see is the easiest because

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.750 
why i prefer see is the easiest because
that's<00:02:27.540> charlie<00:02:28.320> they<00:02:28.440> actually<00:02:28.800> spun<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
that's charlie they actually spun in the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.970 
that's charlie they actually spun in the
cave<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.210> actually<00:02:30.750> near<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.110> cave<00:02:31.350> that's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
cave and actually near the cave that's

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.230 
cave and actually near the cave that's
you<00:02:32.130> know<00:02:32.280> that's<00:02:32.310> pretty<00:02:32.580> much<00:02:32.760> easy<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
you know that's pretty much easy to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.120 
you know that's pretty much easy to
handle<00:02:33.630> as<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.840> guys<00:02:33.960> see<00:02:34.260> from<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.830> machine

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
handle as you guys see from the machine

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.850 
handle as you guys see from the machine
here<00:02:35.460> he's<00:02:35.850> actually<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.510> know<00:02:36.600> basically

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
here he's actually you know basically

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.770 
here he's actually you know basically
like<00:02:37.860> spawn<00:02:38.460> killing<00:02:38.760> them<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.240> I'm<00:02:39.360> trapping

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
like spawn killing them so I'm trapping

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.450 
like spawn killing them so I'm trapping
them<00:02:39.930> at<00:02:40.320> Charlie<00:02:40.890> because<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.190> think<00:02:41.370> they

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
them at Charlie because I think they

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.670 
them at Charlie because I think they
keep<00:02:41.700> on<00:02:41.880> spotting<00:02:42.510> over<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.080> over<00:02:43.170> again<00:02:43.350> at

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680

i<00:03:10.650> make<00:03:11.100> sure<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.400> guys<00:03:11.580> do<00:03:11.880> using<00:03:12.210> a<00:03:12.300> so

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
i make sure you guys do using a so

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.540 
i make sure you guys do using a so
artful<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.260> best<00:03:13.470> way<00:03:13.710> in<00:03:14.190> my<00:03:14.310> opinion

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
artful it is the best way in my opinion

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.550 
artful it is the best way in my opinion
to<00:03:14.820> get<00:03:15.000> DNA<00:03:15.210> domina<00:03:15.660> tree<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.110> just

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
to get DNA domina tree and just

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.650 
to get DNA domina tree and just
basically<00:03:16.890> keep<00:03:17.550> on<00:03:17.730> going<00:03:18.030> back<00:03:18.210> and<00:03:18.390> forth

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
basically keep on going back and forth

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.530 
basically keep on going back and forth
it's<00:03:19.080> learn<00:03:19.470> from<00:03:19.800> this<00:03:19.950> gameplay<00:03:20.220> learn<00:03:21.090> how

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
it's learn from this gameplay learn how

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.510 
it's learn from this gameplay learn how
they<00:03:21.720> keep<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.020> keep<00:03:22.230> on<00:03:22.380> spawning<00:03:22.950> if<00:03:23.070> you

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
they keep it keep on spawning if you

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.430 
they keep it keep on spawning if you
guys<00:03:23.760> know<00:03:24.000> how<00:03:24.150> many<00:03:24.360> problems<00:03:24.690> maybe<00:03:25.140> if

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
guys know how many problems maybe if

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.650 
guys know how many problems maybe if
they<00:03:25.620> happen<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.250> know<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.460> push<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.910> you're

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
they happen you know the push you you're

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.600 
they happen you know the push you you're
getting<00:03:27.900> pinched<00:03:28.260> maybe<00:03:28.650> go<00:03:28.980> towards<00:03:29.520> that

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
getting pinched maybe go towards that

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.270 
getting pinched maybe go towards that
the<00:03:29.910> poolside<00:03:30.180> area<00:03:30.780> maybe<00:03:31.320> camping<00:03:31.710> it<00:03:32.040> and

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
the poolside area maybe camping it and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.160 
the poolside area maybe camping it and
like<00:03:32.520> an<00:03:32.700> ability<00:03:33.000> near<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.360> pool<00:03:33.600> maybe<00:03:33.810> but

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
like an ability near the pool maybe but

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.260 
like an ability near the pool maybe but
basically<00:03:34.650> you're<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.730> oh<00:03:35.760> you're

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
basically you're like you oh you're

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.730 
basically you're like you oh you're
watching<00:03:36.660> from<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:36.990> machine<00:03:37.290> here<00:03:37.560> just

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
watching from the machine here just

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.800 
watching from the machine here just
going<00:03:38.040> back<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.250> forth<00:03:38.700> just<00:03:38.940> killing<00:03:39.660> them

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
going back and forth just killing them

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.360 
going back and forth just killing them
and<00:03:39.870> that's<00:03:40.230> pretty<00:03:40.500> much<00:03:40.650> how<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:40.980> want<00:03:41.310> to

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
and that's pretty much how you want to

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.790 
and that's pretty much how you want to
run<00:03:41.490> retreat<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.570> is<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.960> my<00:03:43.080> opinion<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
run retreat that is in my opinion the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.100 
run retreat that is in my opinion the
easiest<00:03:44.640> way<00:03:44.910> know<00:03:45.180> how<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.360> get<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.600> DNA<00:03:45.870> by

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
easiest way know how to get a DNA by

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.440 
easiest way know how to get a DNA by
metreon<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:47.040> best<00:03:47.370> use<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.970> strategies

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
metreon is the best use the strategies

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.500 
metreon is the best use the strategies
best<00:03:48.720> use<00:03:49.020> my<00:03:49.590> opinion<00:03:50.040> using<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.550> sor<00:03:51.120> collect

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
best use my opinion using a sor collect

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.080 
best use my opinion using a sor collect
the<00:03:51.600> ARX<00:03:51.990> hole<00:03:52.260> puncher<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:53.220> know<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.430> IMR

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
the ARX hole puncher you know the IMR

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.230 
the ARX hole puncher you know the IMR
the<00:03:54.390> ak-12<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.350> belt<00:03:55.560> when<00:03:55.830> t7<00:03:56.370> guns<00:03:57.000> like

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
the ak-12 the belt when t7 guns like

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.080 
the ak-12 the belt when t7 guns like
those<00:03:57.480> would<00:03:57.780> completely<00:03:58.350> dominate<00:03:59.160> retreat

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
those would completely dominate retreat

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.380 
those would completely dominate retreat
so<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.990> is<00:04:01.140> pretty<00:04:01.500> much<00:04:01.740> it<00:04:02.070> guys<00:04:02.390> nothing

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
so that is pretty much it guys nothing

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.480 
so that is pretty much it guys nothing
much<00:04:03.690> nothing<00:04:04.110> too<00:04:04.380> special<00:04:04.650> about<00:04:05.010> this<00:04:05.190> map

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
much nothing too special about this map

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.070 
much nothing too special about this map
it's<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.940> one<00:04:06.090> of<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.240> easiest<00:04:06.480> maps<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:06.960> my

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
it's the one of the easiest maps in my

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.410 
it's the one of the easiest maps in my
opinion<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.620> get<00:04:07.800> DNA<00:04:08.040> bomb<00:04:08.400> as<00:04:08.640> well<00:04:09.270> i<00:04:09.300> think

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
opinion to get DNA bomb as well i think

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.630 
opinion to get DNA bomb as well i think
that<00:04:09.600> riot<00:04:10.020> is<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.530> easiest<00:04:10.860> map<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.280> get<00:04:11.490> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
that riot is the easiest map to get a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.240 
that riot is the easiest map to get a
DNA<00:04:11.790> on<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.230> pretty<00:04:13.830> much<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.070> guys

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
DNA on and that is pretty much it guys

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.980 
DNA on and that is pretty much it guys
so<00:04:14.730> hopefully<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.300> guys<00:04:15.510> did<00:04:15.750> enjoyed

today's episode<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.070> by<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.700> way<00:04:17.910> actually

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
today's episode and by the way actually

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.690 
today's episode and by the way actually
transition<00:04:19.020> here<00:04:19.260> because<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.890> was<00:04:20.250> going<00:04:20.549> to

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
transition here because it was going to

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.670 
transition here because it was going to
be<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:21.030> know<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.180> end<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.750> first<00:04:22.140> half<00:04:22.350> so

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
be you know the end of the first half so

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.469 
be you know the end of the first half so
actually<00:04:23.010> transition<00:04:23.520> here<00:04:23.729> we<00:04:24.270> actually

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
actually transition here we actually

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.330 
actually transition here we actually
picked<00:04:24.870> up<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.140> DNA<00:04:25.470> bomb<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.190> was

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
picked up the DNA bomb so that was

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.140 
picked up the DNA bomb so that was
pretty<00:04:26.520> much<00:04:26.700> it

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
pretty much it

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.910 
pretty much it
we<00:04:27.389> go<00:04:27.509> 6<00:04:27.840> 19<00:04:28.259> and<00:04:28.500> I'm<00:04:28.860> out<00:04:28.979> of<00:04:29.009> here<00:04:29.130> peace<00:04:29.669> out
