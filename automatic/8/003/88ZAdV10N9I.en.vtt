00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.070
 Welcome to this video where 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:08.120
 let's see something about the land rober 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:09.890
 parenti of the Australian army year 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.930
 2000 2003 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.320
 let's see all clear and fast signal of 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.320
 when 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.060
 but 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.289
 the name of my being 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.910
 a support for land rober 610 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.579
 produced by the quota was limited 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.430
 for the industry and assembled parts 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:38.310
 for the moral 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.310
 380 and 1990 we have from the front 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:59.929
 the appetizer is based on the two nations 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.110
 we see the camouflaged in this copy very 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.829
 beautiful 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.390
 very nice people 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.790
 there are no brothers 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.220
 this program intentions four by 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.610
 four six six then we see 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.150
 the 4x4 versions 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.720
 of these vehicles these are 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.210
 driven by a 3.9 biker 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.400
 four-cylinder liters designs has already 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.020
 demonstrated stability in all 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.730
 military operations that have had a 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.340
 Australian army in recent years 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.470
 both in somalia east timor- the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.170
 Solomon Islands Iraq and Afghanistan 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.420
 mainly the big difference 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.200
 we must another another shot of a very take 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.229
 pretty of this merit 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.229
 we see Australians 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.120
 ah 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.260
 for deserts it 's completely different 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.430
 we 're going to see it from another vehicle to the 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.430
 rear part 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.990
 then the big difference with respect 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.439
 to the British is that they have a 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.560
 longer chassis wider and that is 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.290
 Made with special galvanized steel 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.270
 High strength is not a given vehicle 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.270
 It has no capacity and mines 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.099
 and australia has deployed more a way 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.319
 about 10,000 of these 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:29.530
 vehicles of both versions both six 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:32.530
 by six spiritual data of the triple 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.530
 64 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.240
 feel refers to the quality of the 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:46.670
 largest native letter in australia 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.670
 and they are being eliminated 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.480
 and they are being removed by meat 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.510
 it is to note that these vehicles 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.080
 and repeated to civilians 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.760
 maybe repainted with some 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.220
 modifications in its characteristics 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.690
 it's cota is being put out of manuel 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.690
 in the price 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.700
 a vehicle from which another video exists 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.230
 in which it locates us in which we are going to 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.990
 see it with tomato is more 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.160
 in detail we see between the fronts 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.330
 tactical we already observed 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.330
 the blood 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.010
 tactical vehicle color 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.629
 Then they will die as they are 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.629
 sending to the irak stand 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.630
 the walk 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.230
 walls of the room with three lamps 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.940
 special low to contain actions 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.940
 of the desert at night 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.680
 It was where the journalists' fingers 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.090
 They are Carlos who is being retired 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.090
 your car the same 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.220

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.220
 morning 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.750
 so is 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.890
 d 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.870
 discharge 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.470
 and in the offices our census 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.870
 end for operations during the 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.870
 desert 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:00.330
 specific for the loading area of some 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:07.610
 pounds 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.610
 but it is quite practical 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.220
 while we have 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.570
 showed up 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.640
 well thank you very much that this is all 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.640

 it does not have tires 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.190
