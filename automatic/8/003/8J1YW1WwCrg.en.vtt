how to be better at the actual mechanics
of<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> game<00:00:08.849> versus<00:00:09.750> just<00:00:09.900> quick<00:00:10.170> tips<00:00:10.440> here

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
talking about the AI and titanfall

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.640 
talking about the AI and titanfall
meaning<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> grunts<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> spectres<00:00:15.809> that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
meaning the grunts in the spectres that

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.950 
meaning the grunts in the spectres that
are<00:00:16.830> available<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> kill<00:00:18.119> constantly

are available for you to kill constantly

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.840 
are available for you to kill constantly
within<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> game<00:00:19.740> now<00:00:20.310> there's<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.580> lot<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
within the game now there's a lot of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.210 
within the game now there's a lot of
negative<00:00:21.449> feelings<00:00:21.960> around<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> AI<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:23.010> some

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
negative feelings around the AI for some

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.009 
negative feelings around the AI for some
reason<00:00:23.519> people<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:24.090> seem<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.330> hate<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.810> fact

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
reason people just seem to hate the fact

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.050 
reason people just seem to hate the fact
that<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.410> there<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.920> don't<00:00:26.609> personally

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
that it's there I don't personally

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.910 
that it's there I don't personally
understand<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.930> think<00:00:27.990> there's<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> few<00:00:28.650> good

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
understand it I think there's a few good

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.130 
understand it I think there's a few good
reasons<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.029> reasons<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.019> are

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
reasons it's there and reasons that are

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.049 
reasons it's there and reasons that are
pretty<00:00:31.289> necessary<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> game<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.000> I'm

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
pretty necessary to the game so I'm

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.400 
pretty necessary to the game so I'm
going<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.239> go<00:00:33.390> over<00:00:33.420> those<00:00:33.660> really<00:00:33.989> quickly

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
going to go over those really quickly

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.690 
going to go over those really quickly
here<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.770> let<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.010> guys<00:00:35.130> know<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> little<00:00:35.550> bit

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
here and let you guys know a little bit

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.979 
here and let you guys know a little bit
of<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.880> insight<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.480> things<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
of the insight and the things that the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.369 
of the insight and the things that the
AI<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.410> actually<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.210> number<00:00:40.140> one

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
AI can actually do for you so number one

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.280 
AI can actually do for you so number one
I<00:00:40.680> guess<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.430> off<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> bat<00:00:41.820> AI<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.660> there<00:00:43.079> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
I guess right off the bat AI is there to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.970 
I guess right off the bat AI is there to
make<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.469> game<00:00:43.829> feel<00:00:44.510> faster<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.620> very

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
make the game feel faster you have very

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.889 
make the game feel faster you have very
big<00:00:47.219> maps<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.270> very<00:00:48.480> big<00:00:48.690> match

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
big maps you have to have very big match

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:49.970 
big maps you have to have very big match
because<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.379> supporting<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:49.950> only

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
because you're supporting not only

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.279 
because you're supporting not only
pilots<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.210> you're<00:00:51.329> supporting<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:51.780> giant

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
pilots but you're supporting these giant

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.979 
pilots but you're supporting these giant
titans<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.399> AI<00:00:53.640> wasn't<00:00:54.120> there<00:00:54.480> you'd

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
titans and if AI wasn't there you'd

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
titans and if AI wasn't there you'd
spend<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.289> whole<00:00:55.530> lot<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:56.100> time<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.340> searching

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
spend a whole lot of time just searching

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.569 
spend a whole lot of time just searching
for<00:00:57.120> an<00:00:57.360> enemy<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> kill<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:58.559> 6v6<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
for an enemy to kill because 6v6 is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.160 
for an enemy to kill because 6v6 is
what's<00:00:59.789> worked<00:01:00.000> best<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.420> them<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.840> creating

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
what's worked best for them and creating

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.709 
what's worked best for them and creating
the<00:01:01.350> game<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> some<00:01:03.000> people<00:01:03.270> would<00:01:03.329> argue<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the game so some people would argue that

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.920 
the game so some people would argue that
oh<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.320> could<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.830> 12<00:01:05.070> e<00:01:05.220> 12<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.909> 18<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.510> 18<00:01:06.900> or

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
oh it could be 12 e 12 or 18 be 18 or

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.830 
oh it could be 12 e 12 or 18 be 18 or
whatever<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:07.979> balance<00:01:08.520> would<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.090> it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
whatever that balance would be and it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.440 
whatever that balance would be and it
might<00:01:10.110> work<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.310> imagine<00:01:11.430> having<00:01:11.939> 12

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
might work but can you imagine having 12

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.170 
might work but can you imagine having 12
titans<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.500> map<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.130> time<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
titans on on a map at one time that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.570 
titans on on a map at one time that
would<00:01:15.270> be<00:01:15.420> crazy<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.799> yeah<00:01:17.220> okay<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
would be crazy and so yeah okay you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.890 
would be crazy and so yeah okay you
could<00:01:17.729> put<00:01:17.790> Titan<00:01:18.210> limits<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
could put Titan limits but then that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.240 
could put Titan limits but then that
slows<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> game<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:19.860> someone<00:01:20.130> else

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
slows down the game for someone else

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.950 
slows down the game for someone else
there's<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.700> these<00:01:20.880> counterpoints<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
there's all these counterpoints and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
there's all these counterpoints and
arguments<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.250> that's<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
arguments to it but that's one of the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.249 
arguments to it but that's one of the
reasons<00:01:24.210> they're<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.869> make<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
reasons they're there is to make the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.590 
reasons they're there is to make the

and help you get into that Titan faster
it's<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.340> better<00:01:50.549> strategy<00:01:50.820> than<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.509> hunting

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it's a better strategy than just hunting

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.060 
it's a better strategy than just hunting
for<00:01:52.079> 30<00:01:52.500> seconds<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.250> shoot<00:01:53.759> 11<00:01:54.420> pilot<00:01:55.070> instead

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
for 30 seconds to shoot 11 pilot instead

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.370 
for 30 seconds to shoot 11 pilot instead
of<00:01:56.250> hunting<00:01:56.850> for<00:01:57.270> five<00:01:57.509> seconds<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.200> shoot

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
of hunting for five seconds to shoot

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.560 
of hunting for five seconds to shoot
three<00:01:58.740> specters<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.729> three<00:02:00.119> grunts

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
three specters or three grunts

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.880 
three specters or three grunts
definitely<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.469> something<00:02:01.649> that's<00:02:01.799> going

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
definitely it's something that's going

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.109 
definitely it's something that's going
to<00:02:01.979> benefit<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.579> long<00:02:02.670> run<00:02:02.850> in

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
getting those Titans AI kills also count

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.639 
getting those Titans AI kills also count
towards<00:02:06.329> objectives<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.960> some<00:02:07.170> games<00:02:07.350> like

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
towards objectives in some games like

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.650 
towards objectives in some games like
attrition<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:08.849> you're<00:02:09.000> ignoring<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> min

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
attrition so if you're ignoring the min

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.080 
attrition so if you're ignoring the min
attrition<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.530> may<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.800> slowing<00:02:11.610> down<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
attrition you may be slowing down the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.400 
attrition you may be slowing down the
game<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.510> slowing<00:02:12.780> down<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.020> time

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
game and slowing down the time

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.600 
game and slowing down the time
what<00:02:13.470> your<00:02:13.620> team<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:14.040> win<00:02:14.190> because<00:02:14.370> you're

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
what your team can win because you're

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.460 
what your team can win because you're
only<00:02:14.700> searching<00:02:15.210> for<00:02:15.390> pilots<00:02:15.870> they

only searching for pilots they

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.260 
only searching for pilots they
definitely<00:02:16.770> can<00:02:17.040> count<00:02:17.340> towards<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.880> total

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
definitely can count towards that total

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.180 
definitely can count towards that total
objective<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.080> really<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.710> third<00:02:19.980> reason

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190

partially<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.910> help<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.600> game<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.990> faster<00:02:28.440> but

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
partially to help the game be faster but

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.140

spectres to follow you around on the map
like<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.470> would<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.770> an<00:02:46.920> attack<00:02:47.220> dog<00:02:47.250> now

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
like you would like an attack dog now

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.720 
like you would like an attack dog now
granted<00:02:48.540> they're<00:02:48.750> not<00:02:48.930> very<00:02:49.230> good<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:50.010> lot<00:02:50.610> of

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
granted they're not very good a lot of

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.760 
granted they're not very good a lot of
players<00:02:50.880> should<00:02:51.240> be<00:02:51.420> able<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.900> get<00:02:52.230> kills<00:02:52.560> on

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
players should be able to get kills on

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.350 
players should be able to get kills on
them<00:02:52.920> but<00:02:53.220> they<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.490> provide<00:02:53.790> an<00:02:53.940> important

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
them but they can provide an important

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.870 
them but they can provide an important
distraction<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.530> allow<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:56.550> get<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
distraction to allow you to then get the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.310 
distraction to allow you to then get the
kill<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.330> player<00:02:57.510> that<00:02:57.750> you're<00:02:57.930> hunting

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
kill on the player that you're hunting

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.740 
kill on the player that you're hunting
so<00:02:59.010> there's<00:02:59.280> definitely<00:02:59.460> good<00:03:00.060> reasons<00:03:00.690> to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
so there's definitely good reasons to

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.230 
so there's definitely good reasons to
have<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.200> AI<00:03:01.350> they're<00:03:02.100> dumb<00:03:02.400> as<00:03:02.430> bricks<00:03:02.790> in

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
have the AI they're dumb as bricks in

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.420 
have the AI they're dumb as bricks in
