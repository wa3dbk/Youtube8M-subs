think<00:00:37.020> they<00:00:37.410> might<00:00:37.649> not<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.340> we'll<00:00:38.489> see<00:00:38.640> what

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
think they might not so we'll see what

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.729 
think they might not so we'll see what
happens<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.840> my<00:00:39.960> opinion<00:00:40.110> they<00:00:40.500> will

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
happens but in my opinion they will

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.389 
happens but in my opinion they will
reduce<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.399> anyway<00:00:41.910> quarters<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.050> net<00:00:43.399> 67,000

since the patch

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.670 
since the patch
is<00:04:25.370> ridiculous<00:04:26.060> he<00:04:26.180> makes<00:04:26.389> some<00:04:26.570> unreal<00:04:27.290> saves

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
is ridiculous he makes some unreal saves

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.020 
is ridiculous he makes some unreal saves
that<00:04:27.950> he<00:04:28.070> really<00:04:28.370> shouldn't<00:04:28.670> be<00:04:28.730> able<00:04:28.850> to

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
that he really shouldn't be able to

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.480 
that he really shouldn't be able to
probably<00:04:29.900> because<00:04:30.230> he's<00:04:30.350> six<00:04:30.770> foot<00:04:30.950> six<00:04:31.250> and

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
probably because he's six foot six and

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.460 
probably because he's six foot six and
now<00:04:31.910> Google<00:04:32.270> keepers<00:04:32.540> don't<00:04:32.750> flop<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.350> the
