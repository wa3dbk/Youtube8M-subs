00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.980
 It's strange, my friend is starting over. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.740
 A central look here I'll get with it and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.840
 everything today is what John was 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.340
 written by Mario ishii anti fury is 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.980
 shonen jump star in February 2012 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.010
 one is currently has 64 chapters 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.510
 and to date there is no date 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.610
 I publish here in Brazil but now 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.699
 Let's go to the storyline of Caic Gil 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.880
 tells the story that in this cry that 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.160
 the short boy of a f60 who 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.930
 fell in love with the volleyball where he was 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 walking the streets of your city and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.610
 through a tv from a store of a 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.559
 national volleyball championship and he saw 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.050
 that the team I was playing had 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.390
 a player of very short stature who 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.129
 was known as the little giant 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 that's where the guy came from the way he 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.840
 Matches search light they cut 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.729
 fell in love with the sport and solve 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.460
 also practice volleyball in your 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.050
 school he searches for the volleyball team 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.110
 but nobody cares about the sport 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.209
 and it was not the men's volleyball team 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 he ends up being the only player the only 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:23.520
 person in order to play your volleyball 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.259
 school to a female team so he 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.660
 starts training with the women's team and 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.250
 mostly train alone it still 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.160
 it will not be smart that he has friends 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.590
 and he manages to persuade these friends to 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.330
 play volleyball with him only the guys play 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.789
 half of a joke one takes the thing to 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.670
 Seriously as it takes it starts to 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.890
 to practice much 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.000
 he trains all day long he devotes himself 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.310
 to the sport 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.500
 so far his school can enter 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.099
 a championship was there and all regional 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.300
 more 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:56.489
 but only renato knows how to play the 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.920
 other players is that 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:01.789
 joking used to and on your first 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 play in this regional championship they are 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.780
 humiliated they lose ugly however 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.539
 nothing stands out from the majority because despite 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.300
 of him being six feet tall 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.540
 can give a few leaps worth of washer 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.569
 those hairs traveled on the street to the courts 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.040
 to destroy the earth this front 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.469
 game 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.840
 happens a school that has a player 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:27.890
 that he is a genius he is the most expensive 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.489
 peak of the future neymar talent of the ox 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.219
 ball 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.920
 This player is the one 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:36.909
 considered the king of the court the guy has 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.310
 a panoramic view before all else would 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:42.260
 lifter is a pillar of the team 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.000
 rat poison play them nor what they create 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.450
 a rivalry him during that first 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.510
 the unit promises that it will overcome the 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.129
 the tobio and heard that he is better 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.620
 drop the sport because it has no 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.189
 way for this to weigh in the big 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.549
 bids he makes history advances 1 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.650
 year and 3 months there and it happens that he 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.489
 reached in elementary school both the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.950
 all that the renato it reached the 1ยบ 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.139
 school and moved out of school because 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.849
 if fundamental japan a thing when 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.739
 It's a game thing. It's still the same school. 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.590
 entered to like then that the reign 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.889
 chooses the same school as the small one 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.290
 giant played here is the school of the team 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.090
 of the bodies was then a surprise when 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.510
 he will get there when he will have the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.260
 first volleyball practice of the school he 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.530
 meets totobola and that rivalry 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.720
 begins to become a partnership and they 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.900
 have to learn to cope together because 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.780
 are totally opposite is totally is 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.549
 emotional as a whole reason and 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.799
 they will have to start interacting 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.840
 together learn to play together to 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.489
 achieve your goals 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.470
 now speaking a little that I found this 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.569
 Manga has that very climate. 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.560
 nice is a good college story in the 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.569
 my opinion and she has a lot of 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.370
 motivation, it encourages 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.400
 people all the time not giving up on 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:14.859
 your dreams to go on to fight 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.859
 so you kind of called it 2007 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:25.070
 who just watched and this is very nice 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.110
 the volleyball games and of course is 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.980
 sensational where you get lost sometimes 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.810
 Remember manga in the hard frames of the game 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.420
 because things seem to happen a lot 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.090
 Hurry up, my God, how's it going? 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.190
 came to be there and do not know what this is my 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.700
 complicated I think it's because of 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:51.080
 sports court only diagram 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:53.000
 volleyball killing dog the li3 are 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.340
 several actually but a little more 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.730
 I liked the story of the team of the 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.310
 time is of the elementary school that the 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.460
 everything comes in today because it's the 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.110
 following is a team that is totally 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.300
 be dismantled in a place that 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.240
 he was already a great team but then the 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.940
 coach retired they fell know 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.650
 who knows he's on top and has a 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.480
 time after the coach a player 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.110
 very important to leave 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.760
 the team is totally emotionally 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.010
 unstructured players have great 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.290
 players on the team but they fought 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.890
 between them and what happens in the first 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.990
 chapters happen that the renata and other 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.940
 after they started to get along 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.640
 they will start trying to restructure 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.380
 this team bring back those players 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.230
 to interact between them and 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.770
 mainly win face this lock 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.240
 that they have in this water and the whole 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.220
 section that have been playing this 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.380
 sport and this was the only point 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.360
 attracted me in place, taking the 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.680
 plays that the club does nothing because 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.050
 are sensational 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.030
 the tokyo and lifter while renata is 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.040
 network center then they get car 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.320
 making the moves very crazy because 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.840
 nobody puts faith in the renato he is mean 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.730
 let's just say team equals because 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.890
 it surprises the opponent 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.540
 besides that is what counts with a 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.700
 Japanese animation there is a line of 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.340
 ranking debuted on April 6, 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.170
 2014 this animation has five 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.570
 episodes of the first season and has already been 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.010
 confirmed the second season however 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.760
 has not debuted yet 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.500
 The coolest difference 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.100
 I want to send an anime is simply 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.690
 face the sun is because anime has that 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.200
 besides the clear animation of the whole 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:36.840
 movement is is passes much more emotion 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.610
 due to the voices the Japanese dubbing did 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.130
 a sensational dubbing when they 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.170
 they scream they test bus 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.020
 developed cqc is very cool 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.330
 besides of course soundtrack that has that is 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.250
 sensational I did not see among the first 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.100
 episodes not with you and where I 've read 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.320
 in the manga but is was enough 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.570
 at least understand the moves a little 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.360
 that they make a manga because they do not 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.550
 pay thing is frame to frame stands half 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.590
 complicated to understand is no longer me you 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.220
 sees every move going on as much as 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.450
 Cool 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.450
 it's worth checking out 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:31.289
 of volumes in general 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:43.229
