00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that space bridge apart then they can't

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.039 
that space bridge apart then they can't
use<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.180> against<00:01:27.509> us<00:01:27.630> anymore

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049

we'd<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.860> better<00:01:29.070> off<00:01:29.190> if<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.640> could<00:01:29.790> figure

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
we'd be better off if we could figure

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.760

out<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.330> tunnels<00:01:30.750> work<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.619> could

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
out how the tunnels work then we could

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.340 
out how the tunnels work then we could
use<00:01:31.799> them<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.190> our<00:01:32.430> own<00:01:32.490> purposes<00:01:33.170> must<00:01:34.170> be

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
use them for our own purposes must be

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.289 
use them for our own purposes must be
nice<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.830> duck<00:01:35.310> into<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> tunnel<00:01:35.940> to<00:01:36.149> get

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
nice to just duck into a tunnel to get

nice to just duck into a tunnel to get
away<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.020> come<00:01:37.289> out<00:01:37.440> who<00:01:37.770> knows<00:01:37.950> where<00:01:38.340> I

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
away and come out who knows where I
