00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.200
 you can still say that you and at the same time 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.170
 okay tanks 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.459
 some more places mother 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.039
 only for gold respectively 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.219
 so threatening the spartans you haven't 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.909
 it will turn out anyway 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.909
 not clear 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.250
 so tell you the game motivation for 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.089
 me 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.669
 for many actually 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.939
 such a basic motivation to achieve 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.589
 mostly octane 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.589
 as they say in one of the villages 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.190
 here is a bigger tank 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.210
 it's all very cunning everywhere 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.440
 in fact only on the bridges itself 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.980
 heavy 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.680
 you can speak all 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.450
 but because even what is practically 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.790
 waist-high 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.840
 the game might be cooler there 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.030
 you 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.620
 extinguishes them quickly enough 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.920
 Well, plus everything but the police crowd 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.660
 corresponds to where I went 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.810
 there was such a patch 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.660
 recently test version 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.190
 which are all 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.960
 10 times 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.400
 mine and he went yes 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.480
 practical ceiling 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.010
 so i'm not at all on them 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.120
 I feel some special buzz that 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.260
 after the show show true there 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.210
 the rest 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.600
 mostly when the fight started the fig was 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.970
 conflict like buy back fruit rates 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.960
 what's important about your devices 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.950
 time 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.320
 when you go out to battle then the tanks in 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.000
 another kava in another team is not a fact that 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.150
 I generally in the team 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.030
 according to you will 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.570
 in the first place in the role in the first places 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.360
 the rest will all be lower level 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.420
 seas 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.549
 but anyway, that is, we are even pursuing 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.930
 lord of tanks 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 have you ever felt 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.090
 finally 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.660
 architects fiction 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.610
 and this circumstance 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.170
 runs because however we will be there 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.080
 be that there 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.630
 and here is the percentage 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.630
 to the very edge of your projects as such 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.019
 especially do not get it because 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.219
 trying to hospital fight there kill you 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.590
 aar not all people are patient to 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.809
 sit 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.089
 wait for stampa here and often it's really 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:19.869
 the right tactics of the ulcer 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.059
 imperial project except 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.010
 at all 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.260
 as if for some species there bullshit 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.949
 normal is absolutely strategies 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:28.840
 and rubles 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.019
 in general there is no cameron artillery 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.459
 on friday will be just funny here 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.989
 not 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.059
 will sit at the base hide in the bushes 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.059
 here is the first time she will just stare 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.249
 just a grader is active 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.249
 active combat 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.749
 can 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.749
 her order is only there 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:55.649
 respectively 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:58.649
 got that the rollers superfine 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.249
 premium account will need a lot 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:02.739
 time to them 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.390
 and when will you become confused 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.170
 minute I wonder what the game will be for her 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.370
 which will become fulfilled alright weeks 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.280
 here and there all sell completely what 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.029
 heck 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.219
 Of course, you can just pump over others 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.659
 branches of tanks but if also achieved an example 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.489
 mouse 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.609
 then will it want something else to pursue 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.609
 maybe a few I fridays 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.439
 now the choice of great taste seems to me 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.129
 stock 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:32.159
 versions 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.159
 decently cooler mouse 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.979
 but still in my opinion because 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.309
 considering how much time is needed 

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:43.309
 spend more a matter of taste 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.160
 pragmatic 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
 Kolomeytsy home 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.449
 so that it will work 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:55.929
 may all someone even 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:58.929
 after that I tried to give 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.309
 artillery 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:04.129
 mts to 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.129
 respectively, and the grant 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.949
 she ends there 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:16.649
 because while the situation 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.079
 length figurative 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.930
 examples with chinese other measures 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.319
 Markov 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:26.319
 there even think that we have achieved in fact 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:29.180
 because of course time 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.759
 you know so on 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.889
 considering that kim claisters 6 is over 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.759
 varied 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.449
 there you can still 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.499
 where are the payments to pay them all 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.039
 and then what is from 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.650
 but on the other hand considering that this 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.449
 to start the year at 9 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.159
 greis tours 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.279
 I repeat again 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.219
 on the account confuses review 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.249
 that in any case the commando ends 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:00.300
 take a look 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.050
 quite possibly plagiarized 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.879
 give part of the treasury of the week is not in a hurry 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.379
 by time 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.909
 There have already made a look there 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.770
 spend more time 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:13.809
 removes families 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:15.839
 I see sense to hang a little from the disk 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.229
 about 5 ha for now 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.069
 over time, of course, this figure can 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:23.389
 several russia 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.449
 costly will not hold 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.159
 on the contrary, it will be interesting to see 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.430
 how it develops over time 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.879
 is improving 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.879
 what appears who knows maybe 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.349
 completion would like 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.059
 incidentally retell the main ahead 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:50.110
 reviews so 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.110
 the game of the year is partly obligatory 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:55.779
 cool 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:56.889
 excessive 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.029
 is keen on 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:01.119
 all the same time is necessary 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:04.119
 opponent only 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.389
 jaded played in context
