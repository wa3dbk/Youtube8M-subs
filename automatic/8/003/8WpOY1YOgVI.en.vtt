00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.399 
life when I'm not recording and stuff
and<00:02:03.920> basically<00:02:05.570> when<00:02:06.570> you're<00:02:06.719> not<00:02:06.899> partners

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and basically when you're not partners

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.869 
and basically when you're not partners
you<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.129> kind<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.660> render<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.869> upload

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
you have to kind of render and upload

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.309 
you have to kind of render and upload
around<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> time<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.660> want<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.080> video

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
around the time that you want the video

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.970 
around the time that you want the video
to<00:02:13.470> be

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
to be

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.920 
to be
because<00:02:14.489> you<00:02:14.640> cannot<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.150> upload<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.599> during

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
because you cannot just upload it during

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.130 
because you cannot just upload it during
the<00:02:16.020> night<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.410> release<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.220> day<00:02:17.430> after

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
the night and release it the day after

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.720 
the night and release it the day after
because<00:02:19.140> then<00:02:19.560> you're<00:02:19.890> gonna<00:02:20.099> appear<00:02:20.489> very

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
because then you're gonna appear very

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.119 
because then you're gonna appear very
far<00:02:21.450> down<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.780> feet<00:02:21.989> because<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.530> timestamp

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
far down the feet because the timestamp

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.670 
far down the feet because the timestamp
is<00:02:23.280> still<00:02:23.459> gonna<00:02:23.610> be<00:02:23.750> what<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.870> was<00:02:25.080> when<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
is still gonna be what it was when the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.240 
is still gonna be what it was when the
video<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.250> finished<00:02:26.489> processing<00:02:26.940> on<00:02:27.420> YouTube

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
stuff I guess now the last cool part is

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.340 
stuff I guess now the last cool part is
that<00:03:42.590> there<00:03:43.590> will<00:03:43.680> be<00:03:43.709> ads<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.340> channel

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
that there will be ads on the channel

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.470 
that there will be ads on the channel
and<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:47.310> means<00:03:47.579> that<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.239> could<00:03:48.359> be

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
and that means that and that could be

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.229 
and that means that and that could be
anything<00:03:48.720> from<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.500> banner<00:03:50.160> ads<00:03:50.489> on<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.030> side
