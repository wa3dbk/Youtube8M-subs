so<00:03:30.120> then<00:03:30.270> on<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.630> wall<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.410> got<00:03:32.250> this<00:03:32.550> really

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
so then on this wall I got this really

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.270 
so then on this wall I got this really
great<00:03:33.120> rack<00:03:33.930> which<00:03:34.380> was<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.560> complete<00:03:34.920> pain<00:03:35.160> in

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
great rack which was a complete pain in

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.860 
great rack which was a complete pain in
the<00:03:35.370> butt<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:35.670> put<00:03:35.850> together<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.600> really

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
the butt to put together but is really

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.390 
the butt to put together but is really
helpful<00:03:37.230> because<00:03:38.120> we<00:03:39.120> are<00:03:39.209> able<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.480> use<00:03:39.660> those

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
boxes in there so stuff that I do we

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.260 
boxes in there so stuff that I do we
don't<00:03:43.170> get<00:03:43.350> into<00:03:43.500> nearly<00:03:43.980> as<00:03:44.160> often<00:03:44.400> goes<00:03:45.030> in

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
don't get into nearly as often goes in

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.120 
don't get into nearly as often goes in
there<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:47.959> we<00:03:48.959> even<00:03:49.080> have<00:03:49.320> room<00:03:49.530> look<00:03:49.860> at<00:03:49.980> that

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
there and we even have room look at that

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.870 
there and we even have room look at that
we<00:03:50.250> have<00:03:50.280> empty<00:03:50.700> spots<00:03:51.030> for<00:03:51.390> more<00:03:51.540> stuff<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.900> go

we have empty spots for more stuff to go

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.199 
we have empty spots for more stuff to go
this<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.240> our<00:03:54.870> rack<00:03:55.620> which<00:03:56.610> turned<00:03:56.880> out<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.120> be

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
this is our rack which turned out to be

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.300 
this is our rack which turned out to be
one<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.480> my<00:03:57.690> favorite<00:03:58.050> things<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.410> we<00:03:59.130> ended

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
up getting so hang in here our fire

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.580 
up getting so hang in here our fire
polish<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:03.240> particular<00:04:03.720> side<00:04:03.959> appears<00:04:04.440> to

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
polish this particular side appears to

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.560 
polish this particular side appears to
be<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:05.220> three<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.760> four<00:04:05.970> millimeter<00:04:06.390> fire

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
be the three and four millimeter fire

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.790 
be the three and four millimeter fire
polish<00:04:06.959> actually<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:07.350> is<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.590> three

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
polish actually this is the three

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.010 
polish actually this is the three
millimeter<00:04:08.160> fire<00:04:08.340> polish<00:04:08.640> size<00:04:08.850> but<00:04:09.750> let<00:04:09.900> me

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
millimeter fire polish size but let me

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.800 
millimeter fire polish size but let me
look<00:04:10.560> show<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:12.239> rack<00:04:12.450> turns<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:14.810> now

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
look show you the rack turns and now

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.949 
look show you the rack turns and now
here<00:04:16.380> is<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:17.730> 4<00:04:17.940> millimeter<00:04:18.180> fire<00:04:18.570> polish

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
here is the 4 millimeter fire polish

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.570 
here is the 4 millimeter fire polish
side<00:04:19.200> did<00:04:19.980> it<00:04:20.160> do

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
side did it do

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.469 
side did it do
and<00:04:20.669> then<00:04:21.540> turn<00:04:22.290> it<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.500> little<00:04:22.560> bit<00:04:22.860> more<00:04:23.100> and

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
and then turn it a little bit more and

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.450 
and then turn it a little bit more and
what<00:04:24.479> should<00:04:24.810> be<00:04:25.020> on<00:04:25.169> this<00:04:25.380> side<00:04:25.710> but<00:04:26.280> it's

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
what should be on this side but it's

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.390 
what should be on this side but it's
still<00:04:26.610> packed<00:04:26.850> away

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
still packed away

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.790 
still packed away
this<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.360> where<00:04:28.509> normally<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.229> 3<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.590> 4

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
this is where normally the 3 and 4

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.070 
this is where normally the 3 and 4
millimetre<00:04:30.130> crystals<00:04:30.610> go<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.360> we<00:04:31.780> took<00:04:31.930> those

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
millimetre crystals go and we took those

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.600 
millimetre crystals go and we took those
to<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.380> last<00:04:32.560> bead<00:04:32.800> show<00:04:33.040> and<00:04:33.310> so<00:04:33.490> they're

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
to the last bead show and so they're

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.060 
to the last bead show and so they're
still<00:04:33.850> in<00:04:33.940> there<00:04:34.199> then<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.320> last<00:04:35.530> thing<00:04:35.949> to
