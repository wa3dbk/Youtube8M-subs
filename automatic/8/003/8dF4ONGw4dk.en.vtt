00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
would have been one of the largest

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.490 
would have been one of the largest
mounds<00:02:43.620> in<00:02:44.130> wheelchair<00:02:44.959> indeed<00:02:45.959> possibly<00:02:46.410> the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
by 1807 we know that had been somewhat

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.539 
by 1807 we know that had been somewhat

I<00:04:28.080> say<00:04:29.080> entirely<00:04:29.550> but<00:04:30.550> five<00:04:31.389> years<00:04:31.419> ago

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020

in<00:04:32.770> 2010<00:04:33.550> I<00:04:34.110> excavated<00:04:35.110> across<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.770> footprint

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
in 2010 I excavated across the footprint

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.850 
in 2010 I excavated across the footprint
of<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.610> mount<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.960> we<00:04:37.990> found<00:04:38.380> that<00:04:38.620> there<00:04:38.800> was

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
of the mount and we found that there was

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.170 
of the mount and we found that there was
15<00:04:39.789> centimeters<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:40.900> still<00:04:41.169> surviving

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
15 centimeters of it still surviving

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.680 
15 centimeters of it still surviving
that's<00:04:43.180> lucky<00:04:43.600> for<00:04:43.780> us<00:04:44.500> because<00:04:45.160> within<00:04:45.690> about

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
that's lucky for us because within about

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.090 
that's lucky for us because within about
15<00:04:47.259> centimeters<00:04:47.940> we<00:04:49.169> uncovered<00:04:50.169> some<00:04:50.770> bone

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
15 centimeters we uncovered some bone

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.850 
15 centimeters we uncovered some bone
some<00:04:51.940> animal<00:04:52.300> bone<00:04:52.479> and<00:04:53.050> we<00:04:53.139> were<00:04:53.229> able<00:04:53.410> to<00:04:53.650> get

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
some animal bone and we were able to get

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.279 
some animal bone and we were able to get
a<00:04:53.919> radiocarbon<00:04:54.699> date<00:04:55.060> on<00:04:55.270> them<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:55.930> we<00:04:56.050> know

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
a radiocarbon date on them and we know

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.610 
a radiocarbon date on them and we know
that<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.740> mount<00:04:57.120> is<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.180> same<00:04:58.600> date<00:04:58.900> as<00:04:59.229> the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
that that mount is the same date as the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:10.330 
that that mount is the same date as the
enclosure<00:05:00.220> itself<00:05:01.949> around<00:05:02.949> 2000<00:05:04.139> 450<00:05:05.139> BC

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:19.280 

so<00:05:11.340> with<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.790> mound<00:05:12.000> have<00:05:12.210> been<00:05:12.360> here<00:05:13.290> yes

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.290

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
and how we interpret them could it be

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.939 
and how we interpret them could it be
that<00:07:20.190> people<00:07:20.789> moved<00:07:21.539> like<00:07:22.229> some<00:07:22.740> sort<00:07:22.919> of

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:22.949 
that people moved like some sort of

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:26.300 
that people moved like some sort of

or perhaps at different times of the
year<00:07:34.430> at<00:07:35.430> the<00:07:35.490> moment<00:07:35.849> we<00:07:35.940> simply<00:07:36.360> don't<00:07:36.509> know
