"Hi, my name is Babak Basiri, and today we're
here at the University of Georgia College

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.440
of Pharmacy.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.269
I'm a PhD graduate student, first year PhD
student of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.570
The general theme in our lab is essentially
measure so what we're trying to do is measure

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.300
stuff, mainly biological stuff.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.250
These biologists are not very keen about exact
measurements, and that's not good.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.059
If a science like physics made it to the state
that it is today, that's because of exact

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.059
measure.

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.360
It was essentially very tiny variations from
the expected data that influence the physicists

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.620
to come up with all these new theories to
explain those variations.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.479
While in the field of biology, we usually
attribute those to the differences in biological

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.800
systems, and as a sort of, if you call it
'noise'.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.409
And so that was the reason I joined this lab,
because I think it is important that we as

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.330
biologists start doing more exact measurements
and see what they mean.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.700
Liquid xerography and also mass spectrons.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.100
What I measure essentially are nucleotides,
with it, so nucleate acids are parts of our

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.200
genes are made of.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.840
Essentially nucleic DNA is what our made of
and there are lipid gasses.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.950
But we also have another class of nucleic
acids, RNA molecules.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.860
And the good thing about RNA molecules is
that they are regularly available to be used

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.860
as they are.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:02:01.610
So, that's why we are interested.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.619
It's not very exact, so we can see a relative
difference as we can say, okay, this sample

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.340
has more on it than that sample.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.260
But it can never actually be a very exact
number.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.319
I'm very interested in producing exact numbers
for the levels of nucleic acids in cells in

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:30.620
the body because I imagine it's hard, so we
have started using them as pharmaceutical

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.620
reagents.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.120
But our body makes a lot of them, and some
of them actually can be used to see if we

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.069
are at a state of health, or if there is a
population problem and there is a disease

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.069
going on.

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.900
Right now we have three drugs that are we
directed on the market.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.930
I know that's not so many, only three.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.000
But they're only used a trial in the past
10 years, so we're expecting to sell more

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.290
and that's why I'm interested in the field,
because i think that's going to be an important

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.370
field in the future.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.170
The first time I liked biology, the big part
of it was essentially dissecting frogs, and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.170
looking at different organs inside.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.090
The hard part of the lab was to figure out
if we had a male frog or a female frog, and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.090
that was difficult.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.879
You open it up and you can see if it has ovaries
or if it has testes.

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.519
But then, I remember, one time I opened up
this frog, we took out the ovaries and then

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.410
we hid them, and they go like, the sign said
there's this frog here we can't identify whether

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.030
it's a male or a female.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.430
And he just started digging into it trying
to find out what's going on.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.700
And he was very pissed that he can now tell
me that in some different way.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:52.450
He got over it, that was just, yeah, that
was a very good time that I had in the biology.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:00.400
But what is missing in biology is the measurements,
the exact numbers, the exact theories, because

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.540
evolution is a great theory essentially.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.610
I think we should start moving to that knowledge
the theories that generate exact numbers,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:23.690
and that's if those theories work fine right
now, and that's probably the views around

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.720
biology.
