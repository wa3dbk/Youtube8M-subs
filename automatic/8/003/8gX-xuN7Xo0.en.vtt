kind<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.590> do<00:00:34.800> some<00:00:35.160> theologizing<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> speak

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
kind of do some theologizing so to speak

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.889 
kind of do some theologizing so to speak
and<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.489> about<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> think<00:00:39.660> one

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
and when I think about that I think one

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.770 
and when I think about that I think one
of<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.110> reasons<00:00:40.500> could<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.329> proximity<00:00:42.329> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
of the reasons could be is proximity I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.040 
of the reasons could be is proximity I
think<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:44.420> Lucifer<00:00:45.420> when<00:00:45.600> he<00:00:45.780> was

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
think that Lucifer when he was

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.770 
think that Lucifer when he was
originally<00:00:47.039> created<00:00:47.340> who's<00:00:47.850> now<00:00:48.120> known<00:00:48.570> as

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
originally created who's now known as

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.860 
originally created who's now known as
Satan<00:00:49.559> or<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.829> devil<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.690> there

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
Satan or the devil I think that there

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.369 
Satan or the devil I think that there
was<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> proximity<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.579> Lucifer<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
was a proximity that Lucifer and the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.369 
was a proximity that Lucifer and the
Fallen<00:00:56.280> Angels<00:00:56.820> once<00:00:57.149> had<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> presence

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
Fallen Angels once had to the presence

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.500 
Fallen Angels once had to the presence
of<00:00:58.500> God<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.640> say<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.030> they<00:01:00.180> live

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
of God that is to say that they live

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.340 
of God that is to say that they live
fully<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.520> his<00:01:02.520> presence<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
fully in his presence and I think that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.370 
fully in his presence and I think that
Lucifer<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.909> think<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> Angels<00:01:07.020> had

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
Lucifer and I think that the Angels had

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.760 
Lucifer and I think that the Angels had
the<00:01:07.950> most<00:01:08.189> in-depth<00:01:09.290> understanding<00:01:10.290> into<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the most in-depth understanding into the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.600 
the most in-depth understanding into the
nature<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> who<00:01:11.909> God<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:13.140> holy<00:01:13.500> God<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.890> how

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
nature of who God is how holy God is how

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.420 
nature of who God is how holy God is how
great<00:01:15.000> God<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.270> how<00:01:15.720> wonderful<00:01:16.350> God<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> in

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
great God is how wonderful God is and in

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.539 
great God is how wonderful God is and in
spite<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> God's<00:01:18.600> grandeur<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.650> spite<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
spite of God's grandeur in spite of the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.300 
spite of God's grandeur in spite of the
person<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.360> God<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.900> spite<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.619> his<00:01:22.920> greatness

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
person of God in spite of his greatness

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.390 
person of God in spite of his greatness
they<00:01:24.240> rejected<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.159> they

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
they rejected that and so they

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.090 
they rejected that and so they
understood<00:01:27.590> thoroughly<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.860> those

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
understood thoroughly what those

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490 
understood thoroughly what those
consequences<00:01:29.579> would<00:01:30.119> be<00:01:30.180> when<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.140> look<00:01:31.350> at

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
consequences would be when we look at

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.460 
consequences would be when we look at
our<00:01:31.619> Bible<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:32.850> some<00:01:33.780> bits<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.229> pieces

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
that help us to put together our

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.560 
that help us to put together our
understanding<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.439> fall<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
understanding of the fall but we have to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.859 
understanding of the fall but we have to
trust<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.530> God<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.369> sovereign<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869

decision that was made and not only that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.440 
decision that was made and not only that
we<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.649> realize<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.909> humans
