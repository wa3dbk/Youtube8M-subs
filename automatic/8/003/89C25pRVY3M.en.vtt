00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hi to everyone and we are here with this 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.770
 new episode of fishing techniques in 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.070
 which I will show you the mount for 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.059
 fishing the bleak non celletta that 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.670
 serve for Italy not exceeding 15 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:22.170
 centimeters we immediately begin to see 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.269
 floats that are of various types ad 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.380
 example these are really a lot 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.380
 small to slightly larger 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.899
 or there are these types that are 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 slightly longer and these are 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.969
 the maximum size that's fine for this 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.570
 fishing of one gram and 50 which I wine there 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.610
 I advise you never to exceed a g 50 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.890
 because then the puff is not seen if the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.170
 small fish 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.399
 then precisely if I will show you 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:07.439
 the mount with this float that 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:12.030
 from 60 to 70 grams the thread I use a thread 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:17.150
 of 0 12 but a thread that goes from is fine 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.860
 ii from 0 0 6 to 0 14 in diameter 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:24.600
 I already have the son out to do 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:29.250
 first here we start with 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.520
 insert float that is equipped with 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.680
 rubber pads that need to have a lot of fire 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.360
 thin for this type of floats 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.280
 I have different types of rubber pads here 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.350
 very small and all with a very fire 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.090
 thin 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.990
 however now we need these 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.030
 which I already supplied with the float 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.619
 then we pass the thread in his 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:02:00.719
 trap is very small so a little 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.710
 difficult to center then let's pass 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.710
 the first grommet 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:17.020
 here we go and let's get into the 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:18.850
 float plug pulling it up not 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.470
 It must be either very narrow because 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.810
 I'm the thread breaks because it's not 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:31.030
 very large in diameter we insert the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.980
 second child let's pass too 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.520
 he 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.280
 here in the float auction 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.220
 let's call on the float ok now vi 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.880
 I show the sinkers that I will use that 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.110
 they are from 0 10 grams anyway 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.800
 go from 0 0 a gram to 0 15 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.680
 maximum grams then then do not go 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.520
 more good 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:05.290
 I will use these here from 0 to 10 years e 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.680
 I will use between ok we go to put i 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.680
 blonde 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.730
 I think you all know how to put on 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.250
 so I try to do enough 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:24.560
 fast 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:34.010
 here is one I put it as we put it 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:39.590
 second ok also second is done and not 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.659
 naturally we insert the third weight 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.780
 of piombini should be placed according to 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.209
 float and there it also considers the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.959
 weight of the bait I for this type of 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.560
 peach kg zorzi kitten or bego la 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.230
 earth so we should more or less insert 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.540
 then our leads are sliding a 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.849
 along the line and now we move on to the mo 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.609
 year of various sizes 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.889
 I now for example use these are 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.260
 the best years I have 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:17.269
 here is this case not of the 26 but I have them 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.859
 also of 20 22 24 and 18 16 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.789
 then let's start with these here more 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.970
 small I hope you see well not so much 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:29.870
 because very very small I show 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:36.490
 on the finger is really very small world 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.490
 so i hope it focuses ok ok 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.560
 these are from the 26 that I did 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.560
 as soon as we see instead these here are of the 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.539
 20 22 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:53.389
 I don't remember precision but anyway 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:57.409
 you see that they are not very small and 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:00.710
 these here that are of the 18 16th council 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:03.110
 to take them with the ring not with the 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.849
 scoop because being so small and 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.699
 very difficult to make the node with the email 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:11.770
 of with the palette but I love it 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:14.700
 see I use more than that 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.890
 it measures 20 22 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.630
 which takes you and made me quite small 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:25.080
 than those slightly slightly larger 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:34.900
 and then I let the thread pass 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:36.850
 here is the ring I do then it is 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.060
 exit for a moment 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:45.720
 these wires are really very small 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.720
 and these years quite hard 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:56.220
 ok it's past then i keep a bit of thread 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:06:06.930
 in excess after the hook I do a new ok 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:09.930
 then do not do them pass inside Nellino 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.930
 ok 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:22.040
 and shooting faces the last node for 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:25.640
 ensure everything here is in the node is 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.870
 did not worry that the wire 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.940
 coming out very small 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:36.310
 you don't even see if we make three knots 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.310
 ok let's cut the excess wire 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:44.750
 ok here I do not recommend leaving many 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.770
 centimeters 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:52.220
 many mm because here you can really see if 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:57.320
 we went very small ok and see that 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:07:02.840
 I love it and here it is, I hope it shows 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:06.650
 well here then our frame is 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:10.460
 ready here or trigger a note a 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:14.570
 small piece of long from the ground here 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:16.370
 they are our floating office leads 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.960
 I do not advise you to use anyway 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:23.750
 a line more than a meter and nothing 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:30.340
 with this in this video, I hope 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:30.340
 that said nothing is seen next
