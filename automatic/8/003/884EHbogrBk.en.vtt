00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.400
 winter is here and since 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.360
 winter was practically one of mine 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.190
 favorite 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.750
 indeed favorite season because there is the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.140
 Christmas is my birthday 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.480
 the plaque won exchanges measured 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.050
 perfectly perfect for my channel 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.060
 video for land earth shield after 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.570
 this useless introduction we do the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.550
 snow tag is really nice when it falls but 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.930
 then in the end it melts here is a saga 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.059
 of books that you liked a lot 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.739
 at the beginning but that the poet disappointed many 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.890
 of you may agree with me 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.489
 many of you will hate me however a 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.500
 I have chosen this question 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.030
 from the people of veronica roth it started 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.649
 very well the first book is had 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.170
 very much the second book is me 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.320
 I liked the third book even more 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.320
 he disappointed in a horrifying way 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.000
 I didn't like how he wrote it 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.500
 I liked the double point of view 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.570
 I didn't like the story 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 everything that happened there was 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.400
 all the action I expected in a 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 final was really disappointing 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.030
 snowflake something beautiful and 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.220
 unique what is a different book from everyone 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.130
 the other tonio never told the stories 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.020
 and angri 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.369
 this book is unpublished in Italy mi 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 sorry a lot you can't 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.390
 read 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.780
 though if you like English and you have too 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.579
 a school level you can better 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.150
 quietly read this book e 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.310
 buy it on amazon 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.700
 from the repository I leave the link below 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.190
 this book is really fantastic is the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.910
 first book I've ever read that 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.160
 deals mainly with relationships 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.080
 between homosexuals and I liked it 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.000
 a lot of completely different all 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.180
 what we read are me 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.490
 in love with the characters of history 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.440
 of the setting of how they talk about 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.840
 what they all think of this kind 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.410
 for me it's perfect and I think I'll keep it 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.899
 always so close to the heart that 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.490
 enough to Christmas choose the book full of 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.640
 joy and that makes your heart melt 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.280
 when the laws and theirs in parks of 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.080
 damon web or for once in the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.220
 life 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.459
 this book because I talk all the time 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:31.090
 because I am absolutely in love with it 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:33.490
 this book is the most beautiful thing is a 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.160
 strictly sweet that tiscali you 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.780
 melt the heart but that anyway 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.450
 addresses issues from the kind of book 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.459
 which is only physical or is also a book 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.470
 serious though it is a puppet favorite 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.000
 of snow is always nice to do we give one with 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.010
 his family which is a book that 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.910
 could be read by all of yours 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.810
 family 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.730
 now the jacqueline wilson smashes with 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.019
 nut holds family there are also a 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.160
 little of my children due 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.870
 pick one up for a bit wider age and 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.250
 practically almost silenced too 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.660
 linguism could be fine for the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.090
 I think my family ought to 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.010
 more than that makes you laugh and it's fun 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.840
 then talk about kids levels 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.659
 helping families was because 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.280
 I propose Santa Claus he always chooses 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.950
 excellent gifts which is the book that 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.959
 would you like to receive at christmas from the moment 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.420
 that I asked a lot of books for 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.220
 my birthday and as many for Christmas 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.420
 let's say the river does have some though 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.970
 at the moment the books I want 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.860
 absolutely read are the third 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.930
 fourth the fifth the sixth of the saga 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.180
 become an academy says the mild I read 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.709
 the first two blocks and then I have 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.530
 absolutely have the last four 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.319
 months earlier at Christmas time we talk about 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.760
 snow smoke attachments affects which is a 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.400
 book that hurt you like you have 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.780
 made to feel sad or angry 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.829
 the last book of a motorcycle feel 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.180
 Germans sadness of james dashner 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.970
 this book was a blow to the heart 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.760
 atrocious I left from the sea the series 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.030
 so so to love her completely a 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.680
 give us all myself 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.840
 this book killed me 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.690
 I can't tell you why but he killed me 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.069
 sled who does not have a nice ski uars her 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.349
 but especially when you are small 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.690
 choose the book that is loved as a child 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.609
 the spies of ally carter this is the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.560
 third book basically I mean all 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.039
 the spiders series when I was a child 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.449
 I used to read about them one day 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.389
 absolutely beautiful in my opinion 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.740
 you might like it even now if maybe 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.599
 we are because in the end it is ugly 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.669
 adventure 21 21 of the environment really 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.110
 nice here the idea bites advice of 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.820
 ice chooses a book that has you 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.979
 disappointed looking with the john green plates 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.610
 is what is implied by meoni john 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:48.510
 green I don't like characters not 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.800
 i like alaska at the ax i find it to be 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.020
 one of the most popular people in 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.300
 I will not like this planet from time to time 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.310
 the story that is, in the end it was a 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.229
 another nice because john grinder 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.070
 can make you love anything you do 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.760
 write to the way of writing 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.220
 very captivating mind catching 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.170
 that does not let you go his book 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.910
 so it's not finished 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.550
 but in my opinion this is the story 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.070
 trivial the final plot was 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.070
 trivial I expected that it would be 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.080
 success what happened then yes 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.430
 reads the use a little and frees a drink a 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.280
 price less not that I do not 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.770
 liked though not 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.360
 and finally the rudolph reindeer and then 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.430
 take advantage of Santa Claus choose the 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.870
 book that is very expensive for you 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.510
 I think that no explanations are needed for 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.460
 this I see that this is the winter isca 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.330
 an ebook dead space liked and is there 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.780
 less in the next street 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.780
 Hello
