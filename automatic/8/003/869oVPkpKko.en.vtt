bit extra because I still at the moment
have<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> lot<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.329> fusion<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.930> haven't

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
have a lot of a fusion one in haven't

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.290 
have a lot of a fusion one in haven't
enough<00:00:37.710> time<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> sort<00:00:38.219> out<00:00:38.370> again<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.180> add

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
enough time to sort out again to add

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.860 
enough time to sort out again to add
some<00:00:39.450> new<00:00:39.600> bits<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.320> um<00:00:40.579> there's<00:00:41.579> no

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
some new bits to it so um there's no

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.030 
some new bits to it so um there's no
extra<00:00:42.870> filtration<00:00:43.110> no<00:00:43.590> mechanical

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
extra filtration no mechanical

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.350 
extra filtration no mechanical
filtration<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.610> I've<00:00:44.700> done<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.180> it's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
filtration so I've done that and it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.850 
filtration so I've done that and it's
actually<00:00:45.570> caught<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> lot<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.960> crap<00:00:46.230> already<00:00:46.500> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
registration of support there's no way I

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.850 
registration of support there's no way I
was<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> try<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.030> hit<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> I

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
was going to try to hit like that I

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.080 
was going to try to hit like that I
could<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.070> collapsing<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.670> soon<00:01:26.820> as<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
could see that collapsing as soon as the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.240 
could see that collapsing as soon as the
power<00:01:27.270> head<00:01:27.479> went<00:01:27.689> near<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:29.130> I've<00:01:29.220> just

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
power head went near it so I've just

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.679 
power head went near it so I've just
literally<00:01:29.820> turn<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> lights<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> few

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
literally turn the lights on a few

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.310 
literally turn the lights on a few
minutes<00:01:30.780> ago

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
minutes ago

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.950 
minutes ago
so<00:01:31.590> everything's<00:01:31.920> starting<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.310> come<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
so everything's starting to come up the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
so everything's starting to come up the
leather<00:01:34.170> over<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.950> he<00:01:35.340> started<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.030> open<00:01:36.119> up

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
leather over there he started to open up

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.130 
leather over there he started to open up
again<00:01:36.630> obviously<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.500> was<00:01:37.619> closed<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:39.140> just

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
again obviously it was closed so just

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.929 
again obviously it was closed so just
I've<00:01:40.200> got<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.350> focus<00:01:40.619> point<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:41.040> I'm<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:41.880> to

yes<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.289> got<00:04:23.680> some<00:04:23.830> things<00:04:23.979> to<00:04:24.039> think<00:04:24.250> about<00:04:24.310> but

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
yes I got some things to think about but

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.400 
yes I got some things to think about but
the<00:04:25.060> aquascape<00:04:25.300> basically<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.139> means<00:04:26.259> that

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
the aquascape basically it means that

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.140 
the aquascape basically it means that
I'll<00:04:26.590> get<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:26.919> much<00:04:27.069> flow<00:04:27.340> around<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:27.940> sand

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
I'll get so much flow around the sand

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
no detritus build-up now hopefully um

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.899 
no detritus build-up now hopefully um
and<00:04:35.530> if<00:04:36.009> there<00:04:36.159> is<00:04:36.310> that<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.520> can<00:04:36.669> just<00:04:36.789> come

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
along and suck it off the sand bait

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.249 
along and suck it off the sand bait
or<00:04:39.190> put<00:04:40.180> in<00:04:40.240> power<00:04:40.389> heyday<00:04:40.690> for<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.960> little<00:04:41.139> bit

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
or put in power heyday for a little bit

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.439 
or put in power heyday for a little bit
but<00:04:41.889> directly<00:04:42.310> stow<00:04:42.819> all<00:04:42.849> up<00:04:43.120> into<00:04:43.360> the

surface into the Walsh room and then get

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.969 
surface into the Walsh room and then get
out<00:04:46.509> that<00:04:46.690> way<00:04:46.810> so<00:04:46.840> really<00:04:47.349> happy<00:04:47.500> with<00:04:47.710> how<00:04:47.830> it
