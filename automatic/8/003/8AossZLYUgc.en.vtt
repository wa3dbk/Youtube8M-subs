completely like if you have a new year's

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.580 
completely like if you have a new year's
resolution<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:48.400> read<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.210> book<00:04:49.419> each<00:04:49.720> week<00:04:50.139> for

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
resolution to read a book each week for

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.770

a<00:04:50.620> year<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:51.220> don't<00:04:51.490> think<00:04:51.550> it's<00:04:51.820> reading<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.330> 52

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
a year I don't think it's reading the 52

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.659 
a year I don't think it's reading the 52
books<00:04:53.080> that<00:04:53.410> really<00:04:53.860> matters<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.370> think<00:04:54.550> it's

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669
