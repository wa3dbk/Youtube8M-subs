 or not 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.300
 i 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 two 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.200
 20 minutes from the city of Tepic so 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.690
 near the city and so far from the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.750
 quality of life and solutions for 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.030
 find a way to subsist like this 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.879
 find the indigenous community cerro de 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.460
 the tigers a place surrounded by greens 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.379
 hills and springs that for many 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.480
 years were the source of food for 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.309
 these families that now have to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.809
 walk several kilometers to find 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.809
 a little clean water 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.710
 we wait a year 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.710
 to this difficulty 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.979
 ah 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.080
 approximately seven years ago 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.450
 Blacks began to run through the flow 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.640
 of the streams the screw and the trout 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.130
 where three springs emerge that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.680
 end they communicate with the mololoa river and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.289
 since then the inhabitants of the hill 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.390
 of the tigers stopped fishing and 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.939
 use the waters for their consumption and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.090
 wash as they explain their own 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.090
 settlers 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.640
 we kept 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.870
 island 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.830
 the family if we are going to go down there and 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.830
 washed from 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.240
 about 89 years but 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.970
 this is going to be like this let's go to the water 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.940
 and deposits but now no longer because 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.680
 the water turns dark and pestilent 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.590
 waters that come out of a system of 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.170
 federal prison pipes the corner have 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.390
 polluted the streams and even though 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.610
 the representatives of this community have 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.660
 requested the support of state authorities 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.290
 and federals have not been heard and 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.020
 really it makes also eight years 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.840
 Ten years have gone into paperwork but not 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.730
 human not only no society is because 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.920
 that's why we, the compaÃ±eros, go 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.019
 up to this medium because I really mean 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.850
 Understand what you want if it is true 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.160
 because when we send papers to 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.440
 up no no no no I have not written it for the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.120
 deputy are ibarra the situation that 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.000
 indigenous people live on hills of the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.220
 tigers as well as marginalization is a 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.560
 delicate problem because apart from not 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.780
 have water the way to this 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.940
 place has not been conditioned for 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.980
 provide them with greater mobility in case of 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.010
 some emergency 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.110
 it's a more delicate is all the waters 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.690
 blacks worth the waste 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.480
 toxic substances is a community that 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.269
 over these 22 years does not have 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.250
 just half way but has no 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.879
 public transport that takes it out of the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.670
 community 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.769
 alak to the street avocado peek the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.599
 situation for these people is 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.849
 pressing and so far has not 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.220
 there was some response from 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.230
 the federal authorities before the serious 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.750
 pollution that is generating this 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.680
 prison that houses thousands of prisoners of 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.390
 high dangerousness that many times 4 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.069
 curated but no more response 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.319
 because that's why we ourselves are 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.170
 Seeing how we can be 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.879
 can help if it 's with resources 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.840
 economic damages are not paid 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.840
 made 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.390
 for the sun of mayarÃ­ alejandro garcÃ­a 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.950
