you<00:05:44.140> pretty<00:05:44.410> much<00:05:44.530> just<00:05:44.830> wait<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:45.630> usually<00:05:46.630> run

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
you pretty much just wait I usually run

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.780 
you pretty much just wait I usually run

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.270 
over into the corner and just stand
there<00:05:48.880> I've<00:05:49.870> noticed<00:05:50.320> that<00:05:50.620> the<00:05:50.950> the

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
there I've noticed that the the

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.500 
there I've noticed that the the
skeletons<00:05:51.700> will<00:05:51.850> basically<00:05:52.000> just<00:05:52.330> start

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
skeletons will basically just start

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.720 
skeletons will basically just start
spawning<00:05:52.780> up<00:05:53.110> around<00:05:53.350> the<00:05:53.500> room<00:05:53.710> if<00:05:54.310> you<00:05:54.490> stay

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
spawning up around the room if you stay

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.660 
spawning up around the room if you stay
completely<00:05:55.060> still<00:05:55.570> and<00:05:55.840> out<00:05:56.140> of<00:05:56.290> the<00:05:56.350> way

completely still and out of the way

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.280 
completely still and out of the way
generally<00:05:57.670> you<00:05:57.790> won't<00:05:58.090> have<00:05:58.420> them<00:05:58.960> even

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290

attack<00:05:59.620> you<00:06:00.270> in<00:06:01.270> this<00:06:01.390> circumstance<00:06:01.870> I<00:06:01.960> do

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
attack you in this circumstance I do

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.920

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
have an enchantress with me so if they

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.630 
have an enchantress with me so if they
hit<00:06:05.050> too<00:06:05.230> close<00:06:05.500> to<00:06:05.680> her<00:06:05.800> she<00:06:05.830> will<00:06:06.310> start

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
hit too close to her she will start

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.390 
hit too close to her she will start
attacking<00:06:06.910> into<00:06:07.270> them<00:06:07.450> but<00:06:08.350> they<00:06:08.590> move<00:06:08.800> super

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
attacking into them but they move super

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.320 
attacking into them but they move super
slow<00:06:09.790> so<00:06:10.600> even<00:06:11.500> if<00:06:11.650> they<00:06:12.430> are<00:06:12.460> a-going<00:06:13.180> a
