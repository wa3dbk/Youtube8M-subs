to take this picture today with today's
technology<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> df'<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.460> would<00:01:30.000> have

technology with the df' I would have

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.719 
technology with the df' I would have
been<00:01:30.240> able<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:31.100> ascertain<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.369> had<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
been able to ascertain that I had the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.230 
been able to ascertain that I had the
right<00:01:32.909> exposure<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:34.680> look

right exposure and the right look

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.340 
right exposure and the right look
without<00:01:36.240> running<00:01:36.600> through<00:01:36.900> two<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.140> three

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
without running through two or three

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.660 
without running through two or three
rolls<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.710> film<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.130> would<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.369> behaved

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
rolls of film and I would have behaved

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.370 
rolls of film and I would have behaved
through<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> job<00:01:39.450> faster<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.350> of

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
through the job faster and get out of

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
through the job faster and get out of
there<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.860> little<00:01:41.220> faster<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.820> think<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
there a little faster I think the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.179 
there a little faster I think the
tradition<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.899> different<00:01:43.290> film<00:01:43.590> stocks<00:01:43.950> for

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
ago for many years in the beginning I

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.700 
ago for many years in the beginning I
was<00:01:54.090> shooting<00:01:54.390> only<00:01:54.630> raw<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.200> making<00:01:55.560> all<00:01:55.680> my

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
was shooting only raw and making all my

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.039 
was shooting only raw and making all my
own<00:01:55.979> JPEGs<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> started<00:01:57.840> shooting

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
own JPEGs and then I started shooting

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.980 
own JPEGs and then I started shooting
raw<00:01:58.530> plus<00:01:58.829> JPEG<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.610> when<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> noticed<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.960> I

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
raw plus JPEG and when I noticed that I

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.370 
raw plus JPEG and when I noticed that I
could

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
could

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.830 
could
actually<00:02:01.829> fine-tune<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.820> look<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> JPEG

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
actually fine-tune the look of the JPEG

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.899 
actually fine-tune the look of the JPEG
that<00:02:03.869> came<00:02:04.229> out<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.619> camera<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.280> started

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
that came out of a camera I started

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.760 
that came out of a camera I started
thinking<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.329> these<00:02:06.479> different<00:02:06.899> picture

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
thinking of these different picture

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.190 
thinking of these different picture
controls<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.369> different<00:02:09.030> film<00:02:09.239> stocks<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.989> by

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
controls as different film stocks so by

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.089 
controls as different film stocks so by
thinking<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.739> terms<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.280> film<00:02:11.970> stocks<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:13.470> think

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
thinking in terms of film stocks I think

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.640 
thinking in terms of film stocks I think
it<00:02:14.190> does<00:02:14.370> translate<00:02:15.060> over<00:02:15.330> into<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:16.080> digital

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
it does translate over into the digital

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.170 
it does translate over into the digital
world<00:02:16.860> especially<00:02:17.550> with<00:02:17.670> those<00:02:17.819> picture

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
world especially with those picture

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.330 
world especially with those picture

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
controls a great camera is one that's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.970 
controls a great camera is one that's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
don't think this camera forced me to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.559 
don't think this camera forced me to
change<00:02:34.650> much<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.580> way<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> was<00:02:36.030> working<00:02:36.209> at

change much of the way I was working at

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.350 
change much of the way I was working at
all<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:37.110> could<00:02:37.440> glance<00:02:37.739> down<00:02:37.950> see<00:02:38.280> my<00:02:38.430> my

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
all I could glance down see my my

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.820 
all I could glance down see my my
shutter<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.900> all<00:02:40.049> that<00:02:40.170> kind<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.410> stuff<00:02:40.650> and

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
shutter and all that kind of stuff and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.309 
shutter and all that kind of stuff and
and<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.640> was<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:42.120> was<00:02:42.239> like<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.840> film<00:02:43.110> days

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
and and I was it was like the film days

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.039 
and and I was it was like the film days
so<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.680> was<00:02:43.920> more<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.640> moment<00:02:44.849> I<00:02:45.209> felt<00:02:45.540> I

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
so I was more in the moment I felt I

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.750 
so I was more in the moment I felt I
think<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.709> helped<00:02:47.099> me<00:02:47.160> work<00:02:47.340> more<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
think it helped me work more in the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.220 
think it helped me work more in the
moment<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.299> don't<00:02:48.510> think<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.810> slowed<00:02:49.080> me

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
moment but I don't think it slowed me

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.410 
moment but I don't think it slowed me
down<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:50.310> least<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.730> fact<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.120> think<00:02:51.180> it

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
down in the least the fact I think it

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.240 
down in the least the fact I think it
made<00:02:51.599> me<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> little<00:02:51.959> more<00:02:52.170> streamlined<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.950> had

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
made me a little more streamlined I had

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.130 
made me a little more streamlined I had
one<00:02:53.760> day<00:02:53.940> with<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.209> D<00:02:54.390> if<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.690> was<00:02:54.870> overseas

one day with the D if I was overseas
