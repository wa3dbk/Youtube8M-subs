00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.080
 unfortunately I don't know how to speak Korean but if 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.539
 I had to translate words into Italian 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.480
 fiat panda I would just use these hyundai 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 i10 this new i10 indeed has its own 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.539
 in the viewfinder the panda that gives some 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.640
 time has become the best-selling car in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.349
 italy and hyundai like other houses 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.090
 automakers know very well 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.880
 this phenomenon that first of all is 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.230
 linked to the economic crisis considering that 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.420
 dedicate as this is more and more 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.940
 chosen by customers because they cost less 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.410
 compared to larger cars and then there is to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.420
 consider the fact that the machines 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.579
 small we say so they are becoming 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.899
 increasingly suitable for use 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.879
 as the only car for all occasions 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.309
 for example by those who do not have a family 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.440
 numerous and are no longer thought of 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 to be guided only in the city 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.930
 as you can see by clicking on this 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.609
 link last winter I drove in 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.140
 preview the i10 in Lapland 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.449
 it was however a prototype 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.320
 camouflaged that hid the shapes of the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.630
 body 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.369
 now instead I can say that the step in 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.860
 ahead of the previous model is 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.140
 remarkable I particularly like i 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.420
 rear lights and this cut 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.520
 inclined in the area of ​​18 that yes 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 connects the lines of the side very much 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.689
 fluid and also the bumper strips 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.710
 on the doors are well integrated into the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.390
 design 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.700
 the more geometric front, in fact 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.560
 manages to convey a certain grit of 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.380
 new I like the shape of the headlights 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.450
 while for my taste daytime running lights 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.950
 LEDs are a bit showy I think 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.200
 the external appearance is one of the points of 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.240
 strength but I know that inside the cockpit 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.490
 that this Korean girl built into 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.110
 europa has grown more not only in 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.390
 terms of space as I will show you 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.409
 better to sit behind but also like 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.750
 quality of life on board 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.820
 in the sense that if you want you can have them 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.939
 comfort as automatic climate control 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.200
 or the four electric windows from 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.290
 you never know the feeling of driving 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.329
 to stay in a cheap car space 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.130
 high layout for the category 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.320
 even if the height has been decreased 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.780
 compared to the previous model 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.750
 cm however the machine is longer than 8 per 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.310
 a total of 3 meters and 66 then one 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.170
 size still small enough for 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.760
 move well city ​​in traffic or 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.310
 find parking but already 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.900
 big enough to offer one 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.760
 good habitability and a member 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.650
 luggage compartment the minimum capacity of 250 2 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.120
 liters that the highest value in the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.120
 segment to that of city ​​cars 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.739
 the driving position does not give problems 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.720
 although it is not possible to adjust in 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.459
 depth the steering wheel what you between 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.870
 the other is also common 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.120
 competitors 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.950
 the 5-speed manual gearbox and it is 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.870
 positioned high just like on 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.880
 panda and I must say he has one 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.890
 very appreciable maneuverability for 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.739
 these kind of car grafts are 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.690
 soft right in front of the lever of 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.269
 change then there is a comfortable compartment 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.310
 very useful storage for loading ad 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.160
 example cell phone without problems 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.970
 since it is a 12 volt outlet 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.430
 that a USB output in addition to the aux 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.690
 with the auxiliaries for the rest as it goes 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.760
 this new i10 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.220
 let's start with the engines available at 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.890
 launch a 1200 four civilians from 87 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.110
 horses and the 1000 3 cylinders from 65 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.329
 horses that I'm driving and that rather 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.910
 quiet enough fluid was 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:37.099
 modified from the past and me 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.450
 it also seems that the books a little less 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.329
 this first test on the beautiful roads 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.860
 of Sardinia you see without traffic 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.709
 the average consumption indicated by 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.069
 instrumentation is about 17 km with a 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.349
 liter 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.750
 not bad also the steering which is one 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.549
 neither artificial response to that 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.040
 which I remember on other Korean cars 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.290
 and also the successions take good of 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.629
 regularity of the road the sect a 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.159
 good balance and in this regard I remember 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.299
 of when engineers in Lapland me 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.250
 they said they had as a reference 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.030
 road behavior from 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.890
 volkswagen up 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.560
 not by chance, given that after the aforementioned 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.390
 cream to German and the second city ​​car more 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.370
 sold in Europe is firm in the first place 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.370
 adding up the sales of the sisters 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.139
 twin seat mii and skoda citigo then i 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.479
 ten even a rival at home but the 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.100
 kia picanto and there are other important ones 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.280
 competing my Japanese franc 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.010
 formed by citroen c1 then 107 and toyota 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.190
 aygo or suzuki alto the chevrolet 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.490
 spark the opel agila and the mitsubishi space 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.490
 tar 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.909
 in this new i10 I like the 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.889
 exterior design and interior and details 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:46.650
 cared for like the rubberized bumper strips 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.479
 on the doors the storage compartment in front 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.830
 the gear lever is a nice idea and 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.599
 the behavior on 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.669
 road in my opinion better than 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:54.960
 other hyundai that drove in the past but 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.909
 that instead a central screen for 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.650
 check the radio and the navigator 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.389
 multimedia devices is not 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.949
 available even for a fee e 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.050
 it would have been better to have also the 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.779
 steering wheel adjustable in depth in the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.979
 2014 will come then a gpl engine but to the 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.990
 end what matters in this 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.779
 category and above all the price for the 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.060
 new hyundai i10 starts at 9,850 euros 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.529
 for the 1000 engine with a budget of 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.650
 series that includes the control of 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:21.300
 stability esp 6 airbags the sensors for the 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.039
 tire pressure and 5 years of 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.060
 guarantee road assistance and checks 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.870
 free 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.820
 this little Korean girl will succeed 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.470
 built in europe to start new ones 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.540
 customers in such an important category 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.890
 in competitive where many rivals bet 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.780
 also on sympathy and habits 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.140
 linked to a brand 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.140
 what do you say
