00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
but the listing that i got from

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.709 
but the listing that i got from
codemasters<00:00:46.800> was<00:00:47.010> supposedly<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.940> full<00:00:48.510> list

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
codemasters was supposedly a full list

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.240

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of all the classic cars so i pretty much

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.100 
of all the classic cars so i pretty much
just<00:00:50.340> trusted<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> turns<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:51.930> my

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
just trusted them and turns out that my

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
just trusted them and turns out that my
trust<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:52.680> bit<00:00:52.770> misplaced<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.940> as

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
trust was a little bit misplaced so as

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.279 
trust was a little bit misplaced so as
you<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.719> doesn't<00:00:54.899> really<00:00:55.110> look<00:00:55.199> like

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
you see here it doesn't really look like

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.660 
you see here it doesn't really look like
too<00:00:55.530> much<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.160> classic<00:00:56.370> cars

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.099 
too much you just a classic cars
anything<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.510> tell<00:00:57.750> pathan

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
anything you can really tell pathan

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.740

those<00:00:58.260> particularly<00:00:58.710> keen<00:00:58.949> eyed<00:00:59.129> spectators

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
those particularly keen eyed spectators

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.790 
those particularly keen eyed spectators
but<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:00.989> we<00:01:01.020> compare<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.590> next

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
but if when we compare it to this next

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
but if when we compare it to this next
clip<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.030> there's<00:01:03.270> some<00:01:03.390> striking

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
which funny enough is also one of the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.469 
which funny enough is also one of the
cars<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.470> rush<00:01:10.740> film<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.100> based<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.479> so

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
cars that the rush film was based on so

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.580

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.780 
let's have a look at some of the
similarities<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.520> there<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
similarities you can see there the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.190 
similarities you can see there the
sponsors<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> bottom<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> car<00:01:16.080> there

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
sponsors on the bottom of the car there

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.990 
sponsors on the bottom of the car there
on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> side<00:01:16.560> pod<00:01:16.770> which<00:01:17.250> are<00:01:17.400> also<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:17.790> in

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
on the side pod which are also there in

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
on the side pod which are also there in
game<00:01:18.270> pretty<00:01:18.540> much<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.990> same<00:01:19.170> thing<00:01:19.439> there's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
game pretty much the same thing there's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.289 
game pretty much the same thing there's
also<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.610> black<00:01:20.850> bear<00:01:21.000> next<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
also that black bear next to the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.340 
also that black bear next to the
wheeling<00:01:21.659> game<00:01:21.840> i<00:01:21.869> believe<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.290> an

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
wheeling game i believe it's an

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560 
wheeling game i believe it's an
intercooler<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.640> there<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.270> picture

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
intercooler that is there in the picture

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.520 
intercooler that is there in the picture
you<00:01:24.659> can't<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.439> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you can't see it in that one but it is
