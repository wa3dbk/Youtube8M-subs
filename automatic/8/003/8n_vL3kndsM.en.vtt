has got an f-stop of 2.4 to 4.8
mechanical<00:01:31.320> shot<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.830> should<00:01:32.010> make<00:01:32.190> a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
mechanical shot so it should make a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.150 
mechanical shot so it should make a
difference<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.790> 1<00:01:33.000> mm<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.990> well<00:01:34.920> it's

you can see me through already now this
is<00:01:40.980> a<00:01:41.040> pre-production<00:01:41.250> sample<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.330> tree

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
is a pre-production sample we can tree

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.210 
is a pre-production sample we can tree
take<00:01:42.690> pictures<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.650> show<00:01:43.830> you<00:01:43.890> how<00:01:44.160> it

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
take pictures with it to show you how it

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.010 
take pictures with it to show you how it
works<00:01:44.370> however<00:01:44.670> Nokia<00:01:45.360> were<00:01:45.450> very<00:01:45.630> kind<00:01:45.840> to
