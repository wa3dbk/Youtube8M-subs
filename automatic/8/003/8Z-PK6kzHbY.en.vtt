00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.099
 Well then first of all from keywords 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.469
 I would like to explain 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.469
 Big of wood this cracker 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.739
 This is the way I think 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.300
 hdp I saw that I was pursuing this 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.319
 Though I think that 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:27.769
 It is from the body 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.220
 That's the person I feel 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.210
 In theory, we are aiming while choosing keywords of each agricultural cooperative 5 times 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.020
 I wonder if there is a weather 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.170
 I feel fair 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.120
 so 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.340
 When searching for keywords 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
 From the conclusion, the most important thing 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.789
 Do you pay attention 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520
 It was cultivated soil 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.570
 Other things may be left alone 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.750
 It is said that only 3 board meetings are scheduled for this 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.580
 There is a place 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.490
 In it 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.500
 Become a sales site 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.130
 It is a meter 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.880
 It is an elevator horse. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.590
 It's better if you ask me 3 times or so should be read recently 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.270
 Yo 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.470
 I would like to say something like this 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.210
 I read about it so persistently 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.440
 There is a reason 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.520
 We use the metric system, but the most important thing is 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.020
 This is for the affiliate 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.020
 It is more dangerous to enable 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.780
 So, say off keywords and select keywords 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.650
 Also when 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.340
 It is the best to scrape this radar and larch 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.340
 Right way 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.970
 If you are taking a high school exam, please have some data 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.180
 Yes I would like to do something like that 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.180
 Of course, from the US radar the plane is in the same circle 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.140
 Well it is a description written on the board 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.510
 I'm spreading it one by one 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.200
 A keyword of your choice 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.840
 If you do not observe 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.260
 I'm asking for it 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.490
 Prevent the day leak 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.869
 It is that 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.849
 Well though this is still a natural story 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.449
 Another one 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.449
 Not written on the radar 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:19.949
 Do not give me a broad range from here 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.969
 You can differentiate here 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.059
 It will be great 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:25.699
 Differentiation 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.349
 It is no different from previous keywords 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.200
 LOL Your own self-righteousness The keywords for just this afternoon 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.179
 It is said 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:34.669
 It will be easier to go the way 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:37.939
 In the line between manufacturers 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.939
 Although the article is not written over 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:46.379
 It is not written, but a bit of the meter description 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.949
 To do 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.719
 From birth 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.169
 The keyword is 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.609
 It is a treasure keyword 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.839
 I often get caught 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:59.259
 It is more than what is written on the radar as it is 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.449
 How to read what is not written 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:03.950
 It is very after the race 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.950
 m is displayed 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.689
 Erickson thing 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.039
 Have you ever done at once 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.580
 But I did not do 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.880
 Although there is a thing of data in Kanto, 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.880
 I think you can see it only if it does not improve 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.579
 You should notice something 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.579
 I want to past that I noticed 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:31.309
 If you say so, for those who are a bit confusing 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:34.119
 As it may be difficult to understand, a concrete example 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.889
 I want to keep it because there is no cloud 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.500
 Yerevan is fine, but for example 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.960
 Movie I have relatively rising prices but transportation information products are also 10 days 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.389
 until now 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.489
 You have taken acrylic activities 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.620
 There are a lot of products coming out of witch negotiations 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:58.209
 Yes, for example, recently there are many sports golf products 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.399
 But I said I got it, but I can play tennis 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:03.339
 There is a predecessor 

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:06.650
 The gold which I got in such a 2nd defeat 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.370
 Kurum Date players 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.189
 Brought up on one side 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.220
 How many constructions won 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.649
 Introduce tennis 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:15.109
 2222 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.509
 I'm out of that 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.069
 Well that kind of details 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.449
 Also speaking of them, Krumm that brought up Kummu Dates 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.479
 Date will be a keyword, and it will be read and planned 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.479
 This is a broad position to bring in the technique of beating 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.720
 And this one too 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.309
 You also need to hit the tackle 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:33.620
 What kind of player is raining 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.569
 And that's also what accounting was written or 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.169
 Where to look in the data 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.599
 From there, we will expand what can be keywords 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.309
 This is also important 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:44.939
 Then 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:48.909
 Krumm Date player is really what kind of player 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:54.990
 That's a movie 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.069
 To write just the lecture of Kurum Date 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.529
 But it did not exist 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:03.710
 Kurumu Date was raised 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.550
 Mother's comfort 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.610
 In it 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.699
 Just dvd co-hosted 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.139
 Because it is the purpose of selling the general strike, it is not eaten 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.050
 It does not mean that Krumm Date is completely written from the tax side 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.210
 That means 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.789
 There is more of Kurum Date players who are not written, and the professional league 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:21.909
 Also 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:23.159
 One 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.969
 Even if it is not written, it is not written on the radar 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:26.439
 is not it 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.460
 By digging in one 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.169
 How many keywords are spreading 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.509
 Specifically speaking, let's call empathy 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.129
 Say 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.680
 It is not just rice Krumm Date 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.220
 Speaking of Erika, there's no risk to me there 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.190
 It was already necessary for Mr. form for each service 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.740
 won 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.759
 But in these flats that were rolled around 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.249
 It is as a keyword 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.479
 You should drive well though 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.900
 Then let's go out one by one 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.139
 Lol 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.139
 Person who can know rejuvenation 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.139
 It is only the thing that is written in the meter really 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.279
 Keywords picked up at low speed 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.719
 Another deep from the station to the search engine with its keywords 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.439
 Search yourself for yourself 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:21.439
 Another one branched from there 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.889
 Deep place 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.900
 It is called the keyword which was divided after the race 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.080
 Going to win 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.080
 This work is very important 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.279
 I did this 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.180
 In fact 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.029
 I think that I understand well if I try 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.169
 If the influence spreads, there are still many rivals 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.139
 Even the one that goes into the station 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.129
 It is still more than just picking up ways that fear wide 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:50.210
 I do 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.419
 However 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.689
 Completely 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:55.849
 It is a rival 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:58.050
 To the keyword that it is self-made 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.400
 You can find quite
