00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
so let's say enter code and it's a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
so let's say enter code and it's a
little<00:00:26.340> card<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:28.340> sometimes<00:00:29.340> you'll

all right so I just said I had to start
the<00:01:00.940> car<00:01:01.180> let's<00:01:04.019> see

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.090 

outside<00:01:12.720> away<00:01:13.020> from<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.320> building<00:01:13.530> all<00:01:13.979> right

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
outside away from a building all right

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.140 
outside away from a building all right
I'm<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> come<00:01:14.520> back<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.909> when<00:01:15.030> this

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
I'm going to come back to you when this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.899 
I'm going to come back to you when this
gets<00:01:15.330> back<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:16.189> all<00:01:17.189> right<00:01:17.310> guys<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.790> only

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
gets back up all right guys so it only

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
gets back up all right guys so it only
took<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.150> 10<00:01:18.600> seconds<00:01:19.049> I'm<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.500> sure

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
took like 10 seconds I'm not really sure

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.680 
took like 10 seconds I'm not really sure
why<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.950> ended<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> other<00:01:20.820> video<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.450> guess<00:01:21.600> I

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
why I ended the other video so I guess I

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.539 
why I ended the other video so I guess I
got<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.200> some<00:01:22.380> editing<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.950> splice<00:01:23.400> them

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
got to do some editing to splice them

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.880 
got to do some editing to splice them
together<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.570> uh<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:25.530> should<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.860> your

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
together but uh this should be in your

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.060 
together but uh this should be in your
glove<00:01:26.190> box<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.659> its<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.619> they<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
glove box and on its do they have the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.649 
glove box and on its do they have the
code<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.399> here<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> radio<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.570> the

code on here for the radio and for the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
code on here for the radio and for the
navigation<00:01:31.289> I<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:32.399> had<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.640> put<00:01:32.789> it<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
navigation I just had to put it in a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.070 
navigation I just had to put it in a
navigation<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.780> believe<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.470> nope<00:01:35.840> nope<00:01:36.840> nope

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080

but<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.130> told<00:02:35.250> him<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.840> think<00:02:37.320> they<00:02:37.500> they

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
but I told him and I think they they

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.930 
but I told him and I think they they
didn't<00:02:38.010> want<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.250> give<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.580> me<00:02:38.700> what<00:02:38.850> they

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
didn't want to give it to me what they

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.290 
didn't want to give it to me what they
did<00:02:40.490> they<00:02:41.490> come<00:02:41.700> with<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> hundred<00:02:42.060> month

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
did they come with a hundred month

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.290 
did they come with a hundred month
warranty<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:44.220> car<00:02:44.430> seven<00:02:44.820> years<00:02:45.000> old<00:02:45.180> so

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
warranty and the car seven years old so

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.880 
warranty and the car seven years old so
that's<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.570> eighty<00:02:45.780> five<00:02:46.020> months<00:02:46.500> so

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
that's like eighty five months so

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.870 
that's like eighty five months so
they'll<00:02:47.130> credit<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.670> um<00:02:49.190> over<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.400> remaining

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
they'll credit you um over the remaining

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.000 
they'll credit you um over the remaining
months<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.630> warranty<00:02:52.110> which<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.800> think

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
months on the warranty which is I think

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.820 
months on the warranty which is I think
it<00:02:53.070> was<00:02:53.160> 15<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.450> instead<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.870> paying<00:02:55.140> one

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
it was 15 so instead of paying one

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.630 
it was 15 so instead of paying one
hundred<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.190> twelve

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
hundred and twelve

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.280 
hundred and twelve
I<00:02:56.790> paid<00:02:57.000> seventy<00:02:57.420> four<00:02:57.630> dollars<00:02:57.660> for<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.170> new

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
I paid seventy four dollars for a new

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.550 
I paid seventy four dollars for a new
battery<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.920> it's<00:02:59.250> cheaper<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:01.200> go<00:03:01.290> back<00:03:01.440> to

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
battery so it's cheaper to go back to

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.600 
battery so it's cheaper to go back to
the<00:03:01.620> dealer<00:03:01.950> for<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.520> battery<00:03:03.320> also<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:05.190> replace

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
the dealer for a battery also to replace

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.100 
the dealer for a battery also to replace
it<00:03:05.880> you're<00:03:06.090> going<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.270> have<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.570> take<00:03:06.930> off
