00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:04.590
 the Hertha I have now with Werder Bremen Woeser Mönchengladbach and the 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.159
 MTK Budapest to contest the victory parade 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.179
 Stephanie Schmitz reports on today's first final day 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.730
 It has not always been the case at the indoor tournament yet 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.120
 have more today again 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.920
 as 7000 is Siemens 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.740
 from the justification score of the WSC in white jerseys against 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 Entega Budapest the customer wishes masters ran the first half 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.810
 scoreless and the first game won surprisingly had Mönchengladbach 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.040
 with 3 to 0 against Werder Bremen favorites but here the 1 0 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.429
 is lead and bundle Toldo as the Sagittarius the man with the 07 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.760
 his seventh goal 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.760
 young goalkeeper Henkel may have reacted a bit late 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.080
 that said Bolt had good Simon on par with 2 or with each 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.530
 2 6 hits 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.050
 In any case, no class difference can be seen in this game 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.680
 and the balance through 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.480
 a dry shot comes 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.480
 in the approach to recognize here the repeated 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.000
 1 1 so everything open again and then there is always natural mood in the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 Germany 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.450
 her husband dares 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.980
 more of the technicians 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.610
 Kollmannsberger 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.900
 the counter option but someone Wolfersdorf 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.900
 Pluta Simon shoots from all positions 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.050
 he has often proved his ability to score goals 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.410
 surprisingly insight of the long even in the hall 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.090
 and this shot proves this 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.090
 the 2 2 1 for Hertha BSC 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 raging among the people is the meeting place 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.730
 the game in the hall here in the Deutschlandhalle something controversial 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.870
 There are big tournaments with sizes playing surfaces 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.870
 there comes more flow and momentum wants to win 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.890
 Cross Pass Christmas Simon was three to one that was 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.680
 in this game at least the decision for the Elftal and one 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.969
 brilliant start followed 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.969
 Schoenefeld 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.569
 as the result 3 2-victory nevertheless afterwards there was a bitter 0 2 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.099
 3-defeat against Gladbach 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.200
 And so here against Werder Bremen Bremen was in the white jersey Hitler 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.759
 the inside picture 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.579
 Crap also like Hertha BSC now joining the win of both teams 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.079
 hereby meet Föll a duel against her husband trusts 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.679
 remains winner 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:38.099
 he started the 2 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.489
 held there it was 0 2 0 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.569
 Fourth probably the only one in the hand 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.389
 then you look at me that makes the national team center forward 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.999
 Rudi Henkel also got the advantage over captain on the wrong foot 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.819
 almost always played through 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.339
 I do not know what the Nati one hoped for that anyway 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:00.699
 already the 2 2 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.039
 achieve that by hearing about this name 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.509
 then one can only wonder that the Berliners are still so neat 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:09.509
 be involved 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.869
 and desperately searched for a play station 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.729
 major shortcomings now 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.499
 Reinders 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.879
 Well a powerful blast and surprise where most gave the 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.199
 Referee here goal 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.110
 they see it again for the repetition 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.299
 does not give final information 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.299
 not a new way over though 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:39.379
 Nowitzki got his chance leftovers from Berti Vogts but One 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.379
 junior national team indian comparison hamm-heessen 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.369
 Had acquaintance with the professional 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:47.539
 Bulut at 12 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:51.149
 + for some time minute but it was not so dogmatic this scene 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:55.249
 Total indoor football on all days but a bit for your business 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:57.379
 despite some and 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.470
 Melina now needs a bit helpless in the overpayment game 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:02.869
 Fisher knifed 

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:06.439
 and even overpayment by Bremer Möhlmann Norbert Meier Peer 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.679
 striker 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:11.969
 So everything was clear Hertha BSC after the first day of the final 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.269
 only with 2 10 4 points to book 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.499
 and percent the Bremer they held so offense 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:22.539
 at Borussia Mönchengladbach with 4 to 2 points there is even another one 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.229
 hit 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.740
 Norbert Meier February is 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.210
 Taipei football is still the attraction for cold days in Berlin 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.900
 Close contact with the players 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.630
 Fleet combinations «beautiful gate» all this makes the charm of this field 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.749
 Offshoot 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.059
 Size and sportiness and have from a part of the audience especially 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:44.059
 opposite Rudi Völler 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.000
 she experiences the whole team they have a lot of means very evil 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.510
 to calls it belongs he can be found as a national team center forward if 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.919
 you quasi booed in such a city as Berlin 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.620
 because it is of course measurements quite bitter because of me 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.430
 Opinion that we showed the people addressed football 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.889
 but so it was that they won the last two decades and 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.840
 people want by man and how we are there was also one 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.349
 conciliatory gesture 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.449
 who would certainly like to collect flowers with such a young team 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.930
 get from what 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.270
 from ours 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.559
 no word about the rules at this indoor tournament 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.859
 you have the feeling that the technicians are having a hard time 

00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:25.979
 enforce the field too narrow road or maybe a player's 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.029
 he join 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:30.619
 Who likes to be involved in the few days' worth of capital or example cases? 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:34.719
 Reserves and the same player payments and so it was very good players 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:38.229
 Role were a little bigger he is too much to come to her figure socks 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.740
 got and it could 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.310
 in a suburb is that one still hangs the gang a flexible and wanders 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.219
 each one was a korso the level aspired to 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.219
 so for the most part is that their length comes into play and it for the sake of 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.419
 Spectators interesting and second full resolution 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.409
 but still keeping in view of the temperatures is the court with 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:55.360
 our or 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.310
 Profen von Dieter Jahn the audience numbers are so in the 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.530
 pretty much excited
