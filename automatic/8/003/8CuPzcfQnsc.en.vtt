00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
just running what we feel like I ran

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.859 
just running what we feel like I ran
Olivia<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.720> attainted<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.240> that<00:00:27.240> we<00:00:27.420> seem

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869

roll<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.260> opposing<00:00:28.769> team<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.490> just

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
roll the opposing team was just

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.730

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
coincidence so I'm just going to make

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.110 
coincidence so I'm just going to make
keep<00:00:32.099> making<00:00:32.489> videos<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:35.040> last<00:00:35.280> gpg<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.969> do

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

post<00:00:39.450> videos<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:39.930> us<00:00:40.500> losing<00:00:41.070> obviously

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
post videos about us losing obviously

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.959 
post videos about us losing obviously
and<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.329> idea<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.200> way<00:00:44.070> will<00:00:44.760> have

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and the idea is that this way will have

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.869 
and the idea is that this way will have
an<00:00:45.120> easier<00:00:45.270> time<00:00:46.370> keeping<00:00:47.370> track<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> our

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
an easier time keeping track of our

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.680 
an easier time keeping track of our
progress<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:49.129> of<00:00:50.129> course<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.420> will

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
progress and of course it will it will

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.920 
progress and of course it will it will
be<00:00:51.840> fun<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.469> watch<00:00:52.770> how<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.219> were<00:00:53.539> you<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.719> see

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930

to change to another guild later and
yeah<00:01:07.950> we're<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.600> checking<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:09.960> we're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
yeah we're just checking what we're

knock<00:02:24.870> lock<00:02:25.110> him<00:02:25.320> further<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:27.360> was<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.980> was

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
knock lock him further so it was it was

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.910 
knock lock him further so it was it was
a<00:02:29.280> cool<00:02:29.580> thing<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.880> do<00:02:30.150> since<00:02:30.540> there<00:02:31.170> was<00:02:31.320> piled

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
a cool thing to do since there was piled

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.490 
a cool thing to do since there was piled
so<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.210> delay<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.510> spikes<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.110> bit<00:02:34.260> till

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
so we can delay the spikes a bit till

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.060 
so we can delay the spikes a bit till
until<00:02:34.770> it's<00:02:34.920> back<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:36.150> will<00:02:36.270> see<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:37.070> at

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
until it's back and you will see that at

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.180 
until it's back and you will see that at
the<00:02:38.250> moment<00:02:39.110> none<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.350> teams<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.770> actually

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the moment none of the teams is actually

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.610 
the moment none of the teams is actually
taking<00:02:41.550> pressure<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.540> red<00:02:42.690> team<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.050> taking

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
taking pressure the red team is taking

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.380 
taking pressure the red team is taking
passion<00:02:44.070> now<00:02:44.190> because<00:02:44.520> it's<00:02:44.670> Ellis<00:02:44.910> back<00:02:45.150> back

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
passion now because it's Ellis back back

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.450 
passion now because it's Ellis back back
in<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.600> beginning<00:02:46.020> there<00:02:46.680> wasn't<00:02:47.070> really<00:02:47.190> any

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
in the beginning there wasn't really any

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.730 
in the beginning there wasn't really any
pressure<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:47.940> both<00:02:48.720> sides<00:02:49.080> they<00:02:49.710> are<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> groat

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
pressure on both sides they are a groat

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.220 
pressure on both sides they are a groat
all<00:02:52.740> night<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.390> additional<00:02:54.960> pressure

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
all night so that's additional pressure

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.160 
all night so that's additional pressure
and<00:02:55.580> no<00:02:56.580> they<00:02:56.850> just<00:02:56.880> rushed<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.930> was

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
and no they just rushed in and I was

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.960 
and no they just rushed in and I was
really<00:02:58.710> about<00:02:58.980> tactic<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:01.370> you'll<00:03:02.370> see<00:03:02.640> that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
really about tactic and you'll see that

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.440 
really about tactic and you'll see that
they<00:03:03.180> don't<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.720> arrest<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:05.150> they<00:03:06.150> kill

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
they don't really arrest so they kill

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:14.110 
they don't really arrest so they kill
one<00:03:06.750> night<00:03:07.050> but<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:08.450> think<00:03:10.400> we<00:03:11.400> got<00:03:11.430> more<00:03:11.820> kills

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
one night but I think we got more kills

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.790 
one night but I think we got more kills
to<00:03:15.120> justify<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:17.030> well<00:03:18.030> at<00:03:18.720> at<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.410> moment

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
to justify it so well at at the moment

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.979 
to justify it so well at at the moment
the<00:03:20.310> pressure<00:03:20.550> is<00:03:20.700> starting<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.330> kick<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.540> they

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
the pressure is starting to kick in they

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.830 
the pressure is starting to kick in they
don't<00:03:22.230> dress<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.830> they're<00:03:23.040> starting<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.610> wipe

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.140 

another<00:03:27.840> perhaps<00:03:28.500> interesting<00:03:29.280> fun<00:03:29.550> fact<00:03:29.880> is

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
another perhaps interesting fun fact is

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.040 
another perhaps interesting fun fact is
that<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.690> always<00:03:30.810> called<00:03:32.150> pinning<00:03:33.150> where<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.660> did

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
that I always called pinning where I did

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.970 
that I always called pinning where I did
Olivia<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:34.709> we're<00:03:35.310> going<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.640> see<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.980> it's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
Olivia so we're going to see that it's

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.320 
Olivia so we're going to see that it's
always<00:03:38.310> changing<00:03:39.350> so<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:43.320> hammer<00:03:43.560> is

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
always changing so the hammer is

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.360 
always changing so the hammer is
actually<00:03:45.330> back<00:03:45.540> lining<00:03:45.780> most<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.320> time<00:03:46.560> so

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
actually back lining most of the time so

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.630 
actually back lining most of the time so
trying<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.330> make<00:03:49.019> sure<00:03:49.050> they<00:03:49.590> don't<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:50.130> off<00:03:50.310> a

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
trying to make sure they don't get off a

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.240 
trying to make sure they don't get off a
lot<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:50.880> spikes<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.660> together<00:03:52.440> with<00:03:52.830> the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
lot of spikes and together with the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.180 
lot of spikes and together with the
pressure<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.670> poison<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.330> disease<00:03:55.190> starting

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
pressure of poison and disease starting

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.430 
pressure of poison and disease starting
to<00:03:56.340> kick<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.550> now<00:03:57.360> normally<00:03:57.600> it<00:03:58.080> shouldn't

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
to kick in now normally it shouldn't

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.770 
to kick in now normally it shouldn't
kick<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:58.830> that<00:03:58.860> earlier<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.700> strong<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.510> you

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
kick in that earlier that strong so you

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.430 
kick in that earlier that strong so you
know<00:04:01.739> it's<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:02.670> because<00:04:03.060> they<00:04:03.930> didn't

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
know it's just because they didn't

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.710 
know it's just because they didn't
really<00:04:04.650> know<00:04:04.920> what<00:04:05.160> they<00:04:06.090> were<00:04:06.180> doing<00:04:06.420> at<00:04:06.690> that

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
really know what they were doing at that

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.070 
really know what they were doing at that
time<00:04:07.519> at<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.760> moments<00:04:09.300> we<00:04:09.510> were<00:04:09.660> running<00:04:09.780> with

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
time at the moments we were running with

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.650 
time at the moments we were running with
the<00:04:10.110> gas<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.680> stuff<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.100> we<00:04:12.090> haven't<00:04:12.420> really

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
the gas and stuff and we haven't really

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.170 
the gas and stuff and we haven't really
done<00:04:13.290> that<00:04:13.350> many<00:04:13.830> TV<00:04:14.250> cheese<00:04:14.459> with<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:15.390> core

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
done that many TV cheese with this core

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.750 
done that many TV cheese with this core
you'll<00:04:18.180> see<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:19.230> every<00:04:20.070> now<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.459> then<00:04:20.549> we

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
you'll see that so every now and then we

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.920 
you'll see that so every now and then we
hesitate<00:04:21.359> and

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
hesitate and

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.279 
hesitate and
I<00:04:23.310> know<00:04:24.310> this<00:04:25.120> is<00:04:25.300> one<00:04:25.449> of<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.660> points<00:04:25.870> that

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
I know this is one of the points that

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.620 
I know this is one of the points that
should<00:04:26.650> get<00:04:26.860> better<00:04:27.100> our<00:04:27.880> team<00:04:28.240> play<00:04:28.570> should

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
should get better our team play should

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.999 
should get better our team play should
get<00:04:28.990> better<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:31.060> know<00:04:31.210> me<00:04:32.169> most<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.979> the

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
get better and you know me most of the

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.090 
get better and you know me most of the
guild<00:04:33.250> members<00:04:33.699> have<00:04:33.940> been<00:04:34.300> in<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.840> guild<00:04:35.100> for

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
guild members have been in the guild for

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.510 
guild members have been in the guild for
quite<00:04:36.310> some<00:04:36.520> time<00:04:36.550> now<00:04:37.030> so<00:04:38.310> I'm<00:04:39.310> actually

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
quite some time now so I'm actually

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.850 
quite some time now so I'm actually
looking<00:04:39.970> forward<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.720> see<00:04:40.960> what<00:04:41.289> progress

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
looking forward to see what progress

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.340 
looking forward to see what progress
were<00:04:42.370> going<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.820> make<00:04:43.229> so<00:04:44.229> we<00:04:45.130> decided<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:46.350> not

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
were going to make so we decided to not

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.590 
were going to make so we decided to not
push<00:04:47.740> them<00:04:48.009> back<00:04:48.160> into<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.639> base<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.210> just

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
push them back into the base and I just

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.719 
push them back into the base and I just
try<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.840> wipe<00:04:50.110> them<00:04:50.320> here<00:04:50.590> one<00:04:51.280> wore<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.699> down

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
try to wipe them here one wore you down

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:58.140 
try to wipe them here one wore you down
now<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:54.930> what<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.139> pressure<00:04:56.349> is<00:04:56.729> starting<00:04:57.729> to

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
now and what the pressure is starting to

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.980 
now and what the pressure is starting to
kick<00:04:58.300> in<00:04:58.360> again<00:04:58.599> so<00:04:59.530> quite<00:05:00.130> early<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:00.990> think

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
kick in again so quite early I think

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.659 
kick in again so quite early I think
they're<00:05:02.199> opposing<00:05:02.560> monks<00:05:03.039> did<00:05:03.220> not<00:05:03.460> see

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
they're opposing monks did not see

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.629 
they're opposing monks did not see
enough<00:05:03.970> but<00:05:04.300> whatever<00:05:04.720> they<00:05:05.470> did<00:05:05.710> they're

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
enough but whatever they did they're

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.390 
enough but whatever they did they're
taking<00:05:07.229> heavy<00:05:08.229> losses<00:05:08.560> so<00:05:10.620> also<00:05:11.620> remember

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
taking heavy losses so also remember

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.120 
taking heavy losses so also remember
this<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:12.699> a<00:05:12.729> catapult<00:05:13.470> catapult<00:05:14.470> map<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:14.889> if

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
this is a catapult catapult map so if

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.320 
this is a catapult catapult map so if
you<00:05:15.520> can't<00:05:15.820> really<00:05:16.120> say<00:05:16.509> okay<00:05:16.840> I'm<00:05:16.990> going<00:05:17.289> to

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
you can't really say okay I'm going to

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.159 
you can't really say okay I'm going to
defend<00:05:19.330> school<00:05:20.580> which<00:05:21.580> is<00:05:21.610> not<00:05:22.240> as<00:05:22.419> well<00:05:22.930> it's

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
defend school which is not as well it's

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.529 
defend school which is not as well it's
not<00:05:24.039> really<00:05:24.250> viable<00:05:24.669> tactic<00:05:25.270> in<00:05:25.419> this

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
not really viable tactic in this

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.040 
not really viable tactic in this
situation<00:05:25.810> anyway<00:05:26.349> so<00:05:27.220> yeah<00:05:28.210> I<00:05:28.240> forgot<00:05:28.870> to

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
but because of trolling went we just

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.719 
but because of trolling went we just
didn't<00:06:04.180> succeed<00:06:04.690> and<00:06:05.050> we<00:06:05.289> were<00:06:06.250> like<00:06:06.400> are<00:06:06.639> we

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
didn't succeed and we were like are we

didn't succeed and we were like are we
going<00:06:07.090> to<00:06:08.280> push<00:06:09.280> them<00:06:09.520> there<00:06:09.759> are<00:06:09.940> we<00:06:10.090> going<00:06:10.330> to
