00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.170
 no food no corso the barefoot horses via alberto barozzi 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.570
 it's good 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.510
 philosophy 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.950
 ebay 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.960
 one way 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.380
 d interpret the horse company 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.340
 which I quietly be 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.950
 in leading one's life I always repeat 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.170
 with me a proper management especially of the foot 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 because we are talking about bare feet 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.250
 it worked perfectly because it is a natural method 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.930
 and the horse is born barefoot is not born ferrato 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.430
 the question that comes up in it is made and why this horse succeeds in 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.070
 do this thing 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.670
 and the answer is that the horse can do it because it lives in nature and 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.970
 therefore in the most simply natural way possible 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.450
 sign in to today we use barefoot horses 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.200
 in this center there are 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.680
 more than 60 barefoot horses 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.160
 we use 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.890
 these horses of ours play ospol we also use for long walks 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.600
 even for many hours completely barefoot 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.519
 for those who are barefoot king 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.159
 very positive e 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.430
 it works 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.339
 very well in the horse 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.539
 the horse is said to have 5 hearts 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:23.889
 this because 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.339
 why 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.539
 every time he puts his foot on the ground 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:32.589
 away it expands 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:33.849
 outwards 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.779
 with this movement which is called phylactery 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:40.679
 the cans when the foot of the leaning on the ground with 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.509
 first of blood 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.509
 against the external parts where the wing cartilages are 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.120
 when the foot is lifted the cartilage closes up yes 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.389
 closes the cartilages push 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:53.889
 blood upwards 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.889
 so every step the horse takes 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:03.149
 helps with every step the horse helps the heart to pump blood not that 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.129
 arterial of the pumped directly to the sea heart return 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.949
 here is why 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.299
 it is essential that the foot is free to move 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.909
 the lock 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.189
 however the phuket currently used normally 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.809
 those that are repeated at wrong tend to close the foot 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.839
 so this ice cream movement is gone 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:28.309
 so there is no more pumping in fact if we do thermography 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.119
 we see that the bare foot reads lice 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.739
 the foot shod the cold 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.739
 not a starting point 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.419
 barefoot barefoot an end point 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:56.199
 onav a line of tools that are used for cutting the nail 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:01.239
 photo and that are particular tongs is made in a manner 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.239
 particular to help which this cut 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:09.479
 use of knives from da da farrier who may already be 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:10.769
 used queues 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.099
 Chinese clothes of course 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.439
 made in a particular way with in the details of the way details 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:19.060
 that we are resistant 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.729
 they can be in different shapes 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.729
 the second type of use 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.489
 so to be able to work% in point club 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.900
 then next to the festoon or along the wall ie practically 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.870
 the album specific tools to make this place are prices however 

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:45.930
 they also use farriers, they are not completely different things 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.080
 these things are part of the line 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.389
 atdhe I experienced that it works very well 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.439
 all things that are fairly cheap 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:01.709
 and therefore quite well affordable given by whom I want to start to do 

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:02.759
 this thing 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.129
 it's something schemes I like to emphasize and that 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.970
 if this path 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.669
 wait eh eh done with xscor attention with dedication 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:19.050

 can also put in the owner's villas 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:25.349
 of the horse 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.209
 some report horses exactly as they normally do in cleaning 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.629
 in the area of â€‹â€‹the foot with the curasept etc. etc. in the same way yes 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.139
