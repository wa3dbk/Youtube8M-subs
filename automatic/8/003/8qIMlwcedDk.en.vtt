00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
more efficiently and to get all that

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.400 
more efficiently and to get all that
extra<00:02:59.519> dirt<00:02:59.940> out<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.840> it's<00:03:01.019> really<00:03:01.200> pretty

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
extra dirt out so it's really pretty

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.320 
extra dirt out so it's really pretty
nifty<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.040> pretty<00:03:02.190> intuitive<00:03:02.849> as<00:03:03.150> far

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
nifty and it's pretty intuitive as far

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.030 
nifty and it's pretty intuitive as far
as<00:03:03.450> I'm<00:03:03.630> not<00:03:04.019> just<00:03:04.230> running<00:03:04.530> through<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.860> one

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
as I'm not just running through it one

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.300 
as I'm not just running through it one
time<00:03:05.299> you<00:03:06.299> also<00:03:06.450> get<00:03:07.190> anti-tangle<00:03:08.190> technology

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
time you also get anti-tangle technology

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.699 
time you also get anti-tangle technology
which<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.030> actually<00:03:09.269> cool<00:03:09.569> if<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.440> senses

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
which is actually cool if it senses

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.979 
which is actually cool if it senses
cords<00:03:11.459> cables<00:03:11.849> or<00:03:12.180> anything<00:03:12.209> like<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.540> it'll

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
cords cables or anything like that it'll

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.460 
cords cables or anything like that it'll
actually<00:03:13.140> stop<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:15.840> not<00:03:16.109> prevent<00:03:16.410> it

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
actually stop and you not prevent it

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.410 
actually stop and you not prevent it
from<00:03:16.500> getting<00:03:16.680> tangled<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.519> have<00:03:17.730> some

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
from getting tangled so you have some

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.759 
from getting tangled so you have some
protection<00:03:18.870> as<00:03:18.930> far<00:03:19.140> as<00:03:19.230> stuff<00:03:19.530> getting

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
protection as far as stuff getting

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.050 
protection as far as stuff getting
