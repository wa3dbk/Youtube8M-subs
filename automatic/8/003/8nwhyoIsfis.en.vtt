00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.670
 once again from the girls channel 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.130
 let's see how to make a doll 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.160
 jumping, let's put it, sisante what 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.360
 what we need is a pair of scissors and a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.309
 tennis ball that we will have 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.990
 hair removed and cut in half 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.580
 I did not do this in the video 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.980
 because it takes a lot of work to start up 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.180
 to fool in all good well once the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.570
 we have it folded like this 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.660
 we will continue trimming the edge until 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.620
 and just like that, turn around 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.620
 we started to see 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.230
 It is not like this 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.230
 I hope he stays 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.920
 yes 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.550
 if until now, as you will see, the 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.940
 sun then we turn you over if you're 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.260
 A) Yes 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.260
 this what we turn around 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.250
 we squeeze it a little bit stopped so that 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.870
 last longer 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.870
 since we put it on the ground 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.110
 or 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.390
 Y 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.390
 as being a ratillo but we put it 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.160
 we wait 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.920
 and good simply with average but already what 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.920
 we have done
