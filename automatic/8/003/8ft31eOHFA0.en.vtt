00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.709
 hello friend of the laws 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.410
 We are here today in Piracicaba. 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.140
 for a walk a way a bit 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.380
 different 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.660
 we will learn how to do is drift 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.439
 a Japanese technique consisting of 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.439
 controlled overruns 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.190
 and to talk a little bit better about how 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.239
 want to make sad is featured with mane and 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.940
 pilots the super different cars already makes 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.860
 two and a half years and I think I wanted 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.290
 You said a little more four 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.809
 techniques with the difficulty of putting this 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.879
 car and do not hit the wall does not 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.550
 fell on the grass doing nothing wrong 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.940
 in fact drift is a technique that 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.830
 This is the hardest we've been. 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.640
 learn to drive with the steering wheel on the side 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:07.460
 right but the very same is that 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.080
 when the car is in fact the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.610
 People say that the car is lost instead. 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.539
 to actually brake would have to 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.820
 speed up 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.369
 so it's a bit different than the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.110
 people are used to doing in 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.110
 categories of tourism as 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.060
 and how long did it take to learn to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.140
 doing this took a long time 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.750
 very scare was it was a quiet stroll 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.840
 It did not take me a little because of the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.720
 steering wheel on the right but I think 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.170
 It took me six months to get started. 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.450
 to do two things you want next 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.460
 let me learn this in a few hours 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.380
 Are you sure you will learn to leave here? 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.789
 doing legal drift 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.390
 Let's try, then let's go and see 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.390
 what happens 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.630
 the entry of politics and there is also 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.540
 a little more for appliances 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.170
 then you hasten a customer to call 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.170
 bring logo 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.850
 it was not good 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.840
 it will only be able 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:07.590
 long before the game may be a bit lacking 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.590
 here and black water, teleconferences 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.920
 i 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.660
 then he does not 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.090
 in plenary 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.090
 you have to see the picture 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.720
 the moment you 're the first place 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.720
 I think you're in when you can 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.930
 bryan 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.350
 ae 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.350
 morning 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.690
 1 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:19.840
 The car goes from there and has no job 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:23.010
 prefer the father of queen elizabeth ii 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.010
 a little more 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.759
 i 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.780
 in fact and obey at the time the car 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.010
 begins 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.100
 not remember cutting it catches when 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.270
 There and there, there's no way back. 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.740
 even a car there the river 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.740
 wheel because you understand 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:06.810
 hit a ball of paper to Braga 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.180
 congratulations guy is hard as hell is 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.940
 very complicated but you were the first 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.690
 and it's your good, thank you, kindness. 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.760
 I did a good program, but it's okay. 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.290
 that learn a little more claw 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.630
 left making a curve right 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:26.720
 I took about six months as a pilot. 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.720
 with experience 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.410
