00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.360
 whiskey punkt.de meeting point fine 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.580
 spirits welcome to whiskey 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.150
 store the meeting place full of spirits and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.310
 today we have an obligatory hour 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.490
 made fun it's the new ball 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.660
 blair vintage 2002 appeared 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 and although we are still in summer 2013 yet 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.289
 2001 we already have the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.750
 2002 at the one replaced in 2001 and this one 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.820
 replace for me now means in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.200
 quotation mark duty hour because 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.149
 then this bottle will be tasted 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.809
 but the demand should follow the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.930
 2001's relatively strong but is the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.760
 I remember I do not have one 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.190
 photographic memory if you can do that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.680
 may say so 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.239
 i remember basically characters 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.789
 of bottles and actually me one 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.809
 very very strong athletic character 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.960
 with a clear touch of exotic 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.339
 fruit pineapple especially falls to me there 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.290
 a man rather i have the video 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.580
 not seen what i have here 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.920
 So I've tried here now 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.900
 unbiased if you yourself 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.549
 You can have tasted both whiskeys 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.560
 see what kind of differences that we 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.799
 Deviations now with me to the individual 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.000
 video then what I just happen to be 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.900
 I looked at the bottle 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.799
 want to have liked it 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.229
 Here one writes very exactly on it 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.750
 So what is only 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:44.810
 burned in 2002 and bottled in 2012 and it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.810
 is the first release of this 2002 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.799
 natural color is not filtered so that 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.670
 was and is on the box house 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:01.140
 even more on it is taste 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.950
 notes the first release of babette 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.190
 2002 sparkling gold in the color 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.740
 That's a holy gold in the nose 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.860
 the typical ones are soon empty 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.990
 floral and sugar 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:24.730
 and certainly not burned 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:28.650
 have with steve luczo students 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.450
 acid fruits like oranges limes 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.310
 Attacks American oak experts 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.410
 Firmly brings the toffees caramel and the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.870
 vanilla notes in tasty body 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.780
 but sweet and spicy in the character 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.920
 with hints of orange lime and 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.280
 green apples 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.370
 that's the jazz trophy again we have 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.010
 already and if you are a typical long 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.400
 departure would be the floral and fruity 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.860
 develop and connect with each other 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.950
 with spices and sweet of the 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.350
 American oak barrels so that 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.060
 Everything sounds like it has one 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.520
 knowing and not a marketing person 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.790
 described and that inspires me then 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.239
 So a bottle so not that 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.310
 marketing blabla 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.940
 yes I remember it again immediately 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.209
 this gigantic big wood radl 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:34.209
 open the cork 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:35.110
 yes jackson makes it very easy 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.080
 volume percent 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.320
 So we're allowed to do it properly 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.769
 Portion of alcohol on the nose in the nose 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.769
 expect 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.930
 what he does 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:12.560
 an incredible blast from me 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:16.940
 and was hardly with caramel wonderful one 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.370
 real caramel tree and what I have now 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.580
 from the elderly not in parents in the 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.110
 previous in the renovation had this 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.639
 extreme exotic fruits find that 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.639
 I am not here first at first attempt 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.810
 So the camel and my idea the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.810
 lie above everything 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.610
 now comes the fruit so slowly 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:53.470
 but not the test properly 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.470
 sweet sweet caramel lies above everything 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.069
 max grammes euro 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:34.550
 40 comes the spritzigkeit with pure but 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:43.690
 do not press American oak so 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:49.630
 not so violent now you can do this 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.630
 acidic dry fruits come now 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.570
 but the mole 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.780
 but he came over everything 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:22.570
 now come the orange strength yes yes 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:25.000
 surprisingly different than the other soon 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:28.230
 empty character of these strong ones 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.780
 However, the fruity flavors lived are the 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:34.420
 experts firmly agree with these bisky 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.890
 clearly in stamp imprint look 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.740
 find what you are looking for in the shop system 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.330
 We 2001 2002 or when in a few 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.210
 years ago we see this video 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.000
 now in 2013 then it will be the 2003 and 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.540
 2004 give etc 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.040
 To be continued even ask such a 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.380
 Duty hour as one thinks a great 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.620
 experience and heartfelt thanks for 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.620
 watch
