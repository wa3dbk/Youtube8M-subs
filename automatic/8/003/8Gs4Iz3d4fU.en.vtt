00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello dear friends will be with you and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 Today we will talk about how you can easily 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.250
 and just train your vx goal 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.730
 with aimbot cards 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.250
 diaz it's pretty easy to deflate the card 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.480
 Sasha are not to the roller after 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.660
 what are you appearing like this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.150
 a room with various weapons world 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.789
 weapons 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.609
 more precisely with all kinds of weapons from such 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.910
 settings panel parts in detail 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.219
 I'll tell you what each panel does to here 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.140
 here it is the very first it adds 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.370
 bots and still 5 2 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.100
 kick this this infinite 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:46.289
 endless ammo it gives how it all 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.980
 looks start vodka and shown or 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.910
 whether or not you got 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.340
 so I turn off so here is the function 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.550
 adds 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:04.229
 bullet-proof vest + helmet and target this decision and 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.600
 sound practice I still have not caught up 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.290
 what is it but most likely something 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.120
 somehow connected with the sound here 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.980
 there are also settings 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.810
 bots you can choose them speed and 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.330
 straight how will they move 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.230
 cars I chose random and they randomly 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.580
 for a period of time 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.880
 as well as these settings here 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:41.820
 this is the menu this is valid training 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.979
 sovfeda here we open here 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.790
 This wall opens here and after 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.970
 of all that 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.930
 will die just by shooting them already 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:05.610
 will spawn in three places Well these 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:08.180
 here are the three functions they add walls like 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.180
 I also spoke on 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.819
 walls and boxes 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.640
