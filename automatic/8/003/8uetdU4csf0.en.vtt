 Hello, my name is Sergey Rumyantsev 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.530
 and today we talk about using 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.369
 andy filters 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:22.210
 photographer Sergey Blush member of the Union 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.859
 Photographers of Russia in the profession since 2001 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.089
 of the year 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.130
 multiple Russian and laureate 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:31.150
 international photography contests 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.010
 one of the authors of the project airpano andy 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.690
 filter or whatever it is that's on black 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.829
 the filter comes from the English word 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.660
 on and troll net 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.550
 neutral density neutral filter 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.510
 density is designed to 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.900
 increase the shutter speed on the camera bright 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.610
 sunny weather what does it need it 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.400
 you need first of all for the fact that 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.270
 sometimes we don't have time to come to the place 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.100
 shooting 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.380
 early in the morning when there is nobody and 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.060
 around the object that we want to remove 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.460
 already organized a certain 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.560
 the number of nations here to reduce 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.900
 number of people in the frame we will 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.000
 use this one andy filter how 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.350
 way if you put an excerpt 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.450
 5 10 15 seconds on the camera then people 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.509
 who walk around the subject 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.810
 just disappear the final frame this here 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.320
 one of these important uses 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.360
 this filter is different to another 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.030
 use when we want to create 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.689
 effect as i call it stop 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.810
 instant 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.990
 what does it mean the same thing when 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.179
 there is a crowd around the people we put this 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.840
 filter but set the shutter speed is not so 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.360
 long 1 2 seconds and set the model 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.700
 which stands motionless during this 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.890
 time result we get the picture 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.979
 when around a fixed model 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.750
 There is such a train of blurred people 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.360
 like some kind of mystical city 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.990
 it turns out for these purposes we also 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.450
 use andy filter let's now on 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.679
 practice will sort out some secrets 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.990
 work with andy filters 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.269
 Now we will try to blur the water on 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.760
 moscow river now we see the weather 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:15.349
 slightly windy and on the Moscow River can be seen 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.090
 rivers setting andy filter on camera we 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.630
 make an exposure of 20 to 25 seconds and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.150
 virtually all waves are still as filter 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.310
 black and through it nothing is visible then 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.170
 we need to use the camera 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.290
 live view mode which allow 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.920
 line up the composition on the monitor checks 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.540
 cameras as if on a lens and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.400
 there was no black filter we expose 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.510
 make sure we have 25 seconds after 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.330
 all installations 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.870
 push the trigger very 25 second on 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.750
 my result will be capacious we will see it 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.450
 soon enough now waves and ripples 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.480
 which we observe in ordinary life she 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.760
 disappeared and even appeared rolling 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.700
 reflection 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.850
 more or less this way we are now with 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.130
 you met with one of the examples 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.570
 working sandy filters let's 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.410
 consider another way to use 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.100
 Andy filters, we now try to remove 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.960
 famous architectural object without 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.530
 mass of people who are now going 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.920
 in front of our lens for this we are again 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.180
 same put a long exposure 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.040
 using a black filter and try 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.560
 Blur people going to such a state 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.930
 when they will not play key 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.260
 roles 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:45.660
 we set the composition for 20 seconds 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.660
 respectively descent 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.670
 despite the fact that she was now very 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.750
 a large number of people on the bridge 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.730
 melt these numbers 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.430
 remnants of ghosts 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.170
 how could a ghostly city be 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.120
 try to put more exposure there 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.790
 30 seconds 40 seconds 50 seconds 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.730
 it all depends on the immediate 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.269
 plot how we want to completely remove 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.110
 people either leave quite visible 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.110
 silhouettes 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.930
 now we met another 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.460
 interesting artistic technique which 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.460
 can be created using
