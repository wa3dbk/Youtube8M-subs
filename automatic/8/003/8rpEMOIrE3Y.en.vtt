it all from just my mind of going to
baseball<00:02:52.489> stadiums<00:02:52.909> when<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.060> was<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.209> kid<00:02:53.260> first

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
baseball stadiums when I was a kid first

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.140 
baseball stadiums when I was a kid first
off<00:02:54.409> I<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.590> built<00:02:55.040> like<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.310> field<00:02:55.819> right

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
off I just built like this field right

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.149 
off I just built like this field right
here<00:02:56.180> in<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.019> grass<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:57.799> I<00:02:57.859> had<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.040> put

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
here in the grass and I had to put

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.170 
here in the grass and I had to put
clothes<00:02:58.370> on<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.639> grass<00:02:58.879> because<00:02:59.120> you

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
clothes on the grass because you

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.280 
clothes on the grass because you
couldn't<00:02:59.359> really<00:02:59.480> see<00:02:59.719> that<00:02:59.840> grass<00:03:00.109> those

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
couldn't really see that grass those

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.309

pure<00:03:00.530> black<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.699> gold<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.419> flagpole<00:03:03.049> and

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
pure black and gold is the flagpole and

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.830 
pure black and gold is the flagpole and
then<00:03:03.469> that<00:03:03.969> you<00:03:04.969> know<00:03:05.090> judging<00:03:05.629> everything

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
then that you know judging everything

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.360 
then that you know judging everything
was<00:03:06.109> hard<00:03:06.319> like<00:03:06.439> I<00:03:06.560> had<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.709> may<00:03:06.889> I<00:03:06.919> try<00:03:07.159> to<00:03:07.189> make

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.569 
sides um see it goes straight lien Act I
tried<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.439> make<00:03:18.560> sure<00:03:18.590> everything<00:03:19.099> was<00:03:19.189> even

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
tried to make sure everything was even

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.039 
tried to make sure everything was even
everything<00:03:19.970> then<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.150> spawn<00:03:20.389> villagers<00:03:20.900> in

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
everything then I spawn villagers in

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.899
