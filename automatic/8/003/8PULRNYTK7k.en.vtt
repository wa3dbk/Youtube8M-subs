over any air bubbles that get trapped in
there<00:01:43.640> will<00:01:43.820> be<00:01:44.170> siphoned<00:01:45.170> out<00:01:45.259> by<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.590> Aqua

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
there will be siphoned out by the Aqua

going down the pipes which is a

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.320 
going down the pipes which is a
fantastic<00:02:03.860> addition<00:02:04.220> we<00:02:04.670> didn't<00:02:04.970> have<00:02:05.090> back

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
in the 1990's so the water comes in here

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.720 
in the 1990's so the water comes in here
comes<00:02:10.039> around<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.610> up<00:02:10.700> over<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:12.730> partition

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
comes around and up over this partition

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.410

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
and dumps in got a couple of foam deals

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.870 
and dumps in got a couple of foam deals
again<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.720> got<00:02:17.840> these<00:02:18.050> guys<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:19.460> kill

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.590 
to take this off for any reason I just
loosen<00:02:44.900> that<00:02:45.020> up<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.680> pulls<00:02:45.950> right<00:02:46.190> apart

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
loosen that up and it pulls right apart

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.510 
loosen that up and it pulls right apart
so<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.630> don't<00:02:48.140> have<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.380> be<00:02:48.950> cutting<00:02:49.400> on

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
so I don't have to be cutting on

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.420 
so I don't have to be cutting on
anything<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.450> as<00:02:51.290> some<00:02:51.530> people<00:02:51.830> prefer<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
anything and as some people prefer the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.800 
anything and as some people prefer the
two<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:52.970> regular<00:02:53.560> clear<00:02:54.560> tubing<00:02:55.069> or

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
two of the regular clear tubing or

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.630 
two of the regular clear tubing or
different<00:02:56.810> types<00:02:57.020> of<00:02:57.170> tubing<00:02:57.640> flexible

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
different types of tubing flexible

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.589 
different types of tubing flexible
tubing<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.209> don't<00:03:00.050> use<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.290> because<00:03:01.599> from

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
tubing I don't use that because from

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.980 
tubing I don't use that because from
experience<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.440> know<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:05.000> after<00:03:05.900> the

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
experience I know that the after the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.630 
experience I know that the after the
tubing<00:03:06.380> has<00:03:06.500> been<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:06.830> the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
tubing has been on the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.990 
tubing has been on the
push<00:03:08.640> on<00:03:08.819> fittings<00:03:09.060> for<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:10.610> fair<00:03:11.610> amount<00:03:11.730> of

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
push on fittings for a fair amount of

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.240 
push on fittings for a fair amount of
time<00:03:12.209> they<00:03:12.840> don't<00:03:13.080> want<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.620> come<00:03:13.769> off<00:03:13.830> without

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
time they don't want to come off without

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.430 
time they don't want to come off without
being<00:03:14.730> cut<00:03:14.970> off<00:03:15.000> which<00:03:15.810> means<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.200> got<00:03:16.319> to

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
being cut off which means you got to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.460 
being cut off which means you got to
replace<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.920> tubing<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:18.260> anyway<00:03:19.260> that's

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
replace the tubing so anyway that's

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.280 
replace the tubing so anyway that's
where<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:20.700> was<00:03:20.849> one<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.120> my<00:03:21.209> very<00:03:21.989> first

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
where that was one of my very first

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.509 
where that was one of my very first
purchases<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:24.090> think<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:24.959> work<00:03:25.200> great<00:03:25.519> it's

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
purchases I think it work great it's

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.500 
purchases I think it work great it's
rated<00:03:26.940> at<00:03:27.120> 1,200<00:03:27.959> gallons<00:03:28.110> an<00:03:28.620> hour<00:03:28.849> it's<00:03:29.849> 125

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
rated at 1,200 gallons an hour it's 125

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.240 
rated at 1,200 gallons an hour it's 125
gallon<00:03:31.200> tank<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.849> just<00:03:33.390> under<00:03:34.250> 10

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
gallon tank so that is just under 10

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.539 
gallon tank so that is just under 10
cycles<00:03:35.610> an<00:03:36.000> hour<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:37.010> believe<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.040> will<00:03:38.430> be

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
cycles an hour I believe that will be

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.699 
cycles an hour I believe that will be
plenty<00:03:38.879> of<00:03:39.269> course<00:03:39.599> when<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> tank<00:03:40.530> up

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
plenty of course when I have the tank up

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.470 
plenty of course when I have the tank up
and<00:03:40.860> running<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.250> do<00:03:41.310> plan<00:03:41.700> on<00:03:41.760> putting<00:03:42.090> a

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
and running I do plan on putting a

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.780 
and running I do plan on putting a
couple<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:44.450> power<00:03:45.450> heads<00:03:45.829> here<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.069> there<00:03:47.250> to

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
couple of power heads here and there to

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.699 
couple of power heads here and there to
supplement<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.720> water<00:03:48.900> flow<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.489> tank<00:03:51.709> so

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
supplement the water flow in the tank so

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.239 
supplement the water flow in the tank so
well<00:03:53.040> until<00:03:53.610> next<00:03:53.940> time
