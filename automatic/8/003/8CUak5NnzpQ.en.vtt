00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:09.890 

I<00:00:06.859> think<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.940> stage<00:00:09.179> where<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.540> am<00:00:09.719> now

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
I think that in the stage where I am now

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.470 
I think that in the stage where I am now
it's<00:00:10.080> really<00:00:10.290> interesting<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.250> have<00:00:11.480> man's

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
it's really interesting to have man's

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.210 
it's really interesting to have man's
sitting<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.559> my<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.400> my<00:00:14.460> world<00:00:15.500> in<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.619> very<00:00:16.800> free

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
sitting in my in my world in a very free

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.040 
sitting in my in my world in a very free
kind<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.640> way<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.270> know<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.600> an<00:00:18.720> independent

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
kind of way you know it's an independent

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.490 
kind of way you know it's an independent
company<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.939> an<00:00:21.539> approach<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.289> like

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
company and it's an approach that I like

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.650 
company and it's an approach that I like
in<00:00:22.800> relation<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> place<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.449> no

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
in relation to the place that I have no

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.080 
in relation to the place that I have no
idea<00:00:24.920> which<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.130> very<00:00:26.400> big<00:00:26.609> corporate

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
idea which is a very big corporate

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.019 
idea which is a very big corporate
institution<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.310> so<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.880> lot

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
institution and so I think it's a lot

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.930 
institution and so I think it's a lot
about<00:00:30.210> experiment<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.500> lot<00:00:31.679> about

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
about experiment and it's a lot about

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.410 
about experiment and it's a lot about
freedom<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.930> lot<00:00:34.110> about<00:00:35.270> working<00:00:36.270> on

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
freedom and it's a lot about working on

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.410 
freedom and it's a lot about working on
on<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.200> process<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.610> how<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> perception

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
on a process to see how the perception

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.889 
on a process to see how the perception
of<00:00:39.719> man's<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.660> changed

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
of man's can be changed

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.010 
of man's can be changed
men's<00:00:43.700> fashion<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:45.000> general<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.660> well

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
men's fashion in general is well

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.010 
men's fashion in general is well
complicated<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> last<00:00:47.250> decades<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.020> we

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
complicated in the last decades and we

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.619 
complicated in the last decades and we
see<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> lot<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.530> collections<00:00:50.430> which<00:00:51.000> are<00:00:51.210> based

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
see a lot of collections which are based

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.170 
see a lot of collections which are based
on<00:00:51.870> garter<00:00:52.350> hop<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.730> more<00:00:53.910> about

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
on garter hop you know it's more about

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.799 
on garter hop you know it's more about
very<00:00:55.110> commercial<00:00:55.680> approach<00:00:56.329> men<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.600> buy

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
very commercial approach men that buy

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.500 
very commercial approach men that buy
fashion<00:00:58.350> they<00:00:59.070> show<00:00:59.340> strong<00:00:59.760> interested<00:01:00.390> in

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
fashion they show strong interested in

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.860 
fashion they show strong interested in
women<00:01:00.840> fashion<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.410> think<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> last<00:01:02.870> five

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
women fashion I think in the last five

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.929 
women fashion I think in the last five
six<00:01:04.140> seven<00:01:04.260> years<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.830> becoming<00:01:05.280> very<00:01:05.309> strong

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
six seven years is becoming very strong

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.820 
six seven years is becoming very strong
and<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.360> me<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.720> clearly<00:01:07.080> meaning<00:01:07.619> that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and for me it's clearly meaning that

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.600 
and for me it's clearly meaning that
they<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.640> something<00:01:08.820> which<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
they are out for something which is

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:20.499 
they are out for something which is
with<00:01:09.730> more<00:01:10.410> challenging

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.209 

it<00:01:21.509> was<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> very<00:01:21.929> well<00:01:22.229> considered<00:01:22.770> choice<00:01:23.009> of

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
it was a very well considered choice of

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.459 
it was a very well considered choice of
you<00:01:23.369> need<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.609> go<00:01:23.789> to<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.179> off<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.229> that

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
you need to go to the off to see that

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.149 
you need to go to the off to see that
part<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:27.090> fashion<00:01:27.509> world<00:01:27.950> meaning<00:01:28.950> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
part of the fashion world meaning a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.999 
part of the fashion world meaning a
brand<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.390> an<00:01:30.719> impactful<00:01:31.409> historical

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
brand with an impactful historical

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.779 
brand with an impactful historical
package<00:01:32.399> a<00:01:33.709> contrast<00:01:34.709> is<00:01:34.920> probably<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.640> I'm

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
package a contrast is probably what I'm

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.289 
package a contrast is probably what I'm
out<00:01:36.060> for<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.469> always<00:01:37.829> doing<00:01:38.069> a<00:01:38.490> lot<00:01:39.270> of

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
out for as I was always doing a lot of

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
out for as I was always doing a lot of
different<00:01:39.600> things<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> past<00:01:40.709> as<00:01:40.950> well

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
different things in the past as well

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.179 
different things in the past as well
like<00:01:41.969> even<00:01:42.810> before<00:01:42.959> Jill<00:01:43.380> sounded<00:01:43.799> when<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.039> was

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
like even before Jill sounded when I was

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.490 
like even before Jill sounded when I was
having<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.549> own<00:01:44.579> brenda<00:01:45.179> was<00:01:45.329> also<00:01:45.630> operating

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
having my own brenda was also operating

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.230 
having my own brenda was also operating
for<00:01:46.679> example<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.399> teaching<00:01:48.060> at<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
for example I was teaching at the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.569 
for example I was teaching at the
University<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:48.929> five<00:01:49.140> years<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.560> Vienna<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.069> I

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
University for five years in Vienna so I

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.669 
University for five years in Vienna so I
need<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.209> the<00:01:51.390> contrast<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.140> think<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.560> is

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
need to have the contrast I think it is

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.539 
need to have the contrast I think it is
very<00:01:53.509> challenging<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:54.840> me<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.520> not<00:01:56.520> be

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
very challenging for me to not be

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.979 
very challenging for me to not be
everyday<00:01:57.799> in<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.039> same<00:01:59.250> situation<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.179> was

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:00.989 
everyday in the same situation I was

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.779 
everyday in the same situation I was
confronted<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.429> very<00:02:02.929> young<00:02:03.929> age<00:02:04.170> with

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
confronted in a very young age with

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.339 
confronted in a very young age with
specifically<00:02:05.789> one<00:02:06.030> shot<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.539> Martin<00:02:07.020> Margiela

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
specifically one shot on Martin Margiela

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.009 
specifically one shot on Martin Margiela
Easter<00:02:07.890> children<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.239> had<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> very<00:02:09.750> very

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
Easter children and it had a very very

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.369 
Easter children and it had a very very
big<00:02:10.259> impact<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.769> me<00:02:10.920> because<00:02:11.250> before<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
big impact on me because before that

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.110 
big impact on me because before that
time<00:02:13.379> I<00:02:13.680> was<00:02:13.860> looking<00:02:14.129> around<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.790> little<00:02:14.879> bit

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
time I was looking around a little bit

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.160 
time I was looking around a little bit
in<00:02:15.299> fashion<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.799> more<00:02:17.069> as<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:18.690> person

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
in fashion and I think more as a person

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.580 
in fashion and I think more as a person
who<00:02:20.120> who<00:02:21.120> definitely<00:02:21.630> was<00:02:21.870> interested<00:02:22.410> in

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
who who definitely was interested in

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.990 
who who definitely was interested in
buying<00:02:23.549> clothes<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.150> myself<00:02:25.130> but<00:02:26.130> not<00:02:26.609> so

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
buying clothes for myself but not so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.009 
buying clothes for myself but not so
much<00:02:27.150> further<00:02:27.450> than<00:02:27.720> that

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
much further than that

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.759 
much further than that
I<00:02:28.200> wasn't<00:02:28.530> really<00:02:28.799> looking<00:02:29.040> at<00:02:29.340> fashion<00:02:30.470> on<00:02:31.470> an

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
I wasn't really looking at fashion on an

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.729 
I wasn't really looking at fashion on an
from<00:02:32.160> an<00:02:32.280> intellectual<00:02:32.700> point<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.480> view<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.930> was

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
from an intellectual point of view I was

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.190 
from an intellectual point of view I was
one<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.160> perceiving<00:02:35.639> it<00:02:35.790> quite<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.840> know<00:02:36.989> like

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
one of perceiving it quite you know like

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.319 
one of perceiving it quite you know like
maybe<00:02:37.440> too<00:02:38.099> much<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.549> surface<00:02:38.730> for<00:02:39.180> me

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
maybe too much on the surface for me

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.910 
maybe too much on the surface for me
that's<00:02:39.630> maybe<00:02:39.810> something<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.530> not<00:02:40.709> for

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
that's maybe something that is not for

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.039 
that's maybe something that is not for
me<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.880> job<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.569> changed<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
me and that job not that changed the

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.349 
me and that job not that changed the
whole<00:02:43.200> thing<00:02:43.440> Martin<00:02:44.069> was<00:02:44.250> not<00:02:44.280> shown<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.299> a

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
whole thing Martin was not shown on a

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.479 
whole thing Martin was not shown on a
high<00:02:45.540> stage<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.230> was<00:02:46.380> not<00:02:46.560> about<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.829> glamour

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
high stage it was not about the glamour

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.390 
high stage it was not about the glamour
it<00:02:47.940> was<00:02:48.150> very<00:02:48.599> linked<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.889> street<00:02:50.190> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
it was very linked to the street and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.740 
it was very linked to the street and
very<00:02:50.579> linked<00:02:50.880> to

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
very linked to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.370 
very linked to
the<00:02:53.440> social<00:02:53.950> awareness<00:02:54.100> I<00:02:54.790> think<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:56.350> was

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
the social awareness I think and it was

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.190 
the social awareness I think and it was
emotional<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:57.160> conceptual<00:02:57.760> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
emotional and conceptual and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.370 
emotional and conceptual and
psychological<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:04.510> fashion<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:04.930> don't<00:03:05.200> do

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
psychological in fashion you don't do

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.180 
psychological in fashion you don't do
things<00:03:05.590> alone<00:03:05.800> so<00:03:06.760> it's<00:03:07.660> very<00:03:07.810> much<00:03:07.930> about

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
things alone so it's very much about

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.160 
things alone so it's very much about
collaboration<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.460> very<00:03:09.640> much<00:03:09.790> about

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
collaboration and it's very much about

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.440 
collaboration and it's very much about
creating<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.290> your<00:03:12.190> own<00:03:12.310> kind<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.730> family<00:03:13.180> and

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
creating a your own kind of family and

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.260 
creating a your own kind of family and
together<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.680> build<00:03:14.890> something<00:03:15.130> so<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.120> that

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
together you build something so in that

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.970 
together you build something so in that
sense<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:16.750> can<00:03:16.780> cope<00:03:17.140> with<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.410> I'm<00:03:17.620> not<00:03:17.650> gonna

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
sense I can cope with it I'm not gonna

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.280 
sense I can cope with it I'm not gonna
say<00:03:18.160> it's<00:03:18.310> not<00:03:18.430> happy<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.050> a<00:03:20.080> lot

say it's not happy it's it's it is a lot

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.880 
say it's not happy it's it's it is a lot
of<00:03:20.410> work

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
of work

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.980 
of work
I<00:03:20.920> don't<00:03:21.490> think<00:03:21.580> fashion<00:03:22.060> as<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.180> place<00:03:22.480> anymore

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
I don't think fashion as a place anymore

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.680 
I don't think fashion as a place anymore
and<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.740> can<00:03:23.950> still<00:03:24.190> again<00:03:24.550> evolve<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.270> it<00:03:25.450> but

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
and it can still again evolve to it but

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.810 
and it can still again evolve to it but
fashion<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:26.680> this<00:03:26.830> moment<00:03:27.130> in<00:03:27.400> time<00:03:27.430> is

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
fashion in this moment in time is

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.150 
fashion in this moment in time is
another<00:03:28.150> place<00:03:28.480> where<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.230> can<00:03:29.410> just<00:03:29.440> step<00:03:29.920> in

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
another place where you can just step in

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.890 
another place where you can just step in
and<00:03:30.490> you<00:03:30.610> make<00:03:30.790> some<00:03:31.000> things<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.570> let's<00:03:31.720> see

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
and you make some things and let's see

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.020 
and you make some things and let's see
how<00:03:32.050> it<00:03:32.170> goes<00:03:32.380> doesn't<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.459> doesn't<00:03:33.820> work

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
how it goes doesn't just doesn't work

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.440 
how it goes doesn't just doesn't work
like<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.300> anymore<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:35.080> would<00:03:35.860> not<00:03:36.280> want<00:03:37.030> that

the possibility for me to be creative is

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.280 
the possibility for me to be creative is
taken<00:03:41.740> away<00:03:42.010> because<00:03:42.970> I'm<00:03:43.510> attacking<00:03:44.050> a

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
ridiculous what's happening and I think

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.560 
ridiculous what's happening and I think
most<00:04:08.110> creative<00:04:08.800> people<00:04:09.280> most<00:04:09.670> designers<00:04:10.150> will

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
most creative people most designers will

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.699 
most creative people most designers will
see<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.620> like<00:04:11.800> that<00:04:11.830> for<00:04:12.700> themselves<00:04:13.560> lots<00:04:14.560> of

things are taken away true the change of

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.370 
things are taken away true the change of
the<00:04:17.830> system<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:19.630> know<00:04:19.780> like<00:04:19.989> curiosity
