00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
pickups and you know you can tell it's a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.119 
pickups and you know you can tell it's a
prototype<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.470> only<00:01:04.620> has<00:01:04.830> three

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
prototype because it only has three

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
volumes one for each pickup and a tone

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.719 
volumes one for each pickup and a tone
knob<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.770> doesn't<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> pickup<00:01:08.610> selector

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
knob it doesn't have a pickup selector

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 
knob it doesn't have a pickup selector
which<00:01:09.150> would<00:01:09.300> make<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.960> easy<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.409> if

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
which would make it really easy so if

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.690 
which would make it really easy so if
you<00:01:10.650> wanted<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> switch<00:01:11.130> from<00:01:11.370> this<00:01:11.490> pick<00:01:11.670> up

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you wanted to switch from this pick up

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.899 
you wanted to switch from this pick up
to<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.000> pickup<00:01:12.390> you'd<00:01:12.870> have<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.909> I'm

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to this pickup you'd have to go I'm

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:26.260 
to this pickup you'd have to go I'm
rocking<00:01:15.270> out<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:23.310> which<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.969> not<00:01:24.299> very

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
rocking out so which is kind of not very

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.340 
rocking out so which is kind of not very
not<00:01:27.270> very<00:01:28.670> convenient<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.810> tone<00:01:31.079> in

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
not very convenient but you can tone in

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.990 
not very convenient but you can tone in
you<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.250> probably<00:01:32.399> tune<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.850> lot<00:01:32.969> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you can probably tune in a lot of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.310 
you can probably tune in a lot of
different<00:01:33.329> tones<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.899> can<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.289> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
different tones because you can get a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.870 
different tones because you can get a
different<00:01:34.590> balance<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.159> each<00:01:35.280> pickup<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.729> here

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
different balance of each pickup in here

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.580 
different balance of each pickup in here
first<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:36.869> let's<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.350> three

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
first of all let's see what all three

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.359 
first of all let's see what all three
sound<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:41.539> nice<00:01:42.539> and<00:01:42.750> smooth<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:43.369> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
sound like nice and smooth right and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.499 
sound like nice and smooth right and
then<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.670> could<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.119> kinds<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
then you could just do all kinds of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.109 
then you could just do all kinds of
different<00:01:45.630> fading<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.789> want<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.969> little

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
different fading so you want a little

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.890 
different fading so you want a little
more<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.359> that<00:01:48.390> Oh<00:01:48.950> check<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:49.979> out

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
more of that Oh check that out

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.020 
more of that Oh check that out
that's<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:53.190> not<00:01:53.310> even<00:01:53.520> subtle<00:01:53.760> that's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that's so it's not even subtle that's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.310 
that's so it's not even subtle that's
totally<00:01:54.510> other<00:01:54.630> in-your-face

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
totally other in-your-face

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
totally other in-your-face
I<00:02:00.200> can't<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.470> but<00:02:01.950> okay<00:02:02.730> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.000> you

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I can't do that but okay and then you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.270 
I can't do that but okay and then you
have<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.180> tone<00:02:03.480> up<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:04.080> even<00:02:04.500> add<00:02:04.590> more<00:02:04.620> tone<00:02:05.010> so

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
have a tone up to even add more tone so

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.090 
have a tone up to even add more tone so
lots<00:02:05.910> of<00:02:06.030> possibilities<00:02:06.690> here<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:07.800> want

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
lots of possibilities here I just want
