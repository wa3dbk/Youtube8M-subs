00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello friends today I bring you a video for 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.730
 that they become aware of what is 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.589
 pollution and what can reach 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.300
 pass this video sample of the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.130
 deformations that the body will have 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.400
 human with all these kinds of 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.529
 pollution and toxic products according to 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.690
 an article found from the last century 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.609
 with very little scientific rigor nor 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.560
 even hypothetical the human being 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.720
 I would physically evolve to do 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.330
 facing a highly polluted world 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.070
 and toxic we would be talking about a 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.130
 natural selection of man maybe 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.559
 eyes in order to withstand contact 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.080
 with pollutants in the atmosphere the eye 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.150
 human will be similar to the pig one 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.070
 transparent membrane that can now be 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.170
 find in the inner corner of the eye 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.000
 it will be bigger and it will serve as a 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.590
 second pair for two nose will increase from 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.660
 size and you will have a system of 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.239
 compartments and filters to clean 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.830
 better the air for the same reason the 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.879
 nose hairs will become more 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.610
 thick and longer three lungs 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.979
 increase in size and connect to 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.570
 circulatory system which will allow the 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.530
 extraction of air from a small 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.119
 amount of oxygen 4 liver its 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.890
 ability to cleanse the blood 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.200
 will increase dramatically until 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.670
 become a more effective body for 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.220
 the filtering of poisonous substances 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.350
 the skin becomes more brutal with areas 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.450
 calcified to avoid burns by 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.490
 chemical pollutants in the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.409
 atmosphere 6 appendix will stop having a 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.420
 surface function helping 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.130
 transform any type of food 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.080
 vegetable once the meat is 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.610
 become unfit for consumption 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.670
 due to pollution 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.530
 the bone structure will be lighter and more 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.570
 fragile due to the relative lack of 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.740
 vitamin reducing the amount 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.430
 of sunlight and poor diet 8 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.900
 hair 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.970
 will disappear due to a strong 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.800
 global warming 9 ears the increase 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.990
 of noise will lead to the formation of 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.690
 folds in the ears making them more 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.310
 similar to those of the hair a person may 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.530
 raise them to listen better and 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.520
 lower them to reduce the flow noise 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.190
 10 temperament the man is going to be a 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.380
 little crazy this is due to the presence 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.000
 of toxic substances in the products 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.840
 foods that contain a high 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.959
 mercury percentage 11 devices 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.030
 respiratory infections immediately after 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.459
 birth man needs a unit 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.790
 special breathing that will help 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.180
 survive the first weeks of life 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.459
 12 kidneys will acquire a new function 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.010
 the extraction of water from urine and 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.290
 water conservation in the body in 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.819
 place of fluid the person will urinate 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.879
 in a 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.450
 and composed of uric acid and substances 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:57.519
 toxic many will say good 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.670
 total shit I will not live in that 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.040
 then good and what happens if this happens 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.620
 before the pollution reaches the water 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.750
 and only 5% of water remains in the entire 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.549
 world or that many industries are created 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.489
 oil and pollute more the 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.980
 friends atmosphere this can be avoided 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.530
 how can you encourage the use of 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.749
 bicycle there are electric cars and I guess 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.659
 that in the not too distant future not 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:24.489
 You will be so expensive and only you can 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.110
 choose our future that you want 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.780
 end up like this or in a clean world 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.700
 good friends that's it if they liked it 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.830
