I think after about two weeks I was
where<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:13.400> didn't<00:02:13.879> wear<00:02:13.970> every<00:02:14.300> day<00:02:14.330> like<00:02:14.599> two

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
where I didn't wear every day like two

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.930 
where I didn't wear every day like two
weeks<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.739> I<00:02:15.830> didn't<00:02:16.220> wear<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.400> ran<00:02:16.700> into

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
weeks and I didn't wear it ran into

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.270 
weeks and I didn't wear it ran into
issues<00:02:17.300> feel<00:02:17.780> tangling<00:02:18.349> so<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.620> was<00:02:18.890> rushed<00:02:19.160> her

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
issues feel tangling so I was rushed her

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.670 
issues feel tangling so I was rushed her
out<00:02:19.400> with<00:02:19.580> her<00:02:19.610> wig<00:02:19.910> brush<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.569> don't<00:02:21.500> have<00:02:21.620> a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
out with her wig brush I don't have a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.170 
out with her wig brush I don't have a
paddle<00:02:21.950> brush<00:02:22.099> anything<00:02:22.489> but<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.700> was<00:02:22.879> rushed

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
paddle brush anything but I was rushed

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.380 
paddle brush anything but I was rushed
her<00:02:23.330> out<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.800> she<00:02:24.800> would<00:02:25.040> she<00:02:25.849> would<00:02:25.879> be<00:02:26.150> back

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
her out and she would she would be back

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.290 
her out and she would she would be back
to<00:02:26.599> normal<00:02:26.720> should<00:02:27.080> be<00:02:27.200> ok<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.700> she<00:02:29.150> did

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
to normal should be ok but she did

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.089 
to normal should be ok but she did
tangled<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.260> guess<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.650> has<00:02:30.769> something<00:02:30.800> to

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
tangled and I guess it has something to

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.940 
tangled and I guess it has something to
her<00:02:31.280> being<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:31.819> soft<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.680> being<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:33.890> long<00:02:34.180> um<00:02:35.950> a

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
her being so soft and being so long um a

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.190 
her being so soft and being so long um a
lot<00:02:37.130> of<00:02:37.280> criticism<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.900> took<00:02:39.049> me

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
lot of criticism is that it took me

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.170 
lot of criticism is that it took me
forever<00:02:39.349> to<00:02:39.920> figure<00:02:40.250> out<00:02:40.549> and<00:02:40.879> this<00:02:41.000> is

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
forever to figure out and this is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.059 
forever to figure out and this is
something<00:02:41.269> personal<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.900> be<00:02:42.049> primitive<00:02:42.290> for

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
something personal to be primitive for

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.470 
something personal to be primitive for
ever<00:02:43.190> figure<00:02:43.519> out<00:02:43.580> how<00:02:43.760> when<00:02:43.940> is<00:02:44.030> where<00:02:44.239> hurt

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
ever figure out how when is where hurt

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.860 
ever figure out how when is where hurt
so<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.780> guess<00:02:45.140> that's<00:02:45.319> just<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.650> personal<00:02:45.890> team

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
so I guess that's just a personal team

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.210 
so I guess that's just a personal team
figuring<00:02:47.870> out<00:02:47.989> how<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.260> want<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.650> stop<00:02:48.950> her

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
figuring out how you want to stop her

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.330 
figuring out how you want to stop her
and<00:02:49.280> where<00:02:49.579> her<00:02:50.170> originally<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.200> had<00:02:51.410> her<00:02:51.980> in

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and where her originally I had her in

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.949 
and where her originally I had her in
the<00:02:53.150> middle<00:02:53.590> apart<00:02:54.590> in<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.829> middle<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.519> just

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
the middle apart in the middle and just

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.210 
the middle apart in the middle and just
imagine<00:02:56.959> how<00:02:57.049> that<00:02:57.260> would<00:02:57.470> look<00:02:57.530> she<00:02:58.069> has

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
imagine how that would look she has

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.809 
imagine how that would look she has
absolutely<00:02:58.519> no<00:02:58.940> way<00:02:59.150> so<00:03:00.190> while<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:01.370> was<00:03:01.549> in<00:03:01.730> the

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
absolutely no way so while I was in the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.509 
absolutely no way so while I was in the
middle<00:03:01.970> anyway<00:03:02.450> i<00:03:02.660> don't<00:03:02.900> know<00:03:03.019> but<00:03:03.650> i<00:03:03.980> finally

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
middle anyway i don't know but i finally

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.789 
middle anyway i don't know but i finally
decided<00:03:04.849> to<00:03:05.269> work<00:03:05.360> her<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.750> side<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.380> it

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
decided to work her to the side and it

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.190 
decided to work her to the side and it
works<00:03:07.130> out<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.269> just<00:03:08.450> took<00:03:08.599> me<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.840> minute<00:03:09.110> to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
works out so it just took me a minute to

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.650 
works out so it just took me a minute to
figure<00:03:09.709> out<00:03:10.370> how<00:03:10.549> when<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.849> wear<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.209> was<00:03:11.390> my

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
figure out how when to wear that was my

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.960 
figure out how when to wear that was my

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
with the curl pattern so maybe maybe

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.330 
with the curl pattern so maybe maybe
it's<00:05:16.580> making<00:05:17.210> her<00:05:17.539> oh<00:05:17.570> this<00:05:17.810> one<00:05:17.990> is<00:05:18.020> up<00:05:18.259> to<00:05:18.440> 380
