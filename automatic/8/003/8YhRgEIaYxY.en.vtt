wanted to do one more video of Brady

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.080 
wanted to do one more video of Brady
because<00:00:17.730> today's<00:00:18.360> the<00:00:18.689> day<00:00:19.520> he<00:00:20.520> has<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.939> go

because today's the day he has to go

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.920 
because today's the day he has to go
back<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> u.s.<00:00:22.259> to<00:00:22.560> get<00:00:22.710> his<00:00:22.860> hair<00:00:23.099> done<00:00:23.930> so

yeah everything's a little bit hectic

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.780 
yeah everything's a little bit hectic
with<00:03:26.430> packing<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.209> everything<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.790> have

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
with packing and everything and I have

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.400 
with packing and everything and I have
packed<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.270> babies<00:03:30.600> away<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:31.170> I'm<00:03:31.230> really

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
packed the babies away and I'm really

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.199 
packed the babies away and I'm really
bad<00:03:31.680> at<00:03:31.709> keeping<00:03:31.980> them<00:03:32.370> packed<00:03:32.580> away<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.820> keep

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
bad at keeping them packed away I keep

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.840 
bad at keeping them packed away I keep
unpacking<00:03:33.510> them<00:03:33.930> again<00:03:34.430> not<00:03:35.430> something<00:03:35.790> I

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
unpacking them again not something I

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.430 
unpacking them again not something I
recommend<00:03:35.970> when<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.480> try<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.690> actually<00:03:36.900> pack

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
recommend when you try to actually pack

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.380 
recommend when you try to actually pack
and<00:03:37.650> move<00:03:37.830> is<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.580> unpack<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.060> things<00:03:39.239> you've

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
and move is to unpack the things you've

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.540 
and move is to unpack the things you've
already<00:03:39.510> packed<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.020> bit<00:03:40.170> yeah<00:03:41.100> they<00:03:41.310> are<00:03:41.430> the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
already packed a bit yeah they are the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.449 
already packed a bit yeah they are the
same<00:03:41.730> plastic<00:03:41.940> crates<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:42.720> I<00:03:43.020> can<00:03:43.410> pack<00:03:44.250> and

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
same plastic crates so I can pack and

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.270 
same plastic crates so I can pack and
unpack<00:03:44.550> them<00:03:44.940> quite<00:03:45.120> easily<00:03:45.920> but<00:03:46.920> they<00:03:47.130> are

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
unpack them quite easily but they are

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.130 
unpack them quite easily but they are
going<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.700> have<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.120> stay<00:03:48.300> packed<00:03:48.600> probably

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
going to have to stay packed probably

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.500 
going to have to stay packed probably
now<00:03:50.000> yeah<00:03:51.000> moving<00:03:51.450> time<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.930> getting<00:03:52.200> close<00:03:52.590> so

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
now yeah moving time is getting close so

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.060 
now yeah moving time is getting close so
yeah<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.540> probably<00:03:54.840> won't<00:03:55.020> be<00:03:55.470> able<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.739> do<00:03:55.860> many

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
yeah I probably won't be able to do many

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.010 
yeah I probably won't be able to do many
videos<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.300> actually<00:03:57.630> haven't<00:03:57.900> had
