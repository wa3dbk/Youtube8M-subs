00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.460 

so<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.560> turned<00:00:02.070> out<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.490> be<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.760> culprit

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.470 
so this turned out to be the culprit

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.270 
so this turned out to be the culprit
this<00:00:04.470> overhang<00:00:05.130> that<00:00:05.160> goes<00:00:05.609> all<00:00:05.910> around<00:00:05.940> here

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.280 
this overhang that goes all around here

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.280 
this overhang that goes all around here
was<00:00:08.280> frayed<00:00:08.610> badly<00:00:09.330> there<00:00:09.480> was<00:00:09.599> bits<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.170> it

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
was frayed badly there was bits of it

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.430 
was frayed badly there was bits of it
sticking<00:00:10.740> into<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.580> fuel<00:00:11.820> flow<00:00:12.170> that<00:00:13.170> o-ring

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
sticking into the fuel flow that o-ring

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.910 
sticking into the fuel flow that o-ring
seats<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.429> check<00:00:14.849> ball<00:00:15.150> here<00:00:15.480> my<00:00:16.379> guess<00:00:16.440> that

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
seats this check ball here my guess that

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.580 
seats this check ball here my guess that
when<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.760> was<00:00:17.910> plugged<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.109> creating

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
when it was plugged in it was creating

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
when it was plugged in it was creating
enough<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.070> leak<00:00:20.279> or<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> blockage<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.270> it

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
enough of a leak or a blockage that it

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.259 
enough of a leak or a blockage that it
didn't<00:00:22.260> let<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> fuel<00:00:22.850> flow<00:00:23.850> through<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
didn't let the fuel flow through the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.920 
didn't let the fuel flow through the
hose<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> let's<00:00:26.430> take<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> walk<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
hose so let's take a walk out to the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.900 
hose so let's take a walk out to the
outside<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.039> I'll<00:00:29.130> show<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.609> little<00:00:29.820> bit

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
outside and I'll show you a little bit

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.049 
outside and I'll show you a little bit
more<00:00:33.200> it<00:00:34.370> deteriorated<00:00:35.370> quite<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:35.940> it

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
more it deteriorated quite a bit and it

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.940 
more it deteriorated quite a bit and it
wasn't<00:00:36.239> making<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.660> good<00:00:36.870> seal<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.469> that's<00:00:37.680> why

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
wasn't making a good seal so that's why

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.720 
wasn't making a good seal so that's why
I<00:00:37.980> couldn't<00:00:38.670> fill<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.390> fuel<00:00:39.570> hose<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:41.340> I've

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
I couldn't fill the fuel hose so I've

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.690 
I couldn't fill the fuel hose so I've
put<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> good<00:00:43.440> fitting<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.280> other<00:00:44.430> end

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
put the good fitting on the other end

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.790 
put the good fitting on the other end
and<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.120> pumps<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.719> fine<00:00:47.450> using<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.800> pump

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and it pumps just fine using this pump

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.240 
and it pumps just fine using this pump
just<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.700> standard<00:00:51.090> pump<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.780> rough<00:00:52.250> priming

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
just a standard pump for rough priming

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.660 
just a standard pump for rough priming
the<00:00:53.340> fuel<00:00:53.550> line<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.829> can<00:00:55.829> pump<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.219> fuel<00:00:56.460> line

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the fuel line I can pump this fuel line

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.189 
the fuel line I can pump this fuel line
now<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> attached<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.989> gas<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.530> and

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
now with it attached to the gas can and

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.080 
now with it attached to the gas can and
works<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.289> fine<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.250> my<00:01:02.370> prime<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.030> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
works just fine I get my prime up and I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.469 
works just fine I get my prime up and I
think<00:01:03.329> that'll<00:01:03.570> fix<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.220> now<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.790> my

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.289 

adaptation<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.689> didn't<00:01:10.680> want<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.130> carry<00:01:12.090> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
adaptation I didn't want to carry a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.760 
adaptation I didn't want to carry a
whole<00:01:12.479> bunch<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> fuel<00:01:13.020> around<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.560> me<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
whole bunch of fuel around with me and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.109 
whole bunch of fuel around with me and
particularly<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.310> didn't<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.640> those<00:01:14.850> big

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
particularly I didn't like those big

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.450 
particularly I didn't like those big
clumsy<00:01:15.600> fuel<00:01:16.409> tanks<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.009> sit<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
clumsy fuel tanks that sit on the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.690 
clumsy fuel tanks that sit on the
cockpit<00:01:17.759> floor<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> made<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.920> small

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
cockpit floor so I made up this small

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.550 
cockpit floor so I made up this small
fuel<00:01:21.570> tank<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.040> regular<00:01:25.520> 1.25<00:01:26.520> gallon

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
fuel tank out of a regular 1.25 gallon

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.640 
fuel tank out of a regular 1.25 gallon
what's<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.890> 5<00:01:29.189> liter<00:01:29.430> tank<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:31.049> put<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
what's it's a 5 liter tank and I put a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.640 
what's it's a 5 liter tank and I put a
vent<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> using<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.939> simple<00:01:34.130> valve<00:01:35.130> from<00:01:35.610> a

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
vent on it using a simple valve from a

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.460 
vent on it using a simple valve from a
tire<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.939> from<00:01:39.150> an<00:01:39.240> automotive<00:01:39.630> wheel<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
tire that is from an automotive wheel I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.039 
tire that is from an automotive wheel I
took<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.520> core<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.270> loosen<00:01:42.930> this

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
took the core out and I just loosen this

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.620 
took the core out and I just loosen this
up<00:01:43.250> when<00:01:44.250> I'm<00:01:44.340> out<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.759> boat<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.390> can

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
up when I'm out on the boat and I can

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.230 
up when I'm out on the boat and I can
seal<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.530> way<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.009> keep<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> fumes

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
seal it up this way to keep the fumes

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.039 
seal it up this way to keep the fumes
when<00:01:48.659> I'm<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:48.960> using<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.130> transporting<00:01:50.759> it

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
when I'm not using it or transporting it

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.060 
when I'm not using it or transporting it
and<00:01:52.049> what<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> did<00:01:52.439> was<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.829> got<00:01:52.979> some<00:01:53.369> fittings

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
and what I did was I got some fittings

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.060 
and what I did was I got some fittings
this<00:01:56.070> fitting<00:01:56.820> here<00:01:57.409> tank<00:01:58.409> fitting<00:01:58.680> is<00:02:00.920> set<00:02:01.920> up

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.830 
a female to mate up with it and it has a
barb<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.970> just<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:15.690> some<00:02:15.989> fuel<00:02:16.800> resistant

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
barb so I just got some fuel resistant

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.350 
barb so I just got some fuel resistant
tubing<00:02:18.840> made<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.560> for<00:02:19.770> my<00:02:19.890> pickup<00:02:20.280> i<00:02:20.520> took

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
tubing made that for my pickup i took

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.920 
tubing made that for my pickup i took
the<00:02:21.510> existing<00:02:21.950> mechanism<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.930> system

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
the existing mechanism of this system

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.589 
the existing mechanism of this system
and<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.620> drilled<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> hole<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:27.120> made<00:02:27.360> some

fuel filters and I'm an advocate of
filtering<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.060> fuel<00:03:00.360> as<00:03:00.510> much<00:03:00.720> as<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.200> so

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
running that it was fuel starvation

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.220 
running that it was fuel starvation
because<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.459> couldn't<00:03:17.790> fill<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:19.079> this

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
because I couldn't fill this and this

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190

getting<00:03:23.459> fuel<00:03:24.299> into<00:03:24.630> here<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.200> told<00:03:25.470> me

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
getting fuel into here so that told me

getting fuel into here so that told me
there<00:03:25.620> was<00:03:25.739> probably<00:03:26.100> something<00:03:26.400> wrong<00:03:26.730> from

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
here in and sure enough when I took it

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.099 
here in and sure enough when I took it
apart<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.700> was<00:03:29.850> evident<00:03:30.299> what<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.780> problem

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
apart it was evident what the problem

apart it was evident what the problem
was<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:32.430> there<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.670> is<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:33.239> thing<00:03:33.859> fits<00:03:34.859> right

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
was so there it is this thing fits right
