00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.889 

hi<00:00:01.770> my<00:00:02.129> name<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.310> Patrick<00:00:02.879> and<00:00:03.090> today<00:00:03.389> you're

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
hi my name is Patrick and today you're

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.619 
hi my name is Patrick and today you're
going<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.140> learn<00:00:04.200> how<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.549> replace<00:00:05.549> a

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:05.629 
going to learn how to replace a

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.240 
going to learn how to replace a
processor<00:00:06.629> this<00:00:06.839> is<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.020> Centrino<00:00:07.589> Intel

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
processor this is a Centrino Intel

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.790 
processor this is a Centrino Intel
processor<00:00:08.730> so<00:00:09.690> now<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.110> first<00:00:10.500> thing<00:00:10.679> you

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
processor so now the first thing you

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.950 
processor so now the first thing you
want<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.010> do<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.490> see<00:00:12.030> where<00:00:12.330> your<00:00:12.450> processor

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
want to do is see where your processor

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.680 
want to do is see where your processor
is<00:00:13.370> simply<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.580> will<00:00:14.700> be<00:00:14.849> under<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.299> stand

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
is simply it will be under the stand

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.990 
is simply it will be under the stand
because<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.920> need<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> fan<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.670> cool<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.940> down

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
because you need a fan to cool it down

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.760 
because you need a fan to cool it down
or<00:00:18.330> otherwise<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.289> going<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> fry<00:00:19.740> up

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
or otherwise it's just going to fry up

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.029 
or otherwise it's just going to fry up
so<00:00:20.760> now<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.720> should<00:00:21.750> have<00:00:22.080> little<00:00:22.260> wires<00:00:22.590> here

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
so now you should have little wires here

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.700 
so now you should have little wires here
at<00:00:23.130> these<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.750> this<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.050> connects<00:00:25.470> your

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
at these and this is what connects your

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.710 
at these and this is what connects your
fan<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.580> your<00:00:26.699> motherboard<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.330> makes<00:00:27.570> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
fan to your motherboard and makes it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.519 
fan to your motherboard and makes it
work<00:00:27.930> now<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.680> want<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> go<00:00:29.400> very<00:00:29.699> gently<00:00:30.060> and

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
work now you want to go very gently and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.920 
work now you want to go very gently and
unplug<00:00:31.529> these<00:00:31.800> don't<00:00:32.669> pull<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> wire<00:00:33.420> pull

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
unplug these don't pull on the wire pull

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.889 
unplug these don't pull on the wire pull
on<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.550> adapter<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.940> thing<00:00:36.239> nandi<00:00:36.840> is

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
on the adapter on this thing nandi is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.080 
on the adapter on this thing nandi is
because<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.219> could<00:00:38.430> disconnect<00:00:38.760> themselves

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
because they could disconnect themselves

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.959 
because they could disconnect themselves
from<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.010> don't<00:00:41.160> want<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.850> happen

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
from this you don't want that to happen

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.869 
from this you don't want that to happen
now<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.200> different<00:00:43.920> models<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.789> have

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
now on different models you have

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.940 
now on different models you have
different<00:00:45.239> ways<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.800> like

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
different ways but this one it's like

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.069 
different ways but this one it's like
two<00:00:47.219> old<00:00:47.250> levers<00:00:47.940> here<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.360> want<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> put<00:00:48.870> them

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
two old levers here you want to put them

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.819 
two old levers here you want to put them
up<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:50.309> go<00:00:50.579> release<00:00:51.449> pressure<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.230> then<00:00:52.710> you

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
up and go release pressure and then you

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.170 
up and go release pressure and then you
push<00:00:53.309> down<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:55.530> lift<00:00:56.039> these<00:00:56.730> little

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
push down and you lift these little

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.599 
push down and you lift these little
things<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.629> some<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.800> you'll<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
things up some will just you'll have to

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.209 
things up some will just you'll have to
push<00:00:59.820> down<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.090> then<00:01:00.390> put<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.350> that's<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
push down and then put it out that's in

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.149 
push down and then put it out that's in
another<00:01:02.489> video<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.270> hook<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.100> now<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
another video you can hook up now you

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.420 
another video you can hook up now you
want<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.549> push<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:05.939> there<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:07.020> those

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
want to push down there you see those

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.700 
want to push down there you see those
not<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.700> pushed<00:01:08.939> down<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:10.020> your

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
not to be pushed down then you have your

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.200 
not to be pushed down then you have your
fan<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:12.680> now<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.030> come

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
fan right here now you want this to come

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.510 
fan right here now you want this to come
out<00:01:17.330> now<00:01:18.330> here's<00:01:18.720> your<00:01:18.900> processor<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:20.250> this

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
out now here's your processor now this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.969 
out now here's your processor now this
is<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.970> most<00:01:21.210> fragile<00:01:21.689> part<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:22.740> whole

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
is the most fragile part of your whole

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.580 
is the most fragile part of your whole
computer<00:01:23.549> because<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.720> little<00:01:25.229> prongs

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
computer because you have little prongs

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.390 
computer because you have little prongs
on<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.130> these<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:27.270> things<00:01:28.070> this<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.369> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
on it these little things this one is a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.020 
on it these little things this one is a
bent<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.270> won't<00:01:30.720> work<00:01:31.579> because<00:01:32.579> these

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
bent one it won't work because these

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.249 
bent one it won't work because these
little<00:01:33.390> things<00:01:33.659> are<00:01:34.280> broken<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.930> you<00:01:36.930> need<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
little things are broken so you need to

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.450 
little things are broken so you need to
be<00:01:37.380> extremely<00:01:37.829> careful<00:01:38.729> when<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.270> use<00:01:39.299> this

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
be extremely careful when you use this

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.249 
be extremely careful when you use this
now<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:42.180> put<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.479> off<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.869> should<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
now to put it off you should have a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.289 
now to put it off you should have a
little<00:01:43.470> lever<00:01:43.649> on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.890> side<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.700> just

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
little lever on the side here you just

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
little lever on the side here you just
push<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:47.329> lift<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.540> up<00:01:48.630> very<00:01:48.990> gently<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
push that and lift it up very gently and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.700 
push that and lift it up very gently and
then<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.509> take<00:01:51.659> your<00:01:51.720> processor<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
then you just take your processor and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.240 
then you just take your processor and
there<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:55.590> an<00:01:55.799> Intel

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
there you go now this is an Intel

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.270 
there you go now this is an Intel
processor<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:57.450> said<00:01:57.630> before<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:58.259> century<00:01:59.130> no

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
processor it said before a century no

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.359 
processor it said before a century no
2.4<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.320> now<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.829> little<00:02:01.890> arrow

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
2.4 and now you have this little arrow

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.260 
2.4 and now you have this little arrow
there<00:02:03.110> that<00:02:04.110> means<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.710> goes<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.969> pot

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
there that means it goes in this pot

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.080 
there that means it goes in this pot
because<00:02:07.020> there's<00:02:07.259> no<00:02:07.409> holes<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.099> if<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.819> turn

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
because there's no holes and if you turn

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.720 
because there's no holes and if you turn
on<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.959> other<00:02:10.050> side<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:11.069> see<00:02:11.280> there's<00:02:11.550> no

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
on the other side you see there's no

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.559 
on the other side you see there's no
problem

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
problem

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.910 
problem
so<00:02:13.079> they<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:14.280> little<00:02:14.790> arrow<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:15.510> these<00:02:15.920> no

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so they have little arrow so these no

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.750 
so they have little arrow so these no
case<00:02:17.219> you<00:02:17.489> should<00:02:17.700> touch<00:02:18.000> those<00:02:19.189> now<00:02:20.189> to<00:02:20.400> put

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
case you should touch those now to put

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.699 
case you should touch those now to put
it<00:02:20.879> back<00:02:21.090> there<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.260> go

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
it back there you go

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.119 
it back there you go
usually<00:02:23.609> you'll<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.819> paste<00:02:24.390> :<00:02:24.870> pace<00:02:25.049> to<00:02:25.379> help

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
usually you'll have paste : pace to help

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.880 
usually you'll have paste : pace to help
cooling<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:27.450> put<00:02:27.629> that<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:27.989> top<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.290> here

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
cooling it just put that on top of here

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.339 
cooling it just put that on top of here
just<00:02:29.609> a<00:02:29.730> little<00:02:30.090> bit<00:02:30.239> not<00:02:30.659> too<00:02:30.689> much<00:02:31.079> don't

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
just a little bit not too much don't

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.179 
just a little bit not too much don't
exaggerate

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
exaggerate

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.259 
exaggerate
and<00:02:32.909> now<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.150> put<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.750> back<00:02:34.049> on<00:02:34.409> and<00:02:35.269> follow

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
and now you put this back on and follow

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.379 
and now you put this back on and follow
every<00:02:36.959> single<00:02:37.560> other<00:02:37.829> step<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.579> showed<00:02:39.180> you

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
every single other step I showed you

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:45.289 
every single other step I showed you
before<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.139> put<00:02:40.349> ease<00:02:41.239> back<00:02:44.090> this<00:02:45.090> is

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
before it so you put ease back this is

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.559 
before it so you put ease back this is
the<00:02:45.510> tricky<00:02:45.840> part<00:02:46.109> is<00:02:46.549> to<00:02:47.549> be<00:02:47.670> very<00:02:47.970> careful

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
the tricky part is to be very careful

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.119 
the tricky part is to be very careful
because<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.319> still<00:02:49.560> got<00:02:49.709> your<00:02:49.920> processor

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
because you still got your processor

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.470 
because you still got your processor
under<00:02:50.639> there<00:02:51.139> so<00:02:52.139> there<00:02:52.799> you<00:02:52.950> go

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
under there so there you go

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.890 
under there so there you go
put<00:02:54.480> those<00:02:54.659> now<00:02:55.379> you<00:02:56.010> need<00:02:56.189> to<00:02:56.340> be<00:02:56.489> at<00:02:56.900> Terral

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
put those now you need to be at Terral

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.110 
put those now you need to be at Terral
because<00:02:58.139> if<00:02:58.349> this<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.829> not<00:02:58.950> connected<00:02:59.489> well

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
because if this is not connected well

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.789 
because if this is not connected well
it's<00:03:00.480> probably<00:03:00.720> going<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.049> fry<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.590> just

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
it's probably going to fry so it just

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.129 
it's probably going to fry so it just
connected<00:03:02.220> back<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.870> close<00:03:03.870> up<00:03:04.019> your

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
connected back and close up your

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:05.869 
connected back and close up your
computer<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.680> there<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:04.950> go<00:03:05.069> a<00:03:05.310> very

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
computer and there you go a very

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.960 
computer and there you go a very
important<00:03:06.629> note<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:07.079> this<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:07.980> need<00:03:08.129> to<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.340> to

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
important note on this you need to be to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.879 
important note on this you need to be to
have<00:03:09.060> your<00:03:09.329> computer<00:03:09.510> totally<00:03:10.500> disconnected

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
have your computer totally disconnected

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.640 
have your computer totally disconnected
from<00:03:11.389> any<00:03:12.389> power<00:03:13.169> source

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
from any power source

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.429 
from any power source
so<00:03:13.829> I'm<00:03:14.189> plug<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.000> close<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.659> up<00:03:15.750> everything

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
so I'm plug it close it up everything

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.729 
so I'm plug it close it up everything
and<00:03:17.310> that's<00:03:17.430> all
