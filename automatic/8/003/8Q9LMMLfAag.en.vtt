for<00:00:44.670> six<00:00:44.969> burns<00:00:45.410> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.710> air<00:00:46.800> refractory

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
for six burns you can see air refractory

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.299 
for six burns you can see air refractory
cement<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.239> starting<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.039> melt<00:00:50.039> away<00:00:51.260> our

model a tire rim has gone from that to

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
model a tire rim has gone from that to
that<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:05.180> there<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.450> where<00:01:07.049> we're<00:01:07.260> at<00:01:08.000> with<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that so there is where we're at with the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.640 
that so there is where we're at with the
usage<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:10.040> this<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.280> six<00:01:11.549> burns<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.330> far<00:01:12.650> now

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
usage of this with six burns so far now

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.730 
usage of this with six burns so far now
we<00:01:14.420> can<00:01:15.420> still<00:01:15.659> probably<00:01:15.840> use<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.290> lid<00:01:16.530> for

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
we can still probably use this lid for

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.920 
we can still probably use this lid for
maybe<00:01:16.890> two<00:01:17.130> more<00:01:17.310> burns<00:01:17.610> which<00:01:18.570> we're<00:01:18.840> going

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
maybe two more burns which we're going

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.749 
maybe two more burns which we're going
to<00:01:18.990> hopefully<00:01:19.500> accomplish<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.340> some<00:01:20.520> point

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
to hopefully accomplish at some point

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
to hopefully accomplish at some point
soon<00:01:21.030> I've<00:01:21.990> got<00:01:22.259> more<00:01:22.500> borax<00:01:24.049> then<00:01:25.049> here's<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
soon I've got more borax then here's the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.969 
soon I've got more borax then here's the
what<00:01:26.340> we've<00:01:26.490> got<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> kiln<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.330> far<00:01:27.710> as<00:01:28.710> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
what we've got in the kiln so far as you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.429 
what we've got in the kiln so far as you
can<00:01:29.070> see<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> fire<00:01:29.820> bricks<00:01:30.150> are<00:01:30.390> holding<00:01:31.290> up

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
can see the fire bricks are holding up

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.060 
can see the fire bricks are holding up
well<00:01:31.680> we've<00:01:32.670> got<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.090> melted<00:01:33.540> from<00:01:34.070> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
well we've got a little melted from the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.090 
well we've got a little melted from the
lid<00:01:35.689> that<00:01:36.689> came<00:01:37.110> down<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.409> melted<00:01:37.829> down

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
lid that came down and melted down

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.880 
lid that came down and melted down
across<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> refractory

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
across here you can see the refractory

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.340 
across here you can see the refractory
cement<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.640> yeah<00:01:42.090> refractory<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.020> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
cement in here yeah refractory that you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
cement in here yeah refractory that you
know<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:43.920> magnesite<00:01:44.790> all

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
know what that is that's magnesite all

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.999 
know what that is that's magnesite all
that<00:01:45.720> white<00:01:45.899> stuff<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.409> not<00:01:46.560> burnt

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that white stuff that's not burnt

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.190 
that white stuff that's not burnt
that's<00:01:47.820> magnesite<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.960> where<00:01:49.110> that's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that's magnesite you know where that's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.370 
that's magnesite you know where that's
at<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:49.979> from<00:01:50.220> Peggy<00:01:50.460> Ann's<00:01:50.790> mine<00:01:51.380> well

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
at that's from Peggy Ann's mine well

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.139 
at that's from Peggy Ann's mine well
it's<00:01:52.710> not<00:01:52.829> actually<00:01:53.250> from<00:01:53.460> Peggy<00:01:53.700> Ann's<00:01:53.909> mind

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it's not actually from Peggy Ann's mind

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.109 
it's not actually from Peggy Ann's mind
but<00:01:54.360> Peggy<00:01:54.810> Anne's<00:01:55.049> mind<00:01:55.259> has<00:01:55.619> all<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
but Peggy Anne's mind has all that

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.050 
but Peggy Anne's mind has all that
refractory<00:01:58.340> magnesite<00:01:59.369> right<00:01:59.549> there<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.939> it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
refractory magnesite right there in it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.819 
refractory magnesite right there in it
now<00:02:00.890> sometimes<00:02:01.890> when<00:02:02.189> we<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.490> our<00:02:02.640> own<00:02:02.670> little

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
now sometimes when we get our own little

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.929 
now sometimes when we get our own little
recipe<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:05.070> we'll<00:02:05.369> be<00:02:05.460> able<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.640> make<00:02:05.759> our

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
recipe going we'll be able to make our

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.639 
recipe going we'll be able to make our
own<00:02:06.259> so<00:02:07.789> now<00:02:08.789> fire<00:02:09.599> bricks<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.050> yielded<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
own so now fire bricks have yielded the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.390 
own so now fire bricks have yielded the
little<00:02:11.190> ware<00:02:11.450> which<00:02:12.450> makes<00:02:13.140> me

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
little ware which makes me

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.380 
little ware which makes me
think<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:13.670> I'm<00:02:13.790> gonna<00:02:13.909> have<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.120> make<00:02:14.239> my

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
think that I'm gonna have to make my

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.250 
think that I'm gonna have to make my

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
next lid out of these and then hold them

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.470 
next lid out of these and then hold them
together<00:02:21.470> somehow<00:02:22.220> some<00:02:22.670> way<00:02:22.700> with<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.060> little

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
that a blast furnace around they might

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.649 
that a blast furnace around they might
want<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.739> smash<00:03:13.549> it<00:03:13.730> up<00:03:13.849> and<00:03:14.060> view<00:03:14.389> what's<00:03:14.540> in

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
want to smash it up and view what's in

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
the bottom of it now you can see that

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.650 
the bottom of it now you can see that
we've<00:03:17.030> got<00:03:17.239> two<00:03:17.500> down<00:03:18.500> here<00:03:19.269> I've<00:03:20.269> got<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> lot

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
of melted glass a lot of slag or our

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.800 
of melted glass a lot of slag or our
crucibles<00:03:27.470> warming<00:03:27.799> up<00:03:27.919> well<00:03:28.359> so<00:03:29.359> you<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.599> see

crucibles warming up well so you can see
there's<00:03:30.049> just<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:31.459> little<00:03:32.150> bit<00:03:32.389> of<00:03:32.510> slag<00:03:33.500> in<00:03:33.709> the

there's just a little bit of slag in the
bottom<00:03:34.159> man<00:03:35.079> probably<00:03:36.079> just<00:03:36.290> glass<00:03:36.500> there

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
bottom man probably just glass there

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.349 
bottom man probably just glass there
might<00:03:37.310> be<00:03:37.340> some<00:03:37.609> metal<00:03:37.730> in<00:03:37.909> it<00:03:38.060> who<00:03:38.180> knows

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
might be some metal in it who knows

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.640 
might be some metal in it who knows
doesn't<00:03:38.840> look<00:03:38.900> like<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.139> thought<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:42.049> let's

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
refractory cement I just had that laying

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.860 
refractory cement I just had that laying
around<00:04:07.790> so<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.090> didn't<00:04:08.269> have<00:04:08.359> anything<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.690> that

magnetic<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.789> don't<00:04:54.599> think<00:04:54.719> I<00:04:54.810> did<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:55.080> get<00:04:55.169> it<00:04:55.409> I

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:55.529 
magnetic I don't think I did to get it I

magnetic I don't think I did to get it I
didn't<00:04:56.009> get<00:04:56.069> hot<00:04:56.310> enough<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:57.120> there<00:04:57.960> was<00:04:58.080> it

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
didn't get hot enough and there was it

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.309 
didn't get hot enough and there was it
was<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.680> wrong<00:04:58.889> type<00:04:59.279> of<00:05:00.020> flux

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
was the wrong type of flux

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.890 
was the wrong type of flux
now<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.009> third<00:05:02.340> pour<00:05:02.639> was<00:05:02.909> a<00:05:02.939> mixture<00:05:03.330> of<00:05:03.449> a

that other flux to see if I could do
that<00:05:13.830> now<00:05:14.009> it<00:05:14.069> was<00:05:14.159> a<00:05:14.189> mistake<00:05:15.050> my<00:05:16.050> bad<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:18.060> no

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
didn't get it I didn't let it get hot

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.860 
didn't get it I didn't let it get hot
enough<00:05:26.279> that's<00:05:26.819> what<00:05:27.029> it<00:05:27.120> was<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.449> didn't<00:05:27.750> let

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
enough that's what it was I didn't let

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.459 
enough that's what it was I didn't let
it<00:05:27.930> get<00:05:28.139> hot<00:05:28.169> enough<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:29.449> by<00:05:30.449> not<00:05:31.080> waiting

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469 
it get hot enough and by not waiting

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.579 
it get hot enough and by not waiting
long<00:05:31.889> enough<00:05:31.919> it<00:05:32.490> was<00:05:32.969> boiling<00:05:33.330> and<00:05:33.900> it<00:05:34.440> had<00:05:34.560> a

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:34.589 
long enough it was boiling and it had a

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.730 
long enough it was boiling and it had a
nice<00:05:35.039> rolling<00:05:35.819> boil<00:05:36.360> and<00:05:37.229> I<00:05:37.319> thought<00:05:37.560> maybe

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
nice rolling boil and I thought maybe

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.350 
nice rolling boil and I thought maybe
that<00:05:37.860> was<00:05:38.099> just<00:05:38.310> perfect<00:05:38.520> have<00:05:38.879> a<00:05:38.909> few<00:05:39.150> little

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
that was just perfect have a few little

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.149 
that was just perfect have a few little
Bob<00:05:39.900> spikes<00:05:40.440> in<00:05:40.710> it<00:05:41.000> bubbles<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.330> hot<00:05:42.509> stuff

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
Bob spikes in it bubbles and hot stuff

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.980 
Bob spikes in it bubbles and hot stuff
but<00:05:44.159> I<00:05:44.370> didn't<00:05:45.180> wait<00:05:45.270> long<00:05:45.330> enough<00:05:45.509> I<00:05:45.870> should

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
but I didn't wait long enough I should

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.450 
but I didn't wait long enough I should
have<00:05:46.229> waited<00:05:46.289> another<00:05:46.589> 10<00:05:46.889> minutes<00:05:47.069> because

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
have waited another 10 minutes because

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.909 
have waited another 10 minutes because
it<00:05:47.550> has<00:05:47.669> to<00:05:47.819> has<00:05:48.719> to<00:05:48.870> get<00:05:49.050> a<00:05:49.080> nice<00:05:49.409> smooth

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
it has to has to get a nice smooth

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.529 
it has to has to get a nice smooth
placidity<00:05:50.839> to<00:05:51.839> like<00:05:51.990> a<00:05:52.020> little<00:05:52.259> lake<00:05:52.529> and<00:05:52.979> that

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
placidity to like a little lake and that

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.619 
placidity to like a little lake and that
is<00:05:54.539> when<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.589> metals<00:05:56.180> settle<00:05:57.180> down<00:05:57.360> to<00:05:57.599> the

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:57.629 
is when the metals settle down to the

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:58.249 
is when the metals settle down to the
bottom

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
bottom

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.800 
bottom
now<00:05:58.889> when<00:05:59.550> the<00:05:59.669> metals<00:06:00.150> settle<00:06:00.479> down<00:06:00.599> the

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
now when the metals settle down the

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.749 
now when the metals settle down the
bottom<00:06:01.520> yeah

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
bottom yeah

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.869 
bottom yeah
wait<00:06:02.879> about<00:06:02.969> five<00:06:03.240> minutes<00:06:03.539> in<00:06:04.110> your<00:06:04.139> pour<00:06:04.529> I

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:04.879 
wait about five minutes in your pour I

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.040 
wait about five minutes in your pour I
didn't<00:06:05.879> wait<00:06:05.969> long<00:06:06.000> enough<00:06:06.240> they<00:06:06.599> were<00:06:06.659> still

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
didn't wait long enough they were still

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.600 
didn't wait long enough they were still
rolling<00:06:07.409> around<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:07.979> all<00:06:08.069> that<00:06:08.279> glass<00:06:08.580> and

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
rolling around and all that glass and

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.019 
rolling around and all that glass and
the<00:06:09.000> borax<00:06:09.509> and<00:06:10.610> so<00:06:11.960> by<00:06:12.960> doing<00:06:13.020> that<00:06:13.669> we<00:06:14.669> poured

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
the borax and so by doing that we poured

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.469 
the borax and so by doing that we poured
it<00:06:15.180> and<00:06:15.479> poured<00:06:16.050> it<00:06:16.139> on<00:06:16.229> top<00:06:16.469> a<00:06:16.500> second<00:06:17.039> pour

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
it and poured it on top a second pour

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.179 
it and poured it on top a second pour
that's<00:06:18.479> what<00:06:18.900> I<00:06:18.930> did<00:06:19.199> wrong<00:06:19.439> it<00:06:19.710> poured<00:06:19.979> on<00:06:20.159> top

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
that's what I did wrong it poured on top

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:21.550 
that's what I did wrong it poured on top
the<00:06:20.400> second<00:06:20.669> pours

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
the second pours

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.290 
the second pours
class<00:06:21.860> I<00:06:22.160> didn't<00:06:22.370> stand<00:06:22.610> clean<00:06:22.910> out<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.120> glass

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
class I didn't stand clean out the glass

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.390 
class I didn't stand clean out the glass
I<00:06:23.480> just<00:06:23.630> pour<00:06:23.780> to<00:06:23.870> run<00:06:23.960> up<00:06:24.100> mistake<00:06:25.100> didn't

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
I just pour to run up mistake didn't

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.640 
I just pour to run up mistake didn't
force<00:06:25.760> pour<00:06:26.440> forth<00:06:27.440> pour<00:06:27.680> was<00:06:29.410> remelt<00:06:30.410> in<00:06:30.560> the

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
force pour forth pour was remelt in the

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.870 
force pour forth pour was remelt in the
glass<00:06:30.919> that<00:06:32.169> we'd<00:06:33.250> mistakenly<00:06:34.250> poured

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
glass that we'd mistakenly poured

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.190 
glass that we'd mistakenly poured
thinking<00:06:35.210> it<00:06:35.300> was<00:06:35.419> all<00:06:35.540> gonna<00:06:35.720> work<00:06:36.020> together

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
thinking it was all gonna work together

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.530 
thinking it was all gonna work together
because<00:06:36.620> of<00:06:36.860> I<00:06:37.220> didn't<00:06:37.940> have<00:06:38.030> the<00:06:38.120> right<00:06:38.210> flux

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
because of I didn't have the right flux

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.500 
because of I didn't have the right flux
for<00:06:38.810> burn<00:06:39.470> number<00:06:39.770> three<00:06:40.030> for<00:06:41.030> number<00:06:41.210> two<00:06:41.360> and

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
for burn number three for number two and

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.909 
for burn number three for number two and
three<00:06:41.690> we're<00:06:41.960> totally<00:06:42.260> separate<00:06:42.710> minds

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
three we're totally separate minds

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.690 
three we're totally separate minds
totally<00:06:43.820> different<00:06:44.150> fluxes<00:06:44.450> yeah<00:06:45.200> that's

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:45.700 
totally different fluxes yeah that's

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.520 
totally different fluxes yeah that's
yeah<00:06:46.700> different<00:06:47.240> fluxes<00:06:47.690> for<00:06:48.230> different

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
yeah different fluxes for different

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:57.000 
yeah different fluxes for different
minds<00:06:48.889> and<00:06:49.480> art<00:06:50.480> it<00:06:50.870> is<00:06:51.230> it<00:06:51.680> is<00:06:51.950> an<00:06:52.190> art<00:06:55.780> so

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
minds and art it is it is an art so

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.820 
minds and art it is it is an art so
number<00:06:58.010> four<00:06:58.220> was<00:06:58.370> fail<00:06:58.639> number<00:06:59.060> five<00:06:59.830> what's

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
number four was fail number five what's

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:08.830 
number four was fail number five what's
the<00:07:00.950> success<00:07:05.260> and<00:07:06.260> that<00:07:06.590> was<00:07:07.389> the<00:07:08.389> two<00:07:08.570> pores

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
the success and that was the two pores

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.120 
the success and that was the two pores
that<00:07:08.990> we<00:07:09.080> did<00:07:09.229> recently<00:07:11.680> one<00:07:12.680> was<00:07:12.830> a<00:07:12.860> fail

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
that we did recently one was a fail

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.710 
that we did recently one was a fail
first<00:07:13.400> one<00:07:13.550> was<00:07:13.669> a<00:07:13.729> fail<00:07:13.910> because<00:07:14.030> we<00:07:14.150> remelted

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
first one was a fail because we remelted

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.750 
first one was a fail because we remelted
the<00:07:14.780> glass<00:07:14.960> then<00:07:15.830> we<00:07:15.979> had<00:07:16.100> to<00:07:16.220> burn<00:07:16.340> two<00:07:16.550> cuz<00:07:16.669> of

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
the glass then we had to burn two cuz of

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.190 
the glass then we had to burn two cuz of
kiln<00:07:16.970> was<00:07:17.090> hot<00:07:17.270> so<00:07:17.450> we<00:07:17.540> put<00:07:17.720> in<00:07:17.840> what<00:07:17.960> we<00:07:17.990> knew

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.200 
kiln was hot so we put in what we knew

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.190 
kiln was hot so we put in what we knew
would<00:07:18.320> work<00:07:18.940> and<00:07:19.940> we<00:07:20.270> got<00:07:20.419> a<00:07:20.450> good<00:07:20.630> bar<00:07:20.840> so

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.200 
would work and we got a good bar so

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.260 
would work and we got a good bar so
hopefully<00:07:25.870> this<00:07:26.870> next<00:07:27.110> pour<00:07:28.060> we'll<00:07:29.060> be<00:07:29.180> able

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270 
hopefully this next pour we'll be able

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.260 
hopefully this next pour we'll be able
to<00:07:29.419> continue<00:07:29.660> doing<00:07:29.990> overdoing<00:07:30.350> and<00:07:31.150> make<00:07:32.150> it

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
to continue doing overdoing and make it

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.830 
to continue doing overdoing and make it
work<00:07:33.220> now<00:07:34.220> I<00:07:34.520> know<00:07:35.320> wait<00:07:36.320> until<00:07:37.840> what's

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 
work now I know wait until what's

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.570 
work now I know wait until what's
