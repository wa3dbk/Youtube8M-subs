of<00:00:12.990> course<00:00:13.259> here<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.549> today's<00:00:14.880> episode<00:00:15.059> as<00:00:15.570> you

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
of course here on today's episode as you

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.510 
of course here on today's episode as you
can<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:15.960> there's<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.230> partnership<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.949> today's

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
can see there's a partnership on today's

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.790 
can see there's a partnership on today's
episode<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.420> Gravitron<00:00:18.960> starship

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
episode we have the Gravitron starship

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.570 
episode we have the Gravitron starship
3000<00:00:20.900> zero-gravity<00:00:21.900> thing<00:00:22.590> whatever<00:00:23.430> you

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
3000 zero-gravity thing whatever you

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.700 
3000 zero-gravity thing whatever you
want<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.850> call<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.210> arms<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.199> thing<00:00:25.529> that

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
want to call it arms but it's thing that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.580 
want to call it arms but it's thing that
spins<00:00:26.039> really<00:00:26.550> really<00:00:26.880> fast<00:00:27.230> of<00:00:28.230> course<00:00:28.500> you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
spins really really fast of course you

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.230 
spins really really fast of course you
can<00:00:28.710> make<00:00:28.830> them<00:00:28.949> faster<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.460> them<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.060> we

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
can make them faster with them and we

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 
can make them faster with them and we
also<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> topspin<00:00:31.340> I'll<00:00:32.340> start<00:00:32.790> with

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
also have the topspin I'll start with

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.220 
also have the topspin I'll start with
the<00:00:32.969> top<00:00:33.000> system<00:00:33.420> because<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.840> not<00:00:33.989> really

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the top system because it's not really

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.900 
the top system because it's not really
that<00:00:34.260> hard<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.800> basically<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.520> like

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
that hard so basically it's just like

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.540 
that hard so basically it's just like
one<00:00:36.690> rotating<00:00:37.230> block<00:00:37.469> which<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.070> over<00:00:38.370> there

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
one rotating block which is over there

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.810 
one rotating block which is over there
just<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.809> thing<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> things<00:00:41.219> things

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
just on the thing and things things

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.540 
just on the thing and things things
around<00:00:43.879> with<00:00:44.879> totally<00:00:45.870> idiotic<00:00:46.550> description

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
around with totally idiotic description

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.540 
around with totally idiotic description
here<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.300> go<00:00:48.450> here's<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> Gravitron<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.160> also

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
here we go here's a Gravitron it is also

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.910 
here we go here's a Gravitron it is also
really<00:00:51.090> easy<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.809> both<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.649> rides

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
really easy to do both of these rides

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.479 
really easy to do both of these rides
don't<00:00:53.550> require<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.969> lot<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.960> rotator<00:00:55.860> block<00:00:56.219> no

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
don't require a lot one rotator block no

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.910 
don't require a lot one rotator block no
really<00:00:57.239> no<00:00:57.480> other<00:00:57.690> bread<00:00:58.050> still<00:00:58.320> needed<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
really no other bread still needed to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.209 
really no other bread still needed to
urea<00:00:59.300> what<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.420> does<00:01:00.629> basically<00:01:01.100> starts<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
urea what it does basically starts a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.090 
urea what it does basically starts a
really<00:01:02.820> slow<00:01:03.090> acceleration<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.680> starts

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
really slow acceleration and it starts

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.760 
really slow acceleration and it starts
going<00:01:05.280> really<00:01:05.640> fast<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.409> think<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
going really fast I think it's at a

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.550 
going really fast I think it's at a
hundred<00:01:08.189> acceleration<00:01:09.060> right<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.530> which<00:01:10.530> is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
hundred acceleration right now which is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.520 
hundred acceleration right now which is
its<00:01:10.860> max<00:01:11.130> acceleration<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.150> yeah<00:01:12.380> that's<00:01:13.380> not

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
its max acceleration so yeah that's not

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.620 
its max acceleration so yeah that's not
really<00:01:13.799> hard<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.460> rotation<00:01:14.909> block<00:01:15.330> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
really hard it's one rotation block of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.359 
really hard it's one rotation block of
course<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.350> I'll<00:01:16.500> give<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.830> guys<00:01:16.979> two

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
course so here I'll give you guys two

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.120 
course so here I'll give you guys two
examples<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.869> Gravitron<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
examples one is a Gravitron and the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.399 
examples one is a Gravitron and the
other<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.030> course<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.630> talk<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.049> it

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
other is of course to talk of it

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.160 
other is of course to talk of it
so<00:01:22.950> here's<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.490> Gravitron<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.900> want<00:01:25.080> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
so here's the Gravitron what you want to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.170 
so here's the Gravitron what you want to
do<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> thing<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.520> acceleration

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
do with the thing is the acceleration

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.390 
do with the thing is the acceleration
should<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.540> 1<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.560> made<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.009> max

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
should be 1 then I made the max

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.240 
should be 1 then I made the max
acceleration<00:01:30.470> 100<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.430> Gravitron

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
acceleration 100 on the Gravitron

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.840 
acceleration 100 on the Gravitron
so<00:01:33.370> it<00:01:34.000> starts<00:01:34.420> off<00:01:34.600> really<00:01:34.990> slow<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.770> then<00:01:36.640> it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
so it starts off really slow and then it

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.850 
so it starts off really slow and then it
builds<00:01:37.090> up<00:01:37.300> speed<00:01:37.690> after<00:01:37.930> but<00:01:38.410> just<00:01:38.680> like<00:01:38.830> a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
builds up speed after but just like a

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.920 
builds up speed after but just like a
real<00:01:39.190> Gravitron<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.480> in<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.660> real<00:01:42.870> okay<00:01:43.870> so

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
real Gravitron and and in a real okay so

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.210 
real Gravitron and and in a real okay so
the<00:01:44.530> topspin<00:01:45.030> again<00:01:46.030> not<00:01:46.390> hard<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.230> do<00:01:47.380> here<00:01:48.100> we

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
the topspin again not hard to do here we

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.680 
the topspin again not hard to do here we
go<00:01:48.370> so<00:01:48.640> basically<00:01:49.210> what<00:01:49.510> it<00:01:49.660> is<00:01:49.690> it's<00:01:50.280> two

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
go so basically what it is it's two

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.370 
go so basically what it is it's two
popular<00:01:52.690> things<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:55.020> installation<00:01:56.020> blocks

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
popular things with installation blocks

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.630 
popular things with installation blocks
going<00:01:56.860> down<00:01:57.190> under<00:01:57.790> them<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:58.330> it's<00:01:58.540> like<00:01:58.750> that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
going down under them so it's like that

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.840 
going down under them so it's like that
we<00:02:00.640> got<00:02:00.850> our<00:02:01.750> things<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.680> of<00:02:03.010> course<00:02:03.310> the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
we got our things and of course the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.380 
we got our things and of course the
chairs<00:02:05.820> well<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:06.880> course<00:02:06.940> you're<00:02:07.240> going<00:02:07.330> to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
chairs well of course you're going to

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.960 
chairs well of course you're going to
make<00:02:07.570> this<00:02:07.750> like<00:02:08.290> a<00:02:08.590> billion<00:02:09.160> times<00:02:09.190> bigger

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
make this like a billion times bigger

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.460 
make this like a billion times bigger
but<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.540> know<00:02:10.720> what<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:14.020> one<00:02:14.320> of

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
but you know what and you have one of

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.980 
but you know what and you have one of
those<00:02:14.620> rotating<00:02:15.400> blocks<00:02:15.700> there<00:02:16.330> and

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
those rotating blocks there and

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.270 
those rotating blocks there and
obviously<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.890> can<00:02:18.070> end<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.180> but<00:02:20.170> again<00:02:20.620> that

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
obviously you can end it but again that

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.740 
obviously you can end it but again that
goes<00:02:21.490> way<00:02:21.880> way<00:02:22.890> way<00:02:23.890> too<00:02:23.920> slowly<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:25.570> you're

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
goes way way way too slowly so you're

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.900 
goes way way way too slowly so you're
going<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.959> probably<00:02:26.260> want<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.010> acceleration

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
going to probably want the acceleration

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.230 
going to probably want the acceleration
to<00:02:28.060> be<00:02:28.240> around<00:02:28.630> 80<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.490> course<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:31.090> had
