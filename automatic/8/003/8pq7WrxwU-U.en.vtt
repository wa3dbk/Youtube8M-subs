yeah<00:01:42.039> so<00:01:43.000> I'll<00:01:43.149> just<00:01:43.390> try<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.110> out<00:01:44.289> use<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.569> from

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
yeah so I'll just try it out use it from

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.389 
yeah so I'll just try it out use it from
for<00:01:46.780> my<00:01:46.899> own<00:01:47.080> experience<00:01:47.619> it'll<00:01:47.920> take<00:01:48.100> between

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
for my own experience it'll take between

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.930 
for my own experience it'll take between
24<00:01:48.880> hours<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.270> like<00:01:49.390> 72<00:01:49.810> hours<00:01:50.289> I<00:01:50.729> don't<00:01:51.729> know

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
24 hours in like 72 hours I don't know

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.320 
24 hours in like 72 hours I don't know
why<00:01:52.539> but<00:01:52.869> my<00:01:53.080> fastest<00:01:53.530> was<00:01:53.800> like<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:55.000> was<00:01:55.090> maybe

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
why but my fastest was like it was maybe

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.910 
why but my fastest was like it was maybe
like<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.840> little<00:01:56.679> over<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.950> day<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:58.920> don't

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
like a little over a day and I don't

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.109 
like a little over a day and I don't
think<00:02:00.130> there's<00:02:00.280> like<00:02:00.369> any<00:02:00.429> like<00:02:00.789> negative

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
think there's like any like negative

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.410 
think there's like any like negative
effects<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.970> doing<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.060> more<00:02:04.149> than<00:02:04.209> one

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
effects of just doing it more than one

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.100 
effects of just doing it more than one
so<00:02:04.600> if<00:02:04.869> if<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.649> seems<00:02:05.830> like<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:06.009> signal<00:02:06.429> I'll<00:02:06.520> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
so if if it seems like a signal I'll I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.240 
so if if it seems like a signal I'll I
don't<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.410> don't<00:02:08.470> see<00:02:08.649> what<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.920> problem<00:02:09.009> with

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
don't I don't see what the problem with

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.759 
don't I don't see what the problem with
just<00:02:09.549> trying<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.940> get<00:02:10.149> would<00:02:10.329> be<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:11.140> don't

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
just trying to get would be I I don't

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.400 
just trying to get would be I I don't
think<00:02:11.980> they<00:02:12.040> look<00:02:12.160> lock<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.489> out<00:02:12.549> or<00:02:12.730> anything

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
think they look lock you out or anything

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.130 
think they look lock you out or anything
yeah<00:02:14.410> that's<00:02:14.860> about<00:02:14.980> it
