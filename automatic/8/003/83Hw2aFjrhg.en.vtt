source can be almost anything because
there's<00:01:17.490> three<00:01:17.670> digital<00:01:18.000> inputs<00:01:18.270> built<00:01:18.479> into

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
there's three digital inputs built into

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.450 
there's three digital inputs built into
the<00:01:18.750> speaker<00:01:19.080> there's<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.470> USB<00:01:19.740> input<00:01:20.100> an

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the speaker there's a USB input an

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.399 
the speaker there's a USB input an
optical<00:01:21.390> digital<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> coaxial<00:01:22.259> digital

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
optical digital and a coaxial digital

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.840 
optical digital and a coaxial digital
and<00:01:23.189> there's<00:01:23.520> also<00:01:23.640> an<00:01:23.820> analog<00:01:24.090> output<00:01:24.680> input

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
and there's also an analog output input

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
output these speakers play down to 48

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.090 
output these speakers play down to 48
verse<00:01:33.509> which<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.840> low<00:01:34.170> base<00:01:34.409> how<00:01:34.710> about<00:01:34.890> that

let's take a look inside it's also a
subwoofer<00:01:37.170> output<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.740> run<00:01:37.860> us<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.220> you'd

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
subwoofer output to run us up if you'd

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.730 
subwoofer output to run us up if you'd
like<00:01:38.780> this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> inside<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> active

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740

like this is the inside of the active
speaker<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> internal<00:01:42.720> power

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
speaker this is the internal power

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.139

plenty<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> ohm<00:01:48.840> for<00:01:49.049> both<00:01:49.170> channels<00:01:49.970> there's

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
plenty of ohm for both channels there's

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.679
