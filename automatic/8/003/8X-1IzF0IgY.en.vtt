00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.320
 to mitigate the effects in the rankings on June 19 if you're not the 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.569
 only a low at the tip of the customs who surrounded the sessions 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.960
 of tests and we experienced a breakdown anyway took part only at a 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.829
 tenth minute 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:17.829
 normal occurred at the same place 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:21.880
 minc 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 in november 2010 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.769
 20% gathered 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.509
 Why 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.380
 the story 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.720
 this is not ideal would obviously be the 01 group from the outset 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.650
 obama and m 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.010
 that's why I will never play a good idea 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.840
 and men 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.730
 he calls all the valid men in all of Wales who 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.810
 stand there 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.460
 even if it's his plan again 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.650
 and so I want 159 million dollars in the world 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.620
 you know that a big progress these damn limits 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.160
 to others here is a ticket of the very beautiful 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.890
 but linear 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.030
 not at the start 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.470
 brasilia finally agree 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.480
 just before the second half of the season 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.480
 to the eyes of embers second goal 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.700
 so if I tell you yes you have summed up well the transitional simona mayor 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.280
 professional 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 in Algeria the base of mali and Algeria on the back 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.010
 the police 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.640
 but it is also reassuring 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:26.169
 you want to know what is right for me you ask me I would like it 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.819
 bernstein 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.679
 another a style that strangely resembles him
