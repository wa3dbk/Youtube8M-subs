yeah

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.840 
yeah
instruction<00:01:19.220> we<00:01:19.340> know<00:01:19.400> anyway<00:01:19.900> if<00:01:20.900> I've<00:01:21.320> heard

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
instruction we know anyway if I've heard

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.730 
instruction we know anyway if I've heard
on<00:01:22.850> many<00:01:23.060> websites<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:24.050> forums<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
on many websites and forums that the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.219 
on many websites and forums that the
translation<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.640> not<00:01:25.670> very<00:01:26.030> good<00:01:26.180> so<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:27.140> can

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
translation is not very good so you can

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.100 
translation is not very good so you can
use<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.950> alternative<00:01:28.610> from<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:29.110> similar

product like I'm xb9 our table ug you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.370 
product like I'm xb9 our table ug you
can<00:01:34.040> find<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.340> lot<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.610> manuals<00:01:35.060> PDF<00:01:35.810> format<00:01:36.200> on

can find a lot of manuals PDF format on

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:58.100 
can find a lot of manuals PDF format on
the<00:01:36.470> net<00:01:37.420> ok<00:01:38.420> let's<00:01:38.660> see<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.110> actual<00:01:39.850> TX

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.240 

now<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> digital<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:01.010> so<00:02:02.010> it<00:02:02.100> means

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
now this is a digital one so it means

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.310 
now this is a digital one so it means
you<00:02:02.370> can<00:02:02.520> adjust<00:02:02.670> pretty<00:02:03.300> much<00:02:03.570> anything<00:02:03.900> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you can adjust pretty much anything you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:14.860 
you can adjust pretty much anything you
can<00:02:04.920> find<00:02:05.130> out<00:02:05.340> details<00:02:05.700> online

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.740 

okay<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.830> was<00:02:17.069> where<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.420> initial

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
okay this was where the the initial

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.910 
okay this was where the the initial
version<00:02:19.140> had<00:02:19.290> also<00:02:19.680> 72<00:02:21.709> megahertz<00:02:23.569> antenna

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
version had also 72 megahertz antenna

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.650 
version had also 72 megahertz antenna
but<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.160> current<00:02:26.700> ones<00:02:27.060> are<00:02:27.239> only<00:02:27.360> 2.4

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
but this current ones are only 2.4

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.910 
but this current ones are only 2.4
gigahertz<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.150> where<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.420> put<00:02:30.569> your

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
gigahertz this is where you put your

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.030 
gigahertz this is where you put your
transmitter<00:02:31.920> module<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.549> this<00:02:32.730> case<00:02:33.090> it's<00:02:33.510> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
transmitter module in this case it's the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.150 
transmitter module in this case it's the
actual<00:02:35.450> fly<00:02:36.450> sky<00:02:36.810> itself<00:02:39.349> so<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:40.379> think<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.950> can

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
actual fly sky itself so I think you can

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:57.110 
actual fly sky itself so I think you can
just

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.670 

I<00:02:57.150> think<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:57.690> should<00:02:57.840> make<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.110> click<00:02:58.500> or

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
I think it should make a click or

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:07.679 
I think it should make a click or
something

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.300 

the<00:03:08.689> good<00:03:08.900> thing<00:03:09.109> is<00:03:09.140> with<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.799> package<00:03:10.099> that

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
the good thing is with this package that

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.660 
the good thing is with this package that
I<00:03:10.549> got<00:03:10.760> from<00:03:10.879> I<00:03:11.090> assume<00:03:11.329> at<00:03:11.620> around<00:03:12.620> $70<00:03:13.489> is

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
I got from I assume at around $70 is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.619 
I got from I assume at around $70 is
that<00:03:13.879> it<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.560> bundle<00:03:15.980> with<00:03:16.129> the<00:03:16.310> 8<00:03:16.939> channel

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
that it is the bundle with the 8 channel

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.720 
that it is the bundle with the 8 channel
receiver<00:03:18.079> included<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.219> package

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
receiver included in the package

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.360 
receiver included in the package
which<00:03:19.819> is<00:03:20.000> this<00:03:20.150> one<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:22.269> having<00:03:23.269> 800<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:23.959> can

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
which is this one so having 800 you can

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.390 
which is this one so having 800 you can
make<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.760> can<00:03:25.939> use<00:03:26.209> more<00:03:26.480> functions<00:03:27.049> in<00:03:27.200> your

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
make you can use more functions in your

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.069 
make you can use more functions in your
RC<00:03:28.400> helicopter<00:03:28.909> for<00:03:29.090> example<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:29.659> can<00:03:29.900> use<00:03:29.930> a

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
RC helicopter for example you can use a

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.830 
RC helicopter for example you can use a
scale<00:03:30.889> fuselage<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:31.609> can<00:03:31.819> make<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:34.840> landing

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
scale fuselage you can make the landing

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.640 
scale fuselage you can make the landing
gear<00:03:36.310> lifts<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:38.049> things<00:03:39.049> like<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.260> or

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
gear lifts and things like that or

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.199 
gear lifts and things like that or
additional<00:03:40.220> functions<00:03:40.669> because<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.090> only

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
additional functions because you only

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.349 
additional functions because you only
need<00:03:41.299> six<00:03:41.720> for<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.169> helicopter<00:03:43.480> itself<00:03:45.669> so<00:03:46.669> I

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
need six for the helicopter itself so I

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.349 
need six for the helicopter itself so I
read<00:03:48.169> Goods<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.739> Bad's<00:03:48.769> about<00:03:49.040> this<00:03:49.400> remote

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
read Goods and Bad's about this remote

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.759 
read Goods and Bad's about this remote
so<00:03:50.719> I<00:03:50.750> hope<00:03:51.169> I<00:03:51.379> will<00:03:51.560> not<00:03:51.760> have<00:03:52.760> any<00:03:52.939> issues<00:03:53.769> you

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
so I hope I will not have any issues you

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.229 
so I hope I will not have any issues you
can<00:03:54.980> use<00:03:55.129> normal<00:03:55.280> batteries<00:03:55.939> with<00:03:56.090> this

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
can use normal batteries with this

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.379 
can use normal batteries with this
adapter<00:03:56.750> which<00:03:56.870> is<00:03:57.019> built<00:03:57.230> in<00:03:57.439> or<00:03:58.090> like<00:03:59.090> many

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
adapter which is built in or like many
