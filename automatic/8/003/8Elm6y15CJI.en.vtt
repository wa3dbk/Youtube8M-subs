because<00:00:38.820> those<00:00:39.000> will<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.329> work<00:00:39.600> very<00:00:39.629> well

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.590 
cardboard is sticking on outside those
are<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> sides<00:01:30.180> you're<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> be

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
are the sides you're going to be

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260 
are the sides you're going to be
painting<00:01:30.990> afterwards<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.650> simply<00:01:32.610> even<00:01:33.060> have

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
painting afterwards and simply even have

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.569 
painting afterwards and simply even have
eight<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.960> those<00:01:34.130> once<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.340> eight<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
eight of those once you have eight of

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.850 
eight of those once you have eight of
those<00:01:35.850> what<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.590> get<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
those what you want to do get one of

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.710 
those what you want to do get one of
them<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.159> simply<00:01:38.549> stick<00:01:38.909> them<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.479> side

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
them and simply stick them to this side

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.600 
them and simply stick them to this side
like<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.259> they're<00:01:41.040> sticking<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.400> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
like this so they're sticking like that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.429 
like this so they're sticking like that
and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.329> get<00:01:42.540> another<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.259> same

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
and then get another one and do the same

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.980 
and then get another one and do the same
from<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> other<00:01:44.070> side<00:01:44.630> what<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.689> want<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.899> do

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
from the other side what you want to do

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.389 
from the other side what you want to do
now<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.619> one<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.799> those<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.070> joint

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
now is get one of those little joint

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
now is get one of those little joint
what<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.240> want<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.110> glue<00:01:49.290> is

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
what you want to do with that glue is

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.359 
what you want to do with that glue is
simply<00:01:50.159> apply<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:50.970> glue<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.450> inside<00:01:52.369> once

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
simply apply some glue on it inside once

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.800 
simply apply some glue on it inside once
you<00:01:53.520> bend<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
you bend it

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.830 
you bend it
once<00:01:55.410> that's<00:01:55.590> done<00:01:55.800> you<00:01:56.040> simply<00:01:56.700> stick<00:01:57.660> this

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
once that's done you simply stick this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.450 
once that's done you simply stick this
little<00:01:58.080> thing<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.440> a<00:01:58.500> side<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.980> this<00:01:59.190> and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
little thing on a side like this and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.940 
little thing on a side like this and
then<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.690> do<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> same<00:02:01.170> with<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.830> other

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
then you do the same with all the other

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.990 
then you do the same with all the other
ones<00:02:02.540> until<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> basic<00:02:05.070> shape<00:02:05.220> like

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
ones until you get a basic shape like

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.990 
ones until you get a basic shape like
this<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.890> simply<00:02:08.070> put<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.460> in<00:02:08.550> what<00:02:08.910> you

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
this and you simply put it in what you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.460 
this and you simply put it in what you
might<00:02:09.119> want<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.660> inside<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.320> is

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
might want to do on the inside it is

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.780 
might want to do on the inside it is
simply<00:02:10.950> put<00:02:11.130> some<00:02:11.310> sellotape

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
simply put some sellotape

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.730 
simply put some sellotape
in<00:02:11.940> case<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.630> not<00:02:12.780> holding<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.440> very<00:02:13.680> well

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
in case it's not holding out very well

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.440 
in case it's not holding out very well
that's<00:02:14.310> why<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.520> had<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.850> do<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.060> for<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.270> have

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
that's why I had to do it for this have

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.290 
that's why I had to do it for this have
one<00:02:15.660> eye<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.459> over<00:02:17.580> here<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.060> put

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
one eye like so over here I just put

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.100 
one eye like so over here I just put
some<00:02:18.630> sellotape

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
some sellotape

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.010 
some sellotape
on<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> inside<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.310> once<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.120> do<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
on the inside and once you do this you

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.150 
on the inside and once you do this you
get<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.380> little<00:02:22.650> thing<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.980> did

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
get this little thing that you did

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.280 
get this little thing that you did
before<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.270> exact<00:02:24.750> same<00:02:24.840> thing

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
before and you do the exact same thing

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.979 
before and you do the exact same thing
like<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:26.850> before<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.300> progress<00:02:27.600> any

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
like so but before you progress any

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.850 
like so but before you progress any
further<00:02:28.170> we<00:02:28.739> have<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.220> do<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.330> reticle

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
further we have to do is do the reticle

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.620 
further we have to do is do the reticle
their<00:02:31.860> radical<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.520> circle<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.420> have

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
their radical you have a circle you have

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.600 
their radical you have a circle you have
the<00:02:33.780> diamond<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.380> then<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.489> little

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the diamond and then you have the little

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.330 
the diamond and then you have the little
thing<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.060> goes<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.390> very<00:02:36.720> inside<00:02:37.340> so

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
thing that goes on the very inside so

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.979 
thing that goes on the very inside so
what<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.610> want<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.790> do<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.209> simply<00:02:39.570> get<00:02:39.720> this

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
what you want to do is simply get this

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.070 
what you want to do is simply get this
at<00:02:40.920> buy<00:02:41.400> some<00:02:41.700> glue<00:02:42.090> very<00:02:42.450> carefully<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
at buy some glue very carefully on the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.780 
at buy some glue very carefully on the
corners<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:43.709> do<00:02:43.920> not<00:02:44.040> get<00:02:44.220> on<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.430> inside

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
corners so you do not get on it inside

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:52.610 
corners so you do not get on it inside
so<00:02:45.120> like<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.430> then<00:02:51.180> on<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.660> one<00:02:51.900> yeah

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
so like so you and then on of one yeah

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.800 
so like so you and then on of one yeah
be<00:02:53.160> very<00:02:53.190> careful<00:02:53.940> because<00:02:54.030> hot<00:02:54.330> glue<00:02:54.570> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
be very careful because hot glue is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.640 
be very careful because hot glue is
really<00:02:55.170> dangerous

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
really dangerous

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.680 
really dangerous
I<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:56.130> keep<00:02:56.610> burning<00:02:56.820> myself<00:02:57.239> with<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.450> like

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
I I keep burning myself with this like

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.630 
I I keep burning myself with this like
over<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.230> over<00:02:58.440> again<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.250> really<00:02:59.489> not

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
over and over again and it's really not

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.640 
over and over again and it's really not
comfortable<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.299> simply<00:03:00.780> bought<00:03:01.320> this

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
comfortable and you simply bought this

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.280 
comfortable and you simply bought this
diamond<00:03:02.430> shape<00:03:02.640> all<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.150> way<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.540> back<00:03:03.810> like

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
diamond shape all the way the back like

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.190 
diamond shape all the way the back like
so<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:06.150> circle<00:03:06.450> will<00:03:06.540> be<00:03:06.570> all<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.049> way<00:03:07.140> at

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
so and the circle will be all the way at

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.750 
so and the circle will be all the way at
the<00:03:07.290> front<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.680> do<00:03:07.830> not<00:03:08.040> want<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.400> mess<00:03:08.610> with

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the front you do not want to mess with

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.970 
the front you do not want to mess with
the<00:03:08.880> circle<00:03:09.209> anymore<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.660> then<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.470> get<00:03:10.860> the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
the circle anymore and then you get the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.060 
the circle anymore and then you get the
still<00:03:11.220> thing<00:03:11.489> that<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.269> had<00:03:12.510> before<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.530> what

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
still thing that you had before and what

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.220 
still thing that you had before and what
you<00:03:14.130> want<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.310> do<00:03:14.400> again<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.840> apply<00:03:16.049> some

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
you want to do again just apply some

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.850 
you want to do again just apply some
glue<00:03:16.470> on<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.980> sides<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.560> you

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.380 

and<00:03:22.860> then<00:03:23.250> after<00:03:23.490> that<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.850> just<00:03:23.880> do<00:03:24.680> still

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
and then after that you just do still

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.930 
and then after that you just do still
like<00:03:27.390> so<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.050> there<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:28.860> have<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.040> they<00:03:29.580> have

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
like so and there you have it they have

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.910 
like so and there you have it they have
the<00:03:30.120> reticle<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.780> do<00:03:30.840> not<00:03:31.020> do<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.410> don't<00:03:31.770> do

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
the reticle and I do not do I don't do

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.510 
the reticle and I do not do I don't do
right<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:33.319> very<00:03:34.319> slowly<00:03:34.620> if<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:34.920> mess<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.400> up

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
right and very slowly if you mess it up

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.190 
right and very slowly if you mess it up
with<00:03:35.760> hot<00:03:36.000> glue<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.450> gonna<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:36.959> very

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
with hot glue you gonna have to be very

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.900 
with hot glue you gonna have to be very
quick<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.470> fix<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:37.920> like<00:03:38.250> I'm<00:03:38.459> doing<00:03:38.700> right<00:03:38.820> now

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
quick to fix it like I'm doing right now

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.090 
quick to fix it like I'm doing right now
and<00:03:39.390> there<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.080> have<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.290> that's<00:03:40.740> what<00:03:41.040> you

and there you have it that's what you
can<00:03:41.250> have<00:03:41.400> for<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.730> reticle<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.240> once<00:03:42.840> you

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
can have for the reticle and once you

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.320 
can have for the reticle and once you
finish<00:03:43.260> those<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:44.520> is<00:03:44.550> gonna<00:03:44.880> go<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.209> an

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
finish those this is gonna go on an

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.870 
finish those this is gonna go on an
inside<00:03:45.870> like<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.560> before<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.610> do<00:03:47.730> that

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
inside like so and before you do that

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
sticking everything together once

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.009 
sticking everything together once
everything<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.760> dry<00:04:11.970> what<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.390> want<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.600> do<00:04:12.690> is

everything is dry what you want to do is
get<00:04:13.260> some<00:04:13.470> any<00:04:14.280> color<00:04:14.519> code<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.880> want<00:04:15.090> for<00:04:15.300> the

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
get some any color code you want for the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.970 
get some any color code you want for the
reticle<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.900> simply<00:04:16.200> apply<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.560> at<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.829> back

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
reticle and simply apply it at the back

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.130 
reticle and simply apply it at the back
like<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.640> then<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.299> put<00:04:18.450> some<00:04:18.480> seltzer<00:04:19.019> by

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
like so and then you put some seltzer by

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.280 
like so and then you put some seltzer by
either<00:04:19.290> side<00:04:19.620> up<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.220> at<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.820> front<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.600> then

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
either side up and at the front and then

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.170 
either side up and at the front and then
since<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:22.830> didn't<00:04:23.100> open<00:04:23.460> up<00:04:23.610> he<00:04:23.790> don't<00:04:24.030> want

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
since you didn't open up he don't want

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.610 
since you didn't open up he don't want
to<00:04:24.270> close<00:04:24.480> his<00:04:24.660> finger<00:04:24.930> until<00:04:25.140> you<00:04:25.380> have<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
to close his finger until you have the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.080 
to close his finger until you have the
reticle<00:04:25.860> inside<00:04:26.160> otherwise<00:04:26.460> you're<00:04:26.880> not

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
reticle inside otherwise you're not

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.060 
reticle inside otherwise you're not
gonna<00:04:27.210> be<00:04:27.360> able<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.570> get<00:04:27.840> in<00:04:28.080> afterwards<00:04:28.860> and

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
gonna be able to get in afterwards and

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.700 
gonna be able to get in afterwards and
all<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.669> do<00:04:29.820> is<00:04:29.850> simply<00:04:30.410> stick<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.530> on<00:04:31.620> the

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
all you do is simply stick it on the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.670 
all you do is simply stick it on the
inside<00:04:31.830> like<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:32.450> from<00:04:33.450> web<00:04:33.630> side<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.380> sticks

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
inside like so from web side so sticks

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.280 
inside like so from web side so sticks
in<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.310> there<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:35.970> have<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:36.750> once<00:04:37.050> you

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
in and there you have it so once you

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.110 
in and there you have it so once you
have<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.560> radical<00:04:37.890> in<00:04:38.010> you<00:04:38.400> can<00:04:38.550> start<00:04:38.820> using

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
have the radical in you can start using

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.080 
have the radical in you can start using
this<00:04:39.450> little<00:04:39.750> side<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:41.010> simply<00:04:41.669> close

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
this little side to simply close

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.330 
this little side to simply close
everything<00:04:42.630> in<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:42.960> after<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.680> do<00:04:43.770> that<00:04:43.800> that

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
everything in and after you do that that

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.610 
everything in and after you do that that
goes<00:04:44.520> pretty<00:04:44.820> much<00:04:44.970> gonna<00:04:45.120> be<00:04:45.180> finished<00:04:45.620> so

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
goes pretty much gonna be finished so

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.409 
goes pretty much gonna be finished so
once<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.100> finish<00:04:47.280> everything<00:04:47.640> off<00:04:47.850> you're

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
once you finish everything off you're

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.330 
once you finish everything off you're
gonna<00:04:48.660> have<00:04:48.900> a<00:04:49.080> ghost<00:04:49.440> of<00:04:49.620> your<00:04:49.740> own<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.100> this

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
gonna have a ghost of your own and this

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.680 
gonna have a ghost of your own and this
one<00:04:50.520> in<00:04:50.640> particular<00:04:50.760> did<00:04:51.150> not<00:04:51.300> work<00:04:51.450> out<00:04:51.660> very

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
one in particular did not work out very
