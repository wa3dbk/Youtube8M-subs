magic<00:01:22.400> moment<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.610> add<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.290> during<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
magic moment and add and then during the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.280 
magic moment and add and then during the
match<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.549> our<00:01:26.759> truth<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.290> damien

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
match you just have our truth and damien

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.520 
match you just have our truth and damien
sandow<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:29.070> at<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:31.290> Miz

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.899 
sandow going at it as so it's the Miz
and<00:01:31.560> Dolph<00:01:32.070> Ziggler<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.790> would<00:01:32.880> be

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
and Dolph Ziggler I think that would be

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.270 
and Dolph Ziggler I think that would be
perfect<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.350> during<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.799> match<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.189> you

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
perfect to see during the match and you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
perfect to see during the match and you
have<00:01:35.430> MS<00:01:36.119> outside<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.990> Ziggler<00:01:37.320> outside<00:01:37.710> just

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
have MS outside and Ziggler outside just

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.260 
have MS outside and Ziggler outside just
kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.100> chilling<00:01:38.460> around<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.090> know

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
kind of interference hopefully not I

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.360

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.340 
champion but I feel also Miz will do a
better<00:02:23.550> job<00:02:23.640> as<00:02:24.090> champion<00:02:24.600> right<00:02:24.780> now<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:24.990> think

guys and dresses them or something like

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.640 
guys and dresses them or something like
that<00:03:07.830> build<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.250> bit<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.460> an<00:03:08.520> entourage<00:03:08.940> for<00:03:09.650> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
that build a bit of an entourage for the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.920 
that build a bit of an entourage for the
Miz<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:12.150> think<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.420> could<00:03:12.540> work<00:03:12.690> out

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
Miz and I think that could work out

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.860 
Miz and I think that could work out
really<00:03:13.410> really<00:03:13.530> well<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:15.120> think<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.450> mazes

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
really really well so I think the mazes

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.140 
really really well so I think the mazes
I<00:03:16.080> see<00:03:16.320> champion<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.040> better<00:03:17.490> at<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.880> point

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
I see champion is better at this point

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.180 
I see champion is better at this point
in<00:03:18.239> time<00:03:18.390> but<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.600> think<00:03:18.660> Ziegler<00:03:19.200> really<00:03:19.950> needs

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
in time but I think Ziegler really needs

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.470 
in time but I think Ziegler really needs
the<00:03:20.400> belt<00:03:20.610> he's<00:03:20.730> not<00:03:20.880> really<00:03:21.000> doing<00:03:21.270> that<00:03:21.360> much

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
the belt he's not really doing that much

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.030 
the belt he's not really doing that much
with<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:21.989> think<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.230> Miz<00:03:22.440> could<00:03:22.650> use<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
with it I think the Miz could use the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.100 
with it I think the Miz could use the
belt<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.370> lot<00:03:23.850> more<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.330> for<00:03:24.570> that<00:03:24.690> reason<00:03:25.020> alone

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
belt a lot more so for that reason alone

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.550 
belt a lot more so for that reason alone
I<00:03:25.440> hope<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.770> Miz<00:03:25.950> wins<00:03:26.250> but<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.180> do<00:03:27.480> see<00:03:27.870> Ziggler

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
I hope the Miz wins but I do see Ziggler

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.260
