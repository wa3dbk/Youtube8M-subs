00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:10.100
 Now I want to show you this one 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.310
 idea that can develop it just says 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:18.220
 yesterday but merely illustrative 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.380
 as you will see it is a plate 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.509
 all this set is passed a few 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.930
 light band that is coupled to the 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.930
 engine 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.490
 as a trailer the good engine goes with 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.560
 these all 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.610
 would drop 1 over real hole so 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.710
 So much is not going but it is very very firm 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.260
 It is very firm 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.260
 this is a car elastic 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:54.449
 straightened in the forge 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.920
 and as you will see the plate goes in and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.940
 no time 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 it gets stuck 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.810
 it's important to do that but the idea 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:13.560
 is to show how the sandpaper can be centered 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.640
 and how can it be to say self- tense 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.540
 to be tense and 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.540
 this is a 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.520
 good now awesome this this is 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.220
 a spring is a we and I did it 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.340
 I temper it in this case but it's something 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.200
 very worse 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.659
 he does not even come holding it I put it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.990
 simply so that to show 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.990
 notice this 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.159
 there it would come down 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.210
 and it lacks sun 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.049
 here 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.440
 in this part of the country what would be the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.950
 free pulley 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.800
 the free police and in this part of here 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.410
 who would be the engine we are going to put 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.600
 account mode that this would be the the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.159
 tractor pulley to when the shaft rotates 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.859
 the motor 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.429
 that would be the pulley so much in this case what 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.429
 would make of rubber 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.450
 but what happens the free pulley here 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.220
 welded here and this would be the pulley 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.900
 when I want to remove a sandpaper simply 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.990
 I touched 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.420
 pulled up 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.910
 take out sandpaper to put another one and then 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.910
 just drop 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:41.540
 ok because this part of here that is one 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.530
 press that was split 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.170
 I use it to center the sandpaper 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.050
 if I want that 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.540
 that is when I put the sandpaper on the sandpaper or 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.140
 goes or comes very close to what the only thing 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.140
 What do I have to do? 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.880
 and get off 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.580
 this angle was going to change the angle if 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.580
 there were 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.060
 to upload 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.110
 is the angle k as I am 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.970
 and this will allow me quickly 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.970
 central 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.650
 the sandpaper 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.670
 as it runs 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.670
 in the most 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.360
 more perpendicular possible ok is very 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.360
 easy this is a very simple thing this 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.460
 is done I already tell you in a couple of 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.470
 hours for illustration mode but it's 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.140
 an idea that I wanted to do before 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:55.950
 do something I will do something better here 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.950
 I'm going to put a really good spring 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.510
 and good and everything has managed to make it 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.790
 the free pulley that would go 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.840
 here in this place 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.599
 to anything they communicate 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.120
 with me for whips Uruguay 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.870
 well I say 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:23.479
 equal space are not or can not 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.479
 debate because it is a plane but 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.620
 it works and that's the important thing 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:37.600
 neighborhood and see you 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.600
 Saturday if God wants in the barbecue
