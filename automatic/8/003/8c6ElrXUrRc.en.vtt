is<00:00:18.300> really<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.720> rarest<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> rare<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
is really the rarest of the rare you

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.060 
is really the rarest of the rare you
really<00:00:20.880> don't<00:00:21.090> see<00:00:21.270> these<00:00:21.449> very<00:00:21.510> often<00:00:22.199> this

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070

was<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> very<00:00:23.490> popular<00:00:23.850> engine<00:00:24.570> than<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> day

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
was a very popular engine than the day

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.140 
was a very popular engine than the day
it<00:00:25.320> produced<00:00:26.070> 165<00:00:27.060> horsepower<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.949> 2,000<00:00:28.949> RPM

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
it produced 165 horsepower at 2,000 RPM

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.420 
it produced 165 horsepower at 2,000 RPM
so<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> fairly<00:00:31.560> slow<00:00:31.920> turning

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
so it it was a fairly slow turning

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.130 
so it it was a fairly slow turning
engine<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.510> produce<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.960> tremendous

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
engine but it produce a tremendous

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.860 
engine but it produce a tremendous
amount<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.829> torque<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:36.030> little<00:00:36.300> engine<00:00:36.660> Wade

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
amount of torque the little engine Wade

amount of torque the little engine Wade
402<00:00:37.739> pounds<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:39.570> actually<00:00:39.780> has<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
402 pounds and it actually has a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.700 
402 pounds and it actually has a

for<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.280> those<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.879> thought

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
for so for those of you that thought

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.450 
for so for those of you that thought
that<00:00:45.620> supercharging<00:00:46.620> was<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> modern<00:00:47.190> thing

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that supercharging was a modern thing

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.319 
that supercharging was a modern thing
this<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.539> super<00:00:48.690> charging<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.379> 1929<00:00:50.180> now<00:00:51.180> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
this was super charging in 1929 now this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.680 
this was super charging in 1929 now this
little<00:00:51.480> engine<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:52.050> built<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:53.309> month<00:00:54.120> almost

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
little engine was built a month almost

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.590 
little engine was built a month almost
to<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> day<00:00:55.649> before<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.940> stock<00:00:57.180> market

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
to the day before the stock market

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.380 
to the day before the stock market
crashed<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.079> 1929<00:00:58.469> before<00:00:59.430> black<00:00:59.640> Tuesday<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
crashed in 1929 before black Tuesday and

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.690 
crashed in 1929 before black Tuesday and
the<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.660> said<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:03.960> were<00:01:04.080> 400<00:01:04.489> 528<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the like I said there were 400 528 of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.250 
the like I said there were 400 528 of
these<00:01:05.820> engines<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.330> were<00:01:06.360> built<00:01:06.659> they

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
these engines that were built they

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.820 
these engines that were built they
powered<00:01:07.680> things<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.250> wakow<00:01:09.030> biplanes

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
powered things like wakow biplanes

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.300 
powered things like wakow biplanes
travel<00:01:10.830> air<00:01:10.950> biplanes<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.500> Stinson's<00:01:13.500> there

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
travel air biplanes the Stinson's there

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.130 
travel air biplanes the Stinson's there
were<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.790> whole<00:01:14.970> host<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.509> aircraft<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
were just a whole host of aircraft that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.740 
were just a whole host of aircraft that
used<00:01:16.409> these<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> smallest<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
used these this was the smallest of the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.780 
used these this was the smallest of the
of<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> j<00:01:19.380> 6<00:01:19.770> series<00:01:20.430> engines<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> j65

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
of the j 6 series engines this was a j65

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.700 
of the j 6 series engines this was a j65
named<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.240> had<00:01:24.540> five<00:01:24.900> cylinders<00:01:25.380> one

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
named because it had five cylinders one

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.350 
named because it had five cylinders one
two<00:01:26.460> three<00:01:27.119> four<00:01:27.720> five<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.070> j<00:01:29.400> 6<00:01:29.700> 7<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
two three four five now the j 6 7 and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.030 
two three four five now the j 6 7 and
the<00:01:30.840> j<00:01:31.020> 69<00:01:31.640> right<00:01:32.640> engines<00:01:33.560> varied<00:01:34.560> from<00:01:34.799> this

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the j 69 right engines varied from this

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
the j 69 right engines varied from this
one<00:01:35.220> pretty<00:01:35.579> much<00:01:35.850> only<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> number<00:01:36.840> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
one pretty much only in the number of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.499 
one pretty much only in the number of
cylinders<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:38.070> right<00:01:38.369> tried<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.759> interchange

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
cylinders so right tried to interchange

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.770 
cylinders so right tried to interchange
as<00:01:40.020> many<00:01:40.229> parts<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.710> possible<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
as many parts as possible and so the the

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.530 
as many parts as possible and so the the
Pistons<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.530> Link<00:01:43.770> rods<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.369> pistons<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.360> in

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
Pistons and Link rods and pistons and in

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.109 
Pistons and Link rods and pistons and in
those<00:01:46.079> cases<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.920> much<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.640> accessory

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
those cases and much of the accessory

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.899 
those cases and much of the accessory
section<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.350> same<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> 57<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.729> nine

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
section is the same on the 57 and nine

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.569 
section is the same on the 57 and nine
cylinder<00:01:51.360> engines<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> great<00:01:52.829> idea<00:01:52.860> as

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
cylinder engines it was a great idea as

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.730 
cylinder engines it was a great idea as
far<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:54.000> cost<00:01:54.270> savings<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
far as cost savings and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.840 
far as cost savings and
interchangeability<00:01:56.479> what<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.630> meant<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.140> that

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
interchangeability what it meant is that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.399 
interchangeability what it meant is that
for<00:01:59.850> instance<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> nose<00:02:00.570> case<00:02:00.899> on<00:02:01.229> this

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
for instance the nose case on this

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.249 
for instance the nose case on this
five-cylinder<00:02:02.100> engine<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.750> built<00:02:03.750> strong

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
five-cylinder engine is built strong

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.359 
five-cylinder engine is built strong
enough<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:06.200> to<00:02:07.200> carry<00:02:07.469> twice<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.220> horsepower

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
enough to to carry twice the horsepower

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.839 
enough to to carry twice the horsepower
in<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.270> nine<00:02:09.450> cylinder<00:02:09.869> engine<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:11.129> so

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
in the nine cylinder engine and so so

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.080 
in the nine cylinder engine and so so
the<00:02:12.000> five<00:02:12.270> cylinder<00:02:12.690> engine

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the five cylinder engine

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.420 
the five cylinder engine
is<00:02:13.360> severely<00:02:13.930> overbuilt<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.069> it's<00:02:15.340> a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
is severely overbuilt it's a it's a
