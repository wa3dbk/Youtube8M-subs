00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.900 

so<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> basic<00:00:10.800> idea<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.429> try<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.639> take

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
so the basic idea is to try and take

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.299 
so the basic idea is to try and take
this<00:00:12.090> whole<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.750> wrap<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.650> whole<00:00:13.769> car<00:00:14.099> in

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
this whole and to wrap the whole car in

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.810 
this whole and to wrap the whole car in
canvas<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.030> then<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.080> let<00:00:16.289> nature<00:00:17.160> take<00:00:17.609> its

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
canvas and then to let nature take its

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.019 
canvas and then to let nature take its
toll<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> car<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> way<00:00:19.230> becomes<00:00:19.650> a

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
toll so the car in a way becomes a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.700 
toll so the car in a way becomes a
painting<00:00:21.029> i<00:00:23.840> think<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.170> probably<00:00:25.470> should

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
painting i think what so probably should

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.890 
painting i think what so probably should
utilize<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.849> more<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.359> should<00:00:27.630> have

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
utilize this more and should have

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960 
utilize this more and should have
artists<00:00:28.320> making<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.010> doing<00:00:29.279> projects<00:00:29.849> with

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
artists making and doing projects with

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.250 
artists making and doing projects with
their<00:00:30.119> cars<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.449> then<00:00:30.660> keep<00:00:31.019> them<00:00:31.170> as

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
their cars and then keep them as

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.810 
their cars and then keep them as
artworks<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.739> kind<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.040> party<00:00:35.399> know<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.579> was

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
artworks the kind of party know I was

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.280 
artworks the kind of party know I was
looking<00:00:36.059> for<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.420> more<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
looking for was more to do with the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.530 
looking for was more to do with the
marks<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> road<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.640> weather<00:00:38.879> exhaust

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
marks of the road the weather exhaust

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:50.590 
marks of the road the weather exhaust
fumes<00:00:40.079> mud<00:00:40.610> dust<00:00:41.610> particles<00:00:42.420> more<00:00:42.960> accidental

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.260 

waves<00:00:51.600> at<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.930> car<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> think<00:00:52.680> fits<00:00:52.950> into<00:00:53.270> where

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
waves at the car I think fits into where

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.410 
waves at the car I think fits into where
my<00:00:54.480> work<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.680> trying<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.579> use

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
my work is going is I was trying to use

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.139 
my work is going is I was trying to use
the<00:00:57.449> car<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.590> kind<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.190> reflection<00:00:59.940> or<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the car as a kind of a reflection or a

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.249 
the car as a kind of a reflection or a
way<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> car<00:01:01.440> could<00:01:01.769> reflect<00:01:02.129> our

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:03.259 
way that the car could reflect our

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:11.830 
way that the car could reflect our
society<00:01:04.259> and<00:01:04.440> our<00:01:05.070> environment

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840

the drawings that are making 1 i'm just
getting<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.179> vehicle's<00:01:14.899> engine<00:01:15.079> to<00:01:15.679> just<00:01:15.920> put

exhaust<00:01:16.759> fumes<00:01:17.179> on<00:01:17.359> two<00:01:17.539> canvases<00:01:17.799> putting

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
exhaust fumes on two canvases putting

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.010

the<00:01:18.920> canvas<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.640> back<00:01:19.880> of<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.509> back<00:01:20.840> work

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
the canvas to the back of the back work

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.740 
the canvas to the back of the back work
on<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.409> accelerating<00:01:22.069> just<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.030> shoot<00:01:23.359> from

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
on and accelerating just the shoot from

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.230 
on and accelerating just the shoot from
the<00:01:23.810> from<00:01:24.560> these<00:01:24.770> exhaust<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.789> going<00:01:26.030> on<00:01:26.149> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
the from these exhaust just going on the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.330 
the from these exhaust just going on the
canvas<00:01:26.600> suddenly<00:01:27.259> kind<00:01:27.439> of<00:01:27.560> tipped<00:01:28.189> me

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
canvas suddenly kind of tipped me

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.949 
canvas suddenly kind of tipped me
through<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.819> this<00:01:28.939> point<00:01:29.179> what<00:01:29.479> about<00:01:29.600> if<00:01:29.840> I

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
through to this point what about if I

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.139 
through to this point what about if I
took<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.350> whole<00:01:30.530> car<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.100> turn<00:01:31.819> the<00:01:31.969> cow

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
took the whole car and turn the cow

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.020 
took the whole car and turn the cow
itself<00:01:32.569> into<00:01:32.899> a<00:01:32.929> canvas<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:33.860> it<00:01:34.039> starts<00:01:34.909> to

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
itself into a canvas so it starts to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.819 
itself into a canvas so it starts to
become<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.359> kind<00:01:35.630> of<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.840> mirror<00:01:36.079> or<00:01:36.259> reflection

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
become a kind of a mirror or reflection

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:43.539 
become a kind of a mirror or reflection
of<00:01:37.250> what<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:37.759> is<00:01:37.909> as<00:01:38.119> an<00:01:38.270> object<00:01:42.069> as<00:01:43.069> it<00:01:43.130> happens

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
of what it is as an object as it happens

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.449 
of what it is as an object as it happens
it's<00:01:43.729> an<00:01:43.880> electric<00:01:44.329> car<00:01:44.509> or<00:01:45.349> a<00:01:45.409> hybrid<00:01:46.009> car

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
it's an electric car or a hybrid car

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.690 
it's an electric car or a hybrid car
we're<00:01:46.939> just<00:01:47.090> wrapping<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.659> in<00:01:47.750> canvas<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.799> use

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
we're just wrapping it in canvas the use

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.609 
we're just wrapping it in canvas the use
of<00:01:49.729> canvases<00:01:50.479> cut<00:01:50.719> an<00:01:50.840> eyesore<00:01:51.349> quick

something immediately has a kind of

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
rhetoric to it it's become the artwork

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.610 
rhetoric to it it's become the artwork
that's<00:02:02.239> the<00:02:02.390> plan

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.840 

stretching<00:02:08.620> the<00:02:08.740> material<00:02:09.250> around<00:02:09.460> certain

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
stretching the material around certain

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.120 
stretching the material around certain
details<00:02:10.540> have<00:02:11.020> been<00:02:11.230> more<00:02:11.440> difficult<00:02:11.680> than<00:02:12.040> I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
details have been more difficult than I

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.110 
details have been more difficult than I
thought

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.170 

you<00:02:15.690> could<00:02:15.900> cover<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.819> then<00:02:17.819> put<00:02:18.030> that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
you could cover this and then put that

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.789 
you could cover this and then put that
on<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.659> don't<00:02:19.650> know<00:02:19.739> how<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.760> bit<00:02:21.799> not

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
on I don't know how to it's a bit not

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:29.210 
on I don't know how to it's a bit not
happening<00:02:23.159> yeah<00:02:23.549> we<00:02:23.670> need<00:02:23.819> Tim<00:02:24.060> Westwood<00:02:28.220> yeah

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
happening yeah we need Tim Westwood yeah

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.890 
happening yeah we need Tim Westwood yeah
it<00:02:29.310> seems<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.670> be<00:02:29.790> coming<00:02:29.940> out<00:02:30.239> as<00:02:30.450> hoped

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
it seems to be coming out as hoped

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.470 
it seems to be coming out as hoped
there's<00:02:31.829> little<00:02:32.129> bits<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:33.030> know<00:02:33.120> still

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
there's little bits that you know still

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.080 
there's little bits that you know still
are<00:02:33.750> still<00:02:34.019> kind<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.680> little<00:02:35.310> awkward<00:02:35.819> but

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
are still kind of a little awkward but

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.319 
are still kind of a little awkward but
we<00:02:36.450> should've<00:02:37.379> so<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:37.890> tiptoeing<00:02:38.459> around<00:02:38.700> and

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
we should've so you tiptoeing around and

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.580 
we should've so you tiptoeing around and
I<00:02:39.360> think<00:02:39.629> it's<00:02:39.780> going<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.959> come<00:02:40.079> out<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.319> canal

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
I think it's going to come out the canal

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.420 
I think it's going to come out the canal
the<00:02:41.310> last<00:02:41.670> time<00:02:41.940> for<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.959> work<00:02:46.069> we're<00:02:47.069> nearly

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
the last time for that work we're nearly

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.259 
the last time for that work we're nearly
there<00:02:47.720> now<00:02:48.720> it's<00:02:49.109> getting<00:02:49.739> quite<00:02:50.069> close<00:02:50.269> we've

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
there now it's getting quite close we've

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.270 
there now it's getting quite close we've
just<00:02:51.299> got<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.750> kind<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.079> horrible<00:02:52.379> difficult

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
just got the kind of horrible difficult

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.449 
just got the kind of horrible difficult
awkward<00:02:54.150> little<00:02:54.329> bit<00:02:54.660> now<00:02:58.190> here's<00:02:59.190> one<00:02:59.370> we

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
awkward little bit now here's one we

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.069 
awkward little bit now here's one we
made<00:02:59.609> earlier<00:03:02.060> what<00:03:03.060> I've<00:03:03.209> tried<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.690> do<00:03:03.900> is

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
made earlier what I've tried to do is

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.530 
made earlier what I've tried to do is
give<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.440> car<00:03:04.650> something<00:03:04.920> which<00:03:05.340> will<00:03:05.609> speed

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
give the car something which will speed

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.630 
give the car something which will speed
up<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.900> process<00:03:07.049> of<00:03:07.500> aging<00:03:07.920> if<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.129> like<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.609> i

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
up the process of aging if you like so i

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.099 
up the process of aging if you like so i
think<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.120> car<00:03:09.329> within<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.690> year<00:03:09.930> we'll

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
think that the car within a year we'll

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.610 
think that the car within a year we'll
actually<00:03:10.190> already<00:03:11.190> look<00:03:11.640> quite<00:03:12.209> used<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.140> i

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
actually already look quite used and i

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.910 
actually already look quite used and i
think<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.099> will<00:03:14.220> probably<00:03:14.849> continue<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.959> to

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
think it will probably continue to to

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.009 
think it will probably continue to to
become<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.400> thing<00:03:17.760> i<00:03:18.000> think<00:03:18.540> it's<00:03:18.870> supposed

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
become the thing i think it's supposed

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.070 
become the thing i think it's supposed
to<00:03:19.290> become

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.500 

I'm<00:03:26.080> not<00:03:26.500> sure<00:03:26.890> if<00:03:27.129> I'm<00:03:27.310> gonna<00:03:27.459> sign<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.000> car<00:03:28.239> I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
I'm not sure if I'm gonna sign the car I

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.839 
I'm not sure if I'm gonna sign the car I
think<00:03:28.720> at<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.870> moment<00:03:28.900> I've<00:03:29.349> kind<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.760> sort<00:03:30.760> of

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
think at the moment I've kind of sort of

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.240 
think at the moment I've kind of sort of
developed<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:31.450> as<00:03:31.629> a<00:03:31.659> raw<00:03:32.110> canvas<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.920> it's

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
developed it as a raw canvas and it's

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.920 
developed it as a raw canvas and it's
going<00:03:33.400> to<00:03:33.489> be<00:03:33.580> make<00:03:33.760> your<00:03:33.970> painting<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.690> maybe

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
going to be make your painting and maybe

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.720 
going to be make your painting and maybe
when<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.379> paintings<00:03:35.860> made<00:03:36.069> and<00:03:36.400> maybe<00:03:36.610> I

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
when the paintings made and maybe I

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.550 
when the paintings made and maybe I
design<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.209> to<00:03:37.480> kind<00:03:37.659> of<00:03:37.720> close<00:03:37.959> it<00:03:38.230> or<00:03:38.379> or

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
design it to kind of close it or or

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.979 
design it to kind of close it or or
finish<00:03:38.860> it<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.220> would<00:03:39.700> sign<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.000> somewhere<00:03:40.780> and

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
finish it I would sign it somewhere and

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:53.590 
finish it I would sign it somewhere and
maybe<00:03:41.230> not<00:03:41.590> that<00:03:41.620> visibly

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.660
