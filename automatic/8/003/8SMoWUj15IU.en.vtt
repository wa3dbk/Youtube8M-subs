right here when it went to go jump over

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
right here when it went to go jump over
the<00:00:20.010> log<00:00:20.420> and<00:00:21.710> hung<00:00:22.710> itself<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.220> perfectly<00:00:23.730> so

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940

you can see that the cable the choke
isn't<00:00:29.369> even<00:00:29.520> really<00:00:29.760> tight<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> log<00:00:30.449> which

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
isn't even really tight on the log which

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.380 
isn't even really tight on the log which
shows<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.590> did<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.279> struggle<00:00:32.759> too<00:00:32.910> much

clips like this clip right here the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490 
clips like this clip right here the
cable<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.149> be<00:00:45.270> sunk<00:00:45.660> right<00:00:45.960> into<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> bark

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
cable will be sunk right into the bark

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.670 
cable will be sunk right into the bark
which<00:00:46.950> shows<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.399> head<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> bit<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> struggle

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
so here's the hanging cable that I used

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.690 
so here's the hanging cable that I used

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
to support this the stick off its branch

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.860 
to support this the stick off its branch
would<00:00:58.250> look<00:00:59.250> at<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.059> steel<00:01:00.360> tie<00:01:00.629> where

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
would look at that the steel tie where

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.500 
would look at that the steel tie where

cable itself and inspect it so there's

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.740 
cable itself and inspect it so there's
there<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.220> no<00:02:01.430> twist<00:02:01.490> almost<00:02:02.390> looks<00:02:02.540> like<00:02:02.600> you

to<00:02:02.870> us<00:02:03.020> there<00:02:05.350> possibly<00:02:06.350> maybe<00:02:06.680> maybe<00:02:07.460> went

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
to us there possibly maybe maybe went

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.030
