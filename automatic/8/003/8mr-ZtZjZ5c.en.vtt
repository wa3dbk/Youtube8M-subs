00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.860
 hi girls how are you on this occasion 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.320
 I want to show you the tutorial about 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.539
 How to make this hairstyle is a braid and 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.460
 is inspired by the is of frozen the 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.310
 it's really easy to do it and it's 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.600
 very beautiful let's see how it's done 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.250
 First of all apply protective 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.900
 heat all over the hair 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.449
 later go to the iron 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.100
 brush all my hair to distribute 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.550
 the protector and to untangle the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.890
 hair we select the top 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.309
 to spend there the iron and while 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.229
 we both hold the rest in the part 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.989
 let's go let's make some very 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.420
 soft with the iron is basically to give 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.350
 a turn and slide 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.350
 ah 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.010
 in the description of the video I leave you the 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.550
 link of how to make these waves in all 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.550
 your hair 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.340
 when you have finished with this section 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.780
 should jump the hair and make waves 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.320
 the whiskers 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.320
 ah 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.220
 you will have some very light waves 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.610
 that help us to give volume to the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.610
 hairstyle 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.590
 we select the hair from the crown 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.420
 and like doing a half pigtail what 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.890
 we push a little bit in front and 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.890
 we put pins 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.060
 here you should be generous with the volume of 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.240
 this part 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.240
 ah 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.930
 and then we take the millions of 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.530
 sideburns and we cross them over 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.530
 the pins 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.390
 from there we started to make a 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.580
 French braid for this you take a 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.820
 tuft and you take it to between the two 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.650
 from hesse and adds his new 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.860
 tuft that is now in the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.860
 medium 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.500
 ah 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.870
 what do you keep doing this until 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.870
 finish with your hair 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.600
 once you have fastened your hair 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.880
 You must climb from your braid to the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.600
 sides to get it to look done 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.600
 with a lot of hair 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.550
 honestly it will be very complicated if you 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.950
 you have the hair with a cut in many 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.340
 layers because they easily escape 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.340
 hair 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.690
 to finish we remove the pins and 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.690
 we apply fixer and ready 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.670
 ah 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.180
 ah 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.319
 for this hairstyle you need to have 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.510
 pretty long hair the truth I 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.280
 I batted a little bit because my hair is not 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.019
 long enough I suggest 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.760
 that you use extensions and 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.730
 you have out there at hand to give a lot 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.319
 more volume to our braid if you liked 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.299

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.099
