this<00:01:57.360> game<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.810> camera<00:01:58.110> looks<00:01:58.290> very<00:01:58.469> similar

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
this game this camera looks very similar

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.770 
this game this camera looks very similar
to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> F<00:01:59.130> 770<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.180> seen<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.540> video

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
to the F 770 so have you seen that video

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.870 
to the F 770 so have you seen that video
there's<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.469> much<00:02:01.680> change<00:02:02.219> at<00:02:02.399> all<00:02:02.549> again

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
there's not much change at all again

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.670 
there's not much change at all again
I'll<00:02:03.000> point<00:02:03.180> out<00:02:03.299> some<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> key<00:02:04.229> points<00:02:04.590> on

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
I'll point out some of the key points on

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.130 
I'll point out some of the key points on
this<00:02:04.770> cam<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.700> 20<00:02:06.090> x<00:02:06.390> room<00:02:06.659> lens<00:02:06.930> is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
this cam you have the 20 x room lens is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.469 
this cam you have the 20 x room lens is
the<00:02:07.229> fujinon<00:02:07.530> zoom<00:02:07.979> wide-angle<00:02:08.310> starts<00:02:09.300> off<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the fujinon zoom wide-angle starts off a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
the fujinon zoom wide-angle starts off a
25<00:02:09.959> millimeter<00:02:10.229> which<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.979> pretty<00:02:11.160> wide

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
25 millimeter which is that pretty wide

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.350 
25 millimeter which is that pretty wide
and<00:02:11.819> if

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and if

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.730 
and if
of<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> camry<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.050> have<00:02:13.200> these<00:02:13.350> two<00:02:13.590> little

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
of the camry you have these two little

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.250 
of the camry you have these two little
microphone<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.850> does<00:02:15.060> record<00:02:15.420> Full<00:02:15.600> HD<00:02:15.630> video

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
microphone it does record Full HD video

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.840 
microphone it does record Full HD video
so<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> stereo<00:02:16.980> sound<00:02:17.310> mics<00:02:17.640> on

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
so you have the stereo sound mics on

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.210 
so you have the stereo sound mics on
that<00:02:18.320> you<00:02:19.320> also<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:19.830> little<00:02:20.010> bubble

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
that you also have this little bubble

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.890 
that you also have this little bubble
eyes<00:02:20.460> grip<00:02:20.850> right<00:02:21.060> here<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.600> makes<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.870> a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
eyes grip right here so it makes it a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.480 
eyes grip right here so it makes it a
little<00:02:21.990> easier<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.440> hold<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.770> camera<00:02:23.040> of

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
little easier to hold the camera of

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.920 
little easier to hold the camera of
course<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.790> camera<00:02:24.060> also<00:02:24.210> includes<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.750> hand

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
course the camera also includes a hand

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.480 
course the camera also includes a hand
strap<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.650> actually<00:02:25.770> don't<00:02:26.130> drop<00:02:26.460> it

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
strap so that you actually don't drop it

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.150 
strap so that you actually don't drop it
what<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.540> see<00:02:27.720> beaten<00:02:27.960> in<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.680> point<00:02:29.010> right

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
what you see beaten in this point right

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.140 
what you see beaten in this point right
here<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:31.140> assist<00:02:32.010> lamp<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:33.000> low

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
here is the the assist lamp so in low

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.700 
here is the the assist lamp so in low
light<00:02:33.330> situation<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.080> cam<00:02:34.290> will<00:02:34.470> file<00:02:34.680> a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
light situation the cam will file a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.470 
light situation the cam will file a
little<00:02:35.040> light<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.430> help<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.880> illuminate<00:02:36.330> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
little light to help you illuminate the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.870 
little light to help you illuminate the
subject<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.020> for<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> camera<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.040> obtain

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
subject and for the camera to obtain

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.020 
subject and for the camera to obtain
faster<00:02:39.360> focuses<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:40.170> position<00:02:41.030> you'll

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
faster focuses in that position you'll

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.030 
faster focuses in that position you'll
notice<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.450> their<00:02:42.630> left<00:02:42.810> bottom<00:02:43.500> side<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:43.920> see

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
notice on their left bottom side you see

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.770 
notice on their left bottom side you see
the<00:02:44.130> EXR<00:02:44.700> logo<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.180> that's<00:02:45.300> because<00:02:45.480> this

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
the EXR logo and that's because this

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.710 
the EXR logo and that's because this
camera<00:02:46.110> uses<00:02:46.410> our<00:02:46.590> exs<00:02:47.310> sensor<00:02:47.700> technology<00:02:48.330> as

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
camera uses our exs sensor technology as

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.810 
camera uses our exs sensor technology as

provide outstanding images inserted any

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.979 
provide outstanding images inserted any
lighting<00:02:53.280> situations<00:02:53.940> I've<00:02:54.510> look<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:54.930> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
lighting situations I've look on the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.690 
lighting situations I've look on the
side<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.500> camera<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.950> course<00:02:56.010> there<00:02:56.580> is

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
side of the camera of course there is

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.430 
side of the camera of course there is
actually<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.090> button<00:02:57.450> for<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.720> flash<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.350> it

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
actually a button for the flash and it

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.680 
actually a button for the flash and it
allows<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.860> pop<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.250> flash<00:02:59.459> open<00:03:00.030> as<00:03:00.180> you

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
allows you to pop the flash open as you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.630 
allows you to pop the flash open as you
can<00:03:00.810> see<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.230> flash<00:03:01.500> slightly<00:03:02.280> moves<00:03:02.489> to

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
can see that a flash slightly moves to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.699 
can see that a flash slightly moves to
the<00:03:02.730> forward<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.450> for<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.440> love<00:03:04.590> it

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
the forward because for the love it

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.170 
the forward because for the love it
because<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.070> long<00:03:05.340> zoom<00:03:05.670> right<00:03:05.850> because<00:03:06.150> I

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
because of the long zoom right because I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.400 
because of the long zoom right because I
want<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.390> create<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.660> shadow<00:03:06.900> if<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.200> want<00:03:07.350> to

want to create a shadow if you want to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.990 
want to create a shadow if you want to
disable<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.950> flash<00:03:08.130> it's<00:03:08.550> basically<00:03:08.910> just

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
disable the flash it's basically just

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.540 
disable the flash it's basically just
play<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.420> flash<00:03:09.750> back<00:03:10.170> in<00:03:10.470> again<00:03:10.770> on<00:03:11.459> the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
play the flash back in again on the
