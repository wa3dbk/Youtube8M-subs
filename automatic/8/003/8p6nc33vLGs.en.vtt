00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.850
 aging a subject that touches 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.410
 literally everyone 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.080
 what will happen if there was a 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.480
 revolutionary solution the answer the 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.490
 stem cells stem cells 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.650
 actually have our fountain of youth 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.960
 they are the ones that preserve our ability 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.519
 restorative and regenerative body 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.980
 as we get older 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.970
 every cell is degraded and needs to be 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.529
 replaced 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.570
 the cell that replaces it is a 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.310
 stem cell 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.289
 using stem cells a 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.420
 company has developed a complex of 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.250
 special growth factors that 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.840
 heals our cells and slows down 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.440
 the appearance of the process of 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.660
 aging 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.340
 the process begins by seeking the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.700
 best stem cells in the body 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.140
 human 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.030
 we find them in the layer 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.400
 greasy using a syringe 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.730
 sterile specifically designed for this 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.610
 task 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.620
 the doctors extreme mixture mixture of 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.900
 adipose tissue and a group of 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.330
 stem cells scene technicians 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.400
 laboratory then separates the cells 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.510
 fat cell strains by 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.820
 centrifugation 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.559
 then the stem cells are placed 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.839
 in a petri dish then feeds 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.890
 adequately to grow as and when 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.410
 as she crosses 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.539
 it multiplies rapidly and occupies 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.979
 all the holes and gaps its 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.899
 similar to the way the body 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.640
 healed his wounds during this 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.619
 stage the stem cells releases a 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.630
 chemical signal called factor of 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.430
 growth is the cell language 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.960
 that's the way the thousands of 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.610
 cells communicate with each other for 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.009
 perform their vital functions 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.990
 repair and regeneration of 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.030
 body tissues the factors of 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.369
 growth are the crucial ingredient of 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.590
 this rejuvenation system developed by 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.200
 a world leader in this technology 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.700
 now called the Youth 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.070
 product at the cutting edge of 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.509
 technology l umih are born the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.549
 stem cell technology is 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.020
 very important in medicine and in 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.759
 the cosmetics industry 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.369
 since it allows us to give to 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.229
 body exactly the same factor of 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.210
 grow the same signals that him 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.210
 say to repair and regenerate themselves 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.929
 by applying the mines to your skin 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.609
 it's the same process as in the 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.990
 petri dish the factors of 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.909
 growth present in products 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.459
 bright talking to the cells of your 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.260
 body the result you look more 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.830
 in younger health and you have a 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.830
 better appearance
