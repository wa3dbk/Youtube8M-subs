00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
good evidence that drawing is not

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.070 
good evidence that drawing is not
old-fashioned<00:02:08.009> or<00:02:08.160> old-school<00:02:09.080> surprisingly

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080

big<00:02:41.790> distinction<00:02:42.620> visual<00:02:43.620> creation<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.310> just

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
big distinction visual creation is just

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.400 
big distinction visual creation is just
a<00:02:44.730> wider<00:02:44.940> definition<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.870> what<00:02:46.260> I'm<00:02:46.380> doing

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
a wider definition of what I'm doing

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.250 
a wider definition of what I'm doing
it's<00:02:47.280> not<00:02:47.430> just<00:02:47.760> photography<00:02:48.480> it's<00:02:48.810> not<00:02:49.080> just

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
it's not just photography it's not just

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.830 
it's not just photography it's not just
painting<00:02:49.800> or<00:02:50.040> not<00:02:50.520> just<00:02:50.760> throwing<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.600> big

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
painting or not just throwing it's a big

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.130 
painting or not just throwing it's a big
combination<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.740> everything<00:02:53.280> that's<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:54.140> I've

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
little about the process of these

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.420 
little about the process of these
pictures<00:03:20.670> well<00:03:21.510> before<00:03:21.989> starting<00:03:22.980> pencils

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
pictures well before starting pencils

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.060 
pictures well before starting pencils
versus<00:03:23.790> camera<00:03:24.090> last<00:03:24.420> year<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.900> used<00:03:24.930> drew<00:03:25.739> and

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070

shoot pictures on a daily basis one
morning<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.519> thought<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.940> would<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.239> nice<00:03:30.450> to

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
morning I thought it would be nice to

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.150 
morning I thought it would be nice to
actually<00:03:30.989> blend<00:03:31.230> these<00:03:31.500> two<00:03:31.739> mediums

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
actually blend these two mediums

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.400 
actually blend these two mediums
together<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.790> posted<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.690> first<00:03:33.870> picture<00:03:34.380> and

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
together I posted the first picture and

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.830 
together I posted the first picture and
the<00:03:34.769> feedbacks<00:03:35.400> were<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:35.910> massive<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.630> I

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the feedbacks were so massive that I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.070 
the feedbacks were so massive that I
felt<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.380> was<00:03:37.410> bound<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.040> make<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.370> whole<00:03:38.730> series

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
felt I was bound to make a whole series

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
random moments most of the time I

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.790 
random moments most of the time I
execute<00:04:03.030> my<00:04:03.239> IDs<00:04:03.690> several<00:04:04.170> days<00:04:04.440> or<00:04:04.769> weeks

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.840 
after to come to my mind
okay<00:04:07.739> so<00:04:07.800> then<00:04:08.130> would<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.430> say<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.760> you

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
okay so then would you say that you

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.910 
okay so then would you say that you
purposely<00:04:09.450> sort<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.870> create<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:10.590> then

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
purposely sort of create and then

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.370 
purposely sort of create and then
confirm<00:04:11.519> your<00:04:11.580> own<00:04:11.940> add<00:04:12.120> imagination<00:04:12.989> by

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
confirm your own add imagination by

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.259 
confirm your own add imagination by
integrating<00:04:14.070> it<00:04:14.160> through<00:04:14.519> juxtaposition

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
integrating it through juxtaposition

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.030 
integrating it through juxtaposition
with<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.570> real<00:04:15.720> world<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.229> then<00:04:16.739> sort<00:04:16.979> of

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
with the real world and then sort of

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.820 
with the real world and then sort of
like<00:04:17.100> capture<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.850> imagined<00:04:18.630> reality<00:04:19.109> with

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
like capture the imagined reality with

like capture the imagined reality with
the<00:04:20.519> camera<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.120> mechanics<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.870> camera<00:04:22.229> I

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
the camera the mechanics of the camera I

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.770 
the camera the mechanics of the camera I
would<00:04:22.530> say<00:04:22.770> yes<00:04:23.520> indeed<00:04:23.910> in<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.479> series

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
would say yes indeed in this series

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.580 
would say yes indeed in this series
there<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.110> a
