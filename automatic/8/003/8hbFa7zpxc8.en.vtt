00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello and welcome back to the 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.310
 small addendum to our europe 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.500
 universalis round of war fatigue 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.870
 we tested that with the one now 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.780
 The Handelsblatt explains his videos 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.630
 said my strategy was actually 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.310
 pushing trade in africa and asia 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.470
 By being a trading company 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.939
 build there because of the wikipedia tip 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.650
 said that you get a bonus from it 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.420
 I got into the pool 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.490
 I looked at made the raid 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 stevia , however, was right and 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.369
 nevertheless it was wrong we have it 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.529
 I can test that a bit more 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.420
 explain in detail the same though always 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.280
 not everything yet, because it is clear 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.899
 But let's start at the beginning , though 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.489
 you counted on that in front of it 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.390
 had now ruined again 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.739
 turn on fast 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.079
 oh I can no longer turn on 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.300
 the clicks went out horny 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.590
 ok so who uses it on it goes with it 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.059
 This trading looks then then falls 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.160
 stood there in the tooltip in the core nothing 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.510
 other than that he if he man 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.129
 if I produce this here and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.160
 then're running on decency by my 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.809
 increase trading power by 50 percent 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.280
 and really about the trading profit 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.930
 I increased your trading value incorrectly 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.390
 but has read the mechanics 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.119
 still correct because the wikipedia 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.340
 namely clearly says that because 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 your trading power has that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 production bonus equal or trading 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.290
 power is always like the first 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.070
 video posted on the sites run 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.229
 wanted to read about 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.680
 that is to say if their trading power 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.850
 then everyone will be in this trade 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.439
 Regions of this red here for example 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 in the blue where the update the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.770
 company if he then just the same or 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.790
 trading power get a bonus 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.829
 your production 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.360
 you can usually do that afterwards 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.740
 look which is below then the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.840
 naturally identified with here it is 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.729
 still just trading company 1 percent 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.500
 I'm not sure where they are up there 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.329
 should there seems my mistake to say I 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.560
 can go from there as wanted the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.259
 ruled have not got what 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 had then tested and done 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.600
 it found that a ratio 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.420
 from one to ten 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 Say, if I trade power here 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.439
 have had from that was the kind of 7% 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.329
 or so but below 07 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.189
 therefore it should be noticed now that if 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.360
 Italy is getting smaller so is the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.409
 value does not change but he has it 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.119
 almost doubled 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.380
 So the second province was taken here 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.429
 and we are not all over 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.810
 the mechanics work 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.790
 we can only go to 100 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.010
 Summon that is not like that 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.689
 wikipedia says wikipedia just says 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.950
 Trading offsets production to ground 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.019
 the others get when you have yours 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.579
 trading company there that was 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.140
 not the case right the Sun does not say 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.939
 also not paradoxical tooltip of the matter 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.379
 has only wikipedia , however, too 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.790
 that for the old patch was therefore 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.989
 I'll go change out the paradox 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.439
 but it did not exist 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.010
 changed 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.269
 Therefore problematic so the question who 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.409
 Now how can you do all this for now 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.599
 well know that he is using now 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.799
 nothing works anyway 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.540
 as I originally imagined 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.700
 have that you can push the trade and 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.010
 Although simply because you are right 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.450
 you get 1 50% trading power 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.010
 namely if you have a trading 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.810
 Company has got this red area 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.040
 a dealer in vain so he looks at me 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.629
 Now I'm starting to ask two questions behind 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.829
 to if I now wanted one percent 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.519
 which is very easy then I have one 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.290
 third dealer 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.389
 which is really massive and if he is 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.519
 sometimes many regions do not exist 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.319
 colored and region by potentially one 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.909
 Dealer we can get that quite 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.609
 huge and these dealers 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.930
 the amount to through the trade in 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.879
 I can move in any direction 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.469
 want to have and then just the case here 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.909
 above together trading partners around in 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.919
 whose asia then makes me chic then 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.629
 to the also high Alexandria from there 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.699
 a little further down here, etc 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.900
 that means I'll get the whole one 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.549
 Dealer needs through trading 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.780
 company and can but the trade 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.939
 we can not push so much 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.409
 Push that originally wanted but it 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.810
 anyway so if nobody does it now 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.879
 everything would be in the money 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.979
 Africa Asia is lying there we are staying 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.109
 so with the mechanics still high after 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.459
 europe and thus rich and therefore 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.750
 that works pretty much the goal 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.449
 and that can be nice and so on 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.799
 games without any problem only with the 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.359
 production floor for such a thing 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.799
 Now comes the production process 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.810
 but again very briefly exists 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.459
 namely, that's just very 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.009
 under quite painful but I again 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.759
 works and you can do that 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.370
 she said it has unfortunately now 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.870
 abroad is rossmann simulate but in 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.879
 each team a good product is 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.530
 normally displayed and when I as 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.759
 ten percent then he was 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.349
 at the beginning to a percent 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.639
 but after that somehow 12 percent existed 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.470
 still 1 percent has stayed here 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:07.709
 a 2 province then a standardized one 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.519
 of 09 that was sometime on 14 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.599
 increased 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.489
 or in other words the 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.349
 production base peanuts and we know 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.970
 not what values may depend 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.099
 can you push it up we have that 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.720
 feel that they are rather small things 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:22.699
 that 's not very busy with the thing so 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.870
 that raised here by about 10 and somehow 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.120
 then you have to be in super brothers 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.830
 obviously then it always has 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.750
 still peanuts so there is no mechanics 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.520
 must happen all the opposite to that 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.639
 Dealers you get per trade 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.379
 ford with 1 50 percent of therefore the 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.210
 neglect cameras there is one 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:41.080
 other thing years ago 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.190
 that is very relevant here that is 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.440
 if you are a trade republic and 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.789
 the life and again chipfabrik is 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.199
 no trade republic she has to stop 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.060
 also can not stand for public here 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.729
 are there to become public the others 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.259
 all the public key of the biscuit you play a 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.599
 merge a republic if you are in the real one 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.550
 Big is probably synonymous little 2 is getting 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.500
 But you get a modification that 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.590
 neighbors on their production, then 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.419
 in that he is neighbor of the biscuit 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.310
 get in front here 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.569
 draufklicken you get here in front of 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.539
 The trade republic a bonus 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.039
 increased talk down there trading 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.080
 people for paper gold trade company is 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.569
 43 percent is the trade company bonus 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.639
 I do the same to those who do theirs 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.979
 Not company farmers usually pro 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.610
 PROVINCE somewhere around 0.9 percent 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.039
 I noticed 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.360
 while at the cookie that you are ahead 43 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.310
 percent is not enough for me is just that 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.169
 and that you come between right 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.000
 hardcore bonus for his neighbors though 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.500
 our neighbors when he goes his country 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.330
 he not only gets him for himself 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.440
 but his neighbors only go 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.150
 if they are not western probably 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.080
 times when but it is that we now 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.180
 not the war anyway 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.349
 can work together because I want 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.729
 me the dealers for example because 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.650
 any valuable province is to 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.520
 example gold province hebei times somewhere 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.940
 Gold something great then gold somewhere 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.860
 the biscuit is simply the one to go there 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.240
 build his next to it by 40% 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.969
 pushed if that works like this 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.259
 test yet and I do that just simply 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.639
 push pharma up because I have the 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.139
 he has the power to trade 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.210
 Production value in the valuable 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.590
 provinces makes the higher and me 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.029
 wrote that up today we can 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.699
 nevertheless one team working together are 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.840
 here actually or here colorant around 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.460
 there is everything there 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.780
 So you have to watch that the war is over 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.540
 then maybe bring some province 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.030
 the relatively valuable valuable neighbors 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.620
 had to push us 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.330
 you have to go there almost continuously 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.950
 all corners we have the exactly one 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.150
 lose weight because the clear 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.550
 Of course, production remains in the 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.500
 province that does not belong to us but the one 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.540
 Production value is indeed one 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.860
 Trade value goes into my port where 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.540
 I have the power I love that 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.250
 above there is not the departure 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.240
 that means you have great team work 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.340
 also in the hold now rather by chance 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.169
 Something has been created in this form 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.850
 planned differently but that definitely 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.620
 the new scenario will build that 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.150
 I will choose the goals click you 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.860
 in common the goals just for him 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.780
 youthful quasi view is used 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.100
 and that then supposedly develops 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.500
 for trade to europe push 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.750
 Depart quietly and leave on paul the 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.610
 who wants to have 400 reddig in front of the europe 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.050
 such a supertype even makes 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.500
 another tick more fun than originally 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.270
 thought 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.160
 annoying only that he deals with the mechanics 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.390
 works wikipedia that meant me 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.770
 the children are not for me either 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.650
 I assume that size worked out 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.970
 then someday stuck and took him 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.500
 forget the rule change rubber too 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.310
 explain if he knows how exactly 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.050
 go more now 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.419
 it does not matter is in any case 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.070
 anyway and that is the things and things 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:21.810
 So we go to the second tonight 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.120
 a day's skiing in 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.260
 yes that was all I should still 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.390
 quickly get rid of 8 another one 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.710
 short thing is its people have the 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.960
 have criticized that under the video 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.220
 that said , that's ok 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.810
 is definitely when error is always 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.550
 say he is not okay if you are 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.140
 that made home today and 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.880
 then answer button makes that one 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.169
 little weed in my view that 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.700
 I can not quite have it off so we 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:43.710
 that criticize probably always like to say 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.600
 if he does that in the evil way 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.220
 do not want to do so but with it 

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.510
 But it does not have to be there either 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.340
 Answer button I find that 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.970
 not okay so that does not have to be said 

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.970
 it at the same time
