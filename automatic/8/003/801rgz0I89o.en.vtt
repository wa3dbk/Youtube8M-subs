00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.460
 is and let's date more creative than 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.859
 cement here is the america-mg invitation to 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:23.220
 square meters and a man has 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:26.099
 impact of law and boys is the EUC is the ong 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.099
 lighting starting point which is a 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.630
 which I have as a starting point in 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:37.079
 all the projects that I execute that have 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.020
 as well as a higher requirement in which 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.170
 people emphasize the sophistication and refinement 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.350
 and that in all the elements that make up 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.989
 the project because he was born she creates 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.149
 senates she highlights and she 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.449
 actually personalize an environment having 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.410
 so in this room created four 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.559
 scenarios are not having as the disks the sky 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.380
 star is highlighted by led points 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.409
 which were applied individually 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.480
 there we have the complement and that is 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.840
 administration and light 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.500
 you control as needed 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.630
 right you want to create log also has 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.910
 as well as a very large 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.380
 customers have enjoyed the 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:31.320
 sculptures they gave on the walls is 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.520
 also thought of providing for the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.220
 Mom when she's sitting she has 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.400
 comfort for the baby I also worked 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.950
 with the furniture is straight lines 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400
 even to give a break in lighting 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.770
 was worked on the most popular lines 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.510
 It's night time I've already married the right lines. 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.270
 then I thought giving all this 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.490
 symmetry in the movement was a knock 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.100
 studied is thinking of meeting the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.680
 Baby growth because if you 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.590
 follow every room reading you 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.720
 that you replace the cradle with a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.869
 You do not want to see all this sofa bed. 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.810
 study you have for the game of flowers 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.600
 that you have you end up with a point and 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.420
 playing with the side tables 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.640
 it's like they are three you have that 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.490
 reading that you can play with it if 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.130
 not losing all is is all 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.010
 dramatization that you have in the 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.980
 elements that we used is paper from 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.000
 wall was beaten in the decorations with 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.820
 the pendant you have is in the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.120
 side that made the same bajur was 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.950
 customized with the shade 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.140
 no check the show is ok 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.940
 interesting and I have seen that the 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.780
 customers who would like 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.450
 i is the return is being very good and 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.650
 show promises a lot 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:04.380
 it was my first show a sweetie 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:07.890
 very interesting to have sat in a car 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.220
 all environments have well-designed 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.220
