need to brand myself there was none of
that<00:02:28.350> back<00:02:28.650> then<00:02:28.970> there<00:02:29.970> was<00:02:30.090> no<00:02:30.120> crossover<00:02:30.780> I

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
that back then there was no crossover I

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.390 
that back then there was no crossover I
was<00:02:31.230> doing<00:02:31.440> my<00:02:31.530> thing<00:02:31.560> in<00:02:31.830> Spanish<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.340> in

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
was doing my thing in Spanish and in

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.250 
was doing my thing in Spanish and in
English<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.060> word<00:02:33.180> crossover<00:02:33.900> wasn't

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
