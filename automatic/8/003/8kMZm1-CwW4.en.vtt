we're<00:00:03.500> now<00:00:03.650> going<00:00:03.949> to<00:00:04.069> busting<00:00:04.430> out<00:00:04.550> the

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
we're now going to busting out the

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.269 
we're now going to busting out the
ceiling<00:00:05.380> and<00:00:06.380> we're<00:00:06.529> doing<00:00:06.770> this<00:00:06.920> because

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279 
ceiling and we're doing this because

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.789 
ceiling and we're doing this because
later<00:00:08.000> on<00:00:08.180> we're<00:00:08.330> going<00:00:08.420> to<00:00:08.480> put<00:00:08.540> PVC<00:00:09.410> cladding

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:09.799 
later on we're going to put PVC cladding

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.740 
later on we're going to put PVC cladding
up<00:00:09.920> on<00:00:10.190> the<00:00:10.280> ceiling<00:00:10.670> so<00:00:10.820> I'm<00:00:11.570> going<00:00:11.719> to

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
up on the ceiling so I'm going to

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.320 
up on the ceiling so I'm going to
passing<00:00:12.080> it<00:00:12.110> out<00:00:12.230> using<00:00:12.530> this<00:00:12.740> 20<00:00:13.250> mm<00:00:13.430> by<00:00:13.760> 32

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
passing it out using this 20 mm by 32

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.620 
passing it out using this 20 mm by 32
email<00:00:14.660> button<00:00:15.910> so<00:00:16.910> all<00:00:17.029> we<00:00:17.119> do<00:00:17.240> is<00:00:17.360> we<00:00:17.449> screw

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
email button so all we do is we screw

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.040 
email button so all we do is we screw
into<00:00:17.779> the<00:00:17.869> ceiling<00:00:18.279> that<00:00:19.279> way<00:00:19.460> around<00:00:20.050> using

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
into the ceiling that way around using

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.050 
into the ceiling that way around using
some<00:00:21.349> screws<00:00:21.710> that<00:00:22.250> are<00:00:22.310> long<00:00:22.519> enough<00:00:22.550> to<00:00:22.939> go

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
some screws that are long enough to go

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.960 
some screws that are long enough to go
through<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:23.390> actual<00:00:23.539> button<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:25.550> plus<00:00:25.789> the

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
through the actual button the plus the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.849 
through the actual button the plus the
void<00:00:26.119> on<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.390> ceiling<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:26.990> then<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:27.619> joist

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
void on the ceiling and then the joist

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.850 
void on the ceiling and then the joist
itself<00:00:29.439> and<00:00:30.439> once<00:00:30.740> we've<00:00:30.919> done<00:00:31.039> that<00:00:32.860> we're

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
itself and once we've done that we're

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.330 
itself and once we've done that we're
going<00:00:33.950> to<00:00:34.010> get<00:00:34.130> our<00:00:34.310> peak<00:00:34.719> spirit<00:00:35.719> level<00:00:36.340> and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
going to get our peak spirit level and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.500 
going to get our peak spirit level and
we're<00:00:37.430> going<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.610> loom<00:00:37.789> that<00:00:38.000> between<00:00:38.270> the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
we're going to loom that between the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.450 
we're going to loom that between the
buttons<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.260> we'll<00:00:39.469> find<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.800> lost<00:00:40.010> button

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
buttons and we'll find the lost button

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.819 
buttons and we'll find the lost button
because<00:00:40.789> the<00:00:40.910> ceiling<00:00:41.300> is<00:00:41.329> I<00:00:41.539> text<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.530> I'll

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
because the ceiling is I text so I'll

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.810 
because the ceiling is I text so I'll
give<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:43.160> some<00:00:43.190> more<00:00:43.460> points<00:00:45.250> so<00:00:46.250> find<00:00:46.730> the

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
give it some more points so find the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.270 
give it some more points so find the
lost<00:00:47.000> points<00:00:47.239> on<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:47.570> ceiling<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:49.160> then

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
lost points on the ceiling and then

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.330 
lost points on the ceiling and then
we'll<00:00:49.489> go<00:00:49.609> along<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.930> what<00:00:51.140> Pat<00:00:51.350> how's<00:00:51.590> the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
we'll go along and what Pat how's the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.540 
we'll go along and what Pat how's the
wrongs<00:00:52.579> are<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:52.820> two<00:00:53.030> I<00:00:53.059> using<00:00:53.840> these<00:00:53.989> Packers

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
wrongs are the two I using these Packers

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.069 
wrongs are the two I using these Packers
and<00:00:55.550> these<00:00:55.670> come<00:00:55.879> in<00:00:56.030> various<00:00:56.300> different

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
and these come in various different

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.099 
and these come in various different
thicknesses<00:00:57.739> ranging<00:00:58.579> from<00:00:59.090> water<00:00:59.750> mail<00:00:59.960> up

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
thicknesses ranging from water mail up

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.790 
thicknesses ranging from water mail up
to<00:01:00.289> ten<00:01:00.589> mil<00:01:01.570> then<00:01:02.570> on<00:01:02.690> fitzpatl<00:01:03.230> buttons<00:01:03.649> are

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
to ten mil then on fitzpatl buttons are

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.560 
to ten mil then on fitzpatl buttons are
with<00:01:03.980> all<00:01:04.129> sorts<00:01:04.910> of<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.089> buttons<00:01:05.449> are

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
with all sorts of the buttons are

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.600 
with all sorts of the buttons are
completely<00:01:06.020> flat<00:01:06.170> for<00:01:06.950> when<00:01:07.040> we<00:01:07.160> come<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.430> fix

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
completely flat for when we come to fix

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.060 
completely flat for when we come to fix
the<00:01:07.700> cladding<00:01:08.230> so<00:01:09.230> on<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> position<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.920> first

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
the cladding so on a position the first

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.680 
the cladding so on a position the first
button<00:01:10.340> solves<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:10.940> it's<00:01:11.060> about<00:01:11.150> an<00:01:11.390> inch<00:01:11.480> away

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
button solves of it's about an inch away

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:29.730 
button solves of it's about an inch away
from<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.050> actual<00:01:12.440> wall

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.110 

don't<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.010> see<00:01:31.159> that<00:01:31.340> out<00:01:31.550> of<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.790> screen

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
don't you can see that out of the screen

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.469 
don't you can see that out of the screen
called<00:01:32.600> battens<00:01:33.080> over<00:01:33.440> them<00:01:33.909> these<00:01:34.909> are<00:01:34.970> self

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
called battens over them these are self

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:56.039 
called battens over them these are self
countersinking<00:01:36.170> screws<00:01:36.500> are<00:01:36.740> really<00:01:37.010> good

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.480 

so<00:01:57.049> that<00:01:57.320> fixed<00:01:57.650> all<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.830> buttons<00:01:58.220> in

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
so that fixed all the buttons in

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.390 
so that fixed all the buttons in
position<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.270> the<00:02:00.110> amount<00:02:00.799> more<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.070> stay<00:02:01.340> -

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
position and the amount more to stay -

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.310 
position and the amount more to stay -
anything<00:02:01.850> more<00:02:01.970> that's<00:02:02.119> my<00:02:02.299> important<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
anything more that's my important the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.870 
anything more that's my important the
important<00:02:03.770> things<00:02:03.950> at<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.220> level<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:04.759> the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
important things at the level and the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.539 
important things at the level and the
defects<00:02:05.240> securely<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.740> need<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.220> do<00:02:07.280> is<00:02:07.400> get

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
defects securely so I need to do is get

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.449 
defects securely so I need to do is get
up<00:02:07.640> there<00:02:07.850> with<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.780> spirit<00:02:09.080> level<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.560> check

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
up there with the spirit level and check

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.340 
up there with the spirit level and check
that<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.700> oil<00:02:10.850> level<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.810> we<00:02:11.930> need<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.140> find

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
that the oil level so we need to find

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.309 
that the oil level so we need to find
the<00:02:12.500> lowest<00:02:12.739> power<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.970> we<00:02:14.060> can<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.230> I've

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
the lowest power that we can so I've

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.380 
the lowest power that we can so I've
actually<00:02:15.440> checked<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.430> buttons<00:02:16.790> already<00:02:17.090> and

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
actually checked the buttons already and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.840 
actually checked the buttons already and
all<00:02:17.480> where<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.690> lowest<00:02:17.959> part<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.730> laws

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
all where the lowest part is the laws

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.270 
all where the lowest part is the laws
part<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.540> actually<00:02:26.690> here<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.620> past<00:02:28.069> this

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
part is actually here just past this

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.670 
part is actually here just past this
hatch<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:29.269> we<00:02:29.390> do<00:02:29.480> actually<00:02:29.690> clear<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.410> Arts

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
hatch so we do actually clear the Arts

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.860 
hatch so we do actually clear the Arts
Building<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:31.250> we<00:02:31.340> can<00:02:31.489> leave<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.670> on

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.030 

if<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.049> look<00:02:37.200> there<00:02:37.409> you<00:02:37.530> can<00:02:37.650> see<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
if you look there you can see that the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.479 
if you look there you can see that the
button<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:39.530> perfectly<00:02:40.530> level<00:02:40.709> though<00:02:41.040> not<00:02:41.459> a

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
button is perfectly level though not a

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.170 
button is perfectly level though not a
lot<00:02:41.790> point<00:02:43.610> so<00:02:44.610> we're<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.879> use<00:02:45.030> that

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
lot point so we're going to use that

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.850 
lot point so we're going to use that
today<00:02:45.360> at<00:02:45.599> some<00:02:45.750> point<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.620> we're<00:02:46.709> going<00:02:46.830> to

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
today at some point and we're going to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.160 
today at some point and we're going to
lower<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.519> button<00:02:47.940> along<00:02:48.330> its<00:02:48.510> length<00:02:48.720> until

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
lower the button along its length until

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.259 
lower the button along its length until
it's<00:02:49.290> completely<00:02:49.680> level<00:02:50.069> like<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:51.150> then

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
it's completely level like and then

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.220 
it's completely level like and then
we're<00:02:51.390> going<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.540> lower<00:02:51.690> all<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:51.989> other

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
we're going to lower all the other

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.380 
we're going to lower all the other
buttons<00:02:52.620> down<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> out<00:02:53.879> of<00:02:54.239> this

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
buttons down to the out of this

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.000 
buttons down to the out of this
particular<00:02:54.599> button<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.560> we're<00:02:55.680> leveling

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
particular button that we're leveling

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.880 
particular button that we're leveling
now<00:02:57.860> we<00:02:58.860> can<00:02:59.010> see<00:02:59.129> that<00:02:59.310> as<00:02:59.430> reasonably<00:02:59.970> level

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
now we can see that as reasonably level

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.580 
now we can see that as reasonably level
for<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.220> button<00:03:02.640> needs<00:03:03.629> packing<00:03:04.079> down<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.290> bit

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
for the button needs packing down a bit

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.190 
for the button needs packing down a bit
at<00:03:04.799> this<00:03:04.980> side<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:06.450> what<00:03:06.659> I'm<00:03:06.720> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.870> do<00:03:07.019> now

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
at this side so what I'm going to do now

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.319 
at this side so what I'm going to do now
is<00:03:07.319> I'm<00:03:07.409> going<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> go<00:03:07.680> along<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.129> button<00:03:08.549> I'm

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
is I'm going to go along this button I'm

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.509 
is I'm going to go along this button I'm
going<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.599> pack<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.560> do<00:03:10.709> some<00:03:10.890> Packers<00:03:11.280> and

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
going to pack it you do some Packers and

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.580 
going to pack it you do some Packers and
then<00:03:11.640> we're<00:03:11.849> tighten<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.989> screws<00:03:13.260> back<00:03:13.470> up

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
then we're tighten the screws back up

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.520 
then we're tighten the screws back up
again<00:03:14.510> once<00:03:15.510> we've<00:03:15.660> got<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:15.900> one<00:03:16.109> button

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
again once we've got this one button

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.039 
again once we've got this one button
completely<00:03:17.099> level<00:03:17.459> I'll<00:03:18.209> then<00:03:18.390> use<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.660> spirit

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
completely level I'll then use a spirit

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.229 
completely level I'll then use a spirit
level<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.590> I'll<00:03:19.769> go<00:03:19.890> across<00:03:20.160> all<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.120> other

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
level and I'll go across all the other

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.390 
level and I'll go across all the other
buttons<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.989> ensure<00:03:22.829> that<00:03:22.859> they're<00:03:23.190> level

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
buttons and ensure that they're level

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.399 
buttons and ensure that they're level
which<00:03:24.269> will<00:03:24.390> probably<00:03:24.569> mean<00:03:24.810> Pat<00:03:25.049> them<00:03:25.260> all

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
which will probably mean Pat them all

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.530 
which will probably mean Pat them all
down<00:03:25.879> obviously<00:03:26.879> I'm<00:03:27.180> going<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.359> be<00:03:27.420> working

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
down obviously I'm going to be working

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.470 
down obviously I'm going to be working
around<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.170> light<00:03:28.579> so<00:03:29.579> probably<00:03:30.000> starts<00:03:30.299> off

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
around the light so probably starts off

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.360 
around the light so probably starts off
there<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.560> then<00:03:32.370> once<00:03:32.670> it's<00:03:32.879> button<00:03:34.220> once<00:03:35.220> it

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
there and then once it's button once it

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.580 
there and then once it's button once it
button<00:03:35.700> here<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.120> level<00:03:36.480> at<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.049> point<00:03:37.319> where

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
button here is level at this point where

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.009 
button here is level at this point where
the<00:03:37.680> spirit<00:03:38.010> level<00:03:38.129> these<00:03:38.340> are<00:03:38.640> then<00:03:39.510> continue

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
the spirit level these are then continue

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.190 
the spirit level these are then continue
that<00:03:40.560> button<00:03:40.980> along<00:03:41.340> its<00:03:41.549> length<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.200> that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
that button along its length and that

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.920 
that button along its length and that
way<00:03:43.349> we<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.620> level<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.130> old<00:03:44.280> ceiling<00:03:44.730> out<00:03:44.930> so

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
way we can level the old ceiling out so

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.210 
way we can level the old ceiling out so
I'm<00:03:46.019> going<00:03:46.139> to<00:03:46.230> walk<00:03:46.349> there<00:03:46.530> now<00:03:46.709> I'm<00:03:46.980> going<00:03:47.160> to

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
I'm going to walk there now I'm going to

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.580 
I'm going to walk there now I'm going to
put<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.489> level<00:03:48.239> on<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.569> button<00:03:48.900> loosen<00:03:49.470> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
put the level on the button loosen the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.229 
put the level on the button loosen the
screw<00:03:49.829> off<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.280> then<00:03:50.760> I'm<00:03:50.849> going<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.060> pack

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
screw off and then I'm going to pack

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.000 
screw off and then I'm going to pack
behind<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> bus<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.200> using<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.859> correct

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
behind the bus and using the correct

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.610 
behind the bus and using the correct
thickness<00:03:53.400> shim<00:03:54.150> then<00:03:54.750> with<00:03:55.019> time<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.410> screw

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
thickness shim then with time to screw

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.589 
thickness shim then with time to screw
back<00:03:55.799> up<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.639> way<00:03:56.819> we'll<00:03:57.000> have<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.120> perfectly

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
back up that way we'll have a perfectly

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:45.130 
back up that way we'll have a perfectly
level<00:03:58.139> button

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.170 

so<00:04:46.140> I'll<00:04:46.200> just<00:04:46.350> place<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.740> fire<00:04:46.950> metal

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
so I'll just place the fire metal

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.620 
so I'll just place the fire metal
me<00:04:48.300> knowing<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:48.630> seems<00:04:48.960> about<00:04:49.140> right

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:01.220 

so<00:04:54.630> I'm<00:04:54.720> outside<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:55.380> one<00:04:55.530> buckle<00:05:00.110> so<00:05:01.110> I've

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
so I'm outside that one buckle so I've

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.370 
so I'm outside that one buckle so I've
used<00:05:01.260> this<00:05:01.560> live<00:05:02.250> spirit<00:05:02.730> level<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:04.260> ensure

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
used this live spirit level to ensure

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.610 
used this live spirit level to ensure
that<00:05:04.860> every<00:05:05.130> button<00:05:05.550> is<00:05:05.940> leveled<00:05:06.540> and<00:05:07.470> it's

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
that every button is leveled and it's

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.490 
that every button is leveled and it's
completely<00:05:07.890> local<00:05:08.250> enough<00:05:08.430> direction<00:05:09.060> and

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
completely local enough direction and

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.860 
completely local enough direction and
they<00:05:10.500> also<00:05:10.710> complete<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.340> level<00:05:11.760> in<00:05:12.180> that

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
they also complete the level in that

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.020 
they also complete the level in that
direction<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.590> someone<00:05:14.580> we're<00:05:14.700> going<00:05:14.820> to<00:05:14.910> put

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
direction to someone we're going to put

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.490 
direction to someone we're going to put
up<00:05:15.090> lighting<00:05:15.450> up<00:05:15.600> it<00:05:15.840> you'll<00:05:16.110> get<00:05:16.200> actually

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
up lighting up it you'll get actually

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.040 
up lighting up it you'll get actually
leads<00:05:16.800> it<00:05:17.070> because<00:05:17.430> the<00:05:18.150> butteriness<00:05:18.600> on<00:05:18.930> the

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
leads it because the butteriness on the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.340 
leads it because the butteriness on the
ceiling<00:05:19.440> is<00:05:19.680> now<00:05:19.950> level
