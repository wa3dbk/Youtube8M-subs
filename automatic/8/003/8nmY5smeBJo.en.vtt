00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hi everyone 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.530

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.269
 my american markets 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.700
 so this is a site that actually talks 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.500
 actually to eat like market the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.710
 suppose but actually even more 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.710
 interesting American food students 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.809
 was actually so madly and a youtube 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.919
 buzz who told me about it and it's true 

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:27.930
 that she had actually made a video 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.059
 above where she had just made her 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.869
 small order and I found that it was 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.550
 super interesting 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.930
 so actually had so much of 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.900
 narvik did not happen that I got 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.910

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.800
 you only a few weeks ago 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.540
 and in fact there are some products that 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.890
 I tasted and and others I did not have 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.450
 still time or so I really 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.000
 wanted to keep them for another moment 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.770
 so I will introduce you to the total 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.360
 even though I had tasted gold in 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.670
 first place I ordered 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.250

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.220
 like this is actually it all offers 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.450
 simply made it to dry this 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.840
 book is just dried meat 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.220
 with some spices and that's 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.650
 terribly good I honestly believe 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.870
 that ilham the dried meat always has me 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.490
 does a named effect I've always wanted 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.130

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.420

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.240

 so much the stream before such a 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.800
 the view to the states is an marshmallow 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.010

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.940

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.430
 little need for mika and in the end I 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.690

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.810

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.010
 good so here I'm going to give you a try 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:04:00.300
 it was a small town like that 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:04:03.180
 is a little slow to the apache you 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.620
 to show that looks a little like that of 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:11.100
 species of candy like it 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.580
 it's quite special enough it's rather 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.680
 fun 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.260

 explanation facing sowing to real bread and 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.870
 in fact it's scary because it's a 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.460
 Once it's done that it's a crunch 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.070
 apparently it's not super super good 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.490

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.540

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.740
 in fact it's the brand it offers 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.660

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:49.020

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:53.820
