this is a quick video to show you a fun
project<00:00:03.240> that<00:00:03.300> I'm<00:00:03.540> playing<00:00:03.780> playing<00:00:04.140> around

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
project that I'm playing playing around

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.330 
project that I'm playing playing around
with<00:00:04.529> since<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.730> DIY<00:00:06.480> fully<00:00:07.440> digital<00:00:08.069> low

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
latency surround video streamer for the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.930 
latency surround video streamer for the
oculus<00:00:12.660> rift<00:00:12.780> using<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.590> Raspberry<00:00:14.009> Pi<00:00:14.040> which

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
oculus rift using the Raspberry Pi which

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.269 
oculus rift using the Raspberry Pi which
is<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.210> mouthful<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.049> let<00:00:16.650> me<00:00:16.800> show<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.039> it's

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
is a mouthful but let me show you it's

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.640 
is a mouthful but let me show you it's
pretty<00:00:17.430> cool<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.600> dk2<00:00:19.080> oculus

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
pretty cool so we have the dk2 oculus

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.519 
pretty cool so we have the dk2 oculus
rift<00:00:19.859> connector<00:00:20.400> 2<00:00:20.550> PC<00:00:21.000> up<00:00:21.180> there<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.199> over

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
rift connector 2 PC up there and over

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.800 
rift connector 2 PC up there and over
there<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.220> compute<00:00:23.730> module<00:00:24.119> version<00:00:24.600> of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
there is the compute module version of

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.859 
there is the compute module version of
the<00:00:24.900> Raspberry<00:00:25.410> Pi<00:00:25.640> with<00:00:26.640> dual<00:00:26.849> cameras<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the Raspberry Pi with dual cameras and

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.210 
the Raspberry Pi with dual cameras and
you<00:00:27.990> can<00:00:28.140> see<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.590> light<00:00:28.740> streaming

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
you can see that it's light streaming

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.669 
you can see that it's light streaming
right<00:00:29.400> now<00:00:29.429> from<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> cameras<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.539> there<00:00:31.230> is

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
right now from the cameras and there is

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.530 
right now from the cameras and there is
my<00:00:31.859> brow<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.700> goes<00:00:32.850> there<00:00:33.120> suit<00:00:33.329> goes

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
my brow and then it goes there suit goes

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.590 
my brow and then it goes there suit goes
a<00:00:33.690> variety<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:35.100> here<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.670> oculus<00:00:36.120> rift<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.510> if

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
a variety and here is oculus rift and if

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.229 
a variety and here is oculus rift and if
I<00:00:36.719> remove<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> lens<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.969> will<00:00:39.180> see

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
I remove the lens here and you will see

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.860 
I remove the lens here and you will see
and<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.980> live<00:00:41.219> view<00:00:41.670> version<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and that we have a live view version you

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.270 
and that we have a live view version you
can<00:00:42.989> also<00:00:43.079> see<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.920> turn<00:00:44.190> this

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
can also see that when I turn this

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.270 
can also see that when I turn this
around<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.649> you<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.829> see<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
around and like this you can see that it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.549 
around and like this you can see that it
actually<00:00:47.309> maps<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.570> seeing<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.140> it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
actually maps in what I'm seeing so it's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.430 
actually maps in what I'm seeing so it's
two<00:00:50.129> very<00:00:50.430> wide<00:00:50.730> angle<00:00:50.940> lenses<00:00:51.480> surround

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
two very wide angle lenses surround

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.860 
two very wide angle lenses surround
video<00:00:52.949> or<00:00:53.309> light<00:00:53.610> streaming<00:00:53.969> over<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> digital

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
video or light streaming over a digital

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.099 
video or light streaming over a digital
so<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> other<00:00:55.800> side<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.640> my<00:00:57.629> friend<00:00:57.870> Jonathan

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
so the other side is my friend Jonathan

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.430 
so the other side is my friend Jonathan
and<00:00:58.620> yeah<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.640> hacked<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.690> Friday<00:01:01.289> night

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and yeah we hacked this up Friday night

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.189 
and yeah we hacked this up Friday night
and<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.039> Sundays<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.789> I've<00:01:03.359> been<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.019> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and on Sundays it's I've been and so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.420 
and on Sundays it's I've been and so
it's<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.530> I'm<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.090> got<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.390> working

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
it's just I'm we just got this working

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.100 
it's just I'm we just got this working
his<00:01:08.430> company<00:01:08.939> voices<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.479> making<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
his company voices is making the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.190 
his company voices is making the
software<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> PC<00:01:11.670> side<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.900> old

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
software for on the PC side and this old

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.380 
software for on the PC side and this old
and<00:01:13.409> stuff<00:01:13.619> here

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
and stuff here

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.380 
and stuff here
and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.430> Raspberry<00:01:17.430> Pi<00:01:17.490> side<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and then on the Raspberry Pi side I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.240 
and then on the Raspberry Pi side I
actually<00:01:18.810> hacked<00:01:18.990> together<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.619> simple

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
actually hacked together a simple

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.760 
actually hacked together a simple
solution<00:01:20.430> using<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.330> G's<00:01:21.570> trainer<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.259> some

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
solution using a G's trainer and some

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.609 
solution using a G's trainer and some
other<00:01:22.950> stuff<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:24.119> taking<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> video<00:01:25.290> from

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
other stuff for taking the video from

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.600 
other stuff for taking the video from
the<00:01:25.740> cameras<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:27.590> sending<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.520> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the cameras and sending it out and you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
the cameras and sending it out and you
can<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.659> compute<00:01:31.290> module

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
can see that this is the compute module

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
can see that this is the compute module
portion<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> Raspberry<00:01:32.549> Pi<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.210> very

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
portion of the Raspberry Pi so it's very

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.260 
portion of the Raspberry Pi so it's very
small<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.610> connect<00:01:36.000> two

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
small and it can actually connect two

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
small and it can actually connect two
cameras<00:01:36.689> simultaneously<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.770> then<00:01:38.040> during

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
cameras simultaneously and then during

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.609 
cameras simultaneously and then during
the<00:01:38.549> encoding<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.450> fly'<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the encoding on the fly' and the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.120 
the encoding on the fly' and the
resolution<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:43.280> 1197<00:01:44.280> times<00:01:44.990> 900

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
resolution is 1197 times 900

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.709 
resolution is 1197 times 900
or<00:01:46.250> thereabouts<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.030> then<00:01:47.180> you<00:01:47.299> can<00:01:47.450> see<00:01:47.570> that

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
or thereabouts and then you can see that

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.350 
or thereabouts and then you can see that
these<00:01:47.869> are<00:01:47.930> actually<00:01:48.680> wide<00:01:49.610> angle<00:01:50.119> lens

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
these are actually wide angle lens

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.420 
these are actually wide angle lens
versions<00:01:50.899> of<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.469> Raspberry<00:01:52.039> Pi<00:01:52.100> cameras<00:01:54.430> and

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
versions of the Raspberry Pi cameras and

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.090 
versions of the Raspberry Pi cameras and
it's<00:01:55.579> working<00:01:55.759> pretty<00:01:56.180> good<00:01:56.270> if<00:01:57.049> anyone<00:01:57.950> of

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
it's working pretty good if anyone of

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.370 
it's working pretty good if anyone of
you<00:01:58.310> saw<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:58.789> there<00:01:58.970> is<00:01:59.030> a<00:01:59.060> slight<00:01:59.479> lag<00:01:59.869> here

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
you saw that there is a slight lag here

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.600 
you saw that there is a slight lag here
that's<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.429> lag<00:02:01.579> is<00:02:01.759> about<00:02:02.030> maybe<00:02:03.130> 250<00:02:04.130> 300

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610
