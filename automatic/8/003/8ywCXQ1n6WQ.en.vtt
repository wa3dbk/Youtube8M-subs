 direct conflict between the us and russia not 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.850
 it is likely since this would end badly 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.560
 for both parties however the

 the submarine analyst holds as much

 It is likely that Russia will not sell

 800 is a supersonic missile that is 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.570
 developed in a joint project of

 russia and india called grams the missile 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.119
 can be fired from aircraft ships 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.430
 or from land the 800 p that reaches the

 Speed 3 was designed to match 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.560

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.680
 used against land targets

 china has bought several 5365 torpedoes
