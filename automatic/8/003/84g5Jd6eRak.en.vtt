00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
one of the biggest reasons that I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.359 
one of the biggest reasons that I

vampire<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.180> human<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.720> because<00:01:22.259> my

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
vampire and not human is because my

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.499 
vampire and not human is because my
sleep<00:01:22.770> schedules<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.549> screwed<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.270> go

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
sleep schedules are so screwed up I go

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.320 
sleep schedules are so screwed up I go
through<00:01:24.900> cycles<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.729> sleeping<00:01:26.729> way<00:01:26.880> too<00:01:26.939> much

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
through cycles of sleeping way too much

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.850 
through cycles of sleeping way too much
and<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:28.049> I'll<00:01:28.170> go<00:01:28.290> through<00:01:28.320> these<00:01:28.650> other

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and then I'll go through these other

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.649 
and then I'll go through these other
cycles<00:01:29.340> where<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.549> won't<00:01:29.729> sleep<00:01:29.939> at<00:01:30.119> all<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
cycles where I won't sleep at all the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.719 
cycles where I won't sleep at all the
one<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.990> I'm<00:01:31.079> currently<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.310> cycle

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
one that I'm currently in is this cycle

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.730 
one that I'm currently in is this cycle
where<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.119> literally<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:33.990> sleep<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.500> go

fairy-like bizarrely weird but I

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.660 
fairy-like bizarrely weird but I

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
actually think it would be like super

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.699 
actually think it would be like super
awesome<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.359> sleep<00:03:48.569> in<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.840> coffin<00:03:49.019> like<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.650> know

it sounds really morbid and disturbing

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.610 
it sounds really morbid and disturbing
but<00:03:52.380> think<00:03:53.069> about<00:03:53.220> if<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.730> had<00:03:53.880> this<00:03:54.000> awesome

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620
