00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
some of my favorite jewelry pieces I

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.189 
some of my favorite jewelry pieces I
probably<00:06:40.580> have<00:06:40.910> to<00:06:40.940> split<00:06:41.270> this<00:06:41.449> video<00:06:41.780> to<00:06:41.900> two

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
probably have to split this video to two

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.189 
probably have to split this video to two
because<00:06:42.560> it's<00:06:42.680> saying<00:06:42.919> 25<00:06:43.550> minutes<00:06:44.169> so<00:06:45.169> I

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 
because it's saying 25 minutes so I

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.260 
because it's saying 25 minutes so I
probably<00:06:45.530> I<00:06:45.740> probably<00:06:45.800> did<00:06:46.430> split<00:06:46.699> into<00:06:47.090> two

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
probably I probably did split into two

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.850 
probably I probably did split into two
but<00:06:47.840> those<00:06:47.960> are<00:06:48.110> some<00:06:48.259> of<00:06:48.319> the<00:06:48.349> things<00:06:48.440> i<00:06:48.680> have

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
but those are some of the things i have

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.920 
but those are some of the things i have
most<00:06:49.370> of<00:06:49.490> them<00:06:49.610> you<00:06:49.759> can't<00:06:50.120> get<00:06:50.479> anymore

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
most of them you can't get anymore

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.390 
most of them you can't get anymore
because<00:06:51.259> i<00:06:51.410> did<00:06:51.590> get<00:06:51.710> them<00:06:51.860> a<00:06:51.889> long<00:06:52.039> time<00:06:52.099> ago

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 
because i did get them a long time ago

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.930 
because i did get them a long time ago
