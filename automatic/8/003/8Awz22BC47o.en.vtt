come<00:00:28.990> to<00:00:29.020> me<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.800> first<00:00:30.130> issue<00:00:30.369> that<00:00:30.699> we

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
come to me and the first issue that we

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.959 
come to me and the first issue that we
deal<00:00:31.150> with<00:00:31.480> is<00:00:31.750> digestion<00:00:32.649> why<00:00:33.460> do<00:00:33.519> we<00:00:33.789> deal

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
deal with is digestion why do we deal

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.450 
deal with is digestion why do we deal
with<00:00:34.149> digestion<00:00:34.659> first<00:00:35.199> because<00:00:36.159> if<00:00:36.309> you're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
with digestion first because if you're

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.880 
with digestion first because if you're
not<00:00:36.510> absorbing<00:00:37.510> all<00:00:37.629> of<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:38.140> nutrients<00:00:38.649> from

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
you in this segment the first one is

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.240 
you in this segment the first one is
that<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.750> separate<00:01:07.750> your<00:01:08.380> starches<00:01:09.009> from

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
that if you separate your starches from

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.630 
that if you separate your starches from
your<00:01:09.700> proteins<00:01:10.329> you<00:01:10.869> will<00:01:11.049> digest<00:01:11.399> so<00:01:12.399> much

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
your proteins you will digest so much

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.719 
your proteins you will digest so much
easier<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.479> so<00:01:14.110> much<00:01:14.140> better<00:01:14.829> you<00:01:15.520> won't

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
easier and so much better you won't

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.969 
easier and so much better you won't
understand<00:01:16.299> how<00:01:16.539> you<00:01:16.600> lived<00:01:17.079> without<00:01:17.469> doing

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
understand how you lived without doing

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.149 
understand how you lived without doing
this<00:01:18.159> before<00:01:18.899> what<00:01:19.899> do<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.049> mean<00:01:20.289> by<00:01:20.350> starches

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
this before what do I mean by starches

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.870

what you end up doing is interfering
with<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.710> digestion<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.580> both<00:01:45.090> food<00:01:45.600> groups
