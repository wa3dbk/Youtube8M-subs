00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
when I'm breaking it in and it might

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.099 
when I'm breaking it in and it might
take<00:01:30.280> more<00:01:30.520> or<00:01:30.729> less<00:01:30.789> time<00:01:30.939> to<00:01:31.509> break<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:31.990> in

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
take more or less time to break it in

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.230 
take more or less time to break it in
you<00:01:32.560> know<00:01:32.679> make<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:32.979> feel<00:01:33.249> comfortable<00:01:33.700> like<00:01:34.210> a

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
second skin which is why sometimes it

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.289 
second skin which is why sometimes it
can<00:01:38.200> be<00:01:38.289> complicated<00:01:38.619> when<00:01:39.100> I'm<00:01:39.369> training<00:01:39.909> and

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
here is my approval corset that I

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.149 
here is my approval corset that I
reviewed<00:01:55.539> last<00:01:55.959> month<00:01:56.289> and<00:01:56.499> here's<00:01:56.979> my

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
reviewed last month and here's my

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.709 
reviewed last month and here's my
starkers<00:01:57.639> corset<00:01:58.029> which<00:01:58.179> I<00:01:58.299> have<00:01:58.479> yet<00:01:58.659> to

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
starkers corset which I have yet to

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.999 
starkers corset which I have yet to
review<00:01:59.310> this<00:02:00.310> one<00:02:00.579> is<00:02:00.850> a<00:02:00.880> lot<00:02:01.179> thicker<00:02:01.659> I<00:02:02.020> think

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
review this one is a lot thicker I think

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.550 
review this one is a lot thicker I think
it<00:02:03.130> has<00:02:03.340> at<00:02:03.789> least<00:02:04.179> four<00:02:04.630> or<00:02:04.659> five<00:02:04.869> layers<00:02:05.319> in

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
it has at least four or five layers in

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.190 
it has at least four or five layers in
this<00:02:05.709> this<00:02:06.399> one<00:02:06.609> has<00:02:06.939> maybe<00:02:07.329> three<00:02:07.689> layers<00:02:07.929> in

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
this this one has maybe three layers in

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.580 
this this one has maybe three layers in
it<00:02:08.289> it<00:02:09.160> has<00:02:09.340> more<00:02:10.209> warning<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:11.080> also<00:02:11.230> has<00:02:11.560> a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
it it has more warning and it also has a

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.530 
it it has more warning and it also has a
completely<00:02:11.920> different<00:02:12.040> silhouette<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:12.940> found

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
completely different silhouette I found

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.320 
completely different silhouette I found
that<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.319> was<00:02:14.650> very<00:02:14.800> easy<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.849> break<00:02:16.060> in

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
that this one was very easy to break in

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.260 
that this one was very easy to break in
it's<00:02:17.080> uh<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.890> just<00:02:18.099> kind<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.730> softened<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.180> my

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
it's uh it just kind of softened to my

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.790 
it's uh it just kind of softened to my
body<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.780> felt<00:02:20.020> more<00:02:20.170> comfortable<00:02:20.590> right

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
body and felt more comfortable right

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.410 
body and felt more comfortable right
away<00:02:20.830> but<00:02:21.520> just<00:02:21.700> because<00:02:21.820> it's<00:02:22.060> all

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
away but just because it's all

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.180 
away but just because it's all
doesn't<00:02:22.630> mean<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:23.020> not<00:02:23.170> strong<00:02:23.560> this

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
doesn't mean that it's not strong this

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.510 
doesn't mean that it's not strong this
one<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.760> really<00:02:25.390> heavy-duty<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:27.220> took<00:02:27.370> me

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
one is really heavy-duty and it took me

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.339 
one is really heavy-duty and it took me
a<00:02:27.550> lot<00:02:27.819> longer<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.270> break<00:02:28.569> this<00:02:28.750> one<00:02:28.810> in<00:02:29.140> and

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
a lot longer to break this one in and

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.410 
a lot longer to break this one in and
that's<00:02:30.250> why<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.459> haven't<00:02:30.849> reviewed<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.300> yet

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
that's why I haven't reviewed it yet

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.550 
that's why I haven't reviewed it yet
because<00:02:32.520> I'm<00:02:33.520> still<00:02:33.970> basically<00:02:34.660> learning<00:02:35.319> to

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
because I'm still basically learning to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.500 
because I'm still basically learning to
close<00:02:35.770> this<00:02:35.920> one<00:02:36.099> because<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.730> lacing<00:02:37.360> system

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
close this one because the lacing system

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.660 
close this one because the lacing system
is<00:02:37.930> different<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.800> back<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.280> everything

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
is different in the back and everything

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.050 
is different in the back and everything
and<00:02:40.110> every<00:02:41.110> time<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.650> break<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.640> new<00:02:42.670> course

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
and every time I break in a new course

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.580 
and every time I break in a new course
if<00:02:43.270> like<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.510> said<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.200> kind<00:02:44.350> of<00:02:44.440> like

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
if like I said it's kind of like

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.949 
if like I said it's kind of like
starting<00:02:44.950> over<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.459> just<00:02:46.270> because<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:46.630> can<00:02:46.810> lace

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
starting over so just because I can lace

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.020 
starting over so just because I can lace
down<00:02:47.200> 20<00:02:47.590> inches<00:02:47.830> in<00:02:47.860> one<00:02:48.100> course<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.580> doesn't

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
down 20 inches in one course it doesn't

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.729 
down 20 inches in one course it doesn't
necessarily<00:02:49.630> mean<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.900> can<00:02:50.080> lace<00:02:50.230> down<00:02:50.410> 20

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
necessarily mean that I can lace down 20

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.949 
necessarily mean that I can lace down 20
inches<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.100> every<00:02:51.760> corset<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.269> have<00:02:52.510> so

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
inches in every corset that I have so

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.059 
inches in every corset that I have so
that's<00:02:53.140> just<00:02:53.200> one<00:02:53.380> thing<00:02:53.410> that<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.709> wanted<00:02:54.010> to

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
that's just one thing that I wanted to

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.610 
that's just one thing that I wanted to
get<00:02:54.280> out<00:02:54.310> there<00:02:54.720> some<00:02:55.720> people<00:02:55.989> they're<00:02:56.350> very

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
get out there some people they're very

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.960 
get out there some people they're very
experienced<00:02:57.069> in<00:02:57.100> coursing<00:02:57.550> but<00:02:57.700> they<00:02:57.790> stay

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
experienced in coursing but they stay

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.520 
experienced in coursing but they stay
with<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> same<00:02:58.390> maker<00:02:58.630> every<00:02:59.019> single<00:02:59.350> time

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
with the same maker every single time

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.740 
with the same maker every single time
and<00:02:59.800> they<00:03:00.640> just<00:03:00.819> buy<00:03:00.970> smaller<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.510> smaller

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
and they just buy smaller and smaller

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.210 
and they just buy smaller and smaller
sizes<00:03:02.049> from<00:03:02.319> that<00:03:02.500> maker<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.100> there's

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
sizes from that maker and there's

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.800 
sizes from that maker and there's
absolutely<00:03:03.370> nothing<00:03:03.790> wrong<00:03:03.970> with<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.420> you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
absolutely nothing wrong with that you

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.930 
absolutely nothing wrong with that you
build<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.110> rapport<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.590> maker<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.310> they<00:03:06.430> know

to your body I think that's great

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.680 
to your body I think that's great
but<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.560> situations<00:03:17.860> like<00:03:18.310> mine<00:03:18.880> where<00:03:19.420> I'm

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
but in situations like mine where I'm

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.180 
but in situations like mine where I'm
buying<00:03:19.989> from<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.290> lot<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.500> different<00:03:20.680> makers

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
buying from a lot of different makers

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.270 
buying from a lot of different makers
you<00:03:21.850> come<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.390> learn<00:03:22.569> that<00:03:22.900> you<00:03:23.680> don't<00:03:23.890> expect

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
you come to learn that you don't expect

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.370 
you come to learn that you don't expect
the<00:03:24.580> exact<00:03:24.880> same<00:03:25.090> thing<00:03:25.330> from<00:03:25.420> yourself<00:03:25.870> with

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
the exact same thing from yourself with

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.930 
the exact same thing from yourself with
every<00:03:26.650> single<00:03:26.920> course<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.370> have<00:03:27.579> and

every single course that you have and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.440 
every single course that you have and
you<00:03:28.030> don't<00:03:28.180> expect<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:29.859> corset<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.880> break<00:03:31.269> in

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
you don't expect the corset to break in

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.449 
you don't expect the corset to break in
the<00:03:31.690> same<00:03:31.900> way<00:03:32.109> with<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.410> same<00:03:32.590> duration<00:03:33.010> the

the same way with the same duration the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
same ease with every single corset it's

00:06:58.809 --> 00:06:58.819 
fairly delicate it can very easily if

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.399 
fairly delicate it can very easily if
the<00:06:58.939> ends<00:06:59.089> are<00:06:59.239> not<00:06:59.389> treated<00:06:59.749> properly<00:06:59.959> or<00:07:00.319> if

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:04.819 
which is what's going on right there now

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:07.659
