00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
so last night I went to switch on my

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.960 
so last night I went to switch on my
suburban<00:00:15.400> water<00:00:15.849> heater<00:00:16.180> my<00:00:17.020> trailer<00:00:17.500> and<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
suburban water heater my trailer and the

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.480 
suburban water heater my trailer and the
electric<00:00:19.539> worked<00:00:20.169> for<00:00:20.529> a<00:00:20.560> little<00:00:20.829> while<00:00:21.099> and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
electric worked for a little while and

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.870 
electric worked for a little while and
then<00:00:21.849> stopped<00:00:22.390> working<00:00:23.340> luckily<00:00:24.340> it's<00:00:24.520> a<00:00:24.640> dual

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
then stopped working luckily it's a dual

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.389 
then stopped working luckily it's a dual
electric<00:00:25.480> gas<00:00:25.989> so<00:00:26.380> we<00:00:26.500> switched<00:00:26.739> to<00:00:26.890> gas<00:00:27.099> and

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:27.399 
electric gas so we switched to gas and

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.970 
electric gas so we switched to gas and
that<00:00:27.460> out<00:00:27.669> water<00:00:28.029> last<00:00:28.329> night<00:00:28.649> so<00:00:29.649> I'm<00:00:29.829> out

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
that out water last night so I'm out

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.330 
that out water last night so I'm out
here<00:00:30.210> today<00:00:31.210> to<00:00:31.480> figure<00:00:32.259> out<00:00:32.469> what<00:00:32.649> went<00:00:32.800> wrong

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
here today to figure out what went wrong

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.319 
here today to figure out what went wrong
one<00:00:34.210> thing<00:00:34.420> I<00:00:34.540> suspect<00:00:35.170> is<00:00:35.739> down<00:00:36.579> in<00:00:36.850> here<00:00:37.090> we

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
one thing I suspect is down in here we

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.590 
one thing I suspect is down in here we
have<00:00:37.570> a<00:00:38.190> on/off<00:00:39.190> switch<00:00:39.579> then<00:00:40.239> you<00:00:40.360> switch

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
have a on/off switch then you switch

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.650 
have a on/off switch then you switch
back<00:00:40.870> and<00:00:40.930> forth<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.460> I<00:00:42.579> noticed<00:00:43.090> when<00:00:43.329> I<00:00:43.390> went

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
back and forth and I noticed when I went

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.690 
back and forth and I noticed when I went
to<00:00:43.750> switch<00:00:44.079> that<00:00:44.380> off<00:00:45.810> it<00:00:47.370> seemed<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.489> little

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
to switch that off it seemed a little

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.030 
to switch that off it seemed a little
stiff<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:50.260> other<00:00:50.410> night

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
stiff the other night

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.890 
stiff the other night
are<00:00:51.579> you<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.850> morning<00:00:52.120> when<00:00:52.360> we<00:00:52.390> left<00:00:52.720> the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
are you the morning when we left the

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.770 
are you the morning when we left the
last<00:00:53.050> campsite<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:55.030> had<00:00:55.149> to<00:00:55.270> really<00:00:55.420> force

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
last campsite and I had to really force

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.990 
last campsite and I had to really force
it<00:00:56.020> so<00:00:56.200> I<00:00:56.320> believe<00:00:56.770> that<00:00:57.010> switch<00:00:57.460> may<00:00:57.790> have

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
it so I believe that switch may have

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.660 
it so I believe that switch may have
failed<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.590> I'm<00:00:59.680> going<00:00:59.920> to<00:00:59.980> pull<00:01:00.220> that<00:01:00.250> switch

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
failed so I'm going to pull that switch

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.960 
failed so I'm going to pull that switch
out<00:01:01.090> and<00:01:02.970> see<00:01:03.970> what's<00:01:04.149> going<00:01:04.420> on<00:01:05.310> inside<00:01:06.310> the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
out and see what's going on inside the

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.090 
out and see what's going on inside the
trailer<00:01:07.240> I've<00:01:08.049> switched<00:01:08.320> off<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.890> main

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
trailer I've switched off the main

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.660 
trailer I've switched off the main
breaker<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.630> hot<00:01:10.899> water<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:11.680> I<00:01:11.979> won't<00:01:12.490> have

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
breaker to the hot water so I won't have

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.210 
breaker to the hot water so I won't have
any<00:01:12.850> any<00:01:13.320> electricity<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.440> worry<00:01:14.650> about<00:01:14.830> I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
any any electricity to worry about I

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.560 
any any electricity to worry about I
take<00:01:15.549> that<00:01:15.760> switch<00:01:16.090> note<00:01:17.940> okay<00:01:18.940> got<00:01:19.540> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
take that switch note okay got the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.640 
take that switch note okay got the
switch<00:01:19.960> out<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:22.270> get<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.540> out<00:01:22.720> all<00:01:23.110> there<00:01:23.260> is<00:01:23.380> is

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
switch out to get it out all there is is

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.760 
switch out to get it out all there is is
is<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.460> pry<00:01:24.790> it<00:01:24.850> out<00:01:25.119> gently<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:26.409> know<00:01:26.530> I<00:01:26.590> can

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
is to pry it out gently you know I can

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.830 
is to pry it out gently you know I can
use<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.920> flathead<00:01:27.640> screwdriver<00:01:27.820> or<00:01:28.479> something

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
use a flathead screwdriver or something

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.200 
use a flathead screwdriver or something
it<00:01:29.470> just<00:01:29.710> presses<00:01:30.040> in<00:01:30.369> with<00:01:30.610> these<00:01:30.820> tabs

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
it just presses in with these tabs

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.800 
it just presses in with these tabs
plastic<00:01:32.020> tabs<00:01:32.290> when<00:01:32.590> they<00:01:33.070> put<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.430> in<00:01:33.580> so<00:01:33.970> just

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
plastic tabs when they put it in so just

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.630 
plastic tabs when they put it in so just
have<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.080> be<00:01:35.200> gentle<00:01:35.409> so<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:35.799> don't<00:01:36.010> mangle

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
have to be gentle so you don't mangle

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.250 
have to be gentle so you don't mangle
the<00:01:36.670> switch<00:01:37.000> when<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.270> get<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:37.570> out<00:01:38.250> now

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
the switch when you get it out now

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.690 
the switch when you get it out now
I'm<00:01:41.260> just<00:01:41.590> going<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.830> test<00:01:42.070> it<00:01:42.310> with<00:01:42.490> my

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
I'm just going to test it with my

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.870 
I'm just going to test it with my
multimeter<00:01:43.500> put<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.590> on<00:01:44.710> ohms<00:01:45.010> mode<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.729> when

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
multimeter put it on ohms mode and when

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.770 
multimeter put it on ohms mode and when
you<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.390> on<00:01:47.350> it<00:01:47.770> should<00:01:48.040> be<00:01:48.220> for<00:01:48.610> me<00:01:48.790> I'll

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
you in the on it should be for me I'll

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.960 
you in the on it should be for me I'll
just<00:01:50.170> hook<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.310> up<00:01:51.430> give<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.000> shot<00:01:53.759> there<00:01:54.759> we

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
just hook it up give it a shot there we

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.460 
just hook it up give it a shot there we
are<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:56.110> on<00:01:56.439> mode<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.220> nothing<00:01:57.960> off<00:01:58.960> mode

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
are right on mode and nothing off mode

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.910 
are right on mode and nothing off mode
nothing<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.479> notice<00:02:01.479> in<00:02:01.780> on<00:02:02.020> mode<00:02:02.320> if<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:02.590> gently

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
nothing I notice in on mode if I gently

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.070 
nothing I notice in on mode if I gently
touch<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.430> switch<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.180> little<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.600> can<00:02:04.810> actually

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
touch the switch a little I can actually

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.420 
touch the switch a little I can actually
get<00:02:05.500> it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
get it

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.109 
get it
so<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.120> switch<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.600> actually<00:02:07.840> intermittent

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
so the switch is actually intermittent

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.280 
so the switch is actually intermittent
let's<00:02:10.119> be<00:02:10.330> damaged<00:02:10.869> inside<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:13.060> all<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
let's be damaged inside so all I have to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.980 
let's be damaged inside so all I have to
do<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.740> pick<00:02:15.550> up<00:02:15.670> one<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:15.910> those<00:02:16.120> switches<00:02:16.540> and

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
do is pick up one of those switches and

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.050 
do is pick up one of those switches and
install<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.950> I'll<00:02:18.070> be<00:02:18.250> good<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.490> go

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
install it and I'll be good to go

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.350 
install it and I'll be good to go
they're<00:02:19.870> pretty<00:02:20.170> common<00:02:20.440> switch<00:02:21.210> should<00:02:22.210> be

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
they're pretty common switch should be

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.060 
they're pretty common switch should be
able<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.540> get<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.870> at<00:02:23.050> pretty<00:02:23.740> low<00:02:23.770> any

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
able to get it at pretty low any

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.380 
able to get it at pretty low any
electrical<00:02:24.970> type<00:02:25.210> store<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.820> they<00:02:28.000> busted

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
electrical type store so they busted

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.740 
electrical type store so they busted
apart<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.900> switch<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.890> inside<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.090> actual

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750

transferred inside the switch and then

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.449

there<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.670> got<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:36.970> switch<00:03:37.390> it's<00:03:37.989> able<00:03:38.200> to

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
there so I got a switch it's able to

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.790 
there so I got a switch it's able to
handle<00:03:38.709> 20<00:03:39.100> amps<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.930> element<00:03:41.440> in<00:03:41.560> here<00:03:41.769> I

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
handle 20 amps the element in here I

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.890 
handle 20 amps the element in here I
think<00:03:42.100> is<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> thousand<00:03:42.820> one<00:03:43.000> element<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:43.540> it'll

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
think is a thousand one element so it'll

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.660 
think is a thousand one element so it'll
easily<00:03:45.450> handle<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:46.600> current<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:47.519> it's<00:03:48.519> also

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
easily handle that current and it's also

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.540 
easily handle that current and it's also

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
running 18 amps so that means it's

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.840 
running 18 amps so that means it's
drawing<00:04:48.870> 10<00:04:49.170> amps<00:04:49.470> which<00:04:49.590> it's<00:04:50.370> just<00:04:50.640> about
