00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
about this program on the xperia is that

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.830 
about this program on the xperia is that
it<00:02:02.920> actually<00:02:03.069> allows<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.910> to<00:02:04.030> zoom<00:02:04.060> in<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.479> lot

further than the SB weather 2.0 the SP
whether<00:02:08.739> two<00:02:08.920> points<00:02:09.160> are<00:02:09.220> only<00:02:09.340> give<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.610> two

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.880 
whether two points are only give you two
different<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.239> zooming<00:02:10.539> levels

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.410 

and<00:02:16.460> of<00:02:16.550> course<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.819> can<00:02:16.940> also<00:02:17.060> change<00:02:17.300> your

and of course you can also change your
cities<00:02:17.750> here<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.230> can<00:02:18.350> set<00:02:18.500> them<00:02:18.620> as<00:02:18.710> a

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
cities here so you can set them as a

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.890 
cities here so you can set them as a
default<00:02:18.920> city<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.610> remove<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:19.910> city<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.420> get

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
default city and remove the city and get

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.500 
default city and remove the city and get
weather<00:02:21.080> sources

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.880 

okay<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.810> next<00:02:30.840> panel<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> spp

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
okay so the next panel is the spp

okay so the next panel is the spp
traveler<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.260> we'll<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.410> go<00:02:34.590> into<00:02:34.740> that

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
traveler and we'll just go into that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.530 
traveler and we'll just go into that
first<00:02:35.640> thing<00:02:35.760> we<00:02:35.850> actually<00:02:36.120> do<00:02:36.240> is<00:02:36.360> go<00:02:36.510> over

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
first thing we actually do is go over

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.240 
first thing we actually do is go over
here<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.590> way<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.130> is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
here and this is the way that this is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.010 
here and this is the way that this is
actually<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.760> main<00:02:38.880> page<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.690> spb

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
actually the main page of the spb

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.080 
actually the main page of the spb
traveler<00:02:40.440> program<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.430> if<00:02:41.520> we<00:02:41.610> go<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:41.760> here

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
traveler program so if we go on here

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.700 
traveler program so if we go on here
this<00:02:42.240> allows<00:02:42.540> us<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.720> change<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.260> time<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
this allows us to change the time the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.350 
this allows us to change the time the
date<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.160> right<00:02:44.580> now<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:44.970> december

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
date and right now this is december

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.910 
date and right now this is december
twenty<00:02:45.900> first<00:02:46.110> two<00:02:46.290> thousand<00:02:46.530> eight<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.890> i

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
twenty first two thousand eight so i

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.260 
twenty first two thousand eight so i
have<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.220> change<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.550> settings<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.090> little

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
have to change the settings in a little

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.840 
have to change the settings in a little
bit<00:02:49.040> but<00:02:50.040> it's<00:02:50.220> pretty<00:02:50.310> good<00:02:50.490> for<00:02:50.550> just

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
bit but it's pretty good for just

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.090 
bit but it's pretty good for just
demonstrational<00:02:51.420> purposes<00:02:51.530> now<00:02:52.530> go<00:02:52.710> back<00:02:52.860> and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
actually our our conversions and tipping

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.950 
actually our our conversions and tipping
and<00:03:45.790> all<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:46.000> great<00:03:46.090> stuff<00:03:46.210> so<00:03:46.630> if<00:03:46.750> we<00:03:46.810> go<00:03:46.900> to

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
and all that great stuff so if we go to

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.950 
and all that great stuff so if we go to
our<00:03:47.050> tipping<00:03:47.440> calculator<00:03:48.630> we<00:03:49.630> can<00:03:49.810> select

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
our tipping calculator we can select

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.530 
our tipping calculator we can select
number<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:50.680> let's<00:03:50.890> say<00:03:51.040> our<00:03:51.070> bill<00:03:51.370> is<00:03:51.550> 25<00:03:52.180> 12

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
number so let's say our bill is 25 12

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.590 
number so let's say our bill is 25 12
equal<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.740> if<00:03:54.160> we<00:03:54.280> select<00:03:54.460> to<00:03:54.670> tip<00:03:54.880> so<00:03:55.120> fifteen

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
equal and if we select to tip so fifteen

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.970 
equal and if we select to tip so fifteen
percent<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.080> it<00:03:56.170> gives<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.380> a<00:03:56.440> total<00:03:56.620> amount

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
percent so it gives you a total amount

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.890 
percent so it gives you a total amount
and<00:03:57.280> if<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.090> want<00:03:58.270> to<00:03:58.420> split<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.780> up<00:03:58.840> between

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
and if you want to split it up between

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.290 
and if you want to split it up between
four<00:03:59.410> people<00:03:59.740> you<00:03:59.830> can<00:03:59.950> do<00:04:00.040> that<00:04:00.190> as<00:04:00.310> well<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:00.520> 7

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
four people you can do that as well so 7

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.290 
four people you can do that as well so 7
22<00:04:01.690> times<00:04:01.960> for<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.470> that's<00:04:03.220> pretty<00:04:03.460> neat<00:04:03.760> it

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
22 times for and that's pretty neat it

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.090 
22 times for and that's pretty neat it
also<00:04:04.450> gives<00:04:04.540> you<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.810> units<00:04:05.170> calculator<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.040> you

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
also gives you a units calculator so you

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.860 
also gives you a units calculator so you
can<00:04:06.460> check<00:04:06.640> different<00:04:07.060> mutants<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:07.510> if<00:04:07.600> one<00:04:07.720> of

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
can check different mutants so if one of

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.570 
can check different mutants so if one of
the<00:04:07.930> length<00:04:08.110> it'll<00:04:08.770> give<00:04:08.860> us<00:04:08.890> that<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:09.430> if<00:04:09.490> we

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
the length it'll give us that so if we

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.320 
the length it'll give us that so if we
select<00:04:09.870> like<00:04:10.870> 10<00:04:11.440> it'll<00:04:12.040> give<00:04:12.520> us<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:13.060> exact

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
select like 10 it'll give us the exact

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.370 
select like 10 it'll give us the exact
amount<00:04:13.450> so<00:04:14.250> 10<00:04:15.250> meters<00:04:15.610> equals<00:04:15.940> 393<00:04:16.780> inches<00:04:17.170> so

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
amount so 10 meters equals 393 inches so

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.250 
amount so 10 meters equals 393 inches so
just<00:04:17.830> close<00:04:18.040> that<00:04:18.150> if<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.870> want<00:04:20.019> to<00:04:20.080> check
