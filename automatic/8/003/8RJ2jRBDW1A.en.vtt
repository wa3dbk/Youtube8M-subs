about<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.400> game<00:02:14.640> was<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.959> kind<00:02:16.200> of

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
about this game was that the you kind of

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.039 
about this game was that the you kind of
you<00:02:17.099> can't<00:02:17.340> store<00:02:17.879> as<00:02:18.209> much<00:02:18.420> as<00:02:18.659> I<00:02:18.780> want
