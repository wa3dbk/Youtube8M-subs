it looks like a guitar case but it's for
her<00:05:33.150> um<00:05:35.240> racket<00:05:36.650> sadly<00:05:37.650> it<00:05:37.919> only<00:05:38.099> fits<00:05:38.580> her

her um racket sadly it only fits her
racket<00:05:39.300> in<00:05:39.509> there<00:05:39.720> so<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:41.610> ball<00:05:41.849> is<00:05:42.240> just

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
racket in there so the ball is just

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.649
