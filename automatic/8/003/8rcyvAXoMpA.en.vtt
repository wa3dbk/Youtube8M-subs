00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.420 

Oh

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.900 

ok<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.660> for<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.230> move<00:00:22.440> is<00:00:22.670> it's<00:00:23.670> called

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
ok so this for this move is it's called

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.890 
ok so this for this move is it's called
be<00:00:25.460> called<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.580> turnover<00:00:27.060> pass<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.600> it's<00:00:27.780> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
be called the turnover pass and it's a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.410 
be called the turnover pass and it's a
really<00:00:28.200> effective<00:00:28.470> move<00:00:29.090> although<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
really effective move although it is

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.830 
really effective move although it is
quite<00:00:31.350> angle<00:00:31.800> sensitive<00:00:32.250> which<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.720> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
quite angle sensitive which is not the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.200 
quite angle sensitive which is not the
best<00:00:34.020> thing<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.530> oh<00:00:34.560> well<00:00:34.860> still<00:00:35.760> really

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
best thing but oh well still really

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.420 
best thing but oh well still really
great<00:00:36.450> move<00:00:36.680> you<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.860> still<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
great move you can still do it on the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.790 
great move you can still do it on the
street<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.850> stuff<00:00:39.260> it's<00:00:40.260> kind<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.650> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
street and stuff it's kind of like the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.740 
street and stuff it's kind of like the
harman<00:00:41.129> pass<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.820> um<00:00:42.030> i<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.720> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
harman pass you just um i think is a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.650 
harman pass you just um i think is a
little<00:00:42.809> bit<00:00:43.110> easier<00:00:43.290> than<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.739> Herman<00:00:43.980> pass

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
little bit easier than the Herman pass

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.080 
little bit easier than the Herman pass
probably<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:46.170> effective<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.040> I<00:00:47.309> like

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
probably not more effective but I like

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.930 
probably not more effective but I like
it<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:49.110> um<00:00:49.500> I'm<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.190> doing<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> Harman<00:00:50.760> pass

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it so um I'm just doing a Harman pass

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.580 
it so um I'm just doing a Harman pass
right<00:00:51.150> there<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.290> you're<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.530> to

okay<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.520> just<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.380> flip<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.530> over<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
okay and you just like flip it over and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.450 
okay and you just like flip it over and
it<00:01:08.820> turns<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.149> in<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.420> already<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.930> top<00:01:10.460> now

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it turns out in this already on top now

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.660 
it turns out in this already on top now
I'm<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:12.330> doing<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> best<00:01:12.780> job<00:01:12.899> of<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.380> but

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
I'm not doing the best job of it but

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.230 
I'm not doing the best job of it but
that's<00:01:14.670> why<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.880> its<00:01:15.090> Oriole<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:17.149> take<00:01:18.149> your

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
that's why is its Oriole so take your

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.370 
that's why is its Oriole so take your
card<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.130> now<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.190> just<00:01:20.520> put<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.450> top<00:01:21.630> so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
card and now you just put on top so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.389 
card and now you just put on top so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you do you need a pinky break okay so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.560 
you do you need a pinky break okay so
you<00:01:30.659> never<00:01:30.750> lose<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.080> car<00:01:31.440> so<00:01:32.060> there<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.180> go<00:01:33.210> I

to<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:37.260> what<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.590> looks<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.700> put<00:01:38.909> this

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
to do is what it looks like you put this

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.920 
to do is what it looks like you put this
like<00:01:39.330> this<00:01:40.760> then<00:01:41.760> flip<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.270> over<00:01:42.420> just<00:01:42.780> like

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
like this then flip it over just like

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.289 
like this then flip it over just like
that<00:01:42.990> that's<00:01:43.650> basically<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> move<00:01:45.229> like<00:01:46.229> this

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
that that's basically the move like this

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.800 
that that's basically the move like this
okay<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.220> what<00:01:50.220> I'm<00:01:50.340> doing<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:50.970> going

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
okay so what I'm doing is just going

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.240 
okay so what I'm doing is just going
like<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.700> well<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:53.970> right<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.630> and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
like this well this is right here and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.890 
like this well this is right here and
then<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.820> my<00:01:57.060> hand<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.780> on

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
then it's on my hand is going to be on

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.980 
then it's on my hand is going to be on
top<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.799> can't<00:01:59.100> see<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.840> looks

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
top of it so you can't see it it looks

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
top of it so you can't see it it looks
really<00:02:01.200> good<00:02:02.360> pinky<00:02:03.360> brick<00:02:05.090> okay<00:02:06.090> from<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
really good pinky brick okay from the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.020 
really good pinky brick okay from the
top<00:02:06.450> view<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.990> cannot<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.880> that's<00:02:08.880> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
top view you cannot see it that's the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.030 
top view you cannot see it that's the
only<00:02:09.179> angle<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.989> can't<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.500> if<00:02:10.920> you

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
only angle but you can't see it if you

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.490 
only angle but you can't see it if you
see<00:02:11.220> her<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.200> looks<00:02:13.380> very

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
see her like that and it looks very

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.560 
see her like that and it looks very
natural<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.430> your<00:02:14.579> hands<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.209> right<00:02:15.329> place

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
natural of your hands in the right place

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.949 
natural of your hands in the right place
like<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.190> then<00:02:17.510> you're<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.690> lower

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
like this then you're going to lower

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.050 
like this then you're going to lower
this<00:02:19.200> pack<00:02:19.440> now<00:02:19.680> it'll<00:02:20.160> originally<00:02:20.610> be<00:02:20.760> kind

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
this pack now it'll originally be kind
