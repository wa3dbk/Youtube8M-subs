00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.800
 there is such a non-profit 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.799
 organization that provides services 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.950
 on domain name registration 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.970
 In some cases, this organization conducts 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.440
 auctions for more fair 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.300
 domain distribution and fight 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.359
 speculators 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.029
 Well, and quite a reasonable solution so 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.339
 Significantly higher probability 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:18.880
 the domain will buy exactly the one who needs more 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.839
 so they produce about 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.789
 the term can not be expensive books 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.919
 another short entry in the database 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.589
 so the main declared goals 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.789
 gone on to reveal the worthiest of 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.449
 presidents notice it seems to me to buy 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.699
 founders helicopter doctors of the domain to whom 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:34.910
 really need 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.450
 let's see what happens at the very 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.110
 The deed here is a typical auction bid 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.500
 start six-sided 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.360
 the participant is marked green is you and dad 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.790
 really need a domain depends on it 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.070
 future shudegov 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.210
 night sug elephant well and of course quickly 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.440
 give up 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.440
 there are only two applicants 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.370
 we are gradually approaching our 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.410
 maximum reluctant heart of thought 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.240
 upcoming decisions 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.300
 and lose 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.940
 but what happens? 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.680
 and let's a little 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.970
 winners suddenly disappears without a trace 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.560
 buyout building 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.340
 we don't know was collecting saliva to buy or 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.560
 just raise the stakes the main thing is that 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.910
 he is gone now 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.070
 lo and behold you become the main 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.110
 applicant gur domain 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.870
 and here the fun begins 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.520
 Well, the center begins to demand you pasha 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.020
 maximum bet 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.910
 look again at the presidentâ€™s schedule all 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.280
 three bid by our citizen 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.620
 count meaningless 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.990
 women times its area 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.939
 according to common sense of the world 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:42.800
 practice 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.570
 honestly have auctions of course 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.530
 you need a little more than near 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.550
 challenger 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.250
 i.e. noise above bet 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.280
 went the nearest competitor by one 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.330
 step 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.800
 this is logical and therefore often 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.850
 besides we remember the tasks were 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.990
 find a winner 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.740
 but non-profit organization center 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.780
 I think that the most frequent way 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.460
 determine winner one 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.750
 which will bring more money 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.379
 organizer 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.829
 let's think this monstrous at 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.629
 supply provided in bad faith 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.609
 anonymous participant china what for us 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:16.680
 unknown we know just now 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.590
 presence provided centered on 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.369
 Meaning to know more and no loss 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:23.069
 one would assume something 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.139
 accidentally flaw in the rules no 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.799
 Of course I will answer about it do not know 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.230
 know yes and they called and wrote ignoring 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.230
 we have domain registration in the zone of the Russian Federation 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.120
 let's see what happens and see what they say 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.580
 vacant
