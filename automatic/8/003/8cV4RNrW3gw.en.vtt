polyethylene<00:00:27.039> s<00:00:27.160> ups<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:29.320> reason<00:00:29.650> for<00:00:29.830> this

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
polyethylene s ups one reason for this

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.769 
polyethylene s ups one reason for this
is<00:00:30.130> that<00:00:30.189> TST<00:00:30.820> allows<00:00:31.029> us<00:00:31.240> to<00:00:31.359> use<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:31.509> higher

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
is that TST allows us to use a higher

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:32.819 
is that TST allows us to use a higher
grade<00:00:31.990> of<00:00:32.080> plastic<00:00:32.560> than<00:00:32.710> other
