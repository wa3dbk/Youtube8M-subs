suppose<00:02:18.260> but<00:02:18.650> not<00:02:18.950> too<00:02:19.250> much<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.520> not<00:02:20.030> overly

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
suppose but not too much so not overly

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.590 
suppose but not too much so not overly
so<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.620> without<00:02:22.340> further<00:02:22.460> ado<00:02:23.000> let's<00:02:23.330> jump

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
so so without further ado let's jump

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.400 
so so without further ado let's jump
inside<00:02:25.060> we<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.090> not<00:02:26.390> opened<00:02:26.660> up<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.020> outlaw

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
inside we have not opened up the outlaw

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.800 
inside we have not opened up the outlaw
and<00:02:27.650> let's<00:02:27.890> dive<00:02:28.580> straight<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.660> take<00:02:29.780> a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
and let's dive straight in and take a

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.390 
and let's dive straight in and take a
look<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:31.250> first<00:02:31.610> thing<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:31.970> see<00:02:32.240> is<00:02:32.480> that

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
look the first thing you see is that

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.730 
look the first thing you see is that
things<00:02:34.400> are<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.760> little<00:02:35.300> bit<00:02:35.570> different<00:02:36.050> well

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
things are a little bit different well

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.010 
things are a little bit different well
we<00:02:37.520> have<00:02:37.790> flipped<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.360> motherboard<00:02:38.870> tray

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
we have flipped the motherboard tray

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.540 
we have flipped the motherboard tray
around<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:41.300> CPU<00:02:41.600> is<00:02:42.200> actually<00:02:42.830> on

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
around so that the CPU is actually on

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.170 
around so that the CPU is actually on
the<00:02:43.610> lower<00:02:44.120> side<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.720> case<00:02:44.930> now<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:46.180> very

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
the lower side of the case now and very

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.700 
the lower side of the case now and very
very<00:02:47.450> hot<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:49.960> powerful<00:02:50.960> graphics<00:02:51.110> cards<00:02:51.530> are

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
very hot and powerful graphics cards are

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.540 
very hot and powerful graphics cards are
on<00:02:51.950> top<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.770> good<00:02:54.980> because<00:02:55.010> they<00:02:55.460> are

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
on top and this is good because they are

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.580 
on top and this is good because they are
closer<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.810> top<00:02:57.800> cooling<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.230> for<00:03:00.230> such<00:03:00.560> a

closer to the top cooling and for such a

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.760 
closer to the top cooling and for such a
small<00:03:00.830> case<00:03:01.280> there<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.210> a<00:03:02.510> lot<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:02.930> fan<00:03:03.260> options

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770

DVD<00:03:28.610> burner<00:03:28.910> base<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.720> mean<00:03:29.870> that's<00:03:29.960> right

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
DVD burner base I mean that's right

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.560 
DVD burner base I mean that's right
David<00:03:30.680> I've<00:03:30.770> just<00:03:30.920> noticed<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.490> virtually<00:03:32.270> I

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
David I've just noticed it virtually I

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.090 
David I've just noticed it virtually I
mean<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.930> could<00:03:33.050> put<00:03:33.200> any<00:03:33.410> video<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.770> cut<00:03:33.920> in

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
mean you could put any video to cut in

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.620 
mean you could put any video to cut in
here<00:03:34.280> right<00:03:34.520> because<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:34.820> is<00:03:35.180> so<00:03:35.450> much

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
here right because this is so much

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.870 
here right because this is so much
length<00:03:35.900> length<00:03:36.260> room<00:03:36.560> length<00:03:37.370> allows<00:03:37.640> room

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
length length room length allows room

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.740 
length length room length allows room
right<00:03:38.240> yeah<00:03:38.630> yeah<00:03:39.110> no<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:41.090> other<00:03:41.210> question<00:03:41.690> in

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
right yeah yeah no the other question in

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.050 
right yeah yeah no the other question in
this<00:03:41.840> case<00:03:41.900> I<00:03:42.590> think<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.190> lot<00:03:43.220> of<00:03:43.340> people<00:03:43.430> assume

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
this case I think a lot of people assume

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.370 
this case I think a lot of people assume
that<00:03:44.510> this<00:03:45.500> case<00:03:45.830> it's<00:03:46.670> small<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:48.080> cooling

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
that this case it's small so the cooling

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.930 
that this case it's small so the cooling
performance<00:03:48.530> might<00:03:48.980> not<00:03:49.160> be<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.340> good<00:03:49.640> happy

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
performance might not be that good happy

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.670 
performance might not be that good happy
in<00:03:50.480> your<00:03:50.600> testing<00:03:51.050> what<00:03:51.170> do<00:03:51.260> you<00:03:51.410> know<00:03:51.530> what

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
in your testing what do you know what

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.140 
in your testing what do you know what
are<00:03:51.770> your<00:03:51.920> numbers<00:03:52.040> journey<00:03:52.490> is<00:03:52.700> are<00:03:52.940> we<00:03:53.030> going

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
are your numbers journey is are we going

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.880 
are your numbers journey is are we going
to<00:03:53.210> be<00:03:53.270> able<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.450> expect<00:03:53.780> good<00:03:54.590> cooling

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
to be able to expect good cooling

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.170 
to be able to expect good cooling
performance<00:03:55.130> from<00:03:55.550> this<00:03:55.760> case<00:03:55.970> the

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
performance from this case the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.300 
performance from this case the
absolutely<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.870> helps<00:03:57.230> flipping<00:03:58.190> things

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
absolutely it helps flipping things

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.970 
absolutely it helps flipping things
around<00:03:58.610> like<00:03:58.940> this<00:03:59.470> it's<00:04:00.470> usually<00:04:00.950> a

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
around like this it's usually a

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.520 
around like this it's usually a
motherboard<00:04:01.550> tray<00:04:02.330> layout<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.050> you<00:04:03.170> see<00:04:03.350> on

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
motherboard tray layout that you see on

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.790 
motherboard tray layout that you see on
more<00:04:03.770> expensive<00:04:04.340> cases<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:06.380> really<00:04:06.590> works

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
more expensive cases and it really works

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.340 
more expensive cases and it really works
it<00:04:07.130> will<00:04:07.610> keep<00:04:07.760> your<00:04:07.910> special<00:04:08.600> your<00:04:08.750> cards<00:04:09.140> a

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
it will keep your special your cards a

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.090 
it will keep your special your cards a
lot<00:04:09.820> colder<00:04:10.820> and<00:04:11.810> obviously<00:04:12.620> running<00:04:12.800> more

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
lot colder and obviously running more

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.950 
lot colder and obviously running more
stable<00:04:13.520> then<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:15.530> is<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.710> small<00:04:16.040> case<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:17.060> but

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:17.960 
stable then it is a small case and but

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.430 
stable then it is a small case and but
we've<00:04:18.830> done<00:04:18.859> everything<00:04:19.820> we<00:04:20.000> can<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.600> still

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
we've done everything we can to still

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.690 
we've done everything we can to still
keep<00:04:22.900> still<00:04:23.900> keep<00:04:24.040> cable<00:04:25.040> management<00:04:25.280> options

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
keep still keep cable management options

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.410 
keep still keep cable management options
like<00:04:27.390> these<00:04:27.630> so<00:04:27.990> there<00:04:28.680> is<00:04:28.710> not<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.040> lot<00:04:29.190> of<00:04:29.490> room

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
like these so there is not a lot of room

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.150 
like these so there is not a lot of room
behind<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:31.140> motherboard<00:04:31.620> tray<00:04:31.770> but<00:04:32.010> it's

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
behind the motherboard tray but it's

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.880 
behind the motherboard tray but it's
also<00:04:32.340> not<00:04:32.610> needed<00:04:33.150> because<00:04:33.620> cables<00:04:34.620> from<00:04:34.710> your

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
also not needed because cables from your

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.980 
also not needed because cables from your
power<00:04:35.070> supply<00:04:35.310> they<00:04:36.090> can<00:04:36.270> still<00:04:36.450> go<00:04:36.720> through

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
power supply they can still go through

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
into you know the rest of the system so

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.370 
into you know the rest of the system so
all<00:05:08.010> in<00:05:08.280> all<00:05:08.400> it's<00:05:08.700> a<00:05:09.180> small<00:05:09.450> case<00:05:09.750> it's<00:05:10.080> going

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
to say it's a little bit early to say a

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.670 
to say it's a little bit early to say a
final<00:05:31.890> price<00:05:32.370> is<00:05:32.700> a<00:05:32.730> range<00:05:33.330> maybe<00:05:33.660> there<00:05:34.530> is<00:05:34.650> a

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
final price is a range maybe there is a

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.650 
final price is a range maybe there is a
range<00:05:34.950> of<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.790> range<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.210> we<00:05:36.300> can<00:05:36.510> say

range of the range that we can say

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.280 
range of the range that we can say
