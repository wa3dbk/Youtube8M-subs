the<00:02:44.230> grain<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.680> just<00:02:46.250> be<00:02:46.430> careful<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:49.750> well

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
the grain so just be careful that well

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.890 
the grain so just be careful that well
here<00:02:51.709> it's<00:02:52.610> nice<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.150> tight<00:02:53.330> now<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:55.900> just

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
here it's nice and tight now so just

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.900 
here it's nice and tight now so just
wipe<00:02:57.049> it<00:02:57.170> off<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:59.290> now<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:01.220> get<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.459> filter

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
wipe it off and now to get that filter

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.300 
wipe it off and now to get that filter
off<00:03:02.060> okay<00:03:02.480> we're<00:03:02.630> back<00:03:02.750> up<00:03:02.959> top<00:03:03.200> now<00:03:04.130> these

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
off okay we're back up top now these

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.150 
off okay we're back up top now these
filters<00:03:04.670> on<00:03:05.120> these<00:03:05.299> twenty<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.470> three<00:03:06.829> liters

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
filters on these twenty and three liters

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.699 
filters on these twenty and three liters
and<00:03:07.570> these<00:03:08.570> Toyota's<00:03:08.840> are<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.320> little<00:03:09.470> bit

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
and these Toyota's are a little bit

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.270 
and these Toyota's are a little bit
difficult<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:11.440> get<00:03:12.440> off<00:03:12.620> because<00:03:12.950> they're

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
difficult to get off because they're

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.520 
difficult to get off because they're
right<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:14.600> probably<00:03:14.870> can't<00:03:15.079> see<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.319> it's

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
right you probably can't see it it's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.090 
right you probably can't see it it's
right<00:03:15.769> under<00:03:16.250> there<00:03:16.519> underneath<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:18.100> exhaust

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
right under there underneath the exhaust

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.740 
right under there underneath the exhaust
manifold<00:03:19.519> you<00:03:19.640> see<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.819> barcode<00:03:20.239> that's<00:03:20.540> the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
manifold you see a barcode that's the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.990 
manifold you see a barcode that's the
filter<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.319> think<00:03:23.170> well<00:03:24.400> let's<00:03:25.400> see<00:03:25.579> if<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:25.790> can

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
filter I think well let's see if I can

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.250 
filter I think well let's see if I can
do<00:03:26.299> this<00:03:30.340> now<00:03:33.579> luckily<00:03:34.579> I<00:03:35.019> changed<00:03:36.019> it<00:03:36.139> before

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
do this now luckily I changed it before

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.190 
do this now luckily I changed it before
so<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.590> didn't<00:03:36.769> put<00:03:36.889> on<00:03:37.720> super<00:03:38.720> tight<00:03:38.900> because<00:03:39.139> I

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
so I didn't put on super tight because I

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.069 
so I didn't put on super tight because I
knew<00:03:39.319> it's<00:03:39.470> going<00:03:39.500> to<00:03:39.680> be<00:03:39.739> changed<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.069> again

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
knew it's going to be changed it again

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.309 
knew it's going to be changed it again
let's<00:03:42.079> see<00:03:43.030> now<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.389> filters<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:44.840> side<00:03:45.079> block

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
let's see now the filters on side block

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.900 
let's see now the filters on side block
so<00:03:45.819> you're<00:03:46.819> going<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.000> make<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.209> mess<00:03:47.450> it's<00:03:47.690> just

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
so you're going to make a mess it's just

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.960 
so you're going to make a mess it's just
how<00:03:49.910> it's<00:03:50.030> going<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.239> go<00:03:50.389> now<00:03:50.870> I've<00:03:51.019> got<00:03:51.170> it

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
how it's going to go now I've got it

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.009 
how it's going to go now I've got it
screwed<00:03:52.970> off<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.090> little<00:03:53.299> bit<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:53.750> it's

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
screwed off a little bit and it's

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.699 
screwed off a little bit and it's
draining<00:03:54.440> just<00:03:56.109> let<00:03:57.109> that<00:03:57.230> sit<00:03:57.470> for<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.650> few

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
draining just let that sit for a few

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.030 
draining just let that sit for a few
minutes<00:03:58.040> and<00:03:58.190> then<00:03:58.340> take<00:03:58.910> it<00:03:58.940> off<00:03:59.769> now<00:04:00.769> before

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
minutes and then take it off now before

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.610 
minutes and then take it off now before
we<00:04:01.130> get<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.340> photo<00:04:01.549> screwed<00:04:01.880> on

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
we get the photo screwed on

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.280 
we get the photo screwed on
