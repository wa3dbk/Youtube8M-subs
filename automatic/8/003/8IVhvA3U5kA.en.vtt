no bumps or anything anywhere apart from

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.040 
no bumps or anything anywhere apart from
the<00:00:35.130> terrain<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:35.700> obviously<00:00:36.030> that's<00:00:36.690> terrain

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the terrain but obviously that's terrain

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.389 
the terrain but obviously that's terrain
that's<00:00:37.290> meant<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.590> bumpy<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.010> that's<00:00:38.250> cool

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
that's meant to be bumpy and that's cool

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
that's meant to be bumpy and that's cool
and<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> hybrid<00:00:40.020> which<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.500> really<00:00:40.680> cool

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and it is a hybrid which is really cool

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.380 
and it is a hybrid which is really cool
is<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.129> half<00:00:41.309> terrain<00:00:41.610> half<00:00:41.879> sky<00:00:42.120> track

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
is like half terrain half sky track

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.540 
is like half terrain half sky track
which<00:00:42.960> really<00:00:43.200> mixes<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> up<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.950> stuff<00:00:44.250> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
which really mixes it up and stuff and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400 
which really mixes it up and stuff and
it<00:00:44.879> shows<00:00:44.940> Asian<00:00:45.420> fought<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.930> variety<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
it shows Asian fought with a variety of

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
it shows Asian fought with a variety of
styles<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:48.500> add<00:00:49.500> she<00:00:49.649> goes<00:00:49.800> all<00:00:49.980> over<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.309> map

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
styles and add she goes all over the map

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.889 
styles and add she goes all over the map
which<00:00:50.670> every<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.149> we're<00:00:51.300> all<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.600> sticking

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
which every like we're all just sticking

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.660 
which every like we're all just sticking
in<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.140> really<00:00:52.350> small<00:00:52.559> area<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.489> over

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
in one really small area because over

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580 
in one really small area because over
the<00:00:53.789> grass<00:00:54.000> event<00:00:54.329> into<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:55.230> building

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the grass event into this like building

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.119 
the grass event into this like building
area<00:00:55.980> goes<00:00:56.760> outside<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.840> over<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.440> lagoon

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
area goes outside like over the lagoon

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.729 
area goes outside like over the lagoon
late<00:00:59.579> season<00:01:00.270> which<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:00.960> nothing<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.559> really

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
late season which is nothing is really

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.050 
late season which is nothing is really
cool<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:03.379> yeah<00:01:04.379> there<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> few<00:01:05.700> things<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
cool and yeah there is a few things that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.080 
cool and yeah there is a few things that
could<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.299> improved<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.380> first<00:01:07.710> hill<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
could be improved the first hill it's a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.910 
could be improved the first hill it's a
bit<00:01:09.240> weird<00:01:09.420> because<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:10.229> makes<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.710> really

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
bit weird because it makes you really

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.179 
bit weird because it makes you really
slow<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.490> them<00:01:12.500> shield<00:01:13.500> doors<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.100> then

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
slow with them shield doors but then

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
slow with them shield doors but then
they<00:01:14.310> make<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.520> kind<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.909> outwards<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
they make you kind of go outwards to the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.620 
they make you kind of go outwards to the
angle<00:01:16.020> our<00:01:16.140> app<00:01:16.259> which<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.619> kind<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.100> weird<00:01:17.630> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
angle our app which is kind of weird and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.499 
angle our app which is kind of weird and
then<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> take<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.799> too<00:01:20.189> fast<00:01:20.509> you'll

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
then if you take it like too fast you'll

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.530 
then if you take it like too fast you'll
just<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:22.500> fall<00:01:22.740> off<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.070> die<00:01:23.360> all<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
just like fall off and die all the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
just like fall off and die all the
teleporter<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> teleporter<00:01:26.939> it's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
teleporter all the teleporter it's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.960 
teleporter all the teleporter it's
really<00:01:27.900> inconsistent<00:01:28.670> something<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> would

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
really inconsistent something that would

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.280 
really inconsistent something that would
send<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.420> flying<00:01:30.720> off<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> track<00:01:31.259> or

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
send you like flying off the track or

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.760 
send you like flying off the track or
flipping<00:01:31.740> over<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.220> stuff<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.810> also<00:01:34.049> on<00:01:34.530> bits

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
flipping over and stuff and also on bits

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.020 
flipping over and stuff and also on bits
like<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.220> kind<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.460> some<00:01:35.610> backwards

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
like this is kind of some backwards

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.300 
like this is kind of some backwards
tapering<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> mean<00:01:37.350> normal<00:01:37.590> tapering<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.009> ok

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
tapering so I mean normal tapering is ok

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.450 
tapering so I mean normal tapering is ok
but<00:01:38.610> when<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.780> crash<00:01:40.020> into<00:01:40.259> it

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
but when it like you can crash into it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.160 
but when it like you can crash into it
that's<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.759> annoying<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:43.049> you

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that's kind of annoying and as you

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.420 
that's kind of annoying and as you
probably<00:01:43.350> saw<00:01:43.470> Larry<00:01:43.799> didn't<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.130> any<00:01:44.250> points

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
probably saw Larry didn't get any points

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
probably saw Larry didn't get any points
from<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> destination<00:01:45.390> that's<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:46.649> last

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
from the destination that's the last

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.789 
from the destination that's the last
problem<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:48.119> destination<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.720> too<00:01:48.869> thin<00:01:49.140> so

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
problem the destination is too thin so
