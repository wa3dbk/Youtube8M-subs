let's<00:01:44.689> take<00:01:44.899> a<00:01:44.929> quick<00:01:45.229> look<00:01:45.259> at<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.590> spline

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
let's take a quick look at the spline

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.609 
let's take a quick look at the spline
point<00:01:46.219> icon<00:01:46.639> there<00:01:47.329> are<00:01:47.509> two<00:01:47.659> useful<00:01:48.139> items<00:01:48.469> on

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
point icon there are two useful items on

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.099 
point icon there are two useful items on
the<00:01:48.770> icon<00:01:49.130> first<00:01:49.909> it<00:01:50.270> tells<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:50.749> the<00:01:50.869> distance

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
the icon first it tells you the distance

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.260 
the icon first it tells you the distance
in<00:01:51.530> meters<00:01:51.679> between<00:01:52.069> that<00:01:52.459> spine<00:01:52.789> point<00:01:53.090> and

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
in meters between that spine point and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.510 
in meters between that spine point and
you're<00:01:53.450> starting<00:01:53.840> checkpoint<00:01:54.369> this<00:01:55.369> will

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
you're starting checkpoint this will

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.219 
you're starting checkpoint this will
come<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.700> really<00:01:55.999> handy<00:01:56.119> later<00:01:56.569> when<00:01:56.929> we<00:01:57.049> get

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
come in really handy later when we get

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.989 
come in really handy later when we get

00:01:58.989 --> 00:01:58.999 
into creating skill games especially

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.090 
into creating skill games especially
ones<00:01:59.569> that<00:01:59.659> use<00:01:59.929> distance<00:02:00.469> as<00:02:00.649> part<00:02:00.859> of<00:02:00.950> the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
ones that use distance as part of the

this line represents the size of your
curve<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.599> shorter<00:02:09.440> line<00:02:09.649> is<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> sharper<00:02:10.429> curve

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
curve a shorter line is a sharper curve

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.880 
curve a shorter line is a sharper curve
the<00:02:11.270> longer<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.810> line<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.319> wider<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
the longer the line the wider and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.610 
the longer the line the wider and
smoother<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.430> curve<00:02:13.670> so<00:02:14.660> now<00:02:14.840> let's<00:02:15.260> go<00:02:15.410> back

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
smoother the curve so now let's go back

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.960 
smoother the curve so now let's go back
to<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.860> curve<00:02:16.040> we've<00:02:16.280> created<00:02:16.550> I've

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
to the curve we've created I've

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.510 
to the curve we've created I've
purposely<00:02:17.660> made<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.350> little<00:02:18.500> sharp<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.400> that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
purposely made it a little sharp so that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.280 
purposely made it a little sharp so that
you<00:02:19.610> can<00:02:19.760> see<00:02:20.000> how<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.210> adjust<00:02:20.660> that

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
you can see how to adjust that

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.559 
you can see how to adjust that
first<00:02:21.799> grab<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.430> spline<00:02:22.700> point<00:02:22.969> icon<00:02:23.329> on<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
first grab the spline point icon on the

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.289 
first grab the spline point icon on the
curve<00:02:23.959> once<00:02:24.950> selected<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.819> left<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.269> right

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
curve once selected the left and right

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.869 
curve once selected the left and right
triggers<00:02:26.810> adjust<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.439> amount<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.890> curve<00:02:28.159> left

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
triggers adjust the amount of curve left

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.300 
triggers adjust the amount of curve left
makes<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.329> smaller<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.810> sharper<00:02:30.379> you<00:02:30.920> can<00:02:31.099> see

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
makes it smaller and sharper you can see

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.800 
makes it smaller and sharper you can see
here<00:02:31.549> if<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.760> hold<00:02:31.939> the<00:02:32.120> left<00:02:32.299> trigger<00:02:32.510> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
here if I hold the left trigger the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.599 
here if I hold the left trigger the
horizontal<00:02:33.379> line<00:02:33.560> shrinks<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.129> nothing<00:02:34.489> and

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
horizontal line shrinks to nothing and

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.179 
horizontal line shrinks to nothing and
the<00:02:35.120> curve<00:02:35.329> becomes<00:02:35.689> a<00:02:35.840> sharp<00:02:36.140> angle<00:02:36.379> which<00:02:36.980> is

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:37.189 
the curve becomes a sharp angle which is

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.460 
the curve becomes a sharp angle which is
of<00:02:37.310> course<00:02:37.489> too<00:02:37.790> sharp<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.150> drive<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:39.109> my<00:02:39.140> line

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
of course too sharp to drive so my line

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.979 
of course too sharp to drive so my line
turns<00:02:39.769> red<00:02:40.120> right<00:02:41.120> trigger<00:02:41.390> makes<00:02:41.659> the<00:02:41.810> curve

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
turns red right trigger makes the curve

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.319 
turns red right trigger makes the curve
wider<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:43.220> can<00:02:43.370> see<00:02:43.579> as<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.909> hold<00:02:44.090> right

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
wider and you can see as I hold right

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.449 
wider and you can see as I hold right
trigger<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:45.079> horizontal<00:02:45.650> line<00:02:45.799> grows<00:02:46.129> and

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
trigger the horizontal line grows and

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.210 
trigger the horizontal line grows and
the<00:02:46.549> curve<00:02:46.790> becomes<00:02:47.120> wider<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.720> smoother<00:02:48.220> one

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
the curve becomes wider and smoother one

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.099 
the curve becomes wider and smoother one
thing<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.489> note<00:02:49.849> is<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.450> more<00:02:50.659> distance

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
thing to note is that the more distance

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.170 
thing to note is that the more distance
there<00:02:51.319> is<00:02:51.349> between<00:02:51.469> spline<00:02:52.280> points<00:02:52.700> the

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
there is between spline points the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.089 
there is between spline points the
easier<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:53.720> will<00:02:53.840> be<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.049> get<00:02:54.379> a<00:02:54.439> nice<00:02:54.739> smooth

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
easier it will be to get a nice smooth

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.729 
easier it will be to get a nice smooth
curve<00:02:55.629> finally<00:02:56.629> we'll<00:02:57.079> grab<00:02:57.319> our<00:02:57.470> last
