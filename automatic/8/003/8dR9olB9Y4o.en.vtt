a<00:00:04.399> RC<00:00:05.399> enthusiast<00:00:05.550> I<00:00:06.269> wanted<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.689> show<00:00:06.899> you<00:00:06.930> a

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
a RC enthusiast I wanted to show you a

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.770 
a RC enthusiast I wanted to show you a
mod<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> did<00:00:08.670> for<00:00:08.910> my<00:00:08.990> red<00:00:09.990> cat<00:00:10.260> Rs<00:00:10.680> 10<00:00:11.129> I

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
mod that I did for my red cat Rs 10 I

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.200 
mod that I did for my red cat Rs 10 I
constructed<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.900> skid<00:00:13.230> plate<00:00:13.910> because<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.089> was

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
constructed a skid plate because I was

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.670 
constructed a skid plate because I was
noticing<00:00:15.630> that<00:00:15.750> my<00:00:15.900> links<00:00:16.259> were<00:00:16.349> really

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
noticing that my links were really

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.820 
noticing that my links were really
getting<00:00:16.980> chewed<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:18.000> heck<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.509> it's<00:00:19.470> probably

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
getting chewed to heck and it's probably

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.800 
getting chewed to heck and it's probably
also<00:00:20.100> pretty<00:00:20.640> abusive<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> whole

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
also pretty abusive to the whole

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.390 
also pretty abusive to the whole
steering<00:00:22.199> linkage<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.920> servo<00:00:23.279> and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
steering linkage and servo and

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.970 
steering linkage and servo and
everything<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:25.789> sixteenth<00:00:26.789> inch<00:00:27.000> aluminum

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
everything so sixteenth inch aluminum

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.189 
everything so sixteenth inch aluminum
came<00:00:28.980> up<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> pattern<00:00:29.550> folded<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.300> up<00:00:30.449> it's

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
came up with a pattern folded it up it's

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.880 
came up with a pattern folded it up it's
attached<00:00:31.730> at<00:00:32.730> each<00:00:33.269> one<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.989> lower<00:00:34.530> link

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
attached at each one of the lower link

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.320 
attached at each one of the lower link
points<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> bolt<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:35.699> goes<00:00:36.000> all<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.239> way

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.330 
points the bolt just goes all the way

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.240 
points the bolt just goes all the way
through<00:00:36.659> so<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.199> is<00:00:37.379> nut<00:00:37.650> it<00:00:37.769> off<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.159> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
through so this is nut it off on the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.110 
through so this is nut it off on the
bottom<00:00:38.430> okay<00:00:38.960> show<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.019> that<00:00:40.229> real<00:00:40.470> nice

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
bottom okay show you that real nice

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.229 
bottom okay show you that real nice
radius<00:00:42.120> there<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.690> think<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.470> can<00:00:43.650> see<00:00:44.089> got<00:00:45.089> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
radius there I think you can see got the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.570 
radius there I think you can see got the
radius<00:00:45.600> real<00:00:45.809> nice<00:00:46.040> but<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.159> thing<00:00:47.190> that's

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
radius real nice but the thing that's

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.600 
radius real nice but the thing that's
really<00:00:47.850> nice<00:00:48.119> about<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.900> that<00:00:49.369> it's<00:00:50.369> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
really nice about it is that it's a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.660 
really nice about it is that it's a
system<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.420> me<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.900> put<00:00:52.769> weights<00:00:53.040> different

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
system for me to put weights different

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.079 
system for me to put weights different
weights<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:55.080> front<00:00:55.619> of<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.830> until<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.820> get

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
weights on the front of it until I get

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.420 
weights on the front of it until I get
the<00:00:57.269> right<00:00:57.449> amount<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.780> weight<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.860> is<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> big

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the right amount of weight this is a big

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.649 
the right amount of weight this is a big
old<00:00:59.640> chunk<00:00:59.970> over<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.839> inch<00:01:01.820> brass<00:01:02.820> hex<00:01:03.239> stock

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
old chunk over one inch brass hex stock

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.380 
old chunk over one inch brass hex stock
and<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.619> cut<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.979> down<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.580> would<00:01:05.700> slide<00:01:06.030> past

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and I cut it down so it would slide past

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.080 
and I cut it down so it would slide past
the<00:01:06.720> transmission<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.680> cut<00:01:08.370> a<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.490> slot<00:01:09.060> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the transmission I cut a little slot in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.680 
the transmission I cut a little slot in
it<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.050> that<00:01:10.200> my<00:01:10.350> upper<00:01:10.530> brace<00:01:10.980> okay<00:01:11.520> my<00:01:12.480> whole

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
it so that my upper brace okay my whole

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.690 
it so that my upper brace okay my whole
skid<00:01:13.170> plate<00:01:13.440> is<00:01:13.650> connected<00:01:14.130> at<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> bottom

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
skid plate is connected at the bottom

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.090 
skid plate is connected at the bottom
and<00:01:14.880> two<00:01:15.000> points<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:16.440> it's<00:01:16.620> connected

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and two points and then it's connected

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.370 
and two points and then it's connected
right<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.820> with<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.960> knife<00:01:19.170> will

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
right up here with this knife will

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.910 
right up here with this knife will
embrace<00:01:19.790> this<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.940> doubled<00:01:21.330> up<00:01:21.620> as<00:01:22.620> you<00:01:22.770> can

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
embrace this is doubled up as you can

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.520 
embrace this is doubled up as you can
see<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.310> removable<00:01:23.820> I've<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.480> a<00:01:24.510> couple<00:01:25.410> of

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
see it's removable I've got a couple of

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.670 
see it's removable I've got a couple of
nice<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:25.860> button<00:01:26.370> head<00:01:26.550> screws<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.680> so

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
nice little button head screws on it so

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.340 
nice little button head screws on it so
I<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.920> take<00:01:29.100> those<00:01:29.280> off<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.720> take<00:01:30.870> that<00:01:31.080> off

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
I can take those off I can take that off

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.200 
I can take those off I can take that off
and<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:31.830> I<00:01:31.920> can<00:01:32.100> put<00:01:32.250> whatever<00:01:32.460> weight<00:01:32.880> I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
and then I can put whatever weight I

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.120 
and then I can put whatever weight I
want<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> could<00:01:34.620> put<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.800> smaller

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
want in there I could put a smaller

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.540 
want in there I could put a smaller
weight<00:01:35.400> or<00:01:35.580> whatever<00:01:36.320> this<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> very<00:01:37.950> hefty

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
weight or whatever this is a very hefty

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.660 
weight or whatever this is a very hefty
amount<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.090> weight<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.330> think<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.659> is

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
amount of weight I think this is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670 
amount of weight I think this is
probably<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.300> right<00:01:42.680> because

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
probably going to be about right because

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.649 
probably going to be about right because
I've<00:01:43.980> seen<00:01:44.159> guys<00:01:44.370> putting<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.880> lot<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.060> brass<00:01:45.360> on

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
I've seen guys putting a lot of brass on

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.590 
I've seen guys putting a lot of brass on
their<00:01:45.840> knuckles<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.830> mean<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:48.000> much<00:01:48.300> on

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
their knuckles I mean like this much on

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.230 
their knuckles I mean like this much on
that<00:01:48.900> each<00:01:49.110> knuckle<00:01:49.620> and<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.650> I<00:01:52.890> think<00:01:53.240> in

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
that each knuckle and this is I think in

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.750 
that each knuckle and this is I think in
some<00:01:54.450> ways<00:01:54.479> maybe<00:01:55.260> even<00:01:55.650> better<00:01:55.890> because<00:01:56.430> it's

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
some ways maybe even better because it's

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.620 
some ways maybe even better because it's
forward<00:01:58.490> but<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.850> look<00:02:00.030> at<00:02:00.180> where<00:02:00.450> it's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
forward but if you look at where it's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.210 
forward but if you look at where it's
located<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.780> right<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:04.020> line<00:02:04.080> with<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
located it is right in line with the

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.339 
located it is right in line with the
excellent<00:02:05.760> I<00:02:05.970> mean<00:02:06.900> right<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.350> line<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.890> it

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
excellent I mean right in line with it

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.940 
excellent I mean right in line with it
and<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:10.250> skid<00:02:10.640> plate<00:02:10.670> as<00:02:11.299> you<00:02:11.420> can<00:02:11.569> see<00:02:11.950> isn't

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
and a skid plate as you can see isn't

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.449 
and a skid plate as you can see isn't
going<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.719> stop<00:02:14.719> the<00:02:15.349> wheels<00:02:15.620> from<00:02:15.829> doing

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
going to stop the wheels from doing

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.319 
going to stop the wheels from doing
anything<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.939> they<00:02:17.060> would<00:02:17.180> have<00:02:17.269> done

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
anything that they would have done

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.050 
anything that they would have done
anyways<00:02:17.840> because<00:02:18.500> I've<00:02:19.219> got<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.609> skid<00:02:19.879> plate

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
anyways because I've got the skid plate

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.240 
anyways because I've got the skid plate
literally<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.980> know<00:02:22.099> 1/16<00:02:22.849> off<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.329> the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
literally you know 1/16 off of the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.649 
literally you know 1/16 off of the
transmission<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.150> about<00:02:26.299> as<00:02:26.420> close<00:02:26.599> to

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
transmission so it's about as close to

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.580 
transmission so it's about as close to
the<00:02:26.930> transmission<00:02:27.560> as<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.799> could<00:02:27.950> get<00:02:28.159> it<00:02:29.590> we

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
the transmission as I could get it we

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.280 
the transmission as I could get it we
still<00:02:30.799> got<00:02:30.980> plenty<00:02:31.129> of<00:02:31.400> clearance<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.290> that

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
still got plenty of clearance and that

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.429 
still got plenty of clearance and that
way<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:34.090> won't<00:02:35.090> be<00:02:35.180> beating<00:02:35.629> at<00:02:35.750> my<00:02:35.870> linkage<00:02:36.260> so

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
way I won't be beating at my linkage so

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:42.099 
way I won't be beating at my linkage so
much<00:02:38.019> sliding<00:02:39.019> over<00:02:39.260> stuff<00:02:40.569> all<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:41.629> and

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
much sliding over stuff all that and

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.470 
much sliding over stuff all that and
it's<00:02:42.590> got<00:02:42.769> some<00:02:43.280> nice<00:02:43.459> bends<00:02:43.879> in<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.180> as<00:02:44.389> you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
it's got some nice bends in it as you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.750 
it's got some nice bends in it as you
can<00:02:44.629> see<00:02:44.689> so<00:02:45.109> it's<00:02:45.230> not<00:02:45.439> going<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.829> catch

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
can see so it's not going to catch

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.199 
can see so it's not going to catch
anything<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.510> if<00:02:47.989> I<00:02:48.079> have<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.409> back<00:02:48.709> up<00:02:49.010> okay

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
anything and if I have to back up okay

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.330 
anything and if I have to back up okay
I<00:02:50.239> sort<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.840> hanging<00:02:51.169> up<00:02:51.409> on<00:02:51.590> my<00:02:51.769> linkage<00:02:52.159> like

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
I sort of hanging up on my linkage like

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.610 
I sort of hanging up on my linkage like
I've<00:02:52.519> been<00:02:52.669> and<00:02:53.299> smashing<00:02:53.870> my<00:02:53.989> linkage<00:02:54.379> and

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
I've been and smashing my linkage and

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.140 
I've been and smashing my linkage and
bashing<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.099> all<00:02:55.250> over<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.519> place<00:02:55.730> now<00:02:55.970> it's

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
bashing it all over the place now it's

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.690 
bashing it all over the place now it's
going<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.389> bump<00:02:56.599> up<00:02:56.810> over<00:02:57.169> it<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.280> kind<00:02:58.609> of

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
going to bump up over it so I kind of

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.649 
going to bump up over it so I kind of
like<00:02:58.849> it<00:02:58.909> I<00:02:59.239> think<00:02:59.480> it's<00:02:59.599> a<00:02:59.689> pretty<00:02:59.930> neat<00:03:00.169> mod

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
like it I think it's a pretty neat mod

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.460 
like it I think it's a pretty neat mod
and<00:03:02.659> again<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:02.959> would<00:03:03.139> since<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:03.739> did<00:03:04.129> it

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
and again I would since I just did it

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.899 
and again I would since I just did it
but<00:03:06.470> yeah<00:03:07.069> it<00:03:07.579> pretty<00:03:07.819> much<00:03:07.939> gets<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:08.739> rig

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
but yeah it pretty much gets the rig

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.729 
but yeah it pretty much gets the rig
really<00:03:10.909> crazy<00:03:11.209> now<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.480> can<00:03:11.870> actually<00:03:12.079> balance

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
really crazy now I can actually balance

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.240 
really crazy now I can actually balance
it<00:03:12.919> beyond<00:03:13.849> vertical<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:15.650> now<00:03:15.829> wants<00:03:16.190> to

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
it beyond vertical it now wants to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.819 
it beyond vertical it now wants to
balance<00:03:16.519> about<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.629> is<00:03:17.810> its<00:03:18.019> balance<00:03:18.500> point

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
balance about this is its balance point

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.580 
balance about this is its balance point
if<00:03:18.979> you<00:03:19.099> can<00:03:19.280> tell<00:03:19.489> against<00:03:20.319> vertical<00:03:21.319> so<00:03:21.470> I'm

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
if you can tell against vertical so I'm

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.719 
if you can tell against vertical so I'm
actually<00:03:22.040> several<00:03:22.400> degrees<00:03:22.609> beyond<00:03:24.699> where<00:03:25.699> I

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
actually several degrees beyond where I

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.089 
actually several degrees beyond where I
was<00:03:25.819> without<00:03:26.419> the<00:03:26.479> weight<00:03:26.870> so<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.709> think<00:03:27.799> that's

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
was without the weight so I think that's

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.020 
was without the weight so I think that's
pretty<00:03:28.250> awesome

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.990 

alright<00:03:32.030> thanks<00:03:32.510> for<00:03:32.540> watching<00:03:33.019> guys<00:03:33.849> get<00:03:34.849> out

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
alright thanks for watching guys get out

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.059 
alright thanks for watching guys get out
there<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.299> crawl<00:03:35.680> unless<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.859> live

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
there and crawl unless you live

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.400 
there and crawl unless you live
somewhere<00:03:37.879> like<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.359> do<00:03:38.859> and<00:03:39.859> you<00:03:39.919> have<00:03:40.099> to<00:03:40.159> wait
