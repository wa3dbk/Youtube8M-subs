video<00:00:24.970> those<00:00:25.359> videos<00:00:25.689> on<00:00:25.929> my<00:00:26.050> lossy<00:00:26.320> mini<00:00:26.650> 8<00:00:26.829> of

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:27.329 
video those videos on my lossy mini 8 of

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.079 
video those videos on my lossy mini 8 of
just<00:00:28.329> this<00:00:29.169> is<00:00:29.289> just<00:00:29.560> a<00:00:29.650> shock<00:00:30.039> fix<00:00:30.429> that<00:00:30.759> I<00:00:30.789> got

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
just this is just a shock fix that I got

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.230 
just this is just a shock fix that I got
well<00:00:31.960> it's<00:00:32.230> been<00:00:32.800> through<00:00:33.070> my<00:00:33.220> testing<00:00:33.910> and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
well it's been through my testing and

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.650 
well it's been through my testing and
that's<00:00:34.510> my<00:00:34.960> testing<00:00:35.440> was<00:00:35.590> backflips<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:37.390> um

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
that's my testing was backflips like um

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.950 
that's my testing was backflips like um
like<00:00:38.110> more<00:00:38.560> than<00:00:38.740> 30<00:00:39.130> backflips

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
like more than 30 backflips

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.350 
like more than 30 backflips
so<00:00:40.960> as<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:41.800> there's<00:00:42.250> bad<00:00:42.520> landings<00:00:43.120> to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
so as and there's bad landings to

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.920 
so as and there's bad landings to
so<00:00:43.750> it's<00:00:44.560> it<00:00:45.070> still<00:00:45.550> held<00:00:45.850> up<00:00:46.030> so<00:00:46.270> I<00:00:46.300> guess<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:46.900> a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
so it's it still held up so I guess is a

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.800 
so it's it still held up so I guess is a
good<00:00:47.230> shock<00:00:47.560> fix<00:00:47.830> for<00:00:48.130> me<00:00:48.240> my<00:00:49.240> rear<00:00:49.570> shock

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
good shock fix for me my rear shock

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.450 
good shock fix for me my rear shock
tower<00:00:49.840> is<00:00:50.290> fine<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:50.890> nothing<00:00:51.310> has<00:00:51.430> happened

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
tower is fine that nothing has happened

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.130 
tower is fine that nothing has happened
to<00:00:51.850> have<00:00:52.060> a<00:00:52.090> carbon-fiber<00:00:52.600> rear<00:00:52.840> shock<00:00:53.110> tower

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
to have a carbon-fiber rear shock tower

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.820 
to have a carbon-fiber rear shock tower
so<00:00:53.620> I<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.910> know<00:00:55.000> it's<00:00:55.120> just<00:00:55.240> it's<00:00:55.600> fine<00:00:55.900> so<00:00:56.800> I

a new front shock tower outside the
camera<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:31.060> guys<00:01:31.270> had<00:01:31.479> Altima<00:01:32.080> hobby's<00:01:32.440> where

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
I bought the front shock tower from said

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.310 
I bought the front shock tower from said
to<00:01:35.290> get<00:01:35.880> put<00:01:36.880> CA<00:01:37.180> glue<00:01:37.570> or<00:01:37.900> tire<00:01:38.770> glue<00:01:39.600> around<00:01:40.600> I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
to get put CA glue or tire glue around I

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.670 
to get put CA glue or tire glue around I
don't<00:01:41.830> know<00:01:42.900> I'm<00:01:43.900> trying<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.200> get<00:01:44.290> focus

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
don't know I'm trying to get focus

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.890 
don't know I'm trying to get focus
around<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.250> whole<00:01:45.580> shock<00:01:46.000> tower<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.630> just

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
around the whole shock tower so just

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.710 
around the whole shock tower so just
spread<00:01:47.619> it<00:01:47.680> out<00:01:47.890> along<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.520> shock<00:01:49.119> tower<00:01:49.390> cuz

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
spread it out along the shock tower cuz

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.500 
spread it out along the shock tower cuz
I'm<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:51.220> fibers<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.909> shock<00:01:52.270> tower

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
I'm the the fibers of the shock tower

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.560 
I'm the the fibers of the shock tower
art<00:01:52.780> I'm<00:01:53.110> exposed<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.100> that's<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.119> really<00:01:55.390> good

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
art I'm exposed so that's a really good

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.530 
art I'm exposed so that's a really good
fracture<00:01:56.170> point<00:01:56.409> for<00:01:56.650> him<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.880> anything<00:01:58.150> so

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
fracture point for him for anything so

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.289 
fracture point for him for anything so
unless<00:01:58.840> what<00:01:59.080> you<00:01:59.140> should<00:01:59.350> do<00:01:59.470> and<00:01:59.740> then<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.790> got

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
unless what you should do and then I got

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.320 
unless what you should do and then I got
washers<00:02:01.840> for<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:03.040> back<00:02:03.250> support<00:02:03.700> on<00:02:03.880> this

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
washers for the back support on this

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.779 
washers for the back support on this
side<00:02:04.630> or<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.590> support<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.189> this<00:02:06.340> side<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:09.250> it's

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
side or the support on this side so it's

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.150 
side or the support on this side so it's
been<00:02:10.090> through<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.690> whole<00:02:10.959> bunch<00:02:10.990> of<00:02:11.319> stuff<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:11.590> I

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
been through a whole bunch of stuff so I

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.960 
been through a whole bunch of stuff so I
think<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:13.030> should

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
think it should

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.010 
think it should
it<00:02:14.390> should<00:02:14.600> be<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> good<00:02:15.020> fit<00:02:15.320> for<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.830> guys<00:02:15.980> so

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
it should be a good fit for you guys so

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.780 
it should be a good fit for you guys so
this<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.350> part<00:02:18.680> number<00:02:18.980> for<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.280> washers

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
this is the part number for the washers

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.610 
this is the part number for the washers
it's<00:02:20.060> through<00:02:20.330> by<00:02:20.510> six<00:02:20.870> millimeter<00:02:21.320> round

or the shock will be interrupted by the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.150 
or the shock will be interrupted by the
shock<00:03:09.590> eyelet<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.340> don't<00:03:11.270> know<00:03:11.420> why<00:03:11.630> but<00:03:12.160> this

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
shock eyelet I don't know why but this

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.670 
shock eyelet I don't know why but this
rubs<00:03:13.490> against<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> arm<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:15.140> did<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:15.440> for

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
rubs against the a arm and did that for

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.070 
rubs against the a arm and did that for
the<00:03:15.770> rear<00:03:15.950> my<00:03:16.250> rear<00:03:16.490> has<00:03:16.730> never<00:03:17.300> had<00:03:17.630> problems

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
the rear my rear has never had problems

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.790 
the rear my rear has never had problems
yet<00:03:18.760> knock<00:03:19.760> on<00:03:19.970> foot<00:03:20.350> just<00:03:21.350> don't<00:03:21.530> feel<00:03:21.709> like

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
yet knock on foot just don't feel like

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.270 
yet knock on foot just don't feel like
buying<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.310> little<00:03:22.520> British<00:03:22.850> shock<00:03:23.060> salary<00:03:23.450> um

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
buying a little British shock salary um

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.010 
buying a little British shock salary um
yeah<00:03:25.280> I've<00:03:25.400> been<00:03:25.550> I<00:03:25.790> just<00:03:26.060> been<00:03:26.209> doing<00:03:26.390> a<00:03:26.720> lot

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
yeah I've been I just been doing a lot

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.800 
yeah I've been I just been doing a lot
of<00:03:27.050> back<00:03:27.290> flips<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.860> think<00:03:28.610> it's<00:03:28.790> more<00:03:29.060> than<00:03:29.209> 20

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
of back flips I think it's more than 20

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.770 
of back flips I think it's more than 20
so<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:31.010> think<00:03:31.190> that<00:03:31.850> should<00:03:32.150> be<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.330> good<00:03:32.510> test

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
so I think that should be a good test

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.250 
so I think that should be a good test
for<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.260> shock<00:03:33.590> tower<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:34.720> landed<00:03:35.720> on<00:03:35.930> top<00:03:36.200> of

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
for the shock tower I landed on top of

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.040 
for the shock tower I landed on top of
the<00:03:36.500> shock<00:03:36.740> tower<00:03:36.980> many<00:03:37.370> times<00:03:37.930> just<00:03:38.930> like

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
the shock tower many times just like

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.150 
the shock tower many times just like
this<00:03:39.940> on<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.060> shock<00:03:41.270> tower<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.980> nothing<00:03:42.980> has

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
this on the shock tower and nothing has

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.870 
this on the shock tower and nothing has
happened

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
happened

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.310 
happened
I<00:03:44.890> bet<00:03:45.890> maybe<00:03:46.700> if<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.420> do<00:03:47.570> it<00:03:47.720> like<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.900> really

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
I bet maybe if you do it like a really

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.460 
I bet maybe if you do it like a really
good<00:03:48.530> impact<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:50.480> would<00:03:50.720> break<00:03:51.020> because<00:03:51.200> it's

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
good impact it would break because it's

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.560 
good impact it would break because it's
a<00:03:51.560> carbon<00:03:51.860> fiber<00:03:52.040> shock<00:03:52.310> tower<00:03:52.580> they<00:03:52.910> don't<00:03:53.090> we

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
a carbon fiber shock tower they don't we

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.690 
a carbon fiber shock tower they don't we
can't<00:03:53.840> withstand<00:03:54.080> a<00:03:54.500> lot<00:03:54.890> that<00:03:55.160> much<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.610> don't

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
can't withstand a lot that much I don't

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.150 
can't withstand a lot that much I don't
think<00:03:55.850> they<00:03:56.180> can<00:03:56.590> but<00:03:57.590> don't<00:03:57.800> quote<00:03:57.950> me<00:03:58.130> on

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
think they can but don't quote me on

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.860 
think they can but don't quote me on
that

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870
