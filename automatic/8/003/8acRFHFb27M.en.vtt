00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 just a pity that you look at new fields has a lot you are too 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.689
 welcome and vvd find that sir 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.309
 every Friday of 63 film eg feyenoord against this code and 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.419
 the new film from director Dennis bots who made the film the cinema last year 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:20.879
 area code that appeared in the cinema last year with the film ahead of schedule 

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:22.650
 youth film I enjoyed myself 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.210
 the foreground but that does not mean that the dead and by definition no success 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.650
 is on good Friday agreements and is about a couple with her mates 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.759
 visual impairment 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.929
 specifically searches for the success of abdominal pain uefa 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:39.679
 but the grandfather of it is in the first instance looking for was but 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.259
 I had a car accident and ended up in the hospital for that myself 

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:46.479
 no longer could carry these though and there they made it to beats today 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.479
 five years I think it's so nice to be 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.650
 in any case, she should be selling that black fender in that way 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.500
 Guilty Isabel A also called to resolve but as you know when you do something 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.260
 generates a lot of money 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.250
 draw that also people with bad intentions so the crooks in this film 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.600
 is not missing 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.690
 and I'm not going at all at first 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.630
 after the movie code and go away 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.490
 of number of koers and is a kind of myanmar and then the past with the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.020
 hostilities with isabelle de opera in the past present past 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.400
 and that causes me not really a clear need for devolder either 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.310
 am from myself 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
 why do I want that is going to be heavy again because it fascinates me 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.410
 nothing at all until sij he bos have to find this sword because then the de 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.009
 release debts from grandfather and when a game is indeed it is indeed I hope 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.330
 that you eat your sword that you also assad the debts of you 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.840
 but on the other side 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.850
 it is also not really clear how strong that band is 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.650
 syrian bell and after paul penalty pretended to be a very first piece 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.920
 history between grandfather izebel news the necessity is this is not the complete me 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.660
 do not really get hold of I hope that this is a tough find and me 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.270
 hope we search or save 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.909
 and at the same time 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.140
 also a certain credibility and I am not talking about the game of the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.030
 actors hand 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.420
 they are all really talented, but I think it is 6 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.680
 I think it's clear 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.639
 but more in the course of the story and why 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.669
 Those particular choices were made when the brandon Anderson easier and much 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:26.079
 less logical that 20 percent it is a very dangerous thing and 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.550
 sure that's annoying 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.440
 but at the same time I am definitively his help that simply has something like that again 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.910
 from him I think I am not credible at all I am of course not the 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.380
 target group but what are the reasons if you are the target group 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.549
 however, it is a very nice youth slash family film it is 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.949
 this is child friendly in every way and the action in humor 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:52.299
 romance perhaps also it is correct that it is nicely done it also very bad 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.519
 find it funny dennis bots that he made for natural organon second 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.130
 world war also history 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.859
 and now again with killing and and the study trip 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.849
 the hague most riders and that is the law eaten although the group ticks 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.439
 will say the famous points more 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.420
 but that is because we are completely spoiled 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.989
 with all holding curses with budgets of x million euros 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.510
 after business there is nothing to it so I am also less enthusiastic about code and then that 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.109
 I was afraid he was after 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.139
 I am therefore locked up for two days, I am slightly less enthusiastic 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.730
 about code and it is not the actors flip also I do not think of the 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.430
 director regularly commits himself to the scenario and the gate and actor spoke 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.499
 called robert the high and not 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:37.049
 yes not much time and money is invested in a good scenario and me 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.139
 am a bit than grab it first in the Netherlands 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.369
 I have no idea how to agree with that I am very curious about you 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.829
 opinion about the movie code and have a lot more to see if it might 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.790
 let test know in the responses 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.630
 and of course the well-known has the image I have this week 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.499
 stabbed 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.829
 then go nice to the cinema on I go out of the imf ec effect than in you
