settled<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.420> simple<00:01:43.909> version<00:01:44.909> when

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
settled on a kind of simple version when

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.090 
settled on a kind of simple version when
I<00:01:45.509> first<00:01:45.810> started<00:01:46.140> off<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:46.560> doing<00:01:46.950> all

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
I first started off I was doing all

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
I first started off I was doing all
these<00:01:47.280> highly<00:01:47.700> detailed<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.570> little

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
these highly detailed the little

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.260 
these highly detailed the little
highlights<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.430> forth<00:01:50.729> all<00:01:50.939> over<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
highlights and so forth all over the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.319 
highlights and so forth all over the
eyes<00:01:51.390> now<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> kind<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.829> stick<00:01:53.130> mainly<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.939> one

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
eyes now I kind of stick mainly with one

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.749 
eyes now I kind of stick mainly with one
good<00:01:54.689> highlight<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:56.009> right<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
good highlight like right here on the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.510 
good highlight like right here on the
side<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> pupil<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.979> get<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> kind<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.460> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
side get the pupil and get a kind of a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.749 
side get the pupil and get a kind of a
ring<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.530> darkened<00:02:01.530> ring<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:02.100> around<00:02:02.520> it's

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
ring a darkened ring going around it's

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.600 
ring a darkened ring going around it's
that<00:02:02.939> sort<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.270> lighter<00:02:03.869> area<00:02:04.469> between<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
that sort of lighter area between the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.370 
that sort of lighter area between the
pupil<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.390> outer<00:02:06.570> ring<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.110> think

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
pupil and that outer ring that I think

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.969 
pupil and that outer ring that I think
gives<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.950> spooky<00:02:09.319> intense<00:02:10.319> look<00:02:10.739> that

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
gives it that spooky intense look that

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.350 
gives it that spooky intense look that
I'm
