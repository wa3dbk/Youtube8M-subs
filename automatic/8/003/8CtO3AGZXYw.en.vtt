00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.620
 to 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.320
 friend of life and home I am in 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.910
 arequipa steels and I want to pay 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.800
 opportunity because I'm building a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.540
 second floor and for that they are doing 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.880
 columns and they have handed me these 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.220
 I feel the truth that I want to consult 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.200
 with my friend víctor alvarado supervisor 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.120
 of the self-construction line here in 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.590
 steel arequipa to see what can I 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.129
 say about it I do not know if they will be fine 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.309
 acts 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.870
 let's see what vctor says hello very 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.430
 good friend, you have to save me the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.980
 they really arrested me and they gave me 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.800
 these stirrups and the truth I do not know if 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.329
 they are well done, it hurt me a 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.250
 simple view I can tell you that these 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.130
 stirrups are not well done here I see 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.350
 that the hook is too short we can not 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.030
 notice here the hooks are not good 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.590
 placed are not in the central part 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.690
 network time that implies this is something 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.790
 something dangerous for me construction nothing 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.559
 yes the truth that if we use these 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.690
 stirrups we could have a 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.670
 construction that could not stand the 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.110
 earthquakes but for that as I said 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.080
 I have the solution to your running in 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.670
 truth but let's go let's go friends 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.500
 maicon look at this we were talking 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.050
 of corrugated steel stirrups 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.610
 Arequipa removed it really surprises me 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.170
 what is the difference between the stirrups 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.090
 that I brought you with 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.340
 corrugated stirrup born in equipment for 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.740
 for example we can see here we already have 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.479
 this stirrup in which the hooks do not 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.399
 have been placed internally as 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.750
 says the regulation here we can see that 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.270
 corrugated steel stirrups 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.820
 Arequipa has the exact length 18 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.130
 centimeters 18 centimeters is the stirrup 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.470
 and this 18 clear school and the measure of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.840
 hook has to be internal at an angle 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.119
 of 45 degrees in 10 centimeters as 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.189
 minimal that's what we can see in this 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.229
 case in this stirrup type according to which 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.909
 comes packaged is this correct 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.560
 plastic street field that protects the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.479
 stirrup missing us this package 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.310
 bricks is really to protect it 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.590
 of oxidation the idea is that a 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.840
 clean product without corruption without 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.299
 oxidation to place it in your work 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.770
 Another benefit of the product is that the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.619
 column is going to be left wall 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.380
 right and perfect what happens if it is not like that 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.330
 when you have stirrups of different 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.370
 divided not like for example those that I 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.920
 they talk and we see when the teacher 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.680
 now it's going to be the let's say the mooring of 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.480
 the alhambra with the exact wire there goes 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.069
 to suffer the teacher because he will have a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.810
 smaller end other larger 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.120
 then it will be delayed 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.400
 the abutment will go out crooked with 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.200
 This product ensures that those who 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.840
 columns and beams of the house 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.310
 come out perfect and exact matches 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.319
 perfect then that means that to me 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.090
 as owner this benefits me now 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.830
 as the owner benefits you 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.660
 just because you're going to have a column 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.819
 well done you will have the security of 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.800
 that your house has been made with a product 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.440
 without quality between the area but 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.000
 also that you're going to save money because 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.610
 here you are paying for the amount of 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.410
 iron you're carrying, you're not going to 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.180
 have wasted what sometimes remains 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.569
 a piece that is useless, you're already 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.160
 already lost zero waste zero waste 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.010
 that is one of the product benefits 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.319
 another one that you can take it like that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.840
 you need to be hiring a motorcycle 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.940
 hiring a truck to be able to load 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.260
 all the territory the work we have 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.230
 freight savings because they no longer 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.840
 we need a great a great transport 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.330
 of course we save money because we pay the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.650
 exact amount what you need and a 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.330
 very important benefit that is the

 security have the security that you have
