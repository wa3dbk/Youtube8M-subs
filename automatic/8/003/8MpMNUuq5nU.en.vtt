 everything now I start to read and I'm going to 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.299
 start doing a thousand things then equal 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.299

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:05.720
 they tell me and we'll see if we can 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:07.610
 do and how we do it goes while 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.330
 is watching the first video that is about 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.030
 of the contour to occupy is going to be a base 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.820
 of dark makeup is a breakthrough 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.580
 lighter makeup we will occupy a 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.220
 compact powder a translucent powder 2 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.740
 which is a bronze and that will serve you 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.680
 also to frame the end of the video 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.350
 so then we start 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.530
 and we're going to start by applying the base of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530
 makeup 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.920
 equal 12 or more clear of yours 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.740
 and if you want intensified or want 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.320
 buy another breakthrough you can take a little 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.520
 of your concealer of circles under pressure 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.870
 the clear battery 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.860
 then I will start 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:00.170
 first in this area 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.060
 and I'm going to direct it to the temple 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.450
 and then it came down a little 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.330
 next point of light will do 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.930
 from here I 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.560
 how far is the arequito going to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.560
 place there 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.080
 now I'm going to take a little bit of the base 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.780
 dark makeup 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.780
 and we started to frame this area 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.329
 your weight on your nose 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.250
 but they can say 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.250
 after 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.770
 on the other side 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.770
 and half of the eyes up 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.810
 then we're going to take another little bit and we're going to 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.810
 explain all this area 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.159
 and we blur 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:25.120
 ready guys and girls now what I'm going to 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.700
 use is a translucent compact powder 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.250
 If you want you can use one that has 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.240
 color I the truth is that I feel that a 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.310
 auction 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.830
 remember that this is like crazy 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.960
 From the newspaper 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.340
 and we will apply it 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.340
 eight years bow tie 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.790
 super good 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.300
 and now we will also need to apply 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.090
 a little bit of flushing, that's why it's cleaning 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.550
 if you want, you can take a 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.550
 browser that is also good option 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.330
 and we take a little 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.330
 and we start from back to front 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.830
 so that the load that stands out from the 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.830
 half of the eyebrows up 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.620
 but a little bit I 'm sorry 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.680
 and the outline and they can take advantage 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.540
 also for once to place your 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.540
 last group to put a toxic 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:44.029
 and well then that's how we ended up this 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:46.969
 video however, this is not yet 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:50.119

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:52.430

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:56.110

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.939
 using how are you more techniques 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.569

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:05.270
