00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
where they're growing up the backside of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.730 
where they're growing up the backside of
the<00:01:08.700> glass<00:01:08.970> wall<00:01:09.420> which<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.840> really<00:01:10.320> cool<00:01:10.530> look

because<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.070> cover<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.520> glass<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.119> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
because you cover up your glass and it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.170 
because you cover up your glass and it's
flowing<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.680> also<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:14.640> love<00:01:14.850> flowing

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
flowing but I also really love flowing

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.109 
flowing but I also really love flowing
corals<00:01:15.659> which<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.990> something<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.500> does

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you can kind of see now on mine where

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.219 
you can kind of see now on mine where
it's<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.060> flown<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.600> over<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> place<00:01:24.990> in

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it's just flown all over the place in

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
it's just flown all over the place in
the<00:01:25.460> in<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.900> flow<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.080> my<00:01:28.229> pumps<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.909> adds

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the in the flow for my pumps and it adds

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.450 
the in the flow for my pumps and it adds
a<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.479> nice<00:01:30.840> aesthetic<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.560> aquarium<00:01:32.340> in

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
a really nice aesthetic to aquarium in

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
a really nice aesthetic to aquarium in
my<00:01:32.549> opinion<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.420> flowing<00:01:33.930> movement

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
my opinion to have that flowing movement

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.359 
my opinion to have that flowing movement
and<00:01:35.479> it's<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:37.140> bright<00:01:37.439> vibrant<00:01:37.799> green

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and it's a really bright vibrant green

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.819 
and it's a really bright vibrant green
which<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.270> another<00:01:39.450> thing<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.750> love<00:01:39.930> about<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
which is another thing I love about it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.149 
which is another thing I love about it
so<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.579> couple<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.240> care<00:01:43.229> tips<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> guess<00:01:44.040> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
so a couple of care tips on I guess I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.389 
so a couple of care tips on I guess I
would<00:01:44.280> say<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.299> tends<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.310> well<00:01:47.310> I've

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
would say is it tends to like well I've

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.130 
would say is it tends to like well I've
noticed<00:01:47.700> anyways<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.090> mine<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.840> tends<00:01:49.049> to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
noticed anyways with mine it tends to

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.590 
noticed anyways with mine it tends to
like<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.710> bit<00:01:49.829> higher<00:01:50.009> flow<00:01:50.520> once<00:01:51.420> it's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
like a little bit higher flow once it's

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.969 
like a little bit higher flow once it's
established<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> aquarium

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
established in the aquarium

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.410 
established in the aquarium
you<00:01:53.369> know<00:01:53.490> once<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:53.790> hooked<00:01:53.909> onto<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.240> rock

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you know once it's hooked onto a rock

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.910 
you know once it's hooked onto a rock
good<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.200> likes<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.530> little<00:01:55.619> bit<00:01:55.799> more

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
good it really likes a little bit more

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.700 
good it really likes a little bit more
flow<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.630> bring<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> food<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
flow and get to bring the food to it

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.209 
flow and get to bring the food to it
it's<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.189> filter<00:01:59.460> feeder<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:01.560> also<00:02:01.740> you

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
it's a filter feeder and it also you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.600 
it's a filter feeder and it also you
know<00:02:02.250> feeds<00:02:02.610> off<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.560> light<00:02:04.829> so

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
know feeds off of the the light so

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.370 
know feeds off of the the light so
that's<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> other<00:02:06.180> thing<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.140> lower

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that's the other thing it's a lower

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.669 
that's the other thing it's a lower
light<00:02:07.770> coral<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.420> noticed<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.170> with

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
light coral but I have noticed that with

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.320 
light coral but I have noticed that with
a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:11.129> bit<00:02:11.250> higher<00:02:11.280> light<00:02:11.730> than<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.209> I'd

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
a little bit higher light than what I'd

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.850 
a little bit higher light than what I'd
normally<00:02:12.540> call<00:02:12.900> low<00:02:13.080> light

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
normally call low light

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.890 
normally call low light
it<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.580> tends<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.940> extend<00:02:15.390> really<00:02:15.690> well

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
it really tends to extend really well

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
it really tends to extend really well
right<00:02:16.770> now<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:16.980> have<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.520> under<00:02:18.140> castle<00:02:19.140> 360

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
right now I have it under castle 360

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.300 
right now I have it under castle 360
wide<00:02:20.220> lens<00:02:20.970> light<00:02:21.930> or<00:02:22.410> pendant<00:02:22.890> light<00:02:23.040> and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
wide lens light or pendant light and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.910 
wide lens light or pendant light and
I've<00:02:24.270> been<00:02:24.450> slowly<00:02:24.810> dialing<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.590> up<00:02:25.710> on<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
I've been slowly dialing it up on the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.580 
I've been slowly dialing it up on the
intensity<00:02:26.520> every<00:02:26.850> day<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> little<00:02:27.330> bit<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
intensity every day a little bit and it

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.670 
intensity every day a little bit and it
seems<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:29.010> really<00:02:29.340> like<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:31.080> higher<00:02:31.290> light

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
seems to really like the higher light

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.340 
seems to really like the higher light
now<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.430> I've<00:02:32.520> been<00:02:32.610> giving<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:34.020> it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
now that I've been giving it to it it it

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.740 
now that I've been giving it to it it it
grows<00:02:34.590> pretty<00:02:34.650> fast<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.550> some<00:02:36.480> people

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
grows pretty fast so some people

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.360 
grows pretty fast so some people
consider<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.290> little<00:02:37.440> bit<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.680> eighth<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:38.280> an

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
consider it a little bit of eighth of an

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.490 
consider it a little bit of eighth of an
invasive<00:02:38.580> species<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.270> their<00:02:39.390> tank<00:02:39.660> depending

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
invasive species in their tank depending

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000 
invasive species in their tank depending
on<00:02:40.590> what<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.420> tends<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.600> like<00:02:42.780> I've<00:02:43.740> noticed

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
on what it is tends to like I've noticed

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.590 
on what it is tends to like I've noticed
anyways<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.310> little<00:02:44.580> bit<00:02:44.670> dirtier<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.300> water

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
anyways a little bit dirtier of water

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.449 
anyways a little bit dirtier of water
like<00:02:45.930> obviously<00:02:46.350> not<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.860> know<00:02:46.950> super<00:02:47.280> dirty

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
like obviously not you know super dirty

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.310 
like obviously not you know super dirty
or<00:02:47.550> anything<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.450> likes<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.959> because

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
or anything but it likes that because

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.660 
or anything but it likes that because
it's<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> filter<00:02:49.709> feeder<00:02:49.920> like<00:02:50.190> all<00:02:50.340> filter

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
it's a filter feeder like all filter

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.670 
it's a filter feeder like all filter
feeders<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.540> tends<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.380> little

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
feeders it tends to like that a little

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.050 
feeders it tends to like that a little
bit<00:02:52.890> dirtier<00:02:53.250> water<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:56.940> it

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
bit dirtier water so it and then it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.540 
bit dirtier water so it and then it
requires<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.630> know<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.959> normal<00:02:58.770> reef

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
requires you know the normal reef

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.090 
requires you know the normal reef
additives<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.450> whatnot<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.320> you're

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
additives and whatnot that you're

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.949 
additives and whatnot that you're
putting<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.400> take<00:03:02.580> uh<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:03.180> do<00:03:03.239> pretty<00:03:03.510> big<00:03:03.750> water

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
putting to take uh I do pretty big water

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.750 
putting to take uh I do pretty big water
changes<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.530> don't<00:03:04.709> add<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> lot<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:05.459> tank

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
changes so I don't add a lot to my tank

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.170 
changes so I don't add a lot to my tank
water<00:03:06.570> why<00:03:06.870> are<00:03:07.170> additive<00:03:08.040> wise<00:03:08.250> what<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> do

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
water why are additive wise what I do

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.710 
water why are additive wise what I do
add<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:10.050> my<00:03:10.140> tank<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.650> Kent<00:03:11.550> marine<00:03:11.940> coral<00:03:12.450> vite

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
add to my tank is Kent marine coral vite

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.699 
add to my tank is Kent marine coral vite
and<00:03:13.220> that<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:14.610> add<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.300> once<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.600> week<00:03:15.630> in<00:03:16.620> a

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
and that I add it once a week in a

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.970 
and that I add it once a week in a
dosage<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.370> has<00:03:17.700> right<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.150> bottle<00:03:18.860> for<00:03:19.860> my

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
dosage it has right on the bottle for my

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.250 
dosage it has right on the bottle for my
size<00:03:20.220> tank<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.540> seems<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:22.049> keep

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
size tank and it seems to keep

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.080 
size tank and it seems to keep
everything<00:03:22.530> pretty<00:03:23.040> decently<00:03:23.459> happy<00:03:23.880> that

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
everything pretty decently happy that

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.789 
everything pretty decently happy that
paired<00:03:24.510> with<00:03:24.660> big<00:03:24.840> water<00:03:25.110> changes<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.709> know

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
paired with big water changes you know

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.060 
paired with big water changes you know
the<00:03:25.950> extra<00:03:26.220> salt<00:03:26.459> adds<00:03:26.700> back<00:03:27.299> in<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.540> lot<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
the extra salt adds back in a lot of the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.680 
the extra salt adds back in a lot of the
required<00:03:29.070> nutrients<00:03:29.760> for<00:03:29.940> these<00:03:30.060> corals<00:03:30.480> so

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
required nutrients for these corals so

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.560 
required nutrients for these corals so
it<00:03:30.810> seems<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.200> be<00:03:31.290> doing<00:03:31.440> really<00:03:31.590> well<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:31.980> on

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
it seems to be doing really well just on

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.240 
it seems to be doing really well just on
decent<00:03:33.570> light<00:03:34.910> good<00:03:35.910> flow<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:37.530> few

decent light good flow and the few
additives<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:38.760> give<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.000> in<00:03:39.090> big<00:03:39.209> water

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390

already grown quite a bit it's kind of

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.520 
already grown quite a bit it's kind of

the other rocks just what I wanted it to
do<00:03:54.590> it's<00:03:55.590> really<00:03:55.769> cool<00:03:56.070> when<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.310> encrusts<00:03:56.580> you

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
do it's really cool when it encrusts you

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.630 
do it's really cool when it encrusts you
know<00:03:56.940> into<00:03:57.330> a<00:03:57.360> whole<00:03:57.630> reef<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.350> rock<00:03:58.590> area<00:03:58.950> a

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
know into a whole reef and rock area a

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.520 
know into a whole reef and rock area a
lot<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.180> people<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.570> know<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:01.170> do<00:04:01.290> have<00:04:01.320> to

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
lot of people you know you do have to

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.350 
lot of people you know you do have to
wash<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.190> because<00:04:02.280> once<00:04:02.640> again<00:04:02.760> cross<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.239> the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
wash it because once again cross on the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.699 
wash it because once again cross on the
rock<00:04:03.570> it's<00:04:03.780> not<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.080> easiest<00:04:04.350> thing<00:04:04.500> in<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
rock it's not the easiest thing in the

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.640 
rock it's not the easiest thing in the
world<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.100> get<00:04:05.250> off<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:06.750> can<00:04:06.959> be<00:04:07.110> done<00:04:07.290> but<00:04:07.500> it's

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
world to get off it can be done but it's

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.229 
world to get off it can be done but it's
just<00:04:07.890> because<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.370> an<00:04:08.519> interesting<00:04:08.820> one

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
just because it is an interesting one

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.850 
just because it is an interesting one
it's<00:04:09.480> just<00:04:09.720> not<00:04:09.900> super<00:04:10.140> easy<00:04:10.260> to<00:04:10.530> get<00:04:10.650> out<00:04:10.680> of

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
it's just not super easy to get out of

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.580 
it's just not super easy to get out of
reef<00:04:11.010> Rock<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:11.640> my<00:04:12.510> suggestion<00:04:12.930> would<00:04:13.170> be<00:04:13.230> if

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
reef Rock so my suggestion would be if

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.800 
reef Rock so my suggestion would be if
you<00:04:14.250> want<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.610> cover<00:04:14.790> an<00:04:14.910> entire<00:04:14.940> area<00:04:15.480> like<00:04:15.660> I

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
you want to cover an entire area like I

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.789

have set up here

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.400 
have set up here
awesome<00:04:17.220> it'll<00:04:17.549> do<00:04:17.700> that<00:04:17.880> over<00:04:18.150> time<00:04:18.180> but<00:04:19.169> if

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
awesome it'll do that over time but if

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.870 
awesome it'll do that over time but if
you<00:04:19.530> don't<00:04:19.769> want<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.100> encroach<00:04:20.370> onto<00:04:20.640> its

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
neighbors or other corals set it off in

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.460 
neighbors or other corals set it off in
the<00:04:23.669> sand<00:04:23.970> by<00:04:24.450> itself<00:04:24.780> on<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> rock<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.289> you
