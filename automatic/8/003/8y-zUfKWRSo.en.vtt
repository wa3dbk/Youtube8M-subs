a<00:00:00.290> thing<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.319> know<00:00:01.650> before<00:00:01.860> you<00:00:02.190> play<00:00:02.460> your

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
a thing to know before you play your

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.880 
a thing to know before you play your
medal<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.480> I'm<00:00:04.250> pretty<00:00:05.250> sure<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:06.890> only

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
medal is I'm pretty sure that only

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.890 
medal is I'm pretty sure that only
metals<00:00:08.370> above<00:00:08.670> copper<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.360> reactivity

alligator clips or wires the first thing
you<00:00:36.030> need<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> do<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.750> fill<00:00:37.230> your<00:00:37.500> container

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
you need to do is fill your container

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:53.040 
you need to do is fill your container
with<00:00:38.040> veneer

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.590 

now<00:00:54.150> make<00:00:55.150> sure<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.840> have<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.970> positive

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
now make sure that you have the positive

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.530 
now make sure that you have the positive
lead<00:00:59.020> of<00:00:59.680> your<00:01:00.460> power<00:01:00.670> source<00:01:00.910> going<00:01:01.240> to<00:01:01.450> the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
lead of your power source going to the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.570 
lead of your power source going to the
piece<00:01:01.720> of<00:01:01.870> copper<00:01:02.290> and<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.650> negative<00:01:03.100> lead<00:01:03.280> of

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
piece of copper and the negative lead of

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.310 
piece of copper and the negative lead of
your<00:01:03.730> power<00:01:03.940> source<00:01:04.150> going<00:01:04.420> to<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.750> metal<00:01:05.290> you

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
your power source going to the metal you

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.610 
your power source going to the metal you
want<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.710> play<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.960> put<00:01:11.229> them<00:01:11.380> in<00:01:11.530> your

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
want to play now put them in your

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.270 
want to play now put them in your
vinegar<00:01:13.290> make<00:01:14.290> sure<00:01:14.440> they're<00:01:14.620> separated<00:01:15.190> and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
vinegar make sure they're separated and

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:33.350 
vinegar make sure they're separated and
not<00:01:15.460> touching

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.200 

so<00:01:34.360> I'm<00:01:34.450> going<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.660> plug<00:01:34.870> it<00:01:35.050> in<00:01:35.140> now<00:01:36.210> plugging

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
so I'm going to plug it in now plugging

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.050 
so I'm going to plug it in now plugging
it<00:01:37.480> in<00:01:40.830> sorry<00:01:41.830> about<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.550> lights<00:01:42.760> turned

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
it in sorry about that the lights turned

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.630 
it in sorry about that the lights turned
off<00:01:44.730> turning<00:01:45.730> them<00:01:45.850> back<00:01:45.880> on<00:01:47.070> now<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.130> can<00:01:48.400> see

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
off turning them back on now you can see

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.290 
off turning them back on now you can see
on<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.060> metal<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.540> plating<00:01:50.050> bubbles<00:01:50.650> are

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
on the metal and plating bubbles are

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.460 
on the metal and plating bubbles are
being<00:01:52.300> produced<00:01:52.540> those<00:01:52.870> are<00:01:53.050> bubbles<00:01:53.350> of

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
being produced those are bubbles of

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.610 
being produced those are bubbles of
hydrogen<00:01:53.650> it's<00:01:54.160> flammable<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:54.880> be<00:01:55.030> careful

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
hydrogen it's flammable so be careful

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.290 
hydrogen it's flammable so be careful
what's<00:01:56.620> happening<00:01:57.040> at<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.280> copper<00:01:57.700> electrode

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
what's happening at the copper electrode

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.550 
what's happening at the copper electrode
is<00:01:58.600> that<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.520> copper<00:02:00.970> atoms<00:02:01.150> are<00:02:01.780> being

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
is that the copper atoms are being

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.100 
is that the copper atoms are being
oxidized<00:02:03.280> form<00:02:03.640> copper<00:02:04.060> ions<00:02:04.420> which<00:02:04.720> dissolve

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
oxidized form copper ions which dissolve

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.780 
oxidized form copper ions which dissolve
in<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.290> vinegar<00:02:05.740> solution<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.370> form<00:02:06.580> copper

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
in the vinegar solution to form copper

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.710 
in the vinegar solution to form copper
acetate<00:02:08.820> then<00:02:09.820> those<00:02:10.090> gain<00:02:10.390> electrons<00:02:10.960> at<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
acetate then those gain electrons at the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.710 
acetate then those gain electrons at the
negative<00:02:13.800> electrode<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.360> deposit<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
negative electrode and deposit on the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:25.580 
negative electrode and deposit on the
quarter

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.100 

the<00:02:26.160> solution<00:02:26.700> starts<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:27.209> turn<00:02:27.360> blue<00:02:27.690> due<00:02:28.080> to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
the solution starts to turn blue due to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:41.140 
the solution starts to turn blue due to
copper<00:02:28.680> acetate<00:02:28.830> forming

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.330 

so<00:02:41.810> I'm<00:02:42.440> done<00:02:43.750> plating<00:02:44.750> my<00:02:45.110> quarter<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.220> I

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
so I'm done plating my quarter and I

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.680 
so I'm done plating my quarter and I
don't<00:02:46.400> know<00:02:46.580> if<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:46.760> can<00:02:46.879> see<00:02:47.150> what<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
don't know if you can see what the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.199 
don't know if you can see what the
solution<00:02:48.049> has<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> blue<00:02:49.040> color<00:02:49.340> just<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:50.000> very

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
solution has a blue color just a very

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.729 
solution has a blue color just a very
slight<00:02:50.480> blue<00:02:50.720> color<00:02:53.019> due<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.049> copper<00:02:54.500> acetate

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.589 

so<00:02:57.739> there's<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.220> quarter<00:02:58.700> after<00:02:58.970> plating

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
so there's the quarter after plating

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.030 
so there's the quarter after plating
it's<00:03:00.170> not<00:03:00.290> my<00:03:00.470> best<00:03:00.680> I've<00:03:02.140> plated<00:03:03.140> quarters

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
it's not my best I've plated quarters

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.750 
it's not my best I've plated quarters
better<00:03:05.920> there's<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.040> quarter<00:03:07.400> that's<00:03:07.549> not

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
better there's a quarter that's not

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.550 
better there's a quarter that's not
plated<00:03:08.180> compared<00:03:08.629> to<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.870> quarter<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.409> is

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
plated compared to the quarter that is

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:55.220 
plated compared to the quarter that is
played<00:03:09.829> on<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.190> left<00:03:15.730> there<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.760> other<00:03:17.090> sides

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.280 

you

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
you

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.590 
you
thanks<00:03:58.290> for<00:03:58.470> watching
