egg<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.680> through<00:02:22.950> finding<00:02:23.310> keys<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.940> each<00:02:24.510> key

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
egg is through finding keys and each key

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.270 
egg is through finding keys and each key
leads<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.290> different<00:02:25.560> gates<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:25.980> once<00:02:26.160> they

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
leads to a different gates so once they

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.620 
leads to a different gates so once they
found<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.550> first<00:02:26.730> key<00:02:26.940> they<00:02:27.120> can<00:02:27.300> find<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
found the first key they can find the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.140 
found the first key they can find the
first<00:02:27.870> gate<00:02:28.080> do<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.920> first<00:02:29.130> quest<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.670> then

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
first gate do the first quest and then

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.760 
first gate do the first quest and then
they<00:02:30.270> get<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.510> clue<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.050> second<00:02:31.380> key<00:02:31.530> and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
they get the clue to the second key and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.740 
they get the clue to the second key and
so<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.310> there<00:02:32.489> are<00:02:32.610> three<00:02:32.790> gates<00:02:33.030> three<00:02:33.569> keys

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
so on there are three gates three keys

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.600 
so on there are three gates three keys
and<00:02:34.020> they<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.590> find<00:02:34.800> them<00:02:34.920> or<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.430> be<00:02:35.520> able

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
and they have to find them or to be able

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.370 
and they have to find them or to be able
to<00:02:35.819> get<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> last<00:02:36.330> gate<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.810> then<00:02:37.050> find

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
to get to the last gate and then find

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.630 
to get to the last gate and then find
the<00:02:37.470> Easter<00:02:37.590> egg<00:02:37.830> now<00:02:37.950> obviously<00:02:38.280> as<00:02:38.370> most

that a lot of people didn't like the

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.300 
that a lot of people didn't like the
references<00:05:43.230> which<00:05:43.680> is<00:05:43.890> completely

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
references which is completely

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.680 
references which is completely
understandable<00:05:44.370> because<00:05:45.030> if<00:05:45.390> you<00:05:45.510> look

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
understandable because if you look

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.060 
understandable because if you look
younger<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.140> you<00:05:46.380> didn't<00:05:46.680> live<00:05:46.800> through<00:05:46.920> the

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
younger and you didn't live through the

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.430 
younger and you didn't live through the
80s<00:05:47.370> then<00:05:47.910> it<00:05:48.450> probably<00:05:48.720> wouldn't<00:05:49.110> make<00:05:49.260> much

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
80s then it probably wouldn't make much

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.960 
80s then it probably wouldn't make much
sense<00:05:49.500> to<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:50.010> whereas<00:05:50.430> I<00:05:50.550> got<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:50.820> majority

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
of the references so it was okay for me

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.190
