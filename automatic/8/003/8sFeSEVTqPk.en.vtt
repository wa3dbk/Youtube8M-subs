 procedure and the ingredients are 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.610
 the need to develop cola 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.309
 ingredients are the following two 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.610
 190 gram Philadelphia cheese bars 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.100
 each a cup of fresh milk one 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.860
 can of condensed milk the milkmaid three 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.600
 tablespoons of grenetina half cup of

 water butter to spread marmalade 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.040
 blackberry and the utensils that 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.710
 we will occupy are a mold with capacity 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.690
 liter and a half and blender good as 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.720
 we will start to make this jelly 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.420
 good as a first step we will put together 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.210
 butter in the mold 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.960
 this will be done to avoid that at the time 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.470
 of unmolding the gelatin stick 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.580
 good after a cable the butter 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.340
 we will put for a few seconds to 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.360
 refrigerator to prevent said 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.420
 gelatin stick 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.980
 well let's go to the world step and we'll try 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.700
 three tablespoons of grenetine 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.909
 in the half cup of water 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.840
 since they are incorporated we started 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.730
 see perfectly until they disappear 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.000
 others 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.240
 once incorporated we let rest by 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.200
 a few minutes 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.100
 as a third step we will incorporate all 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:11.520
 the ingredients in the blender we put 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.520
 the three philadelphia feed bars 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.810
 we add the cup of fresh milk 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.810
 condensed milk 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.430
 add the 3 tablespoons of grenetina 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:49.680
 once incorporated all the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:52.790
 ingredients we put in the blender and 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.790
 we started to liquefy 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.390
 since all the 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.640
 ingredients below 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.640
 we will remove the mold from the refrigerator 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.270
 which is already perfectly cold 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.270
 and we passed all the ingredients 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.110
 good since we emptied all the 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.110
 already liquefied ingredients 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.670
 we'll see it to the refrigerator 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.049
 for about 10 minutes 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.879
 good so we will leave 10 minutes 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.879
 that set and then unmold 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.530
 well once the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.969
 10 minutes we proceed to unmold the 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.969
 gelatin in a tray 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.250
 ah 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.250
 we put them upside down 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.480
 We center the mold with the gelatin and 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.480
 we flipped 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.530
 i 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.259
 to 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.750
 once disassembled 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:04.300
 we will approach with a little jam of 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.300
 salt flavor of blackberry jam 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:18.400
 this is to give it an exquisite touch 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.400
 to this gelatin 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.820
 we extend everything perfectly 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.280
 good friends this is how our 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.890
 gelatin I hope it was your 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.310
 Thank you very much until next time 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.310
 Thank you
