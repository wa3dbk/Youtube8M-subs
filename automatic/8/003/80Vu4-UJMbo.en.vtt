00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.700

inch<00:02:01.350> curling<00:02:01.829> iron<00:02:02.100> um<00:02:02.689> yeah<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:04.049> i<00:02:04.079> also<00:02:04.200> got

them because they both have sparkles on
them<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.990> huge<00:02:09.379> reason<00:02:10.379> why

your hair all over your hair 20 minutes

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.640 
your hair all over your hair 20 minutes
before<00:05:46.000> you<00:05:46.270> shower<00:05:46.510> I<00:05:46.900> let<00:05:47.139> it<00:05:47.229> sit<00:05:47.349> my<00:05:47.470> hair

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
before you shower I let it sit my hair

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.500 
before you shower I let it sit my hair
for<00:05:47.770> 20<00:05:47.979> minutes<00:05:48.250> and<00:05:48.430> then<00:05:48.880> I<00:05:48.909> watched<00:05:49.210> it<00:05:49.389> out

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
for 20 minutes and then I watched it out

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.149 
for 20 minutes and then I watched it out
and<00:05:49.780> shampoo<00:05:50.139> and<00:05:50.260> conditioner<00:05:50.650> like<00:05:50.800> normal

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
and shampoo and conditioner like normal

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.909 
and shampoo and conditioner like normal
but<00:05:51.729> it<00:05:52.000> makes<00:05:52.210> sure<00:05:52.389> your<00:05:52.570> hair<00:05:53.139> feels<00:05:53.470> so

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
but it makes sure your hair feels so

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.159 
but it makes sure your hair feels so
soft<00:05:54.400> so<00:05:54.760> I'm<00:05:55.150> loving<00:05:55.599> this<00:05:55.720> and<00:05:55.990> I'm<00:05:56.050> probably

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
soft so I'm loving this and I'm probably

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.390 
soft so I'm loving this and I'm probably
just<00:05:56.380> going<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.680> keep<00:05:56.770> repurchasing<00:05:57.070> this

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
just going to keep repurchasing this

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.670 
just going to keep repurchasing this
because<00:05:58.330> once<00:05:58.599> I<00:05:58.690> find<00:05:58.900> a<00:05:58.990> hair<00:05:59.139> mask<00:05:59.320> that<00:05:59.650> I

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:16.480 
the fact it gives I think it's great i

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.150 
the fact it gives I think it's great i
think<00:07:16.870> it's<00:07:16.960> great<00:07:17.110> alone<00:07:17.410> I<00:07:17.710> wouldn't<00:07:17.980> need

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 
think it's great alone I wouldn't need

another<00:07:18.460> dry<00:07:19.300> shampoo<00:07:19.780> I<00:07:19.990> would<00:07:20.140> just<00:07:20.170> use

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440 
another dry shampoo I would just use

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.430 
another dry shampoo I would just use
this<00:07:20.940> but<00:07:21.940> I<00:07:21.970> think<00:07:22.030> it's<00:07:22.360> also<00:07:22.540> a<00:07:22.840> little<00:07:23.350> bit

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
this but I think it's also a little bit

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.530 
this but I think it's also a little bit
more<00:07:23.680> pricey<00:07:23.920> obviously<00:07:24.790> than<00:07:25.090> just<00:07:25.390> using

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:25.540 
more pricey obviously than just using

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.200 
more pricey obviously than just using
baby<00:07:25.840> powder<00:07:26.110> so<00:07:26.710> the<00:07:27.490> price<00:07:27.730> will<00:07:27.940> be<00:07:28.030> down

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
baby powder so the price will be down

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:44.950 
for getting your hair to be healthy

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.520 
for getting your hair to be healthy
stronger<00:07:45.520> and<00:07:45.730> then<00:07:45.880> finally<00:07:46.450> growing<00:07:47.200> longer

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:47.530 
stronger and then finally growing longer

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.920 
stronger and then finally growing longer
because<00:07:47.980> if<00:07:48.280> your<00:07:48.760> hair<00:07:48.970> is<00:07:49.000> not<00:07:49.300> healthy<00:07:49.570> it's
