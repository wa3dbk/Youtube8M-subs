00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello you love many of you know 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.319
 The pony just does not want to sit there 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.389
 the hair keeps falling into it 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.190
 face or you will just everyone 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.349
 have hair out of your face 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.660
 I have 34 son for you 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:22.050
 prepared and we start with 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.750
 friso number one yes yes you take it first 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.460
 a part of the hair he is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.310
 like to weave and share it 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.759
 three strands and found only once 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.590
 normal to weave and then you take 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.920
 to the back and front always something to it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.730
 So bad french so if you are 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.360
 you are then get out of her face so 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.059
 about there 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.860
 you take the first strand and 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.360
 she puts you either away or in the 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.460
 mouth inside and always gives the easiest 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.949
 take a new strand from the hair 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.469
 from behind something to the last scene 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.829
 In addition, she kneels in the back 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.960
 mouth 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.640
 new strand from behind something to and 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.850
 again in the mouth takes a new one 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.450
 StrÃ¤hne puts her in the middle of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.210
 something in the back and the foremost one 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.400
 again, before new leaves in the strand 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.140
 middle to the rear something to it 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.159
 take and the front again in the courage 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.610
 Actually, that's easy 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.670
 little exercise new front strand to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.299
 to take something back there 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.530
 in the mouth take so again new 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.310
 put front strand in the middle and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.900
 then you just flee to the end 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.380
 quite normal without french without 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.420
 something further and put that then 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.810
 behind your hair on the back 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.780
 somewhere that you can not see it 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.850
 best with hairpins twice and us 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.140
 already there is such a beautiful 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.640
 Waterfall effect on the side of the head 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.820
 one of my favorite hairstyles actually 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.230
 because I think she just has something 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:12.080
 So best in the team two horns and 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:15.680
 cross the so well the whole should then 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.180
 look like that just has something 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.290
 looks a bit special 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.880
 it just tells a little more work 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.280
 Just turned off as the pony 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.660
 stuck or the hair 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:33.890
 and yes I hope he understood for 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:37.460
 so number two you have to first 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.110
 your hair from ear to ear about 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.870
 Take as I do now 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.810
 about once so completely over 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.550
 head over to the other side 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.010
 from the ear then a bit 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.220
 strange but that will be one 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.170
 Real very very nice hairstyle and at the 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.000
 page where he wants to start 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.050
 You can braid a bit 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.450
 take more hair off the ear because of the 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.250
 zob otherwise there is much thinner 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.490
 You can go to the rest of your hair 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.959
 in the back to form a braid 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.900
 then they are in the way and you catch me 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.970
 easy on with a strand in three 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.260
 surfaces but not upwards but 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:21.230
 down so you are weaving first 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.820
 quite normal but the outer ones are 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.310
 do not come in the middle pure but 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.690
 long down and then you start too 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.489
 still to make french 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.320
 It came in the beginning a bit 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.959
 confusing for hands but be 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.489
 actually it's easy , just take it easy 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.220
 only to the outer always aspire something 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.739
 Do it and do it down to the middle 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.680
 so always under the middle strand 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.950
 long in the middle a little bit down to it 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.989
 in the middle what was down and in 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.840
 the middle that then also results 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.170
 other result of the braid is like that 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.880
 a little bit more out 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.090
 and that really works in the end 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.319
 like a real hair band 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.370
 That's why I think the hairstyle is real 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.709
 very very nice 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.900
 just as bad as french 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.840
 only that they are not the outer strands 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.610
 drauflegt over the middle strand 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:18.880
 long but below that calls itself then 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.680
 Dutch otto yes and if you then am 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.240
 its end where he arrived back your 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.720
 Hair is too short or where it stops 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:33.220
 want to quit then you just take 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:40.540
 everything and so it is about the height of 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:41.950
 ear tight and then on the side where we 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.979
 It has begun to weave now 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.580
 probably a bit narrower and thinner 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.169
 his 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.460
 You can just give it that one again 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.680
 bit apart that's one thing 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:56.620
 a little more volume gets that 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.000
 looking about evenly like that 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.690
 also make a bit of a picture and then 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.260
 can you open the back years and that 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.960
 everything still a little bit 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.919
 and then comes the out, I hope we 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.919
 you have understood everything 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.440
 hairstyle number three 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.750
 So for this hairstyle you take first 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.510
 a strand of the crest divides this into 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.210
 two strands and turns them around each other 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.010
 best back next to both 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.220
 stand something and turn them again 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.590
 took something back to both and 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.220
 actually turn it all the time 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.550
 to take on both what is and turn to 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.950
 take a turn 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.860
 this is a slightly trickier variant 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.720
 to turn it easy and pin it 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.389
 a bit tricky a bit 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.490
 special and that's why I like it 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.360
 that very well 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.220
 he pushes that a bit 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.540
 forward then it gets more volume 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.270
 and then you can do that with any one 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.620
 clasp the clasp you like and 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.970
 so that's it 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.400
 easiest of these three 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.560
 but I think that has somehow 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.580
 very cool effect and i hope you 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.340
 have also understood this hairstyle too 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.840
 I succumb very much to the video 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.550
 fell through and write to me 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.530
 just in the comments 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.840
 which of the three hairstyles now on 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.250
 most beautiful finds and I'm still one 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.250
 Have a nice day soon
