00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
 It bothered me enough to agree 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.590
 with me there is a television program 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:15.450
 Danish who says or rather that shows 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.070
 naked women and friends are 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:26.460
 feel in an armchair to evaluate the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:28.650
 bodies of we are on the street it 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.029
 It shows how sexist it can get 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.980
 be the television we think of some 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.369
 moment that we had seen everything but 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.369
 to 4 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.930
 but well I want to invite you to see 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.059
 the controversy in denmark television 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.280
 public has premiered during the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.110
 maximum audience which for many is 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.920
 already the most sexist program of the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.050
 history 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.480
 two men sit in front of a 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.079
 naked woman and they are dedicated to commenting their 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.730
 body 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.770
 she listens to everything but without power 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.970
 replicate the program has received 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.700
 hundreds of complaints 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.620
 if you remove the dressing gown and prepare for 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.660
 listen to what these two men say 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.780
 of your body comment on the size of your 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.160
 chest his tattoos 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.390
 and they even ask him to turn around 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.190
 to be able to see her butt well 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.900
 worked the program to which many 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.420
 they call the most sexist in the history of 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.160
 the television the director is the musician 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.630
 what you have liked to do after or 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.730
 after going through a program of 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.530
 talents only that now instead of 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.960
 public brings a friend every day 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.090
 different to comment the play the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.950
 criticisms have not delayed accuse him of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.750
 reify and humiliate women a 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.430
 Once there is a movement that asks 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.100
 withdraw the program that issues the 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.840
 public television in prime time of 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.610
 moment Blackman has gone to his 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.100
 new york house to run away from a 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.810
 controversy he does not understand he is considered 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.240
 a genius says that his program is 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.310
 revolutionary and that women finally 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.360
 they will know what they really think 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.360
 the men of their bodies 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.759
 make a statement 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.399
 because it says in some mentions that 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.269
 they make this kind of a law I know how 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.269
 your vagina works 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.420
 they are happy you can tell 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.420
 when he started he's happy he 's sad 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.250
 I know that there are people who like 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.830
 biologists see through the air 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.830
 there are people who are healthy people 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.490
 but look beyond more 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.480
 as the character as with the irony and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.310
 the sarcasm and I get very bad but I 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.960
 it seems that a serious mistake is made here 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.170
 because really the women who are 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.220
 there they are very attractive they are being 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.600
 used of object women I do not 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.160
 I understand how it is possible that the 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.100
 television in addition to such a country 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.300
 advanced as denmark wear these 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.880
 women and put them there as a 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.140
 true livestock exposure but of 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.880
 true they all become true 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.530
 pieces of meat in which they are put 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.340
 in front of two guys besides not 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.340
 they have no appeal 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:29.439
 I entered a rich mine 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.540
 yes 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.430
 but fruit of what is the body of a 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.590
 woman but also tries to see and read the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.590
 nipple and respect of course 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.810
 ah 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.870
 if you want, they take off your robe and Pablo goes to 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.520
 proceed to forgive you I think it's going to 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.860
 First of all, tell you before this one 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.380
 highlight the dressing gown is to tell you that you have 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.489
 it looks a lot like me to my sister and for 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:23.199
 so not all that money 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.199
 then you can bring it to light 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.690
 now I want to see your arrival 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:34.030
 arelis to the good one to see what we are 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.030
 watching watching of course 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:44.220
 basically a young attractive woman is 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.630
 note that it is very well we are working 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.169
 but but it does not produce me absolutely 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.190
 nothing 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:53.610
 I could not analyze their breasts their 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.610
 moms 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.750
 I could not analyze 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.700
 [Music] 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:07.470
 d 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.120
 so if we have a claim from 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.460
 national television council for this 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.730
 distance so let's get up to 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.730
 here not
