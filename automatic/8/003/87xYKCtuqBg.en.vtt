 one 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.930
 windows 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.689
 Roland Garros 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.659
 forty days and with purpose 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.960
 a stop in the day to consider that God's plan for your life 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.119
 let's meditate together his will 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.609
 let's stop to continue with more force 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.400
 God wants to reorient our lives, let's pay attention 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.640
 day 14 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.920
 when god looks digital 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 says the bible in Isaiah chapter 8 verse 17 the lord has hidden his 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.550
 face of the people 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.610
 but I will wait on him 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.670
 Because in the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 I have hopes 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.030
 God is real 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.640
 no matter 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.900
 as a thesis 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.920
 When things go well in our lives it is easy to worship God 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.369
 when he has provided food friends 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.369
 family health 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.240
 but circumstances are not always so desired 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.140
 how we worship god then 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.110
 what we do when God seems to be millions of miles away 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.680
 the deepest degree of relationship is to praise God despite 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.750
 thank god during a test 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.660
 trust him during temptation 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.550
 accept the suffering diamar world 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.140
 although it seems ready 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.130
 the test of the western half and the separation and decide when we are 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.530
 separated by a physical distance 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.720
 or see you 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.480
 unable to speak 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.960
 in the case of our friendship with God 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.190
 not always 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.190
 we feel close to him 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.220
 yancey points out in any service there are moments of intimacy 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.539
 and moments of distancing 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.409
 and in the relationship with God 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.700
 no matter how intimate the pendulum is, it will also move from one side 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:18.739
 then yes 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.069
 the worship gets difficult 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.299
 to mature our friendship 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.079
 God will put her to the test with periods of apparent separation 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.889
 moments in which we will feel that he abandoned us some forgetting 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.799
 God seems to be millions of miles away 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:41.759
 Saint John of the Cross referred to those days of spiritual drought 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.690
 doubt and the distancing of God 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.749
 like the dark night 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.199
 of the soul 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.689
 jen united kingdom 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:51.979
 he called him 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:55.369
 the ministry of absence 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.549
 coughing called them the night ministry 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.889
 others called them the winter of the heart 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.289
 apart from jesus 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.759
 David was the one who possibly had more friendship with God 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:14.539
 the Lord had behind me to call him a man according to my heart without 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:15.799
 embargo 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.390
 David often complained 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.189
 of the apparent absence of god 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.099
 my god because you stay so far away 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.559
 because you hide from me when I need you the most 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.049
 OMG 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.339
 my god, why have you abandoned me? 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.109
 far are you to save me 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.050
 far 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.410
 of my words of lamented because 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.559
 he has rejected me 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.559
 of course god had not really left to well 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.279
 Nor will it leave you 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.519
 has promised several times I will never leave you 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:53.739
 I will not abandon you 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.889
 but God 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.269
 he does not promise you, you will always feel my presence 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.010
 indeed god recognizes that sometimes he hides his face from us 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.950
 Sometimes it's like it's one of her 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.909
 hunt disappeared in action 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.009
 In our life 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:13.709
 florol marcolongo 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.930
 describes it in the following way you wake up one morning and all your 

00:04:17.929 --> 00:04:20.929
 spiritual feelings have disappeared 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.479
 but nothing happens 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.259
 reprimands salt devil but nothing changes 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.960
 perform these spiritual exercises 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.910
 you ask your friends to pray for you all the sins you can confess 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.919
 imagine 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.499
 and to ask for forgiveness 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.409
 to all your acquaintances 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:40.509
 well some 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.559
 but nothing happens 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.559
 you begin to wonder 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:49.029
 how long will this spiritual twilight last for weeks 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.639
 months 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.169
 it will end some day 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.300
 you feel your prayers bouncing off the roof 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.629
 on the verge of despair rytas 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.360
 Kim in peace 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.759
 the truth is that 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.919
 nothing is wrong 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.479
 it is a normal part of the test and the maturing of our friendship with God 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.939
 all Christians go through that situation at least once and so 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.189
 general several times 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:18.509
 it is painful 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.509
 and puzzling but it is absolutely vital 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.460
 for the development of the fair 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.810
 jopo did not lose hope when he did not feel God's presence in his life 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.509
 because I had that certainty 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.629
 He said he was convinced of his innocence 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.629
 because if I'm heading east, it's not there 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.680
 If I went west, I can not find it 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.939
 if it's busy in the north I do not see it 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:47.650
 if it turns south 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.529
 he did not get to perceive 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.259
 instead he knows my ways 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.439
 if I put myself to the test 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.699
 I would leave 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.789
 like gold 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.449
 when god seems distant 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.900
 I could feel that he is angry combo hold this discipline I walk by some 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.460
 sin 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.770
 It is true 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.119
 the sin if 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.119
 can dissociate us from intimate friendship with God 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.909
 we sadden the spirit of God 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.909
 and we extinguish our communion with disobedience 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.779
 the conflict with others 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:26.340
 the multiple occupations the friendship with the world 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.159
 and other sins 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.839
 but this feeling of abandonment and estrangement from God 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:35.569
 it has nothing to do with sin is a test of faith 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.089
 one that all 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:40.339
 we must face 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:41.919
 you will continue loving 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:45.419
 trusting obeying and worshiping God 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.199
 even if you do not feel his presence 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.049
 nor have evident and visible proof of his work in your life 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.039
 at present the most common error of Christians regarding the 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:58.279
 duration 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:01.279
 is that they look for more loved experiences 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.090
 They look for a bike feeling they find 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.460
 they conclude that they have shaken hands 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.749
 what a mistake 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:11.080
 actually 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.599
 God soler withdraw our feelings so that we do not depend on them 

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:20.179
 worship is not the search for a feeling even 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:23.789
 if it is one of intimacy with Christ 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:27.699
 when you were a Christian in diapers 

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:33.559
 gave you several emotions like that answered your prayers and mature and self-centered 

00:07:33.559 --> 00:07:37.739
 to confirm its existence but as we grow in faith 

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:40.789
 it gradually moves us 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:43.509
 of those dependencies 

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:45.520
 with my presence of God 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.029
 and the manifestation of his presence are two different things 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.460
 1 is a fact 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.659
 the other 

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:53.329
 is a feeling
