presentational ideas for the clock trick

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.660 
presentational ideas for the clock trick
on<00:00:06.960> how<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.200> can<00:00:07.379> make<00:00:07.529> it<00:00:07.649> even<00:00:07.859> more<00:00:08.220> amazing

on how you can make it even more amazing
so<00:00:09.179> let's<00:00:09.389> do<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.870> quick<00:00:10.080> review<00:00:10.320> mr.<00:00:11.160> hand<00:00:11.400> when

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
so let's do a quick review mr. hand when

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.700 
so let's do a quick review mr. hand when
he<00:00:11.700> did<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> trick<00:00:12.210> took<00:00:12.389> off<00:00:12.570> five<00:00:12.929> cards<00:00:13.469> and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
he did the trick took off five cards and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.919 
he did the trick took off five cards and
he<00:00:14.549> stuck<00:00:14.849> those<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.240> his<00:00:15.360> pocket

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
he stuck those in his pocket

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.880 
he stuck those in his pocket
then<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.529> dealt<00:00:16.890> twelve<00:00:17.250> cards<00:00:21.560> to<00:00:22.560> make<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
then I dealt twelve cards to make the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.650 
then I dealt twelve cards to make the
clock<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.699> put<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> rest<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> cards

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
clock and I put the rest of the cards

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.890 
clock and I put the rest of the cards
aside<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.160> had<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> prediction<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.420> was

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
aside now I had a prediction that was

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.679 
aside now I had a prediction that was
written<00:00:28.170> down<00:00:28.880> but<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:29.970> you'd<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.539> can

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
written down but if you'd like you can

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.780 
written down but if you'd like you can
use<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> card<00:00:32.070> from<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> little<00:00:32.610> deck

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
use a like a card from a little deck

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.720 
use a like a card from a little deck
these<00:00:33.630> are<00:00:33.780> kind<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.050> fun<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.410> use<00:00:34.730> that's

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
these are kind of fun to use that's

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.540 
these are kind of fun to use that's
going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.030> be<00:00:36.120> our<00:00:36.210> prediction<00:00:36.719> card<00:00:36.930> okay<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
going to be our prediction card okay the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.299 
going to be our prediction card okay the
little<00:00:38.940> four<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.270> diamonds<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:40.620> then<00:00:41.070> we

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
little four of diamonds and then we

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.979 
little four of diamonds and then we
we're<00:00:41.640> gonna<00:00:41.760> make<00:00:42.000> our<00:00:42.180> clock<00:00:42.450> there's<00:00:42.719> one

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
we're gonna make our clock there's one

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.850 
we're gonna make our clock there's one
two<00:00:43.440> three<00:00:44.030> four<00:00:45.200> five<00:00:46.200> six<00:00:47.100> seven<00:00:47.969> eight<00:00:48.860> nine

two three four five six seven eight nine
ten<00:00:50.700> eleven<00:00:51.660> twelve<00:00:52.670> now<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
ten eleven twelve now we know that the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.850 
ten eleven twelve now we know that the
four<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.539> diamonds<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> card

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
four of diamonds is going to be the card

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.810 
four of diamonds is going to be the card
selected<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:57.270> thing<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> did<00:00:58.020> was<00:00:58.260> I

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
selected and one thing that I did was I

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.279 
selected and one thing that I did was I
changed<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.719> using<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.109> red

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
changed it because I was using a red

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.439 
changed it because I was using a red
deck<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> end<00:01:02.190> when<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> go<00:01:02.670> okay<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
deck so at the end when I go okay the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
deck so at the end when I go okay the
selected<00:01:03.960> card<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.379> four<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> diamonds

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
selected card was the four of diamonds

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.370 
selected card was the four of diamonds
here's<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> prediction<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.270> was<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.020> sure<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
here's the prediction I was so sure that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
here's the prediction I was so sure that
I<00:01:07.770> took<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.430> deck<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> different

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
I took it out of a deck with a different

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.230 
I took it out of a deck with a different
colored<00:01:09.659> back<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.490> reason<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.880> works

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
colored back and the reason that works

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330 
colored back and the reason that works
is<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:12.960> we're<00:01:13.320> handling<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.860> cards<00:01:14.159> here

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
is when we we're handling the cards here

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.920 
is when we we're handling the cards here
were<00:01:14.460> handling<00:01:14.909> them<00:01:15.030> all<00:01:15.180> face-up<00:01:15.509> they

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
were handling them all face-up they

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.760 
were handling them all face-up they
never<00:01:16.140> see<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> backs<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> cards<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.770> what

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
never see the backs of the cards so what

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.600 
never see the backs of the cards so what
I<00:01:19.799> did<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:21.590> when<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.650> put<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> four<00:01:23.580> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
I did was when I put the four of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.030 
I did was when I put the four of
diamonds<00:01:24.229> thirteenth<00:01:25.229> from<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> bottom<00:01:25.950> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
diamonds thirteenth from the bottom of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.910 
diamonds thirteenth from the bottom of
the<00:01:26.130> deck<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.610> two<00:01:26.880> three<00:01:27.150> four<00:01:27.560> five<00:01:28.560> six

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
the deck one two three four five six

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.130 
the deck one two three four five six
seven<00:01:29.310> eight<00:01:29.460> nine<00:01:29.700> ten<00:01:30.060> eleven<00:01:30.390> twelve<00:01:30.479> when

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve when

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.719 
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve when
I<00:01:31.170> put<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> four<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.829> diamonds<00:01:32.009> thirteenth

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I put the four of diamonds thirteenth

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.300 
I put the four of diamonds thirteenth
from<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> bottom<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> deck<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.829> put<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
from the bottom of the deck I just put a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.179 
from the bottom of the deck I just put a
black<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:37.439> could<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.770> blue<00:01:38.070> or

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
black one or you could use blue or

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.679 
black one or you could use blue or
whatever<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.759> put<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> different<00:01:39.390> colored

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
whatever but I put a different colored

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
whatever but I put a different colored
one<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.140> instead<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> red<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
one in instead of the red one and the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.120 
one in instead of the red one and the
trick<00:01:42.630> works<00:01:42.840> exactly<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.619> same<00:01:43.829> way<00:01:44.009> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
trick works exactly the same way and

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.700 
trick works exactly the same way and
that<00:01:44.280> gives<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> little<00:01:44.970> extra

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
that gives you like a little extra

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.230 
that gives you like a little extra
presentational<00:01:46.710> point<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.880> end<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.180> you

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
presentational point on the end but you

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.510 
presentational point on the end but you
can<00:01:48.479> use<00:01:48.689> different<00:01:49.470> colored<00:01:49.950> cards<00:01:50.310> for

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
can use different colored cards for

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.969 
can use different colored cards for
predictions<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> prediction

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
predictions you can have the prediction
