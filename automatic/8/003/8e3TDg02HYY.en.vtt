00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
sides seem to be Japan and the Soviet

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.880 
sides seem to be Japan and the Soviet
Union<00:00:51.149> now<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.660> only<00:00:52.020> time<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.410> has<00:00:52.800> ever

full-blown war which would link to World
War<00:03:06.410> two<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:07.129> the<00:03:07.250> other<00:03:07.340> one<00:03:07.579> you<00:03:07.970> see<00:03:08.209> a

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
War two and in the other one you see a

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.880 
War two and in the other one you see a
nuclear<00:03:08.930> symbol<00:03:09.319> what<00:03:09.500> looks<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.739> be<00:03:09.799> some

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
nuclear symbol what looks to be some

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.530 
nuclear symbol what looks to be some
kind<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.340> factory<00:03:10.640> or<00:03:11.060> something<00:03:11.090> like<00:03:11.480> that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
kind of factory or something like that

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.110 
kind of factory or something like that
maybe<00:03:12.319> that<00:03:12.500> links<00:03:12.829> in<00:03:12.980> with<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.370> Hashima

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
maybe that links in with the Hashima

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.280 
maybe that links in with the Hashima
bomb<00:03:14.299> because<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.660> was<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.900> course<00:03:15.049> a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
bomb because that was of course a

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.770 
bomb because that was of course a
nuclear<00:03:15.650> weapon<00:03:16.190> used<00:03:16.760> by<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:17.030> Americans<00:03:17.569> in

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
nuclear weapon used by the Americans in

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.289 
nuclear weapon used by the Americans in
Japan<00:03:18.319> and<00:03:18.590> yeah<00:03:19.160> if<00:03:19.549> that<00:03:19.850> is<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.090> case<00:03:20.120> then

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
Japan and yeah if that is the case then

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.390 
Japan and yeah if that is the case then
it's<00:03:21.200> all<00:03:21.319> getting<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.530> bit<00:03:21.560> real<00:03:21.859> in<00:03:22.040> it's<00:03:22.310> all

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
it's all getting a bit real in it's all

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.860

getting<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.639> bit<00:03:22.670> real<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.720> all<00:03:23.840> that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870
