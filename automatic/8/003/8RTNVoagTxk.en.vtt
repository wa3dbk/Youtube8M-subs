simple process for this project we also

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
simple process for this project we also
used<00:01:52.650> a<00:01:52.860> welding<00:01:53.250> technique<00:01:53.640> called<00:01:53.790> plug

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180

spot<00:01:57.119> weld<00:01:58.369> yes<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.610> could<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.880> done<00:02:00.030> this

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
spot weld yes we could have done this

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.889 
spot weld yes we could have done this
project<00:02:00.660> with<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> spot<00:02:01.140> welder<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.860> had<00:02:02.040> one

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
project with a spot welder we had one

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.170 
project with a spot welder we had one
but<00:02:03.899> two<00:02:04.470> in<00:02:04.590> order<00:02:04.800> for<00:02:05.070> us<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.160> reach<00:02:05.640> into

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
but two in order for us to reach into

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.529 
but two in order for us to reach into
our<00:02:06.750> project<00:02:07.320> we<00:02:07.380> would<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.800> needed

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
our project we would have needed

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.990 
our project we would have needed
incredibly<00:02:09.539> long<00:02:09.840> tongs<00:02:10.350> on<00:02:10.800> our<00:02:10.950> spot<00:02:11.550> welder

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
incredibly long tongs on our spot welder

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.490 
incredibly long tongs on our spot welder
so<00:02:12.690> by<00:02:13.260> drilling<00:02:13.650> holes<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.520> welding<00:02:14.970> spot<00:02:15.500> we

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so by drilling holes and welding spot we

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.780 
so by drilling holes and welding spot we
simulate<00:02:17.160> being<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.850> same<00:02:18.120> process<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:20.040> also

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
simulate being the same process the also

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.690 
simulate being the same process the also
while<00:02:21.030> welding<00:02:21.330> will<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:22.530> moved<00:02:22.890> around<00:02:23.310> from

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
while welding will we moved around from

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.990 
while welding will we moved around from
one<00:02:24.030> side<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.930> other<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.650> front<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.790> back

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
one side to the other and front to back

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.309 
one side to the other and front to back
this<00:02:27.840> helps<00:02:28.260> distribute<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:29.160> heat<00:02:29.370> evenly

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
this helps distribute the heat evenly

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.260 
this helps distribute the heat evenly
