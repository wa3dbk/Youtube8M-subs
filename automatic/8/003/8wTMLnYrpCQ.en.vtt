 today we are going to be just 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.019
 talking about something we had 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.340
 active out there last week I'm 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.859
 talking about what was the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.929
 community challege called the explosion 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.430
 sonic i think that most of you 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.170
 obviously he even found out 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.579
 they participated but for those people 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.829
 maybe they were a little 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.149
 disconnected from xbox live for what or if 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.340
 maybe they could not play much at 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.660
 plants or go that simple simply 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.670
 they were losing some 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.829
 videos on the channel lately 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.899
 I comment very quickly what is this all about? 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.550
 So, guys, as it was already good 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.100
 known we had in the challenges 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.020
 weekly for this whole month of January and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.590
 the last one that has just finished 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.170
 was to stun many to many 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.059
 characters or those we could most 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.210
 comes out with what was the character of the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.630
 engineers was to use 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.689
 completely 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.520
 what was the sonic bomb or what 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.229
 which were the mines these are placed 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.299
 on the ground and that also to your order to 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.369
 the characters go so that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.439
 as a community we would achieve a great 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.500
 amount of these and guys has already 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.240
 finished then said challenge inclusive 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.890
 is already in the game menu what is 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.750
 a new transition a new 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.939
 notice in which obviously therefore 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.729
 they tell us that it has already finished and 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.350
 what are the results ojito here 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.810
 it says the result of explosion 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.970
 sonic this community 'stuns is 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.250
 I congratulate you for stunning a little 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.619
 more than 10 million players and 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.780
 unlock an envelope of ultra stickers 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.390
 weird go to the tub of stickers and 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.459
 gets his deserved prize guys there 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.920
 you will remember that the challenge was 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.929
 divided into two parts leaves only has 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.970
 completed or only the 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.220
 first of the two goals ale 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.990
 unfortunately so that's why nothing 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.209
 more have given us what is an envelope 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.429
 ultra weird if we had come to the 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:08.310
 second amount would have given us two 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.720
 of these two same things so in this 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.549
 small video guys I'm going to open what 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.080
 it's the envelope and also I'm not going to 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.390
 buy a few hits 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.920
 I have not bought stickers for a long time 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.840
 done, you have not uploaded any 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.550
 video of opening stickers or anything 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.560
 that so maybe in this video do 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.450
 a few of them but come 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.490

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.770
 ultra rare envelope let's see what it is 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.740

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.660
 here of diamond patch is a patch or 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.060
 is to have someone tell me something 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.700
 thing is called patch so I'm 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.700
 thinking the purse cartoon 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.400
 what am I thinking you know is net not what 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.080
 I can believe is seriously someone if 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.530
 someone has it, do not see it tell me now 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.420
 the patch and is that if it looks like the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.490
 little things that used such a caricature 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.140
 but well let's go there let us 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.850
 comments I would love to know that 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.940
 Javier is just thinking about that 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.920
 patch thing and it's seriously the clown 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.400
 put diamond 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.430
 good is a beard with 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.370
 and so on until the diamond pins that 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.140
 it looks super pro and guys that's basically 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.750
 it was what they gave us for the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.519
 challenge and well I'm going to buy myself some 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.239
 law in shock of the lawn or good to see 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.159
 let's see the purchase today 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.629
 I know they are bosc down is that I do not want 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.159
 buy from these because those are no longer 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.590
 they are going to give nothing and they are going to give me pure 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.420
 consumable because I think I already have 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.280
 if not all are already a large part of 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.140
 all the characters and that so just 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.549
 I will be buying from these two that 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.680
 are the ones that so far because I 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.540
 agree a little bit more because they're going to 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.609
 give things that I do not have see here yet 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.180
 I get many things for example the 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:00.849
 real light glasses wow we have here 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.739
 gold periscope depth or is 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.170
 like a submarine now in your head 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.200
 Golden rain boot is also father 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.120
 says here silver heart glasses 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.889
 I do not know the silver ones we do not like 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.799
 because they only look gray does not convince me 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:16.930
 a lot says here silver glam-rock see 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.269
 as gray it even looks more like 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.949
 white I do not know what the hell but good 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.870

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.930

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.669

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.650
 well fine or else that or crazy pictures see 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.080
 no good is an appearance for the boost 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.530
 it looks quite strange really very 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.580
 static but already in this see this flow 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.940
 of lava on rocks wow this looks 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.610
 incredible that go what is that without 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.040
 disarm game left the yen trailer 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.650
 on the lawn never in everything and I believed 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.600
 that was the weapon then go predetermined 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.180
 and obviously that's not the way it was a skin and 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.580
 well here it is watered down that great in 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.760
 this truly merits an upcoming game 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.070

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.810
