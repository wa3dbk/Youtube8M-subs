make good decisions about that and so

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.030 
make good decisions about that and so

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
the burns are all important for

plant communities and all the animals

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.810 
plant communities and all the animals
that<00:00:59.480> they<00:00:59.600> support<00:01:00.190> stating<00:01:01.190> why<00:01:01.310> we<00:01:01.490> burn<00:01:01.670> is

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
that they support stating why we burn is

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.840 
that they support stating why we burn is
important<00:01:02.240> because<00:01:02.360> that<00:01:02.510> allows<00:01:02.870> us<00:01:02.900> to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
important because that allows us to

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.220 
important because that allows us to
monitor<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.059> results<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.660> burn<00:01:05.810> and

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
monitor the results of the burn and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.080 
monitor the results of the burn and
decide<00:01:06.830> whether<00:01:07.040> or<00:01:07.160> not<00:01:07.250> it<00:01:07.400> did<00:01:07.520> what<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:08.030> was

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
decide whether or not it did what it was

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.330 
decide whether or not it did what it was
supposed<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.870> sometimes<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:09.980> may<00:01:10.130> lead

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
supposed to and sometimes that may lead

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.640 
supposed to and sometimes that may lead
to<00:01:10.370> us<00:01:10.730> modifying<00:01:11.660> a<00:01:11.810> prescription<00:01:12.320> so<00:01:12.500> that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
to us modifying a prescription so that

here that hasn't been burned in three
years<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.620> can<00:01:48.770> tell<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.100> it's<00:01:49.220> a

a few minutes ago the difference is this

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.340 
a few minutes ago the difference is this
one<00:02:31.520> had<00:02:32.090> gone<00:02:32.270> three<00:02:32.600> years<00:02:32.870> without<00:02:33.110> burning

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
one had gone three years without burning

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.960 
one had gone three years without burning
before<00:02:33.890> he<00:02:33.980> burned<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.700> other<00:02:34.820> one

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
before he burned it and the other one

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.220 
before he burned it and the other one
had<00:02:35.090> only<00:02:35.240> gone<00:02:35.420> one<00:02:35.660> year<00:02:35.840> with<00:02:35.960> that<00:02:36.050> burning

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
had only gone one year with that burning

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.020 
had only gone one year with that burning
so<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.070> can<00:02:37.220> see<00:02:37.370> some<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.730> difference

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
so you can see some of the difference

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.580

time is longer meaning that fire was

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.580 
time is longer meaning that fire was

Prout's that would get killed by fire

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.690 
Prout's that would get killed by fire
every<00:03:24.290> time<00:03:24.320> we<00:03:24.620> burn<00:03:24.830> but<00:03:25.160> without<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.489> fire

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
every time we burn but without the fire

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.430 
every time we burn but without the fire
they're<00:03:26.030> allowed<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.540> grow<00:03:26.780> up<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.110> get<00:03:27.200> big

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
they're allowed to grow up and get big

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.350 
they're allowed to grow up and get big

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
and one of the main differences you see

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.080 
and one of the main differences you see
is<00:03:29.750> we<00:03:30.020> don't<00:03:30.230> have<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:31.010> species<00:03:31.700> richness

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
is we don't have that species richness

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.199 
is we don't have that species richness
of<00:03:33.070> herbaceous<00:03:34.070> plants<00:03:34.489> on<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.670> ground<00:03:34.940> it's

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
of herbaceous plants on the ground it's

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.400 
of herbaceous plants on the ground it's
pretty<00:03:35.390> much<00:03:35.570> just<00:03:35.630> leaf<00:03:35.959> litter<00:03:36.200> on<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
pretty much just leaf litter on the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.190 
pretty much just leaf litter on the
ground<00:03:36.500> in<00:03:36.920> just<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:37.820> few<00:03:38.000> plants<00:03:38.270> so<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.080> can

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
ground in just a few plants so you can

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.229 
ground in just a few plants so you can
see<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.680> shading<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.310> these<00:03:40.760> hardwoods

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
see that the shading of these hardwoods

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.270 
see that the shading of these hardwoods
being<00:03:41.540> released<00:03:41.870> from<00:03:41.989> fire<00:03:42.290> causes<00:03:43.160> all

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
being released from fire causes all

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.890 
being released from fire causes all
those<00:03:43.459> other<00:03:43.610> species<00:03:43.910> of<00:03:44.090> plants<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.690> pretty

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
those other species of plants to pretty

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.350 
those other species of plants to pretty
much<00:03:45.050> disappear<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:46.640> more<00:03:46.820> often<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.180> burn

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
much disappear the more often you burn

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.910 
much disappear the more often you burn
the<00:03:47.600> less<00:03:47.780> smoke<00:03:48.019> is<00:03:48.170> produced<00:03:48.530> by<00:03:48.739> each

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
the less smoke is produced by each

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.310 
the less smoke is produced by each
individual<00:03:49.459> burn<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:50.870> can<00:03:51.050> think<00:03:51.230> of

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
individual burn so you can think of

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.630 
individual burn so you can think of
prescribed<00:03:51.680> burning<00:03:51.709> as<00:03:52.160> kind<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.489> an

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
prescribed burning as kind of an

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.120 
prescribed burning as kind of an
insurance<00:03:53.330> policy<00:03:53.780> where<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.260> pay<00:03:54.860> a<00:03:54.890> little

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
insurance policy where you pay a little

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.100 
insurance policy where you pay a little
bit<00:03:55.250> over<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.850> long<00:03:56.030> term<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.360> avoid<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:56.840> big

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
bit over the long term to avoid a big

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.720 
bit over the long term to avoid a big
catastrophe<00:03:57.290> though<00:03:58.280> there<00:03:58.430> might<00:03:58.550> be<00:03:58.610> a

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
catastrophe though there might be a

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.490 
catastrophe though there might be a
little<00:03:58.940> bit<00:03:59.030> of<00:03:59.120> smoke<00:03:59.360> with<00:03:59.510> each<00:03:59.630> burn<00:03:59.930> and

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
little bit of smoke with each burn and

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.960 
little bit of smoke with each burn and
we<00:04:00.620> might<00:04:00.769> have<00:04:00.920> that<00:04:01.070> smoke<00:04:01.280> pretty<00:04:01.519> often<00:04:01.700> if

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
we might have that smoke pretty often if

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.820 
we might have that smoke pretty often if
we<00:04:02.030> burn<00:04:02.269> every<00:04:02.510> two<00:04:02.660> or<00:04:02.810> three<00:04:02.959> years<00:04:03.290> but

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
we burn every two or three years but

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.710 
we burn every two or three years but
that's<00:04:03.950> a<00:04:04.100> lot<00:04:04.250> better<00:04:04.459> than<00:04:04.550> than<00:04:05.360> trying<00:04:05.630> to

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
that's a lot better than than trying to

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.180 
that's a lot better than than trying to
put<00:04:05.900> out<00:04:06.019> fires<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.620> then<00:04:06.709> having<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:07.040> big

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
put out fires and then having a big

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.699 
put out fires and then having a big
wildfire<00:04:07.730> where<00:04:07.970> you<00:04:08.090> just<00:04:08.300> smoke<00:04:09.290> in<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.560> whole

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
wildfire where you just smoke in a whole

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.020 
wildfire where you just smoke in a whole
city<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.250> have<00:04:10.370> people<00:04:10.550> going<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:10.910> the

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
city and have people going to the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.449 
city and have people going to the
hospital<00:04:11.480> because<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.810> asthma<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.800> other<00:04:13.190> air
