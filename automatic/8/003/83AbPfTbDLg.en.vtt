00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
fast it turns on and I guess well that's

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.440 
fast it turns on and I guess well that's
turning<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.009> have<00:00:14.190> just<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.700> couple<00:00:14.730> seconds

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
turning on I have just a couple seconds

turning on I have just a couple seconds
to<00:00:15.750> show<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:15.960> how<00:00:16.109> many<00:00:16.289> how<00:00:16.560> many<00:00:16.619> porches

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
to show you how many how many porches

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.070 
to show you how many how many porches
there<00:00:17.310> aren't<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.510> haven't<00:00:18.720> seen<00:00:19.020> that

another pictures or anything but there's
look<00:00:23.519> for<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.300> ski<00:00:24.869> car<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.350> right<00:00:25.590> in

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
look for a ski car to have right in

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.160 
look for a ski car to have right in
there<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:26.609> there's<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.960> some<00:00:27.960> kind<00:00:28.080> of

old-fashioned card you could put inside

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.200 
old-fashioned card you could put inside
here<00:00:31.130> or<00:00:32.130> maybe<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.610> could<00:00:32.700> be<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> new<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.059> I

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
here or maybe it could be a new one I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
whole lot of ports for audio i use that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.510 
whole lot of ports for audio i use that
one<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.440> my<00:00:46.620> 5.1<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:48.000> i<00:00:48.390> never<00:00:48.960> use<00:00:49.140> those

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.420 
fast not turned on but as you can see
how<00:01:36.869> fast<00:01:37.110> will<00:01:37.259> turn<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.560> FB<00:01:37.829> password

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:54.600 

oh<00:01:51.900> okay<00:01:52.900> it's<00:01:53.080> on<00:01:53.410> right<00:01:53.680> now<00:01:53.740> step<00:01:54.220> pretty

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
oh okay it's on right now step pretty

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.170 
oh okay it's on right now step pretty
good<00:01:54.760> I<00:01:55.890> see<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.190> already<00:01:57.400> start<00:01:58.390> doing<00:01:58.690> stuff

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
good I see you already start doing stuff

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.750 
good I see you already start doing stuff
so<00:02:01.180> right<00:02:01.479> when<00:02:01.600> these<00:02:01.890> two<00:02:02.890> gadgets<00:02:03.100> turn<00:02:03.550> on

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
so right when these two gadgets turn on

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.350 
so right when these two gadgets turn on
then<00:02:04.000> it's<00:02:04.150> pretty<00:02:04.450> much<00:02:04.540> done<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.670> start<00:02:07.240> up

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
then it's pretty much done and start up

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.770 
then it's pretty much done and start up
I<00:02:07.600> only<00:02:07.810> have<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:09.690> which<00:02:10.690> is<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.850> just

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
I only have that which is just the just

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.330 
I only have that which is just the just
because<00:02:14.080> I'm<00:02:14.170> plugging<00:02:14.380> things<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.739> USB<00:02:14.980> and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
because I'm plugging things in USB and

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.280 
because I'm plugging things in USB and
then<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.970> antivirus<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.780> everything<00:02:17.140> else

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
then a the antivirus and everything else

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.430 
then a the antivirus and everything else
that's<00:02:17.470> just<00:02:17.860> part<00:02:18.070> of<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.220> laptop<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.320> has

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
that's just part of the laptop so it has

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.260 
that's just part of the laptop so it has
minimal<00:02:20.920> things<00:02:21.160> on<00:02:21.370> start<00:02:21.730> up<00:02:21.760> automatically

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
minimal things on start up automatically

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.020 
minimal things on start up automatically
it's<00:02:22.709> also<00:02:23.709> why<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.280> turns<00:02:24.489> on<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:24.820> fast

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
it's also why it turns on so fast

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.720 
it's also why it turns on so fast
besides<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.690> has<00:02:26.040> really<00:02:27.040> good<00:02:27.280> hardware

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
besides it has really good hardware

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.830 
besides it has really good hardware

boost<00:03:04.360> using<00:03:04.780> cpu-z<00:03:06.120> look<00:03:07.120> at<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.360> core<00:03:07.750> speed

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
boost using cpu-z look at the core speed

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.630 
boost using cpu-z look at the core speed
and<00:03:09.160> after<00:03:09.910> i<00:03:09.940> push<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:11.799> eco<00:03:12.070> button<00:03:14.459> now<00:03:15.459> look

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
and after i push the eco button now look

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.949 
and after i push the eco button now look
at<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.820> core<00:03:16.000> speed<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:19.150> why<00:03:19.330> not<00:03:19.540> that

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
at the core speed and that why not that

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.640 
at the core speed and that why not that
one<00:03:20.080> just<00:03:20.430> boosts<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.549> brightness<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.209> sound

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
one just boosts the brightness and sound

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.100 
one just boosts the brightness and sound
then<00:03:23.650> turn<00:03:23.980> on<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.370> off<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.640> webcam<00:03:25.090> same<00:03:25.930> for

the same if you give it 6 gigabytes

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.390 
the same if you give it 6 gigabytes
it'll<00:04:05.860> be<00:04:05.980> as<00:04:06.300> 6.7<00:04:07.300> but<00:04:07.990> out<00:04:08.500> of<00:04:08.650> stock<00:04:09.040> it's<00:04:09.310> a
