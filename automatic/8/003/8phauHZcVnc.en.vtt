level<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.660> he<00:01:04.439> he's<00:01:04.890> thinking<00:01:05.159> about<00:01:05.189> taking

level and he he's thinking about taking

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.219

a<00:01:05.580> prohormone<00:01:06.000> stack<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.780> he's<00:01:06.900> waiting<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
a prohormone stack but he's waiting to

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.990 
a prohormone stack but he's waiting to
see<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> say<00:01:08.490> about<00:01:08.610> that

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.890 

there's<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.090> couple<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.420> things<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.750> guys

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
there's a couple of things you guys

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.719 
there's a couple of things you guys
should<00:01:13.140> know<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.560> poor<00:01:13.920> home<00:01:14.159> Proform

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
should know about poor home Proform

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
should know about poor home Proform
lines<00:01:15.000> before<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.420> take<00:01:15.600> them<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:15.990> any

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
lines before you take them or any

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.130 
lines before you take them or any
anabolic<00:01:17.130> compound<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.509> first<00:01:18.750> thing<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
anabolic compound and the first thing is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.039 
anabolic compound and the first thing is
this<00:01:19.320> Pro<00:01:20.250> hormones<00:01:20.670> are<00:01:21.030> pretty<00:01:21.840> much

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this Pro hormones are pretty much

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.289 
this Pro hormones are pretty much
steroids<00:01:24.049> they<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:26.130> chemical<00:01:26.610> structure

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
steroids they have a chemical structure

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.100 
steroids they have a chemical structure
that<00:01:30.079> makes<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.619> precursor<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:33.150> hormones

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that makes them a precursor to hormones

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.280 
that makes them a precursor to hormones
which<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.220> steroids<00:01:36.229> so<00:01:37.790> what<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.840> need<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
which are steroids so what you need to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.920 
which are steroids so what you need to
think<00:01:40.680> about<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.360> chemical

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
think about here is that that chemical

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.889 
think about here is that that chemical
structure<00:01:43.460> actually<00:01:44.460> needs<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.790> survive<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
structure actually needs to survive a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.960 
structure actually needs to survive a
couple<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.560> passes<00:01:46.920> through<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> liver<00:01:47.490> in

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
couple of passes through the liver in

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.969 
couple of passes through the liver in
order<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> actually<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.899> an<00:01:49.259> effect<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
order to actually have an effect on you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.789 
order to actually have an effect on you
now<00:01:50.820> what<00:01:51.000> does<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.119> mean<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:51.799> first

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
now what does that mean well first

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.420 
now what does that mean well first
things<00:01:53.040> first

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
things first

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.280 
things first
one<00:01:54.259> pro<00:01:55.259> hormones<00:01:55.850> are<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.630> cause<00:01:57.840> just

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
one pro hormones are going to cause just

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.149 
one pro hormones are going to cause just
as<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:59.009> not<00:01:59.520> more<00:02:00.180> damage<00:02:00.689> than<00:02:01.530> most

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
as much if not more damage than most

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.200 
as much if not more damage than most
oral<00:02:02.969> steroids<00:02:03.630> right<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:05.040> they're<00:02:05.790> passing

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
oral steroids right so they're passing

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.029 
oral steroids right so they're passing
through<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> liver<00:02:06.630> your<00:02:07.560> liver<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.860> being

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
through the liver your liver is being

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.650 
through the liver your liver is being
forced<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.340> overwork<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:11.610> can't<00:02:11.879> use

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
forced to overwork and you can't use

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.460 
forced to overwork and you can't use
them<00:02:12.870> for

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
them for

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
steroids so if I were going to consider

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.020 
steroids so if I were going to consider
between<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.470> two<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.890> mean<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.820> legal

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
between the two I mean the legal

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.250 
between the two I mean the legal
difference<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.600> nothing<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.230> one<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:24.140> just<00:03:25.140> as

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
difference is nothing and one is just as

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.590 
difference is nothing and one is just as
bad<00:03:25.410> if<00:03:25.620> not<00:03:25.650> more<00:03:26.070> bad<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.850> me<00:03:27.000> than<00:03:27.360> the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
bad if not more bad for me than the

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.479 
bad if not more bad for me than the
other<00:03:28.190> particularly<00:03:29.190> if<00:03:29.250> you're<00:03:29.370> talking

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
other particularly if you're talking

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.430 
other particularly if you're talking
about<00:03:29.580> injectable<00:03:30.239> steroids<00:03:30.630> which<00:03:30.870> aren't

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
about injectable steroids which aren't

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.560 
about injectable steroids which aren't
necessarily<00:03:31.980> as<00:03:32.190> harsh<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.700> lip<00:03:32.910> now<00:03:33.450> I'm

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
necessarily as harsh on the lip now I'm

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.810 
necessarily as harsh on the lip now I'm
not<00:03:33.690> advocating<00:03:33.840> steroids<00:03:34.709> but<00:03:34.920> I'm<00:03:35.070> saying

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
not advocating steroids but I'm saying

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.270 
not advocating steroids but I'm saying
that<00:03:35.940> pro<00:03:36.269> hormones<00:03:36.450> can<00:03:37.320> have<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:38.010> as<00:03:38.130> much

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
that pro hormones can have just as much

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.449 
that pro hormones can have just as much
damage<00:03:38.850> on<00:03:39.090> your<00:03:39.330> body<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:40.860> just<00:03:41.100> as<00:03:41.220> harsh

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
damage on your body and be just as harsh

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.460 
damage on your body and be just as harsh
on<00:03:41.700> your<00:03:41.820> internal<00:03:42.090> organs<00:03:42.269> as<00:03:42.690> actual

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
on your internal organs as actual

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.880 
on your internal organs as actual
steroids<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.100> there<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.400> no<00:03:44.660> better<00:03:45.660> thing

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
steroids so there is no better thing

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.250 
steroids so there is no better thing
about<00:03:46.890> Pro<00:03:47.730> home<00:03:47.880> some<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.299> them<00:03:48.510> will

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
about Pro home some of them will

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.750 
about Pro home some of them will
actually<00:03:49.290> work<00:03:49.860> just<00:03:50.100> as<00:03:50.250> well<00:03:50.280> if<00:03:50.549> not<00:03:50.700> better

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
actually work just as well if not better

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.390 
actually work just as well if not better
than<00:03:51.060> oral<00:03:51.690> steroids<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:52.320> that's<00:03:52.530> one<00:03:53.190> thing

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
than oral steroids so that's one thing

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.360 
than oral steroids so that's one thing
to<00:03:53.670> think<00:03:54.120> about<00:03:54.239> but<00:03:55.019> again<00:03:55.350> they<00:03:55.950> are<00:03:55.980> going

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
to think about but again they are going

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.620 
to think about but again they are going
to<00:03:56.610> have<00:03:57.000> implications<00:03:57.269> for<00:03:57.660> your<00:03:57.840> health<00:03:58.610> 3

don't really need to think about
spending<00:04:16.799> your<00:04:16.919> money<00:04:17.070> on<00:04:17.310> anabolic

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
spending your money on anabolic

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.250 
spending your money on anabolic
compounds<00:04:18.239> right<00:04:18.390> now<00:04:19.790> you<00:04:21.049> have<00:04:22.049> made

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
compounds right now you have made

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.640 
compounds right now you have made
significant<00:04:22.800> gains<00:04:22.830> without<00:04:23.340> steroids<00:04:23.700> and

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
significant gains without steroids and

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.430 
significant gains without steroids and
without<00:04:25.650> pearl<00:04:25.830> hormones

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
without pearl hormones

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.580 
without pearl hormones
so<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:27.370> would<00:04:28.300> just<00:04:28.330> focus<00:04:28.630> on<00:04:28.930> eating<00:04:29.410> whole

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
so I would just focus on eating whole

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.050 
so I would just focus on eating whole
food<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.040> lifting<00:04:30.400> weights<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:30.910> doing

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
food and lifting weights and doing

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.390 
food and lifting weights and doing
compound<00:04:31.540> movements<00:04:31.930> for<00:04:32.050> now<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.440> then<00:04:33.010> down

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
compound movements for now and then down

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.220 
compound movements for now and then down
the<00:04:33.490> line<00:04:33.670> when<00:04:33.880> you're<00:04:33.970> 25<00:04:34.390> 26

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
the line when you're 25 26

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.000 
the line when you're 25 26
even<00:04:35.500> 30<00:04:35.710> 31<00:04:36.310> if<00:04:37.150> you<00:04:37.300> want<00:04:37.480> to<00:04:37.540> think<00:04:37.720> about

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
even 30 31 if you want to think about

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.260 
even 30 31 if you want to think about
testosterone<00:04:39.010> replacement<00:04:39.100> therapy<00:04:39.520> or<00:04:40.000> you

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
testosterone replacement therapy or you

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.380 
testosterone replacement therapy or you
know<00:04:41.310> other<00:04:42.310> antibiotics<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.150> things<00:04:43.300> like

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
know other antibiotics and things like

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.000 
know other antibiotics and things like
that<00:04:43.570> then<00:04:44.140> that's<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.500> time<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.680> think<00:04:44.890> about

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
that then that's the time to think about

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.070 
that then that's the time to think about
it<00:04:45.160> not<00:04:45.610> when<00:04:45.820> you're<00:04:45.940> 19<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.300> you're<00:04:46.600> just

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
it not when you're 19 and you're just

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.250 
it not when you're 19 and you're just
beginning<00:04:47.500> your<00:04:47.530> life<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.100> stuff<00:04:48.670> like<00:04:48.820> that

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
beginning your life and stuff like that

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.180 
beginning your life and stuff like that
so<00:04:50.260> that's<00:04:50.590> my<00:04:51.010> take<00:04:51.220> on<00:04:51.370> everything<00:04:51.640> I<00:04:53.190> think

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
so that's my take on everything I think

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.670 
so that's my take on everything I think
that<00:04:54.370> uh<00:04:54.400> like<00:04:55.240> I<00:04:55.330> said<00:04:55.390> there's<00:04:56.140> positives

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
that uh like I said there's positives

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.350 
that uh like I said there's positives
and<00:04:56.800> negatives<00:04:57.190> to<00:04:57.280> taking<00:04:57.670> any<00:04:57.850> animala

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
and negatives to taking any animala

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.380 
and negatives to taking any animala
compound<00:04:58.810> but<00:04:59.640> to<00:05:00.640> think<00:05:00.850> that<00:05:00.970> pro<00:05:01.240> hormones

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
compound but to think that pro hormones

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.510 
compound but to think that pro hormones
are<00:05:01.810> any<00:05:02.020> better<00:05:02.350> for<00:05:02.620> you<00:05:02.830> than<00:05:03.040> steroids

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
are any better for you than steroids

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.640 
are any better for you than steroids
order<00:05:03.910> that<00:05:04.810> you're<00:05:04.990> not<00:05:05.140> going<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.590> get<00:05:07.650> any

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
order that you're not going to get any

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.700 
order that you're not going to get any
of<00:05:08.800> the<00:05:08.890> legal<00:05:09.130> implications<00:05:09.780> is<00:05:10.780> a<00:05:11.230> falsehood

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
of the legal implications is a falsehood

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:20.490 
of the legal implications is a falsehood
so<00:05:12.390> definitely<00:05:13.390> consider<00:05:13.510> that<00:05:19.230> so<00:05:20.230> if<00:05:20.410> you

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
so definitely consider that so if you

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.780 
so definitely consider that so if you
have<00:05:20.590> any<00:05:20.740> more<00:05:20.830> questions<00:05:21.190> for<00:05:21.310> me<00:05:21.370> hit<00:05:21.610> me<00:05:21.700> up
