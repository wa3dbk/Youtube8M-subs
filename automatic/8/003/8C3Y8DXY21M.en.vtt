00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 what's up fitness friends i show 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.590
 you know what I have here right 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.920
 fat fat fitness doner himself 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.250
 made really good nutrition right 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.380
 healthy and how you can prepare it 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.380
 that you see her in this video 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.930
 that needs ever as a basis in 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.120
 flat bread I have half here 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.920
 plan red that's 250 came that will be 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.480
 basis for the doner and her 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.260
 It must be very careful in the middle 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.910
 cut open 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.690
 I have already made the mistake 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.300
 that I messed up the other piece 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.100
 then of course you need girls going on 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.230
 because this will be a chicken dönern 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.180
 and you do not really need that because 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.739
 there is a lot of sugar in it but I like that 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.540
 meat creates a bit sweet and 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.830
 That's why I'll do it for the meat 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.470
 use the marinade 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.230
 you need salt pepper basil 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.430
 oregano if you do not have both 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.860
 It does not matter bad salt and pepper 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.600
 quite a bit too sambal olek for the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.580
 Sauce here is all for the sauce mustard 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.200
 and yogurt the sauce is a bit 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.910
 stolen form from the program chicken 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.619
 wrap but a bit different I think 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.740
 yogurt tastes better less 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.350
 protein more sugar but I taste the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.390
 better with it and a clove of garlic 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.759
 for the sauce and that's all that 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.050
 will come in later salad onions 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.270
 and tomatoes 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.640
 You first have to get the flatbread 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.020
 a bit of the oven on would be yes 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.090
 a bit crunchy maybe from above 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.729
 and down in there he had to do it 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.210
 still be soft and therefore 200 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.250
 Degree 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.440
 yes I do not have it I have the yard 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.670
 not preheated so maybe ten 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.220
 minutes for the sauce we need then 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.799
 100 grams of yogurt 5 grams of 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.860
 the sixty-five grams of sambal olek 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.689
 about half a teaspoon each 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.080
 then we need one or a half 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.030
 garlic clove depending on how intense 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.729
 garlic taste should be the sauce 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.670
 and then they are willing again 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.040
 a pinch of salt a pinch of pepper 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.400
 a bit basilic and a bit 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.950
 oregano now stirring point is already 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.110
 the sauce heartily thank you of course 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.850
 still make a tasty and test 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.160
 look then happens if necessary 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.329
 would like to add again now 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.030
 we marinate the chicken with 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:30.190
 three grams of olive oil first and in 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.209
 aerzen salt pepper what i started with 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.000
 I still have hot peppers that forget 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.799
 my favorite spice combination for 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.169
 the meat and now comes when you 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.329
 if you always want to be like me 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:46.450
 maybe five to ten grams of that 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.910
 chili sauce in the south of this sweet sheep 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.290
 or you annoying completely away but me 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.139
 find the meat get one by 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.900
 really horny sweet and sheep marinade 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.850
 ok ten grams I have from the sauce here 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.430
 done clean and now it will all be 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.079
 the meat marinates optimally 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.250
 natural day before in one 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.299
 let stand refrigerator 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.829
 but not many know just before 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.870
 what your apartment block is closest to you 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.750
 statements will have what is what they do 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.630
 want to eat in the next day 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.680
 marinade stir the meat 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.389
 then it comes here in the pan and 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.570
 then the breakdown is only this is mine 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:28.989
 trick you know that on level 2 to 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.510
 made with it the meat with the banner 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.160
 warm then starts to percentage with it 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.959
 I'm through one in the end you can 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.340
 decide how much you like that 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.870
 can initiate and I'm such a type 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.280
 during which I had nothing to do 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.230
 I can clean up my name is me 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.840
 I was just the glasses now has 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.299
 I know what the bowl off I clear 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.760
 the spices away or what can 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.530
 you still salt and then pepper the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.419
 sauce is already finished that I have 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.600
 again a fridge and everything 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:01.720
 when I start eating with it 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.250
 Everything is already done because after the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.430
 eat when you are really full 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.900
 Eaten then because you just want 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.000
 tired and then you have no stomach for 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.350
 clean up but since I already did that 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 I can do with a pure 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.100
 certain and then me on the 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.340
 couch rest and of course youtube 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.840
 videos watch that the book is now 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.459
 also finished there I have the oven now 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.760
 settled and now only think it 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.760
 times 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.080
 she is on stage 2 all the time 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.720
 continue to roast and the advantage of it is 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.390
 that you want it for that now 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.630
 liquid is now evaporated 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.340
 Roast it while you are 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.210
 can fry it so crispy 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.980
 Nobody wants and I think that's it 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.920
 is now optimal 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:00.310
 because if it's nice and soft that's it 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.770
 environment from the outside bit funny now 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.960
 we can do it and we can don the kebab 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.760
 nice how to do that you know 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.660
 you probably know this way 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.900
 stop 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.640
 then everything comes with it 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.330
 not everything goes down so sideways 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:19.150
 then grabbed the meat purely the salad 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.370
 and on top of it then the sauce so now 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.530
 is the doner finished that is real 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.720
 got really fat 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.600
 I stopped everything I did 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.190
 this is a toaster so big 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.870
 that's why he needs my toaster 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.170
 I still lean on them otherwise falls 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.270
 everything out what I still notice that 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.610
 Ding has about as many calories 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.150
 like a doner of doner but for that 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.100
 the nutrient sources are a great deal 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.080
 higher quality than in a doner shop and 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.330
 so it is a healthy fitness trainer 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.800
 He is not a little calorie but I can 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.520
 allowed me because it was my first meal 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.910
 is the day and we have almost 19 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.220
 Clock 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.360
 So for me it is not a problem 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.600
 to eat more 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.280
 and yes that's a really good big one 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.580
 recommendation from me because of the taste 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.580
 the taste is just outstanding 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:14.020
 believe me i will give you both the 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.930
 nutritional values ​​as well as the quantities of 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.430
 the recipe right at the end of the 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.260
 Show videos 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.770
 In any case, I thank you very much 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.530
 for watching and if you have the 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.780
 To make delicious doner kebab then yes 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.440
