00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.450
 hello everybody, look at me here again and this 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.720
 instead of talking about something cool, I 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.720
 I'm going to talk about the famous r 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.910
 ovinhos the soft tone I bought them 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.700
 in April of this year and we are already 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.280
 and I never used it because I had 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.860
 Forgotten, actually, so I 'm going to leave. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.350
 for the first time here in this video, right? 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.410
 I'm thinking of making several videos 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.179
 thus prove the Korean products and 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.969
 non-Korean people have more 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:49.070
 and send them to you, right? 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.940
 tell you what I found of you 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.980

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.480

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.749
 On this shore, can you get this good from here? 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.949

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.679
 hatch 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.659
 It's a game of exfoliation so you 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.460
 will use this game alone to pass on 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.930
 areas that you have the most 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.360
 It's really in the nose and here you are. 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.119
 take it that way and you massaging the area 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.630

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.689
 35 minutes later whitish 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.579
 There you pick strip with warm water it goes 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.189

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:29.689
 mistakes you know that same feeling 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.390

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.399
 The second is from here I do not know how to speak 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.399

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.360
 everyone is down here so he's a 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.939

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.149
 You'll put her all over your 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.579
 face and leave to act for about 15 to 20 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.250
 minutes and then also remove with 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.590
 a fashion also a cleaning mask 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.250

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.719
 is his name passing beneath it in the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.359
 truth is the panel 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.130
 You'll get it and it's yours. 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.140
 face in those areas where they have the most 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.410
 irregularities is that marquinhos de 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.930
 spine or it also covers your bizarre 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.400
 clothes queues did not put their 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.670
 makeup and such 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.590
 You pass it does not leave the skin well. 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.739
 draws very early in appearance 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.330
 the use is very soft too and he also 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.300
 leaves the skin very straight 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.400
 so these here these produtinhos people 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.060

 camera not much recommended use and 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.150
 follows strong 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.140
 this one is well know is so sequinho 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.019
 I will be there 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.430

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.430

 all the steps as you have seen and now 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.340
 I'll tell you my opinion 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.520
 I loved it is the first cec poors that is a 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.080
 exfoliating and after you swim it 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.930
 really leaves the skin like this 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.700
 you know that feeling of cleanliness 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.470
 mask the second step differently 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.800
 many others I've used because I 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.560
 I have very sensitive skin it did not burn 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.710
 causes irritation on my skin and it 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.770
 also cleaned well know and lastly 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.490
 third that I simply loved that 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.650
 it's the crime is I had not really used 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.960
 the car is as good as that it is 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.780
 extremely dry and enough to carry 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.850
 you pass on his face like that 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.840
 usually stay on top of marquinhos and 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.300
 thorn 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.630
 the lonely egg he just let 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.600
 smooth and super dry it goes on until 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.120
 Leave that velvet touch even you 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.240
 if the nice coin you feel your 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.760
 skin totally free and mine I love it 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.310
 my final opinion here was super 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.130
 sorry to have bought you follow poors 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.080
 if you have oily skin banana feather 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.630
 You buy I've seen people on the internet 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.180
 complaining because ô oô the exfoliating gel 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.480
 did not have as many particles as 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.540
 ours was the water too but people this 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.240
 is a very good thing for those who have skin 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.950
 oily because I like mine behind 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.960
 dermatologist forbade me to use 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.419
 any exfoliator had many 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.230
 why particles like why on the skin 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.930
 oily 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.960
 if you I spend too much exfoliating 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.000
 Exfoliating is the friction will stimulate the 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.910
 fabrics produce even more grease 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.550
 so instead of helping to accept your 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:07.370
 skin it will worsen and its legality and 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.440
 if he has few particles and little johnny 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.540
 it's really fine, habit you do 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.970
 That passage is good because 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.070
 one massage and then after that is 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.689
 as expected to off-press to 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.909
 you take and elect 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.919

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:24.049
