 which has enhanced the production of the feet an important complement 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.949
 nutritional

 although you are wondering how to consume this seed 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.549
 what is advisable are coming naturally in fruit salads 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.109
 yogurt and even whistleblowers and here it has no pain and its taste is quite 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.909
 neutral but also that there is the alternative of buying some of the 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.999
 products that are being marketed with chia added to their ingredients 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.799
 the law that now marks balanced is an open one not only is it had if 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.540
 you get crown open reads full and dad affronts and mayonnaise and you put 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.039
 chia noah would be best 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.319
 obviously because it would be like 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.609
 how to supplement something that does not have an adjustment to the consumption of fatty acids 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.920

 helps to maintain our health the ideal that is getting from products of the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.200
 sea ​​but if that is not possible this seed can make the difference in 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.399
 of life as vascular risk factors 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.399
 a healthy life 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.879
 notice that a study showed who does it 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:16.380
 Japanese have ten months bad omega 3 levels than Americans do for 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.609
 this reason also the ones that japan is to say much lower steve levels 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.020
 klein resist coronary disease the Japanese consume an average of fist 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.050
 eat three grams a day of omega 3 while Americans only 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.919
 zero point 2 and probably we also tac tac by those levels of 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.520
 the second with his sin free theme the amount in the city we having 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.160
 all this coast this tremendous korte we are very 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.530
 p bad for rockets each element for the high price 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.900
 it seems to me they recommended me coapan deck that consumed 8 mega press 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.500
 It seems that it is very good for the buses, not exactly that has shown that the 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.500
 omega-3 serves n 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.509
 of the sector and also in the development of the retina 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.940
 in fact a study that studied the home the children in the longer term of 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:07.020
 mothers who had ingested omega 3 proved to have better performance 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.529
 school what mothers mothers whose percent kuijs children had not 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.809
 had access to this mega 3 police we thought the Japanese people who have 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:21.069
 a high content of omega 3 in their diet p is a pretty privileged people 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.059
 finished 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:26.139
 intellectuals and I would say that it is an intelligent people we grew up we saw 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.200
 of fish shellfish any product of Tuesday number 3 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.070
 not basically in fatty fish or like strawberries with cream or sardines 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.509
 the epad danced and blue fish in the lounge bar or the salmon 

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:41.520
 i also tuna 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.230
 even jar tuna contains quite negative expressed kiev 1 s 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.120

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.300
 simple mcd day the Tarr Tuna especially for the pregnant woman 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.599
 very proven that it serves to lower cholesterol and lower triglycerides 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.909
 which are important causes of heart and brain infarcts 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.460
 the simpsons and hierarchical chillán pearls 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.460
 the Chinese and if they do not obey through fishing 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.289
