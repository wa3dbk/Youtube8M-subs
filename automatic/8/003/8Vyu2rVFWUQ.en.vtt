00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
years obviously there was a time when

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.979 
years obviously there was a time when
natural<00:00:37.649> hair<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:39.510> instance<00:00:39.840> look

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
natural hair was so in for instance look

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.160

at<00:00:40.050> good<00:00:40.260> times<00:00:41.390> everyone<00:00:42.390> was<00:00:42.750> wearing<00:00:42.960> their

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
at good times everyone was wearing their

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.529 
at good times everyone was wearing their
hair<00:00:43.350> naturally<00:00:43.829> pretty<00:00:44.489> much<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.360> show

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

okay<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.500> 70s<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.700> let's

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
okay but that was in the 70s so let's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.510 
okay but that was in the 70s so let's
move<00:00:48.660> more<00:00:49.170> towards<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> 90s<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
move more towards the 90s because I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.000

natural hair on TV which is good in a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.789 
natural hair on TV which is good in a
way<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.390> way<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.229> natural<00:01:49.560> hair<00:01:49.710> is

they all with exception of one I believe
why<00:03:29.550> not<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.850> say<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.420> be<00:03:30.900> safe<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.380> I've

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
why not to say to to be safe but I've

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.560 
why not to say to to be safe but I've
got<00:03:31.830> anything<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.130> one<00:03:32.250> right<00:03:32.400> now<00:03:32.570> they're

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
got anything of one right now they're

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.720 
got anything of one right now they're
all<00:03:33.600> they<00:03:34.080> all<00:03:34.200> wear<00:03:34.350> their<00:03:34.470> hair<00:03:34.590> natural<00:03:34.980> the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
all they all wear their hair natural the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.820 
all they all wear their hair natural the
reason<00:03:35.970> why<00:03:36.060> that's<00:03:36.209> problematic<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:37.230> because

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
reason why that's problematic is because

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.970 
reason why that's problematic is because
they're<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:38.970> jail<00:03:39.510> they're<00:03:39.750> all<00:03:39.900> criminals<00:03:40.350> or

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
they're in jail they're all criminals or

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.729 
they're in jail they're all criminals or
at<00:03:41.730> least<00:03:41.940> they're<00:03:42.660> all<00:03:42.840> perceived<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.620> be

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
at least they're all perceived to be

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.250 
at least they're all perceived to be
criminals<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:44.970> see<00:03:45.239> how<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.690> is<00:03:45.810> another

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
criminals so I see how that is another

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.910 
criminals so I see how that is another
problem<00:03:46.590> why<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.550> natural<00:03:47.880> hair<00:03:48.209> on<00:03:48.300> TV<00:03:48.920> shown

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
problem why is natural hair on TV shown

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.110
