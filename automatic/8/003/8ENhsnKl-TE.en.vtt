phone off and just went nuts because

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.190 
phone off and just went nuts because
obviously<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:52.450> was<00:04:52.600> something<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:52.930> I<00:04:53.080> wanted

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
obviously it was something that I wanted

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.840 
obviously it was something that I wanted
to<00:04:53.410> do<00:04:53.590> but<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.830> knew<00:04:54.040> racing<00:04:54.430> with<00:04:54.520> those<00:04:54.670> guys

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
to do but I knew racing with those guys

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.750 
to do but I knew racing with those guys
it<00:04:55.180> was<00:04:55.330> you<00:04:55.900> had<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.110> be<00:04:56.440> competing<00:04:56.980> and<00:04:57.130> I

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
it was you had to be competing and I

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.150 
it was you had to be competing and I
felt<00:04:58.240> like<00:04:58.390> if<00:04:58.630> I<00:04:58.870> didn't<00:04:59.260> take<00:04:59.470> this<00:04:59.740> season

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
felt like if I didn't take this season

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.200 
felt like if I didn't take this season
off<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:00.490> think<00:05:00.670> I<00:05:00.760> would<00:05:00.880> have<00:05:00.940> been<00:05:01.060> in<00:05:01.090> the

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
off I think I would have been in the

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.750 
off I think I would have been in the
same<00:05:01.360> situation<00:05:01.960> is<00:05:02.050> 2012<00:05:02.800> being<00:05:03.370> on<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.580> same

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
same situation is 2012 being on the same

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.310 
same situation is 2012 being on the same
team<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.180> all<00:05:04.300> this<00:05:04.420> stuff<00:05:04.540> and<00:05:04.750> I<00:05:04.840> just<00:05:05.170> I

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
team and all this stuff and I just I

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.350 
team and all this stuff and I just I
couldn't<00:05:05.740> go<00:05:05.860> through<00:05:06.040> it<00:05:06.130> again<00:05:06.190> so<00:05:06.520> we<00:05:07.000> we

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
couldn't go through it again so we we

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.510 
couldn't go through it again so we we
decided<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.930> bite<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.440> bullet<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:08.950> take<00:05:09.190> the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
decided to bite the bullet and take the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.040 
decided to bite the bullet and take the
heat<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:09.910> make<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.480> right<00:05:10.660> choice<00:05:10.900> and

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
heat and make the right choice and

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.380 
heat and make the right choice and
that's<00:05:11.169> why<00:05:11.350> we're<00:05:11.500> here<00:05:11.820> I<00:05:12.820> think<00:05:13.210> one<00:05:13.360> thing

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
that's why we're here I think one thing

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.310 
that's why we're here I think one thing
that<00:05:13.540> maybe<00:05:13.750> people<00:05:13.900> are<00:05:14.050> going<00:05:14.140> to<00:05:14.230> learn

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
that maybe people are going to learn

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.260 
that maybe people are going to learn

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.240 
you know had to crash in the second moto
and<00:05:55.900> then<00:05:56.050> Dungey<00:05:56.410> wins<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:56.860> we're<00:05:56.950> thinking

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
and then Dungey wins and we're thinking

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.890 
and then Dungey wins and we're thinking
he's<00:05:57.400> one<00:05:57.610> point<00:05:57.880> within<00:05:58.120> and<00:05:58.510> he<00:05:58.600> goes<00:05:58.780> to

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
he's one point within and he goes to

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.390 
he's one point within and he goes to
watch<00:05:59.020> google<00:05:59.380> and<00:05:59.470> all<00:05:59.560> this<00:05:59.710> you<00:06:00.130> know<00:06:00.160> he's

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
watch google and all this you know he's

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.650 
watch google and all this you know he's
the<00:06:00.550> guy<00:06:00.700> and<00:06:00.970> then<00:06:01.060> all<00:06:01.150> of<00:06:01.180> a<00:06:01.240> sudden<00:06:01.270> you<00:06:01.540> get

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
the guy and then all of a sudden you get

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.810 
the guy and then all of a sudden you get
to<00:06:01.810> unadilla<00:06:02.229> new<00:06:02.500> 2012<00:06:03.130> bike<00:06:03.400> comes<00:06:03.640> out

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
to unadilla new 2012 bike comes out

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.670 
to unadilla new 2012 bike comes out
Villopoto<00:06:04.360> so<00:06:04.960> I<00:06:04.990> think<00:06:05.110> that's<00:06:05.530> the

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
Villopoto so I think that's the

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.430 
Villopoto so I think that's the
difference<00:06:06.070> at<00:06:06.460> this<00:06:06.669> level<00:06:06.990> we<00:06:07.990> are<00:06:08.080> all<00:06:08.229> so

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
difference at this level we are all so

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.430 
difference at this level we are all so
close<00:06:08.680> you<00:06:09.040> know<00:06:09.160> we're<00:06:09.640> we're<00:06:10.270> all<00:06:10.450> out<00:06:11.140> there

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
close you know we're we're all out there

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.590 
close you know we're we're all out there
fighting<00:06:11.740> for<00:06:11.950> you<00:06:12.550> know<00:06:12.669> percentages<00:06:13.360> and

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
fighting for you know percentages and

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.760 
fighting for you know percentages and
stuff<00:06:13.750> like<00:06:13.870> that<00:06:13.930> and<00:06:14.110> I<00:06:14.229> think<00:06:14.440> it<00:06:14.560> comes

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
stuff like that and I think it comes

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.740 
stuff like that and I think it comes
down<00:06:14.860> to<00:06:15.190> if<00:06:15.430> you're<00:06:16.120> just<00:06:16.300> showing<00:06:16.419> up<00:06:16.600> at<00:06:16.720> a

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
down to if you're just showing up at a

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.210 
down to if you're just showing up at a
race<00:06:16.900> and<00:06:17.110> you're<00:06:17.200> happy<00:06:17.380> on<00:06:17.740> the<00:06:17.919> team<00:06:18.100> that

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
race and you're happy on the team that

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.469 
race and you're happy on the team that
your<00:06:18.430> own<00:06:18.550> this<00:06:18.729> is<00:06:18.910> something<00:06:19.180> you<00:06:19.270> want<00:06:19.360> to

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
your own this is something you want to

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.180 
your own this is something you want to
be<00:06:19.600> on<00:06:19.690> I<00:06:19.870> think<00:06:20.290> it<00:06:20.380> translates<00:06:20.500> to<00:06:21.010> what

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
be on I think it translates to what

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.620 
be on I think it translates to what
ronnie<00:06:21.430> was<00:06:21.640> doing<00:06:21.910> this<00:06:22.030> year<00:06:22.240> at<00:06:22.390> the<00:06:22.479> end<00:06:22.570> of

the<00:06:22.750> season<00:06:22.930> and<00:06:23.290> you<00:06:23.950> know<00:06:24.039> I<00:06:24.070> think<00:06:24.220> that's

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
the season and you know I think that's

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.460 
the season and you know I think that's
what<00:06:24.849> going<00:06:25.360> into<00:06:25.570> the<00:06:25.660> outdoors<00:06:25.750> I<00:06:26.110> didn't

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
what going into the outdoors I didn't

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.830 
what going into the outdoors I didn't
have<00:06:26.620> and<00:06:26.979> I<00:06:27.070> felt<00:06:27.310> like<00:06:27.430> we<00:06:27.849> barely<00:06:28.450> made<00:06:28.780> it

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
have and I felt like we barely made it

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.340 
have and I felt like we barely made it

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
across there was no way was going to try

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.460 
across there was no way was going to try
to<00:06:30.760> go<00:06:30.880> out<00:06:30.970> and<00:06:31.420> do<00:06:31.540> it<00:06:31.570> outdoors<00:06:31.780> and<00:06:32.200> I<00:06:32.230> felt

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
to go out and do it outdoors and I felt

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.930 
to go out and do it outdoors and I felt
like<00:06:32.590> if<00:06:32.710> I<00:06:32.830> didn't<00:06:33.100> make<00:06:33.250> that<00:06:33.310> change<00:06:33.700> and

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
like if I didn't make that change and

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.670 
like if I didn't make that change and
make<00:06:34.060> the<00:06:34.180> heart<00:06:34.210> calling<00:06:34.750> in<00:06:34.900> I<00:06:35.110> was<00:06:35.500> going<00:06:35.620> to
