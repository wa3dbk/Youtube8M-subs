tutorial<00:00:02.340> for<00:00:02.610> cube<00:00:02.909> storm<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:04.259> design

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
tutorial for cube storm this design

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.070 
tutorial for cube storm this design
starts<00:00:05.009> with<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> zigzagging<00:00:05.970> line<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.660> then

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
starts with a zigzagging line and then

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.110 
starts with a zigzagging line and then
you're<00:00:07.200> going<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.470> swirl<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:08.189> into<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> square

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
you're going to swirl that into a square

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.959 
you're going to swirl that into a square
shape<00:00:09.530> kind<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.620> hit<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:10.830> point<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.610> then

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
shape kind of hit that point and then

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.690 
shape kind of hit that point and then
echo<00:00:12.570> all<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.110> way<00:00:13.200> back<00:00:13.380> around<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.460> line

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
echo all the way back around the line

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.670 
echo all the way back around the line
that<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.030> just<00:00:15.240> created<00:00:15.540> you're<00:00:16.529> just

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
that you just created you're just

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.269 
that you just created you're just
expanding<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.609> by<00:00:18.480> one<00:00:18.930> line<00:00:19.170> by<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.920> little

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
expanding it by one line by that little

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.890 
expanding it by one line by that little
bit<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.670> distance<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.210> keep<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.600> kind<00:00:21.779> of

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
bit of distance you keep that kind of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.200 
bit of distance you keep that kind of
consistent<00:00:22.500> all<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.680> way<00:00:22.800> throughout<00:00:23.210> and

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
consistent all the way throughout and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.179 
consistent all the way throughout and
then<00:00:24.660> you'll<00:00:24.779> travel<00:00:25.050> stitch<00:00:25.410> along<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.949> edge

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
then you'll travel stitch along the edge

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.820 
then you'll travel stitch along the edge
of<00:00:26.460> your<00:00:26.609> starting<00:00:27.119> line<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.570> come<00:00:28.439> back<00:00:28.619> up

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
of your starting line and come back up

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.609 
of your starting line and come back up
and<00:00:28.920> around<00:00:29.480> now<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:30.900> up<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.439> how

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and around now it's really up to you how

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.799 
and around now it's really up to you how
you<00:00:31.650> stitch<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.669> either<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:33.660> these

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you stitch this you can either do these

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.799 
you stitch this you can either do these
lines<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.230> echo<00:00:34.530> quilting<00:00:34.739> first<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.700> fill<00:00:36.510> in

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
lines of echo quilting first and fill in

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.650 
lines of echo quilting first and fill in
the<00:00:37.200> square<00:00:37.710> later<00:00:38.190> or<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.090> fill<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.510> in

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
the square later or you can fill it in

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.450 
the square later or you can fill it in
immediately<00:00:40.290> after<00:00:40.620> stitching<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.160> square

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
immediately after stitching the square

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610 
immediately after stitching the square
it's<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:41.969> entirely<00:00:42.360> up<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> but

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
it's really entirely up to you but

like<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> call<00:00:50.370> cubing<00:00:50.969> kind<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.079> pebble

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
like to call cubing kind of like pebble

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.279 
like to call cubing kind of like pebble
eng<00:00:52.530> only<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.280> cubes<00:00:53.820> anyway<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.230> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
eng only it's with cubes anyway so you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.569 
eng only it's with cubes anyway so you
fill<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:55.980> these<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.399> squares

can aim for the squares to be rather
small<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.680> design<00:01:05.159> simply<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:05.880> my

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
small in this design simply because my

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.539 
small in this design simply because my
starting<00:01:07.110> square<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.950> swear<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.490> were

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
starting square the swear that they were

starting square the swear that they were
fitting<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.119> into<00:01:09.510> was<00:01:09.689> fairly<00:01:09.930> small<00:01:10.340> but

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
fitting all into was fairly small but

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.859 
fitting all into was fairly small but
really<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.760> entirely<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.540> kind

of play with it see what you like to
create<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.060> design<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.470> do

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
create with this design then all you do

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.280 
create with this design then all you do
is<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.040> simply<00:01:17.430> stitch<00:01:18.150> track<00:01:18.720> keep<00:01:18.930> travel

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
more straight lines that's pretty much

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.149 
more straight lines that's pretty much
the<00:01:47.700> best<00:01:47.939> way<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> keep<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.540> consistent<00:01:49.200> now

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the best way to keep this consistent now

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.300 
the best way to keep this consistent now
now<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.479> stitched<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:52.110> new<00:01:52.320> kind<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.950> straight

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
now just stitched a new kind of straight

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.280 
now just stitched a new kind of straight
jagged<00:01:53.790> line<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> go<00:01:55.079> into

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
jagged line and I'm going to go into

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.130 
jagged line and I'm going to go into
this<00:01:55.500> area<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.490> fill<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.060> with<00:01:57.299> some<00:01:57.600> cubing

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
this area and fill this with some cubing

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.069 
this area and fill this with some cubing
and<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:59.700> time<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> filled<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.570> cubing<00:02:00.930> in

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
and this time I filled the cubing in

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.959 
and this time I filled the cubing in
first<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.770> then<00:02:01.979> i<00:02:02.009> stitched<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.640> echo

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
first and then i stitched the echo

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.550 
first and then i stitched the echo
stitching<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.600> said<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:04.200> doesn't

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
stitching like I said it really doesn't

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.069 
stitching like I said it really doesn't
matter<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:05.040> order<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.869> as

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
matter what order you do that in just as

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.359 
matter what order you do that in just as
long<00:02:07.229> as<00:02:07.350> at<00:02:07.500> some<00:02:07.680> point<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.039> fill<00:02:08.250> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
long as at some point you fill the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.669 
long as at some point you fill the
senate<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.910> could<00:02:09.090> fill<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.899> square<00:02:10.349> with

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
senate you could fill in the square with

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.650 
senate you could fill in the square with
really<00:02:11.190> any<00:02:11.370> design<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.730> want<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.090> fill<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.390> in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
really any design you want to fill it in

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.630 
really any design you want to fill it in
if<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.810> wanted<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.140> fill<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.500> with<00:02:13.620> circles<00:02:14.430> if

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
if you wanted to fill it with circles if

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.060 
if you wanted to fill it with circles if
you<00:02:14.730> wanted<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.060> fill<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.330> with<00:02:15.420> triangles<00:02:16.070> it

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
you wanted to fill it with triangles it

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.160 
you wanted to fill it with triangles it
really<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.490> changes<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> design<00:02:18.330> any<00:02:18.750> design

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
really it changes the design any design

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.750 
really it changes the design any design
that<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.410> put<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.800> center<00:02:20.100> will<00:02:20.460> change

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
that you put in the center will change

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.940 
that you put in the center will change
the<00:02:21.060> effect<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.350> it's<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.650> fun<00:02:22.920> to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the effect of it but it's really fun to

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.080 
the effect of it but it's really fun to
just<00:02:23.220> kind<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.430> play<00:02:23.610> with<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:23.940> see<00:02:24.060> what

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
just kind of play with that and see what

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.540 
just kind of play with that and see what
you<00:02:24.270> can<00:02:24.300> come<00:02:24.450> up<00:02:24.630> with<00:02:25.190> so<00:02:26.190> now<00:02:26.310> we're<00:02:26.460> going

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
you can come up with so now we're going

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.250 
you can come up with so now we're going
to<00:02:26.640> fast<00:02:26.850> forward<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> little<00:02:27.690> bit<00:02:27.960> further

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
to fast forward on a little bit further

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.380 
to fast forward on a little bit further
in<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.740> design<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.550> can<00:02:29.700> see<00:02:29.880> how<00:02:30.090> things

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
in the design you can see how things

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.410 
in the design you can see how things
start<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.750> take<00:02:31.020> shape<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.910> has<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.940> really

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
start to take shape and has a really

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.480 
start to take shape and has a really
neat<00:02:33.750> effect<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.290> love<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.740> texture<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.370> this

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
neat effect I love the texture of this

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.900 
neat effect I love the texture of this
design<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> surface<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.660> your<00:02:36.810> quilt<00:02:37.140> and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
design on the surface of your quilt and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.430 
design on the surface of your quilt and
filling<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> weird<00:02:39.390> areas<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> bit

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
filling in the weird areas are a bit

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.560 
filling in the weird areas are a bit
tricky<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:41.280> best<00:02:41.520> thing<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.150> just<00:02:42.180> kind

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
tricky the best thing to do is just kind

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.300 
tricky the best thing to do is just kind
of<00:02:42.720> keep<00:02:43.020> stitching<00:02:43.440> some<00:02:43.920> squares

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
of keep stitching some squares

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.420 
of keep stitching some squares
occasionally<00:02:45.180> some<00:02:45.420> jagged<00:02:45.720> lines<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.500> if

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
occasionally some jagged lines and if

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.730 
occasionally some jagged lines and if
you<00:02:47.580> can't<00:02:47.910> fit<00:02:48.150> anything<00:02:48.540> into<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.140> space<00:02:49.530> at

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
you can't fit anything into a space at

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.250 
you can't fit anything into a space at
all<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.340> stitch<00:02:50.580> straight<00:02:51.150> lines<00:02:51.480> or<00:02:51.720> jagan

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
all just stitch straight lines or jagan

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.770 
all just stitch straight lines or jagan
line<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.740> like<00:02:52.830> V<00:02:53.160> shapes<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.880> keep<00:02:54.570> those

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
line just like V shapes and keep those

of<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> design<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.930> will<00:02:58.050> look<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.260> fine

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820
