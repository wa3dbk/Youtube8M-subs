00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.970
 Good afternoon, Davydova, 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.150
 elena site author in space 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.030
 free creation today we will talk 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.660
 about such a very unusual topic 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.830
 this will be the first movie of the series 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.670
 dedicated star born 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.340
 then such stars born no further 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.670
 I wanted to tell more about people 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.310
 come souls come from other planets 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.439
 I would also like to talk more about 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.079
 clones 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.380
 This is not all, of course, souls, not all 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.450
 category so to say shower 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.780
 people who live now on 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.660
 planet earth but star category 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.050
 many born may respond in 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.950
 heart of those who are now watching this video 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.110
 star born 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:58.500
 these are the souls of people who used to be embodied 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.879
 on other high level planets 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.299
 Consciousness is usually either Pleiades or 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.270
 Sirius Andromeda 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:12.930
 still mass the possibility of planets and stellar 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.049
 systems where these souls incarnated what is it 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.380
 means souls come from higher 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.080
 life plans than we are now living level 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.350
 consciousness the opportunity to experience love from 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.009
 them at the cell level at the level 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.659
 invisible dna threads that is on thin 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.790
 plan 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.659
 there is a memory of that planet of those 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.079
 opportunities in which they 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.219
 or this feeling of love energy which 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.189
 coming from the heart 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:46.030
 then more sensitivity sensitive 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:49.079
 the nervous system is so much more powerful 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.969
 vulnerability when you take everything and 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.340
 passed through your own heart you 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:59.170
 maybe such a dreaminess 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.270
 a clear understanding of what could be 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.420
 completely different than we live 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.239
 now what more love can 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.450
 be more mutual understanding and of course 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:13.120
 all this all this is a memory of past lives 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.180
 it is on the higher planes of being on 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.569
 higher dimensions gives such 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.620
 feeling not comfortable living on earth in 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.819
 this moment 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.160
 what does it mean if you are with birth you 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.859
 remember the birth itself for example 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.160
 drawn to the stars or you could clearly 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:36.129
 feel that the earth is not your planet 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.340
 when I wrote a series of texts and the stars 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.430
 born reviews that are on the site on 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.859
 my posted very vividly demonstrate 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.370
 about this for example, people write that I 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:50.709
 childhood knew that I was not from here not with this 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.239
 planets since childhood of this early age 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:58.650
 78 years from where that is memory in cells 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.919
 makes it very clear to us the same way 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.380
 if you have such a high degree 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:08.349
 dreaminess when you have such a feeling 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.680
 justice eyes deep in the heart 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.130
 when you have a large amount of love failed 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.680
 rejection for example 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.900
 violence and so forth it all can 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.690
 talk about what you don't feel 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.890
 comfortable on this planet and the most 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:29.150
 interesting that these sorrow stars are born 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.030
 this is a category of people who have enough 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.970
 hard at all to interact in this 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.070
 energy what happens usually everything 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.770
 stars born if we consider 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.440
 chakra system i.e. chakras from above 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.670
 down to starting from pockets enchantment and 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:50.900
 ending the root chakra level 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:54.620
 coccyx in earthly people those who are the first 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.780
 incarnation originates in the earth energy 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.900
 begins and chapter begins to develop 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.880
 from the bottom up, that is, the chakras open 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.580
 root sweat sexual chakra 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.100
 solar plexus and so on in 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.870
 a star is usually not born 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.330
 open upper chakras 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.459
 that is, there is a very powerful connection with the spirit 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.520
 developed intuition enchantment to the third eye 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.460
 and usually born in stars 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.270
 their development goes powerful they came with 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.160
 developed chakra to heart therefore 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.920
 so vulnerable feeling 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.380
 injustice can often be very 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.860
 it's hard to accept those energies that 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.590
 peculiar to the earthly incarnation 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.940
 earthly people and earthly people are like 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.390
 rule the bottom three chakras 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.990
 root sexy and sunny 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:51.770
 plexus is usually most people 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.770
 Now we have the planet earth hung on 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.210
 the three lower chakras does not even reach 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.819
 the third chakra usually hung on 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:04.680
 the bottom two is to eat 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:07.789
 how to make money is better than nothing 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.039
 do sex lust and everything 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:13.500
 does n't even reach the third chakra yet 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.840
 solar plexus when we talk about 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.160
 the fact that here comes the realization of oneself 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.849
 here comes the opportunity to express yourself 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.590
 solar plexus chakra is 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.720
 confidence is an opportunity to realize 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.410
 own inner strength exactly how 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.620
 energy 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.810
 and the star born they came from 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.669
 developed upper chakras 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.220
 spirituality creativity compassion 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.770
 unconditional love or at all 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.259
 opportunities to feel love 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.389
 from here there are completely different things that 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:53.009
 make stars born look 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:55.349
 please look at this picture from behind 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:58.190
 does she respond in your heart as far as 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:03.470
 pulls you to her do you like her 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.470
 Does the eye feel comfortable?
