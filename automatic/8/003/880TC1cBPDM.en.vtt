hi guys Matt Bailey here from the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.060 
hi guys Matt Bailey here from the
Bailey's<00:00:08.970> Deezer<00:00:09.210> group<00:00:09.599> Cody<00:00:10.349> we've<00:00:10.889> had<00:00:11.040> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
Bailey's Deezer group Cody we've had a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.770 
Bailey's Deezer group Cody we've had a
lot<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.309> questions<00:00:11.790> about<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.540> lot<00:00:12.750> of

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
lot of questions about it and a lot of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.330 
lot of questions about it and a lot of
phone<00:00:13.049> calls<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.410> lot<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.590> people<00:00:13.889> wondering<00:00:14.250> of

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
phone calls a lot of people wondering of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.860 
phone calls a lot of people wondering of
what<00:00:14.519> it's<00:00:14.639> all<00:00:14.759> about<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.059> here's<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.630> brief

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
what it's all about so here's a brief

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.230 
what it's all about so here's a brief
interview<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.529> brief<00:00:16.830> video<00:00:17.340> sorry<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:18.150> to

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
interview a brief video sorry just to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.700 
interview a brief video sorry just to
give<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.539> quick<00:00:18.720> indication<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.500> what

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
give you a quick indication as to what

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.359 
give you a quick indication as to what
it's<00:00:19.890> all<00:00:20.039> about

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
it's all about

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.700 
it's all about
so<00:00:20.670> when<00:00:21.359> we're<00:00:21.480> talking<00:00:21.630> about<00:00:21.869> calibration

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
so when we're talking about calibration

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.650 
so when we're talking about calibration
which<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.279> basically<00:00:23.730> what<00:00:23.970> coding<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.480> all

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
which is basically what coding is all

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.929 
which is basically what coding is all
about<00:00:25.010> calibration<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> way<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.789> which<00:00:26.820> we

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
about calibration is a way in which we

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.060 
about calibration is a way in which we
used<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.510> actually<00:00:27.689> adjust<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.529> fuel<00:00:28.769> pumps

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
used to actually adjust the fuel pumps

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.800 
used to actually adjust the fuel pumps
on<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> test<00:00:29.519> bench<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.000> fuel<00:00:30.359> injectors

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
on a test bench or the fuel injectors

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.810 
on a test bench or the fuel injectors
whatever<00:00:31.170> they<00:00:31.320> were<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:32.040> order<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.460> ensure

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
whatever they were in order to ensure

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.310 
whatever they were in order to ensure
that<00:00:33.000> each<00:00:33.120> single<00:00:33.510> cylinder<00:00:33.899> had<00:00:34.020> exactly

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that each single cylinder had exactly

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.770 
that each single cylinder had exactly
the<00:00:34.500> same<00:00:34.590> horsepower<00:00:35.370> now<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:36.600> these

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the same horsepower now with these

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.510 
the same horsepower now with these
injectors<00:00:37.350> however<00:00:37.770> they're<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.190> sensitive

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
injectors however they're so sensitive

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.819 
injectors however they're so sensitive
the<00:00:38.969> tolerances<00:00:39.540> are<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.930> small<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.379> mean<00:00:40.530> we're

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the tolerances are so small I mean we're

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.130 
the tolerances are so small I mean we're
already<00:00:41.100> working<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.730> microns<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.899> when<00:00:43.020> we

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
already working in microns but when we

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.630 
already working in microns but when we
think<00:00:43.379> about<00:00:43.500> Denso<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> way<00:00:44.399> which

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
think about Denso on the way which

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.369 
think about Denso on the way which
they're<00:00:44.850> manufacturing<00:00:45.600> these<00:00:45.750> injectors

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
they're manufacturing these injectors

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
they're manufacturing these injectors
we're<00:00:46.920> talking<00:00:47.280> about<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.760> making<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
we're talking about the making what a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.330 
we're talking about the making what a
million<00:00:48.840> or<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.170> injectors<00:00:49.680> every<00:00:49.980> single

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
million or so injectors every single

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.110 
million or so injectors every single
year<00:00:50.489> now<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:50.940> them<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.750> stop<00:00:52.170> test<00:00:53.120> adjust

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
year now for them to to stop test adjust

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.479 
year now for them to to stop test adjust
test<00:00:54.660> adjust<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> test<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> make

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
test adjust the test just just to make

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
test adjust the test just just to make
them<00:00:56.670> perfect<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.809> viable<00:00:58.109> scenario

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
them perfect it's not a viable scenario

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.459 
them perfect it's not a viable scenario
so<00:00:59.250> what<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> code<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.600> does<00:01:01.020> is

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
so what a code actually does is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.470 
so what a code actually does is
basically<00:01:01.710> rather<00:01:02.309> than<00:01:02.550> adjust<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.449> of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
basically rather than adjust all of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.179 
basically rather than adjust all of
these<00:01:03.780> things<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.290> many<00:01:04.439> times<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.070> they

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
these things so many times what they

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.560 
these things so many times what they
actually<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.299> where<00:01:06.450> they

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
actually do is get them to where they

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.300 
actually do is get them to where they
say<00:01:06.750> okay<00:01:07.020> within<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.380> window<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:08.100> they're

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
say okay within a window that they're

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.460 
say okay within a window that they're
acceptable<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.150> rather<00:01:09.630> than<00:01:09.869> adjust<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
acceptable and rather than adjust the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
acceptable and rather than adjust the
injector<00:01:10.920> we're<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> tell<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> see

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
injector we're going to tell the you see

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.359 
injector we're going to tell the you see
you<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.810> injector<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you what this injector is like and the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
you what this injector is like and the
ECU<00:01:14.939> will<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.479> compensating<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.380> us

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
ECU will then do the compensating for us

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.929 
ECU will then do the compensating for us
to<00:01:16.619> make<00:01:16.799> sure<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.070> horsepower<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.700> all<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
to make sure the horsepower is all the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.660 
to make sure the horsepower is all the
same<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.180> that's<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> code<00:01:19.560> generally<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
same so that's what a code generally is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
same so that's what a code generally is
now<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.630> our<00:01:21.750> injectors<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.590> bit

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
now with our injectors it's a little bit

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.350 
now with our injectors it's a little bit
of<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> gray<00:01:23.040> area<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.119> actually

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of a gray area because what we actually

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.390 
of a gray area because what we actually
do<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.990> we've<00:01:25.409> worked<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> way<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.280> able

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
do is we've worked out a way to be able

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.240 
do is we've worked out a way to be able
to<00:01:26.640> adjust<00:01:26.729> them<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.420> over<00:01:28.020> 70<00:01:28.409> cc's<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.890> flow

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
to adjust them so over 70 cc's a flow

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.770 
to adjust them so over 70 cc's a flow
they're<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.640> absolutely<00:01:30.119> perfect<00:01:30.659> but

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
they're not absolutely perfect but

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.690 
they're not absolutely perfect but
they're<00:01:30.990> within<00:01:31.140> about<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.500> 1<00:01:31.770> CC<00:01:32.280> window

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
they're within about a 1 CC window

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.670 
they're within about a 1 CC window
whereas<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.450> original<00:01:33.570> ones<00:01:34.079> are<00:01:34.259> sort<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
whereas the original ones are sort of a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.760 
whereas the original ones are sort of a
70<00:01:35.159> CC<00:01:35.850> per<00:01:36.180> minute<00:01:36.450> flow<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.200> window<00:01:37.500> about

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
70 CC per minute flow but a window about

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.140 
70 CC per minute flow but a window about
6<00:01:38.070> or<00:01:38.220> 7<00:01:38.280> CC<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:40.040> you're<00:01:41.040> typically<00:01:41.490> finally<00:01:42.030> we

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
6 or 7 CC so you're typically finally we

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.179 
6 or 7 CC so you're typically finally we
also<00:01:42.329> try<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> back<00:01:43.020> screw<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.560> four<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
also try to back screw to four to be the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.710 
also try to back screw to four to be the
same<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.579> you'll<00:01:44.729> typically<00:01:45.060> find<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.600> if

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
same so you'll typically find that if

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.090 
same so you'll typically find that if
you<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.990> set<00:01:46.229> off<00:01:46.380> us<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.710> might<00:01:46.860> only<00:01:46.979> be

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
you get a set off us they might only be

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.649 
you get a set off us they might only be
one<00:01:47.340> or<00:01:47.490> two<00:01:47.549> codes<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> box<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> they're

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
one or two codes in the box and they're

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.389 
one or two codes in the box and they're
just<00:01:48.810> assigned<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> all<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.619> same<00:01:49.829> objectives

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
just assigned to all the same objectives

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.969 
just assigned to all the same objectives
but<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:51.329> reality<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.439> terms<00:01:52.890> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
but the reality is is that in terms of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.219 
but the reality is is that in terms of
your<00:01:53.220> car<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.790> don't<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.090> what<00:01:54.270> EC<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:54.990> what

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
your car you don't know what EC but what

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.440 
your car you don't know what EC but what
codes<00:01:55.590> are<00:01:55.829> already<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.490> ECU<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.329> is

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
codes are already in your ECU so that is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.510 
codes are already in your ECU so that is
something<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.899> pretty<00:01:58.350> much<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:59.040> recommend

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
something that pretty much we recommend

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.940 
something that pretty much we recommend
that<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.759> do<00:01:59.969> get<00:02:00.299> them<00:02:00.479> code<00:02:01.110> at<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> ECU

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that you do get them code at the ECU

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.350 
that you do get them code at the ECU
your<00:02:02.130> car<00:02:02.340> should<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.670> coded<00:02:03.240> because

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
your car should be coded because

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.820 
your car should be coded because
otherwise<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:04.049> don't<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.380> exact

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
otherwise we don't know exact

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.950 
otherwise we don't know exact

least<00:02:12.270> they<00:02:12.390> get<00:02:12.540> them<00:02:12.690> coded<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.490> like<00:02:14.490> we

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
least they get them coded so like we

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.100 
least they get them coded so like we
said<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.300> sucka<00:02:15.750> Dead<00:02:15.960> Sea

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
said it's a bit of a sucka Dead Sea

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.020 
said it's a bit of a sucka Dead Sea
approach<00:02:16.440> our<00:02:16.800> approach<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.880> not

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
approach our approach to it is not

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.820 
approach our approach to it is not
exactly<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.600> same<00:02:18.810> as<00:02:18.960> Gonzalez's<00:02:19.680> and

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
exactly the same as Gonzalez's and

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.620 
exactly the same as Gonzalez's and
sometimes<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.340> doesn't<00:02:20.550> require<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.270> but<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
sometimes it doesn't require it but the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.810 
sometimes it doesn't require it but the
reality<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.890> we<00:02:23.430> don't<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:23.730> what

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
reality is is that we don't know what

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820 
reality is is that we don't know what
codes<00:02:24.090> are<00:02:24.240> inside<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.690> ECU<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.230> yeah<00:02:25.650> we

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
codes are inside the ECU so yeah we

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.110 
codes are inside the ECU so yeah we
recommend<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.400> quite<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> good<00:02:26.820> thing<00:02:26.850> that

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
recommend it's quite a good thing that

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.570 
recommend it's quite a good thing that
it<00:02:27.210> gets<00:02:27.390> done
