it'll take 10 minutes if you have all
the<00:04:02.139> teleports<00:04:02.680> ready<00:04:03.449> but<00:04:04.449> this<00:04:04.569> course

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
the teleports ready but this course

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.860 
the teleports ready but this course
yields<00:04:05.650> about<00:04:05.829> 15k<00:04:06.459> XP<00:04:06.819> an<00:04:06.910> hour

although the failure rate is rather high
in<00:04:12.069> my<00:04:12.459> opinion<00:04:12.819> this<00:04:12.940> course<00:04:13.239> is<00:04:13.419> not<00:04:13.569> worth

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
in my opinion this course is not worth

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.400 
in my opinion this course is not worth
