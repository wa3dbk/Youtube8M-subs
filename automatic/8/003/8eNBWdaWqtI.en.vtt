00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
like save this finger for example if you

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.950 
like save this finger for example if you
start<00:04:09.100> at<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.250> red<00:04:09.550> and<00:04:10.090> just<00:04:10.540> swoop<00:04:10.810> across

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
start at the red and just swoop across

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.949 
start at the red and just swoop across
you'll<00:04:11.470> get<00:04:11.620> read<00:04:11.860> into<00:04:12.160> your<00:04:12.750> negative<00:04:13.750> space

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.600 
so when I do some I have a one like this
as<00:04:20.109> I'll<00:04:20.890> do<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.430> top<00:04:21.730> coat<00:04:22.410> on<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:24.100> red<00:04:24.310> and

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
as I'll do the top coat on the red and

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
as I'll do the top coat on the red and
then<00:04:25.570> swoop<00:04:25.990> it<00:04:26.169> up<00:04:26.260> around<00:04:27.450> clean<00:04:28.450> off<00:04:28.600> my

brush<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.470> then<00:04:30.660> just<00:04:31.660> do<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.050> clear

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.810
