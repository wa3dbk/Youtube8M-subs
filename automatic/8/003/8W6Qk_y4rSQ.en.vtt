00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.650
 let's go down everything and we have 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.509
 the five new achievements that are these 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.310

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.640
 completely new and safe 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.170
 they are very easy let's start with the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.570
 first achievement that is going to be this one here 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.820
 says he wins 25 platinum medals in 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.670
 subsequent and final missions of 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.840
 heels in gel and 5 online then this 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.600
 says he's going to see medals 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.520
 we can win gold silver bronze and if 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.799
 we make everything perfect and the challenges we are going 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.509
 to win the platinum then the next 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.880
 then it says complete at the end of a 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.829
 hit without suffering damage in gta 5 online 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.530
 with this I think it means that no 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.360
 They shoot us or beat us or anything to 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.340
 pass it without any scratch and you will notice 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.679
 this achievement that this achievement if I do not 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.060
 wrong is going to be a silver trophy and 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.970
 the previous one that we have seen before was of 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.220
 gold the next achievement I love this 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.689
 achievement is called enjoy a little and what 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.909
 we have to do is just spend ourselves 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.369
 nothing more and nothing less than 8 million in 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.470
 vehicles of this dlc for example if 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.000
 they take out the hydra we can buy it if 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.549
 they take out an armored vehicle we buy it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.009
 and so when we spend 8 million we are going 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.989
 to give this achievement that is 50 g that if 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.060
 I'm not wrong in the play will be a trophy 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.280
 of gold then let's go with the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.420

 people in each in each mission and 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.670

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.459

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.170
