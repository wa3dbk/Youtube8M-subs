00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.379
 Hello, welcome to a new video 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.900
 of teacher to remember that our 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:13.570
 website we have hundreds and hundreds and 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.710
 hundreds of exercises to pass and 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.880
 check very good grades in math 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:21.310
 physical and chemical and we are we have a 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.919
 pdfs where all the sections are 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.590
 all the statements and services so 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.140
 If you think you are in the blog or in the 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.579
 web page too but good if I do not 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.030
 you send an email to the teacher and also 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.239
 of that new gmail 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.170
 puntocom I am not the one that I want that 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.230
 he 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.019
 of integral solutions what more you 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 you are going to be open good let's go to 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.000
 mess that is what imparts 20 are usually 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.800
 five grams of hydrochloric acid in 35 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.559
 grams of water is worth the anxiety of the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.479
 Dissolution is 106 grams match 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.640
 minister there is the concentration of 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.190
 dissolution to so much more portions 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.290
 aggravated and molarÃ­a good then what 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.839
 first we do as we always go to 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.660
 calculate the molecular mass of the acid 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:13.110
 hydrochloric acid that is 1 of 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:14.590
 hydrogen plus 35.5 of the chlorine would be 36 51 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.539
 grams 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.929
 the match is better what it means 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.450
 that we have 30 and 65 grams of acid 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.090
 hydrochloric in a mold is worth 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.039
 you remember students good they see that 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.770
 we have that then we say 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.689
 we have 5 grams if we are going to see the 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.689
 data and then for the blue 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.640
 I like to help 5 grams of acid 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.820
 Hydrochloric acid hydrochloride is the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.360
 soluto true and 35 grams 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:49.040
 of water that is the solvent is to remember 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.140
 that in the dissolution we have absolute 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.240
 solvent and the solution that is the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.220
 total so to speak good so 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.830
 say it is not the total by then 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.390
 We have 5 grams of solute and 35 grams and 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.220
 solvent how many grams do we have of 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:07.070
 dissolution is very good question 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.070
 40 grams of its solution 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.360
 well then for now we are going to then 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.100
 let's go to that which tells us first 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.590
 paragraph a section tells us that 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.690
 we calculate the per cent based on 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.450
 Well, let's see a bit for a hundred 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.150
 en masse it would not be so much a hundred in mass 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.290
 I think the least thing that now purities 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.300
 or do not want to solute if you match with 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.700
 we are of dissolution remember 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.070
 dissolution I put myself like that knew like dt 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.080
 per hundred all grams of solutes 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.300
 how many do we have five well fine well 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.990
 let's have dissolution when we have 40 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.540
 worth and a hundred and that gives our 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:51.000
 calculated 5 divided by 40 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.280
 per hundred here I have the calculator 12 5% 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.760
 Well, it would be done 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.120
 the section well but apart to see us 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.370
 they ask for liter grams and we achieve the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.480
 form are grams of solutes that if the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.700
 we know well lit liters of 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.230
 dissolution let's put but not 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.850
 we know the liters of dissolution 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.739
 true then well we know what of 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.380
 above we do not know what's below that 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.000
 we have to do that you can calculate a 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.130
 and more levels well then let's see 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.690
 how can we calculate give us the 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.050
 density of us we know that the 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.760
 density here is equal to mass density 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.920
 party volume then we know the 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.769
 density if we know the mass of the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.600
 dissolution because it produces the density of 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.269
 dissolution the density of the solution 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.519
 It is equal to mass of solution match 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.160
 volume of solution remembered that 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.350
 always I say the solutions I say 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.170
 the densities always give us problems 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.850
 so take care and it's worth well 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.970
 we clear the volume as it clears the 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.610
 volume come very well is exchanged 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.780
 for the one that's always here 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.710
 the ub is changed by the one of m party of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.130
 that is equal 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.710
 the mass of the solution that are 40 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.140
 grams 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:18.120
 match the density of the dissolution 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:20.380
 but good and 41.06 medium 37 74 17 74 what 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.150
 milliliters because milliliters because the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.640
 density well in milliliters 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.220
 but milliliters of that milliliters of the 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.280
 dissolution 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.350
 to remember it from cognitive ones I know that 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.100
 I can seem a bit heavy and only 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:38.040
 it is solvent solute colors 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.960
 and the dissolution but then there's 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.930
 that try to avoid mistakes that 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.360
 they commit very often then that's why 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.310
 we have to put on that we were of solute 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.710
 grams dissolution whatever in camon 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.570
 it very important to me if 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.550
 works well or good then 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.840
 now we continue then we already know 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.540
 the stretches of solutes and already the 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.280
 we knew that there are 5 and the liters of 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.680
 good dissolution here come milliliters 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.930
 but going from milliliters to liters because 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.700
 let's do conversion factor let's 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:13.530
 to make packages would be a thousand milliliters 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:16.560
 one liter so it gives 00 37 74 liters 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:20.960
 of liters of dissolution of the party 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.090
 between 0,03 774 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.400
 ok and that's not going to make the regulator 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.759
 because if we are not going to laugh 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.759
 everyone 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:36.160
 03774 good humidity 132 49 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:46.300
 1 grams subway meter for the section 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:50.919
 b would already be worth it for now well 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:53.740
 you understand yes then now we go to 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.710
 section c that asks us the modality 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.800
 wrong the dwelling of jacques polarities equal 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:04.560
 to the absolute number of moles 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.510
 liters of dissolution 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.130
 that we know here we know liters of 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.780
 solution if we know events of 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:15.320
 solution because we just calculate them 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:20.850
 0.03 774 liters of solution 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.530
 0.037 74 liters of solution we know 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.380
 the modes enjoyed we do not know how 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.960
 enjoyed but but but we know the 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:30.060
 grams and remember always thanks to 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.010
 triangle of death comes in I look at the 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.620
 issue of death that at the beginning 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.740
 it seemed our enemy we can go from 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.570
 grams amoles or by a formula I what 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.850
 I'm going to do for conversion factors 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.460
 but by the formula that is given in the pdf 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:48.650
 It is also done perfectly but good 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.650
 We know that 30 and 65 grams 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.650
 are 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.340
 solute vale that I always say there 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.870
 what to put of what and then I of course 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:01.910
 as a project the teacher and I do not 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:07.580
 they will correct or I hope so 5 clairvoyant 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:07.580
 36.5 from 0.14 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:14.550
 absolute moles 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.900
 when they are going to correct or better 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.920
 They correct badly because every time I 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:22.090
 You put me wrong to 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:26.650
 to the broth on the internet good then 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:31.720
 let's see would we make 0.14 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:35.740
 divided into 3 0 0 37 74 and gives us the 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:39.009
 371 modality I'm always rounding 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:41.800
 a little molar 

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:44.800
 as the party there would be the 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.380
 well, you have understood, I am going to 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.210
 underline well 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.670
 the interesting problem because we play 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.500
 with many formulas it is discounted that the 

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.080
 solutions besides being complicated 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.610
 we are pulling formulas you have to 

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.620
 do many solution exercises 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.930
 because they are complicated and I always say 

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.170
 same complicated solutions the 

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:07.960
 density gives problems dominant angle 

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:12.510
 of death is worth and little by little they go 

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.510
 coming out like churros come see you
