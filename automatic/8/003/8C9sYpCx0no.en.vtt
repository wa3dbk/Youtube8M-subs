00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:18.450
 the vital looks in france and 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:20.610
 especially in england where the 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.220
 situation is very different from the 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.550
 situation of the varnish nuns because 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.289
 we make money what we are 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.939
 and that's what pep likes the most 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:37.199
 guardiola in the negotiations I suppose to 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:40.960
 his agent whom he will not be 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:46.690
 pending of a person from a league or 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:51.070

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:55.440
 he has the partners behind him and now 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:01.079

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.079

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:09.130
 they will help you and this is a situation 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.560
 that the circle that has convinced pep 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.280
 guardiola to sign for the bank is a 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.560
 a bundesliga that year after year is giving 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.300
 quality jumps and with the arrival of 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.590
 pep guardiola as he thinks it will affect 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.590
 to the entire German championship 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.780
 at this moment he 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.630
 the police has shown by this 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.450
 munich signing varnish has shown 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:39.759
 that we are at the point of 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:42.130
 make us the best league in europe is 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.050
 say in the world we have 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.360
 improved during those last two years 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:52.540
 very much and the pineapple gtp is going to be a 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.300
 very very very interesting point very very 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.680
 pale 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.980
 by other players and by others 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.780
 mental level trainers to come to 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.760
 germany to come and work in the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.340
 economy and finally going back to pep 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.140
 guardiola that will have absolute power 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.060
 also in the lower categories of 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.820
 bayern of Munich that is going to say to 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.120
 design the style of play of the bayern 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.120
 from Munich 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:28.500
 we hope that the text is going to get 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.230
 and will publish and and try to play or 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.850
 create a mix between the game of 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:41.000
 barcelona and the bowling game is 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:44.220
 say I'm sure he's going to look 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.320
 a mix between military of 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.600
 virtuality training mentality 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.170
 because the Spanish players and the 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.420
 German players and this is going to be a 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.140
 very interesting situation 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:04.099
 rhetoric is that to build and create 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.840
 a football for the future in soccer that goes 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.840
