 warfare and this trick is to get out 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.010
 of the maps in a second this trick is 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.170
 very easy to do can be done in 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.420
 all the consoles but only in 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.340
 personalized match can not be 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.670
 public game and ensures 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.690
 Welcome to the teleportation trick 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.690
 in advance warfare 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.320
 in the hospital 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.420
 well all the first thing we will have 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.489
 what to do is that we are in the game 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.260
 with a friend our friend has to be 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.480
 the creator of the game has to be 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 the host the host the leader as 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.229
 you want to call vale and good he's going to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.509
 create the game has to put take 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.100
 the flag and you have to customize the 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.390
 starting just as I am 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.759
 putting me is worth as the post I 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 stop the video and put it as 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.229
 exposed I'll take it that easy and then 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.940
 to save the game you give to 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.490
 square to save the mode and what 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.050
 you will have in custom modes 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.970
 good when he starts the game 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.200
 we are going to do the trick 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.820
 because he is the game can be done 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.009
 nothing gets the team that pleases him 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 and we in the atlas team are worth 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.060
 we are in the atlas restaurant 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.440
 we will give viewer vale we change 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.539
 from team to the spectator we go back to 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.580
 change equipment to atlas but not 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.710
 we take class worth very important now 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.990
 we simply give the circle back 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.360
 to change equipment and now very attention 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.310
 important we are selecting the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 atlas team you see we are not 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.509
 selecting that team and now 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 we will have to quickly give the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.509
 X below 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.399
 and the X again again 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.920
 it has to be in that order everyone waits 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.710
 is here a moment x down x very fast 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.310
 ok and now when it appears to catch 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.439
 class 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.780
 obviously we take class this time and 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.030
 now we can move around the map worth 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.769
 As you can see we are in free mode but 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.269
 we will place ourselves in the place where 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.370
 we want to appear now simply you 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.830
 we give to the square it is worth not 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.629
 appear the messages below that puts 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.400
 pressed to appear if you do not put that 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.379
 means that the trick has gone well and 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.090
 we simply give the square and how 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.400
 we have seen we have appeared on the site 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.019
 I wanted to decide and I did not because 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.150
 I put on that site in free mode 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.250
 and in the place where we have 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.989
 put to look like we have to and then tell you 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.640
 that you can not leave all the maps 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.019
 because there are some that this case falls to you 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.060
 off the map you can not run not 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.040
 You can step on it because it's distorted 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.540
 say it but most yes you can 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.099
 as for example in this one can 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.900
 exit completely off the map there 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.030
 some places that you can fall but 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.290
 Well this is a matter of you 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.329
 for the places where you want to go 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.329
 I could even make a small series 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.400
 of the places where we can go from 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.710
 each map of the game because the truth that 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.990
 I liked this very much, it 's very 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.000
 easier than the actor white trick 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.800
 of transportation because there you can only 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.690
 do in ps3 on team that got stubborn 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.300
 instead, here it can be done in all 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.590
 the consoles can be done in xbox in 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.630
 the one on ps3 on ps4 11 on wii and what 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.910
 that it is not only in the course of 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.430
 this one this game because it 's very easy to 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.770
 do apart but he has no more 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.820
 things seen those can look for the game 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.560
 you have seen that all the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.030
 when they are ship there you are dying 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.790
 all the time on some maps like this 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.990
 because you simply reappear in 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.090
 the map and do the trick again 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.410
 because sometimes you see 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.150
 at the beginning of the game that's why 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.560
 I recommend that you wait a little bit 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.990
 before the game starts it's worth 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.820
 because if it does not work sometimes you have 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.200
 what to do when they have passed 30 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.970
 seconds of the shutdown when you have 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.010
 start the game then you wait 30 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.830
 seconds like that to be able to play because 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.630
 Sometimes as I tell you to look but it is very 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.730
 easy to do, I recommend you see it 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.650
 with a friend because if you do it just do not 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.210
 you have so to speak a small 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.010
 delagneau because he has to be the 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.720
 Leader of the game to us 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.760
 we are the ones who are going to do the trick 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.560
 ok then he can not do it 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.490
 because if it is not going to cost a lot 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.440
 practice 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.140
 It will not go well personally 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.420
 it came out I did it alone offline or 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.400
 online does not matter with the connection 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.320
 putting it did not work for me being the host 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.060
 I had to do it with a partner because 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.459
 if not, it can not be worth as if 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.530
 saying then the trick is very easy to 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.360
 do instead blank costs so what 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.660
 What you had to do was take a 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.180
 custom mode start with tve 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.500
 this is worth to take it from there and it was 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.080
 Quite complicated 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.480
 in plan that can only be in ps3 and 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.980
 in xbox and you have to have that game and 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.710
 a little harder to understand 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.360
 this is very easy since you have seen it is 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.060
 that is going to leave is practically at 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.820
 first if you do not go out for him to go 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.530
 where are you worth because it is very easy and 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.060
 I did not expect it to be so 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.220
 simple and as I say, you can not 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.780
 do in public game because you have 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.580
 seen that changing equipment must be 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.830
 modify the heading accord 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.660
 modify it well because if not it will not 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.060
 work so I hope it has 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.500
 liked the video if it's like this do not forget 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.570
 leave me tonight and if you have any 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.950
 doubt do not forget let me your comment and
