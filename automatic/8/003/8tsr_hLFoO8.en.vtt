00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.770
 Tell me guys took the cesac eric shanks 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.200
 today we are going to talk about characters 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.370
 that you felt bad to face in 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.349
 some games 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.650
 after all, sometimes producers 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.690
 They are extremely paulo coconut and make you 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.699
 face your brother or someone you 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.420
 I really did not want to like it very much and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.890
 such 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.920
 in some cases you have to kill this 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.779
 person in other cases and not in some 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.029
 you discover that you 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.930
 was a big son of a bitch without wanting to 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.420
 wanting, let's go then the first one 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
 character our list is saved in beech 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.329
 offers and tactics 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.520
 this new one but ends up finding that his 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.309
 brother of the city is a great son of the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.930
 bitch who killed his own father and goes after 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.640
 to get the story clear 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.710
 to your surprise you find your 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.620
 brother Sauber doing the same thing as 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.170
 you were going to do and during the battle the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.079
 a city that ends up turning 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.750
 capturing the saved and transforming it is 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.449
 an enemy-controlled vampire who 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.670
 only has one goal to pluck your head 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.210
 You obviously do not like this much. 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.220
 idea 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.659
 he ends up being forced to kill the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.270
 own brother with a small detail 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.790
 during all combat the dawn is 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.380
 aware of their own movements but 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.299
 has not bought from his own body 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.909
 making the situation even more 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.500
 depressing 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.049
 according to the personal service of today is the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.180
 governs river insight which is a 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.400
 character that you can kill or not 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.409
 but that if you end up killing yourself 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.450
 he obviously feels bad about it after all 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.710
 accounts thanks to yourself you have a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.439
 chance to survive 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.210
 one thousand a site after all she gives you a gun and 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.979
 helps you in some parts of the world 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.079
 unfortunately it ends up being infected 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.540
 by the same type of parasite that infected 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.180
 the nurses at the hospital and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.590
 attacking two harry harry or saving 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.030
 or finish angle 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.280
 obviously we are not talking about the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.170
 second option we with this nodes do not 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.079
 we will be depressed to save the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.590
 a third character our list of 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.479
 today is the great or sif which is just a 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.729
 wolf with sword in the mouth for those who do not 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.770
 paid attention to the history of waiters 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.840
 but for those who like lord the game 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.710
 ends up learning that he is the companion 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.840
 the knight's air towels and that 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.760
 he sacrificed to save the after 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.520
 death of his sif master saves the grave 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.470
 and now for hundreds of years until 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.350
 that the successor of actors finally 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.610
 came up winning challenging after the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.770
 before this wait 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.470
 Unfortunately, if it is not the successor of 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.620
 actors as part of the test is to kill it 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.770
 to then be able to enter the labs and then yes 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.390
 overcome the curse that has taken the world 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.220
 hundreds of years ago 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.890
 The interesting thing is that in theirs and us 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.740
 find this puppy and save them and 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.840
 if you do this before you face it 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.690
 when he is bhutto he finishes 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.970
 recognizing and yet he faces 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.910
 and you're forced to kill a character 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.800
 which is not bad that they do not really want 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.390
 ask you to come the end of the game 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.100
 I just want to go back to the master's side. 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.080
 him at the end of the day. 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.970
 The battle was still limping and such 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.030
 showing that he is really bad and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.090
 You end up killing my anyway. 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.680
 motherfucker you 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.590
 closing the list today we have to 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.420
 harley clean batman arkham city that 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.710
 You must be wondering why? 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.440
 has been added to the list 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.050
 good in the batman arkham city tutorial 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.360
 You wind up getting her down and she falls. 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.480
 behave everything and everything else that you 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.520
 thinking here is a poor cot many hours 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.950
 after that you can access the room 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.020
 her inside arkham city and you 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.920
 discovers a pregnancy test with the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.790
 positive sign ie you shot 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.440
 a pregnant woman on the floor or so 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.210
 it must not have done very well for the baby 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.490
 her is not good 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.250
 if you discover this room at the end of 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.530
 game appears she singing sleeps baby 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.800
 applied in pick up while credits 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.420
 and they are rolling them and harley hymn 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.900
 resell them in case you have found 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.690
 this first test and if you access the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.010
 same room again you find out that 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.370
 there is another test with a negative sign 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.370
 that is, the batman in provoking abortion in the 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.530
 harley quinn the warner game tutorial 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.780
 commented on this subject 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.229
 say that it is actually a false positive 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.050
 on the test and everything but the way you 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.310
 she behaves herself and the clues they 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.590
 go during the flight 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.440
 It seems that Batman really killed the 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.360
 son of the joker with her and at the 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.220
 accounts to order ended up not going back 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.419
 There were balls to admit that. 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.010
 happened after all it was a 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.830
 heavy with clothes right 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.110
 but eventually you caused the death 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.699
 Anequim and you're a big one by the short 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.699
