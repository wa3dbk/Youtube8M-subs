00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.250
 my name is Luis Estrada 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.250
 it is a single use 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.729
 in this video cristina d as a novelty a background color like the web page 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.269
 once we had put basic tickets you are already in it in your 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.289
 place 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.150
 we go to tag t 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.150
 we should attribute that color 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.010
 the value that tribute can have can be punk 'number that csav that bad 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.060
 a rgb value 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.700
 with a color 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.210
 for example 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.210
 enter bg blushes equals 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.640
 or less 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.640
 the chibolas come back and refresh the browser 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.430
 you will see what the color has changed 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.890
 however the problem is that he 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.090
 as the background color is the same as the text color 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.530
 this is impossible to see 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.469
 you must be careful when using color combinations 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.850
 d the source 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.600
 with the irc background color 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 if you use a dark background color 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.550
 you should quote 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.410
 a reader 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.300
 depending on the background color you use 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.370
 you can make your text easier easier 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.670
 neat been impossible to read 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.990
 you should also be careful not to use background colors 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.120
 what hurt my eyes 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.120
 like the color red and yellow 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.509
 By far the two most used colors for font pages are white and 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.800
 the black 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.550
 if there is any color 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.250
 that you want to use 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.810
 but it does not have a common name like blue or red 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.200
 you can specify the color 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.250
 because the number texas decimal 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.120
 or the value he receives 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.369
 for a table d common color codes 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.319

 copy the number 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:36.430
 and paste it into the source code file in this way 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:41.649
 save the file and refresh browser 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.719
