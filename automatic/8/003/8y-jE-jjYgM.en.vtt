expand upon in future seasons and I was
even<00:05:03.860> enjoying<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.430> little<00:05:04.520> bits<00:05:04.789> of<00:05:04.880> comedy

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
even enjoying the little bits of comedy

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.629 
even enjoying the little bits of comedy
being<00:05:05.630> thrown<00:05:05.870> in<00:05:06.080> here<00:05:06.409> and<00:05:06.530> there<00:05:06.710> this<00:05:07.340> was

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
being thrown in here and there this was

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.939 
being thrown in here and there this was
a<00:05:07.669> fantastic<00:05:08.229> start<00:05:09.229> to<00:05:09.380> the<00:05:09.500> season<00:05:09.650> finale

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
a fantastic start to the season finale

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.610 
a fantastic start to the season finale
but<00:05:10.699> since<00:05:11.030> this<00:05:11.180> is<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.389> two-parter<00:05:12.169> I<00:05:12.199> figured

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
but since this is a two-parter I figured

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.200 
but since this is a two-parter I figured
that<00:05:12.740> I<00:05:12.770> should<00:05:12.860> split<00:05:13.340> my<00:05:13.520> thoughts<00:05:13.849> between

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
that I should split my thoughts between
