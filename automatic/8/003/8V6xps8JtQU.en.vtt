00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.240
- Perched on the edge of the Grand Canal

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.633
is the Rialto Market.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.450
I'm here to shop with
my friend, Lelia Passi,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.540
a fun spirit, a real Italian countess,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.863
and a life-long Venetian.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.440
Today we're gathering everything we need

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.050
to cook at her centuries-old palazzo

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.938
that's just a short walk from the market.

00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:23.260
(women laughing)

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.360
We're here with Contessa Passi

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.900
in her beautiful Palazzo Tiepolo.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.440
And the Contessa is going
to show us how to make

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.850
a very typical Venetian dish.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.340
And the dish is called--

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.213
- Easy and Beasy.
- Easy and Beasy.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.090
- It's beans, rice, and peas.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.440
- So what do we do first?

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.568
You're in charge.

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:44.120
(laughing)

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.450
- [Lelia] We are beginning
from preparing peas.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.720
- Okay, so these are fresh?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.843
- Yes, they are fresh.

00:00:48.843 --> 00:00:50.660
You see it there, look.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.530
Now you must use the onion and some oil.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.790
After, you can add in rice with this one.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.970
- Risotto rice?
- Risotto rice.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.090
- And then we do the fagotto.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.990
- [Lelia] Now you wanna cut
this very, very thinner.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.090
You fry with oil.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.623
You use many onions.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.510
- Can I try?

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.343
- Yes.

00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:16.720
See now you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.600
Very good, you are quite a cook.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.990
- You think so?

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.063
- Yes, you are.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.250
- I went to cooking school
a very long time ago.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.950
I think maybe I have to come back.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.703
This is an onion, a big spring onion.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.340
- You cut very thin, thin, thin.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.940
- And you put oil?
- Yes.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.840
- And this is olive oil?
- Olive oil.

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:41.160
- Enough?
- Enough, enough.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.740
Now I must cook this.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.743
- And gas?

00:01:45.743 --> 00:01:48.260
You use mostly gas in Venice, yeah?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.390
- You put the liver inside with some oil.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.257
- Yep, so you cook the onion
and liver separately first?

00:01:54.257 --> 00:01:55.840
- Yeah, separately.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.680
- And salt and pepper?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.630
- After.
- After, yeah.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.500
Can I stir?
- Yes, thank you.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.630
The onion must be translucent and gold.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.280
When the liver is cook
I mix the two together.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.340
- And how do you know
when the liver is cooked?

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.440
- When it begin, white.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.273
- That's ready.

00:02:16.273 --> 00:02:17.260
But that's fast.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.550
I mean, it's finished in--

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.595
- Five minutes.

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:21.955
(laughing)

00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:23.242
- Fagotto.
- Yes.

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.909
(food sizzling)

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.475
- And you want some parsley, do you?

00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:31.864
- Now some parsley.

00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:33.810
(knife chopping)

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.930
- Okay, so we finally chopped the parsley,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.200
and into the mix of onion and liver.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.050
- Yes, it is.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.573
It is finished.
- Okay.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.290
- We'll put the rice, some onions.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.580
- Yep, that's onion butter?

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:47.510
- Onion butter.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.980
- Then you put in the risotto rice.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.040
And risotto rice is
much shorter and fatter

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.410
than regular rice, isn't it?

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.505
- After, we add some
broth, vegetable broth.

00:02:58.505 --> 00:02:59.490
- Vegetable broth.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.580
- And we cook until al
dente, 10 minutes, about.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.210
- Okay.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.990
So these are the peas that you've cooked?

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.690
- Yes, I cook before
but in the same system.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.909
And at the end, we add the cheese.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.640
Finished, finished, okay?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.980
- Great.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.386
You've opened a few
champagne bottles, I think.

00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:19.820
(women laughing)

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.110
This is from your parents?

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.336
- Yes, of course.

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:26.334
Prosecco is made by my parents in Aldein.

00:03:26.334 --> 00:03:27.167
(cork pops)

00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:29.830
(women laughing)

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.433
- To you, Contessa.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.210
