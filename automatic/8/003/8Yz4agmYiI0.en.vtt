00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
design work so within each peg there's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.580 
design work so within each peg there's
opportunities<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:48.410> multiple<00:00:49.410> of

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.660 

and<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:43.320> only<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> few<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.310> this

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and I'm only going to put a few on this

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.140

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
morning but you'll get the idea of how

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.190 
morning but you'll get the idea of how
easy<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:51.780> load<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.200> up

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.899 

and<00:01:55.650> you<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.920> I've<00:01:56.009> only<00:01:56.130> put<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.729> on

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and you see I've only put this much on

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.179 
and you see I've only put this much on
but<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.390> go<00:01:57.509> all<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> way<00:01:57.750> out<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.110> here<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
but I can go all the way out to here the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.469 
but I can go all the way out to here the
opening<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.790> wide<00:01:59.970> enough<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> accommodate

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
opening is wide enough to accommodate

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.380 
opening is wide enough to accommodate
all<00:02:01.080> of<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.350> different<00:02:02.000> fibers<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.240> may

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
all of the different fibers that you may

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.210 
all of the different fibers that you may
choose<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.350> we're<00:02:04.470> going<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
choose and what we're going to do is

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.210 
choose and what we're going to do is
insert<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.939> fiber<00:02:06.380> pull<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.500> down<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.979> tip

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
insert the fiber pull it down to the tip

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.780 
insert the fiber pull it down to the tip
and<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.239> let<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.599> beads<00:02:10.590> drop<00:02:11.459> right

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and then just let the beads drop right

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.490 
and then just let the beads drop right
onto<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.620> fiber<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.870> probably<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
onto the fiber this is the probably the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.110 
onto the fiber this is the probably the
most<00:02:16.739> time-consuming<00:02:17.010> part<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:17.910> whole

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
most time-consuming part of this whole

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.780 
most time-consuming part of this whole
project<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.810> stringing<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.260> beads<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
project is stringing the beads so the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.309 
project is stringing the beads so the
next<00:02:20.970> thing<00:02:21.150> we're<00:02:21.269> going<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.450> do<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.930> choose<00:02:22.290> a

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
next thing we're going to do is choose a

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.070 
next thing we're going to do is choose a
ha<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.730> for<00:02:26.730> demonstration<00:02:27.480> purposes<00:02:27.900> I'm

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
ha and for demonstration purposes I'm

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.440 
ha and for demonstration purposes I'm
going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.350> choose<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:28.950> pigs<00:02:29.280> they<00:02:30.239> just

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
going to choose the for pigs they just

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.240 
going to choose the for pigs they just
twist<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:33.120> give<00:02:34.049> a<00:02:34.080> little<00:02:34.350> little<00:02:34.860> twist

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
twist on and give a little little twist

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.840 
twist on and give a little little twist
and<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.670> will<00:02:35.790> fit<00:02:36.000> right<00:02:36.030> into<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> notches

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
and it will fit right into the notches

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.160 
and it will fit right into the notches
ok<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.310> we've<00:02:41.519> got<00:02:41.549> our<00:02:42.120> source<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.930> we've<00:02:43.019> got

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
ok so we've got our source and we've got

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.630 
ok so we've got our source and we've got
our<00:02:43.319> beads<00:02:43.560> don't<00:02:43.860> have<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.100> lot<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.310> beads<00:02:44.519> on

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
our beads don't have a lot of beads on

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.090 
our beads don't have a lot of beads on
just<00:02:44.940> yet<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.630> we<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.350> our<00:02:46.470> working<00:02:46.709> end

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
just yet and we have our working end

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.160 
just yet and we have our working end
that<00:02:47.880> working<00:02:48.269> end<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:48.600> going<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.840> go<00:02:48.930> right

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
that working end is going to go right

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.680 
that working end is going to go right
down<00:02:49.200> inside<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> French<00:02:50.519> knitter<00:02:50.790> you're

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
down inside of the French knitter you're

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.020 
down inside of the French knitter you're
going<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.930> hold<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.880> then<00:02:53.880> in

going to hold on to it and then in

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.750 
going to hold on to it and then in
succession<00:02:54.510> either<00:02:55.260> clockwise<00:02:56.069> or<00:02:56.310> counter

clockwise<00:02:56.790> either<00:02:57.630> way<00:02:57.870> works<00:02:58.110> you're<00:02:58.530> going

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
clockwise either way works you're going

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.270 
clockwise either way works you're going
to<00:02:58.950> wrap<00:02:59.130> your<00:02:59.160> pegs<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:01.380> we<00:03:01.560> consider<00:03:01.980> this

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
to wrap your pegs and we consider this

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.750 
to wrap your pegs and we consider this
now<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.640> first<00:03:03.030> row<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:04.799> next<00:03:05.040> step<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.609> to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
now the first row the next step is to

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.250 
now the first row the next step is to
take<00:03:05.940> your<00:03:06.150> fiber<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.690> bring<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.109> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
take your fiber and bring it to the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
take your fiber and bring it to the
front<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.280> first<00:03:08.519> peg<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:10.290> here<00:03:11.130> you're

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
front of the first peg and here you're

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.800 
front of the first peg and here you're
hanging<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.120> starting<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.690> you're

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
hanging on to the starting and you're

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.280 
hanging on to the starting and you're
also<00:03:13.049> hanging<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.570> working<00:03:15.570> end<00:03:15.780> so

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
also hanging on to the working end so

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.530 
also hanging on to the working end so
you<00:03:16.350> feel<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.190> need<00:03:17.820> about<00:03:18.030> 16

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
you feel like you have need about 16

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.900 
you feel like you have need about 16
fingers<00:03:18.959> but<00:03:19.320> that's<00:03:19.890> how<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.370> just<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.760> get

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
fingers but that's how it is just to get

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.789 
fingers but that's how it is just to get
started<00:03:21.359> I'm<00:03:21.780> releasing<00:03:22.200> some<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
started I'm releasing some of the

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.710 
started I'm releasing some of the
tension<00:03:22.829> from<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.640> working<00:03:24.180> end<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.630> I'm

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
tension from the working end that I'm

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.020 
tension from the working end that I'm
holding<00:03:24.930> on<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.709> what<00:03:25.739> I'm<00:03:26.430> doing<00:03:26.519> is

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
holding on to and what I'm doing is

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.810 
holding on to and what I'm doing is
lifting<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.959> front<00:03:28.440> row<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.190> first<00:03:29.220> row<00:03:29.609> over

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
lifting the front row the first row over

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.670 
lifting the front row the first row over
the<00:03:32.820> fiber<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.750> placed<00:03:34.049> in<00:03:34.260> front<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.560> the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
the fiber that I placed in front of the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.949 
the fiber that I placed in front of the
peg<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.910> literally<00:03:36.329> is<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.630> knit

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
peg and that literally is the knit

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.610 
peg and that literally is the knit
stitch

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.800 

and<00:03:43.129> when<00:03:43.340> I'm<00:03:43.459> doing<00:03:43.640> a<00:03:43.879> pattern<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:44.480> might

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
and when I'm doing a pattern that might

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.259 
and when I'm doing a pattern that might
be<00:03:45.019> a<00:03:45.050> little<00:03:45.379> bit<00:03:45.730> dependent<00:03:46.730> on<00:03:46.879> how<00:03:47.209> many

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
be a little bit dependent on how many

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.390 
be a little bit dependent on how many
times<00:03:47.660> I<00:03:47.840> go<00:03:48.019> around<00:03:48.140> I<00:03:48.500> will<00:03:48.560> mark<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.190> first

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
times I go around I will mark the first

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.140 
times I go around I will mark the first
peg<00:03:49.760> with<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:51.310> permanent<00:03:52.310> marker<00:03:52.580> or<00:03:52.819> piece

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
peg with a a permanent marker or piece

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.400 
peg with a a permanent marker or piece
of<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.510> little<00:03:54.050> touch<00:03:54.349> of<00:03:54.790> nail<00:03:55.790> polish<00:03:56.410> all

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
of a little touch of nail polish all

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.380 
of a little touch of nail polish all
right<00:03:57.650> when<00:03:58.310> you're<00:03:58.430> doing<00:03:58.760> jewelry<00:03:59.030> it's<00:03:59.269> a

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
right when you're doing jewelry it's a

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.300 
right when you're doing jewelry it's a
really<00:03:59.629> good<00:03:59.810> idea<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.230> do<00:04:00.590> two<00:04:00.950> or<00:04:01.040> three

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
really good idea to do two or three

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.880 
really good idea to do two or three
rounds<00:04:01.459> without<00:04:01.760> any<00:04:02.150> beads<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:03.530> allows

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
rounds without any beads that allows

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.420 
rounds without any beads that allows
space<00:04:04.280> for<00:04:04.610> your<00:04:04.700> closure<00:04:05.030> you<00:04:06.220> don't<00:04:07.220> want<00:04:07.340> to

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
space for your closure you don't want to

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.979 
space for your closure you don't want to
put<00:04:07.580> your<00:04:07.700> closure<00:04:07.970> on<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.420> crack<00:04:08.599> your<00:04:08.780> beat

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
put your closure on and crack your beat

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.520 
put your closure on and crack your beat
so<00:04:09.290> just<00:04:09.799> a<00:04:09.890> little<00:04:10.040> bit<00:04:10.250> of<00:04:10.370> extra<00:04:10.879> room<00:04:10.910> there

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
so just a little bit of extra room there

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.410 
so just a little bit of extra room there
all<00:04:12.530> right<00:04:12.830> we've<00:04:13.250> gone<00:04:13.400> around<00:04:13.549> twice<00:04:14.060> I'm

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
all right we've gone around twice I'm

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.810 
all right we've gone around twice I'm
gonna<00:04:14.630> pull<00:04:14.989> my<00:04:15.500> starting<00:04:16.160> piece<00:04:16.370> just<00:04:16.700> a

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
gonna pull my starting piece just a

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.219 
gonna pull my starting piece just a
little<00:04:17.060> bit<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.359> that<00:04:17.510> brings<00:04:17.810> everything

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
little bit and that brings everything

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.490 
little bit and that brings everything
into<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:19.120> little<00:04:20.120> bit<00:04:20.239> eat-eat<00:04:20.690> more<00:04:21.200> even

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
into a little bit eat-eat more even

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.219 
into a little bit eat-eat more even
tension<00:04:21.739> there<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:23.000> when<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.240> want<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.630> place<00:04:24.200> my

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
tension there so when I want to place my

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.750 
tension there so when I want to place my
beads<00:04:24.740> in<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.510> will<00:04:26.510> move<00:04:26.750> them<00:04:26.990> up<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.610> use

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
beads in I will move them up and I use

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.280 
beads in I will move them up and I use
one<00:04:28.970> of<00:04:29.060> our<00:04:29.180> wonder<00:04:29.450> clips<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.960> hold<00:04:30.139> the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
one of our wonder clips to hold the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.140 
one of our wonder clips to hold the
beads<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:30.740> I'm<00:04:30.919> not<00:04:31.070> chasing<00:04:31.550> them<00:04:31.669> around<00:04:31.790> the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
beads so I'm not chasing them around the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.750 
beads so I'm not chasing them around the
spool<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:35.750> here<00:04:36.139> was<00:04:36.289> my<00:04:36.320> last<00:04:36.710> stitch<00:04:37.160> I'm

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
spool so here was my last stitch I'm

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.590 
spool so here was my last stitch I'm
going<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.270> draw<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:38.600> beat<00:04:38.930> down<00:04:40.449> between<00:04:41.449> the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
going to draw the beat down between the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.600 
going to draw the beat down between the
pig<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.199> then<00:04:42.740> I'm<00:04:42.889> going<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.160> make<00:04:43.370> my<00:04:43.550> next

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
pig and then I'm going to make my next

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.040 
pig and then I'm going to make my next
stitch

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.830 

NEADS<00:04:49.590> between<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.220> pig

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
NEADS between the pig

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.050 
NEADS between the pig
and<00:04:51.930> then<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.680> stitch<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.220> lifting<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:53.760> first

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
and then the stitch of lifting the first

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.659 
and then the stitch of lifting the first
row<00:04:54.330> up<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:54.840> over<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.500> fiber<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.070> off<00:04:56.400> the

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
row up and over the fiber and off the

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.129 
row up and over the fiber and off the
pig<00:04:57.139> just<00:04:58.139> like<00:04:58.260> that<00:04:59.660> now<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:00.720> see<00:05:00.840> it's

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
pig just like that now you see it's

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.340 
pig just like that now you see it's
trapped<00:05:01.470> in<00:05:01.680> between<00:05:02.840> there's<00:05:03.840> enough<00:05:04.169> space

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
trapped in between there's enough space

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.409 
trapped in between there's enough space
I<00:05:04.650> could<00:05:04.710> actually<00:05:04.980> put<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.430> larger<00:05:05.880> bead<00:05:06.030> here

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
I could actually put a larger bead here

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.020 
I could actually put a larger bead here
or<00:05:06.690> I<00:05:06.750> can<00:05:07.050> put<00:05:07.230> two<00:05:07.410> beads<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:08.010> again<00:05:08.430> the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
or I can put two beads so again the

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.090 
or I can put two beads so again the
creativity<00:05:09.810> gets<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.350> be<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.740> point<00:05:10.770> where

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
creativity gets to be to the point where

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.610 
creativity gets to be to the point where
it's<00:05:11.250> up<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:12.020> I'm<00:05:13.020> going<00:05:13.230> to<00:05:13.320> show<00:05:13.470> you<00:05:13.530> a

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
it's up to you I'm going to show you a

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.780 
it's up to you I'm going to show you a
little<00:05:15.590> sample<00:05:16.590> here<00:05:16.620> where<00:05:17.040> I've<00:05:17.220> used<00:05:17.250> four

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
little sample here where I've used four

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.080 
little sample here where I've used four
pigs<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.450> on<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.870> beginning<00:05:19.260> I<00:05:19.590> dropped<00:05:20.460> two

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
pigs and on the beginning I dropped two

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.900 
pigs and on the beginning I dropped two
beads<00:05:21.450> between<00:05:21.900> each<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:22.620> every<00:05:22.919> peg<00:05:23.160> on<00:05:23.400> each

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
beads between each and every peg on each

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.370 
beads between each and every peg on each
and<00:05:24.090> every<00:05:24.210> row<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:24.810> that<00:05:25.290> looks<00:05:25.530> like<00:05:25.710> this

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
and every row and that looks like this

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.500 
and every row and that looks like this
the<00:05:28.380> next<00:05:28.650> time<00:05:28.800> I<00:05:29.010> dropped<00:05:29.460> one<00:05:29.580> B<00:05:30.030> between

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
the next time I dropped one B between

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.780 
the next time I dropped one B between
each<00:05:30.750> peg<00:05:31.080> on<00:05:31.260> every<00:05:31.650> row<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.100> that<00:05:32.610> would

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
each peg on every row and that would

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.240 
each peg on every row and that would
look<00:05:32.910> like<00:05:32.970> this<00:05:33.200> so<00:05:34.200> even<00:05:34.410> though<00:05:34.830> I've<00:05:35.010> used

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
look like this so even though I've used

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.860 
look like this so even though I've used
the<00:05:35.400> for<00:05:35.639> pay<00:05:35.820> kit<00:05:36.120> I've<00:05:36.330> got<00:05:36.510> two<00:05:36.720> different

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
the for pay kit I've got two different

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.690 
the for pay kit I've got two different
looks<00:05:39.380> so<00:05:40.380> just<00:05:40.710> briefly<00:05:41.070> I<00:05:41.160> want<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.490> show<00:05:41.639> you

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
looks so just briefly I want to show you

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.730 
looks so just briefly I want to show you
a<00:05:41.820> couple<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.270> things<00:05:42.479> this<00:05:43.169> is<00:05:43.380> done<00:05:43.560> with<00:05:43.710> a

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
a couple of things this is done with a

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.830 
a couple of things this is done with a
for<00:05:44.100> peg<00:05:44.370> head<00:05:44.669> this<00:05:44.940> is<00:05:45.000> about<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.540> largest

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
for peg head this is about the largest

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.080 
for peg head this is about the largest
bead<00:05:46.169> that<00:05:46.350> we<00:05:46.410> like<00:05:46.680> to<00:05:46.710> use<00:05:47.100> it's<00:05:47.430> about<00:05:47.580> an<00:05:47.850> 8

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
bead that we like to use it's about an 8

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.000 
bead that we like to use it's about an 8
millimeter<00:05:48.500> in<00:05:49.700> this<00:05:50.700> case<00:05:50.940> I've<00:05:51.210> dropped<00:05:52.010> one

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
millimeter in this case I've dropped one

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.640 
millimeter in this case I've dropped one
B<00:05:53.220> between<00:05:53.669> each<00:05:53.910> peg<00:05:54.330> of<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.630> four<00:05:55.110> peg<00:05:55.350> head

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
B between each peg of the four peg head

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.740 
B between each peg of the four peg head
and<00:05:55.890> the<00:05:56.460> second<00:05:56.850> row<00:05:56.970> I<00:05:57.000> didn't<00:05:57.360> drop<00:05:57.510> any

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
and the second row I didn't drop any

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.510 
and the second row I didn't drop any
beads<00:05:58.020> so<00:05:58.260> this<00:05:58.440> right<00:05:58.650> here<00:05:58.710> doesn't<00:05:59.370> have

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
beads so this right here doesn't have

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.320 
beads so this right here doesn't have
any<00:05:59.669> beads<00:05:59.940> on<00:06:00.150> it

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
any beads on it

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.659 
any beads on it
and<00:06:00.479> that<00:06:00.990> allows<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.830> beads<00:06:02.070> to<00:06:02.340> fit<00:06:02.520> down

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
and that allows the beads to fit down

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.940 
and that allows the beads to fit down
through<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.120> throat<00:06:03.390> of<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:04.020> French<00:06:04.710> knitter

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
through the throat of the French knitter

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.920 
through the throat of the French knitter
do<00:06:05.460> you<00:06:05.550> have<00:06:05.669> to<00:06:05.820> make<00:06:06.300> sure<00:06:06.479> that<00:06:06.600> you<00:06:06.750> have

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
do you have to make sure that you have

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.210 
do you have to make sure that you have
beads<00:06:07.200> that<00:06:07.410> are<00:06:07.590> going<00:06:07.800> to<00:06:07.919> accommodate

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
beads that are going to accommodate

beads that are going to accommodate
going<00:06:09.090> down<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.419> center
