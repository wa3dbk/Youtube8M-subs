 accordingly it will be extremely healthy 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.369
 a quark for itself flaxseed protein 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.439
 Here you can already see the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.269

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.579
 Let's start with the ingredients of 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.079
 each ingredients each good 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.759
 homemade protein shake needed 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.470
 a basic ingredient is our basic ingredient 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.270
 quark, better said lean quark and 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.100
 lean quark has the advantage that it has a 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.289
 but very low fat content has for it 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.449
 a fairly high proportion of protein 100 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.399
 grams of lean quark contain about 13 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.289
 protein and this protein exists 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.820
 out of about 80 percent casein and casein 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.289
 has a long-term effect is so 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.030
 slowly absorbed by the body slowly 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.579
 used by the body and accordingly 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.190

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.260
 let's start with the 40 to the do we 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.260
 first our container and there comes 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.410
 the whole pieces come in nothing 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.100
 should go wrong and put everything in as 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.579
 next the lean quark there you can 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.849
 quietly do everything in the whole 250 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:35.410

 everything fine and next the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:43.230
 linseed about as a tablespoon says 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.230
 it must have gone something wrong 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:53.489

 We can still do everything we need 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.690
 a little milk for us when it 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.690
 not liquid enough 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.570
 that should be enough 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.730
 and now the lemon is added 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.540

 Of course, with some honey more 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.540
 will sweeten a tablespoon of honey 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.980
 give it that tastes that again 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.780
 bit sweet but in itself 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.940
 really very good if needed 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.960
 a little bit more flaxseed and 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.930
