really<00:05:30.349> seen<00:05:30.560> a<00:05:30.620> whole<00:05:30.860> lot<00:05:30.889> of<00:05:31.099> it<00:05:31.339> and<00:05:31.520> stuff

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
really seen a whole lot of it and stuff

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.070 
really seen a whole lot of it and stuff
on<00:05:31.909> he's<00:05:32.089> been<00:05:32.210> really<00:05:32.449> relying<00:05:32.870> on<00:05:33.050> that

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
on he's been really relying on that

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.350 
on he's been really relying on that
right<00:05:33.379> hand<00:05:33.560> power<00:05:33.860> but<00:05:34.580> he<00:05:34.669> is<00:05:34.819> powerful<00:05:35.089> in

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
right hand power but he is powerful in

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.209 
right hand power but he is powerful in
both<00:05:35.509> hands<00:05:35.779> but<00:05:36.379> I<00:05:36.409> think<00:05:36.740> Taylor's<00:05:36.949> gonna

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219 
both hands but I think Taylor's gonna

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:38.950 
both hands but I think Taylor's gonna
you<00:05:37.520> know<00:05:37.639> neutralize<00:05:38.149> that<00:05:38.180> he's<00:05:38.719> going<00:05:38.899> to

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
you know neutralize that he's going to

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.139 
you know neutralize that he's going to
hold<00:05:39.139> him<00:05:39.199> back<00:05:39.409> with<00:05:39.680> his<00:05:39.889> much<00:05:40.430> better<00:05:40.759> jab

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:41.149 
hold him back with his much better jab

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:44.170 
hold him back with his much better jab
you<00:05:41.659> know<00:05:41.779> his<00:05:41.930> longer<00:05:42.349> jab<00:05:42.529> and<00:05:42.770> stuff<00:05:43.009> on<00:05:43.279> the

only thing I can really see his Lacey

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:49.929 
only thing I can really see his Lacey
could<00:05:45.860> do<00:05:46.039> is<00:05:46.250> a<00:05:46.509> slip<00:05:48.399> Jermaine's<00:05:49.399> jab<00:05:49.729> and

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:49.939 
could do is a slip Jermaine's jab and

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:51.189 
could do is a slip Jermaine's jab and
catch<00:05:50.120> up<00:05:50.270> with<00:05:50.389> his<00:05:50.509> left<00:05:50.750> hook<00:05:50.960> you<00:05:51.169> know

catch up with his left hook you know

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.860 
catch up with his left hook you know
because<00:05:51.680> Jermaine<00:05:52.580> has<00:05:52.849> a<00:05:52.879> tendency<00:05:53.300> of<00:05:53.509> uh

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
because Jermaine has a tendency of uh

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.529 
because Jermaine has a tendency of uh
jackknifed<00:05:54.860> in<00:05:55.039> his<00:05:55.159> jab<00:05:55.399> and<00:05:55.430> also<00:05:55.969> he<00:05:56.389> has<00:05:56.509> a

jackknifed in his jab and also he has a

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.320 
jackknifed in his jab and also he has a
habit<00:05:56.839> of<00:05:57.139> when<00:05:57.560> he<00:05:57.649> jabs<00:05:57.979> he<00:05:58.159> drops<00:05:58.550> his<00:05:59.060> left

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.909 
habit of when he jabs he drops his left
hand<00:05:59.539> so<00:05:59.750> he<00:05:59.899> may<00:06:00.020> be<00:06:00.080> able<00:06:00.259> catch<00:06:00.620> a<00:06:00.800> little

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
catch him like that but it has to be

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.939

good<00:06:05.360> timing<00:06:05.659> you<00:06:06.259> know<00:06:06.409> and<00:06:06.649> that's

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
good timing you know and that's

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:07.839 
good timing you know and that's

Taylor is going to go is going to get a
win<00:06:46.340> by<00:06:46.520> knockout<00:06:46.550> I<00:06:47.060> think<00:06:47.240> he's<00:06:47.330> going<00:06:47.449> to

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:47.539

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:48.850 
win by knockout I think he's going to
knock<00:06:47.659> out<00:06:47.840> lacing<00:06:48.259> that's<00:06:48.409> going<00:06:48.560> to<00:06:48.620> be<00:06:48.740> the

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
knock out lacing that's going to be the

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.980

end of the career Lacey in and then I

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.209 
end of the career Lacey in and then I
think<00:06:51.199> he's<00:06:51.289> going<00:06:51.409> to<00:06:51.469> retire<00:06:51.770> right<00:06:51.979> after
