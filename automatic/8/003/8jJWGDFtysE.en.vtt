00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.059 
is massive and you could go through the
other<00:02:42.480> ones<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:42.989> in<00:02:43.140> my<00:02:43.260> opinion<00:02:43.379> Jupiter's

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
other ones but in my opinion Jupiter's

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.530 
other ones but in my opinion Jupiter's
cock<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.489> way<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.790> go<00:02:45.060> then<00:02:45.330> you're<00:02:45.450> going

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
cock is the way to go then you're going

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.119 
cock is the way to go then you're going
to<00:02:45.599> want<00:02:45.720> Jupiter's<00:02:46.170> locks<00:02:46.440> which<00:02:46.860> costs

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
to want Jupiter's locks which costs

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.550 
to want Jupiter's locks which costs
around<00:02:47.370> 70<00:02:48.060> could<00:02:48.660> go<00:02:48.810> for<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.019> steer<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.379> hell

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
around 70 could go for a steer in hell

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.050 
around 70 could go for a steer in hell
but<00:02:49.739> again<00:02:50.010> i<00:02:50.250> don't<00:02:50.459> think<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.700> upgrades

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
but again i don't think the upgrades

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.610 
but again i don't think the upgrades
that<00:02:51.209> much<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.629> Jupiter's<00:02:52.019> looks<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.530> it

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
that much in Jupiter's looks and it

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.319 
that much in Jupiter's looks and it
looks<00:02:52.799> better<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.370> then<00:02:54.090> you're<00:02:54.180> going<00:02:54.269> to

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
looks better and then you're going to

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.550 
looks better and then you're going to
want<00:02:54.480> flight<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.900> vulture<00:02:55.319> for<00:02:55.470> your

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
want flight of the vulture for your

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.589 
want flight of the vulture for your
torso<00:02:55.799> armor<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:56.579> really<00:02:56.790> really<00:02:57.150> fast<00:02:57.390> at

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
torso armor it's really really fast at

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.699 
torso armor it's really really fast at
rolling<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.200> get<00:02:58.319> a<00:02:58.349> lot<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.530> other

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
rolling and you get a lot of other

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.559 
rolling and you get a lot of other
bonuses<00:02:59.190> and<00:02:59.220> then<00:02:59.760> again<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.329> want<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
bonuses and then again you want the

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.660 
bonuses and then again you want the
battle<00:03:00.870> proven<00:03:01.230> grief<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.459> could

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
battle proven grief so you could

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.309 
battle proven grief so you could
actually<00:03:02.790> go<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.150> solid<00:03:03.569> iron<00:03:03.690> Greaves<00:03:04.049> but

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
actually go for solid iron Greaves but

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.660 
actually go for solid iron Greaves but
it's<00:03:04.440> just<00:03:04.620> not<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:04.799> much<00:03:05.129> of<00:03:05.340> an<00:03:05.430> increase

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
it's just not that much of an increase

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.430 
it's just not that much of an increase
again<00:03:05.910> for<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.420> money<00:03:06.599> are<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.109> in<00:03:07.230> my<00:03:07.349> opinion

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
again for the money are so in my opinion

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.110 
again for the money are so in my opinion
definitely<00:03:08.160> go<00:03:08.250> for<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.459> battle<00:03:08.760> proven

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120

range again so you just need to get away

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.050 
range again so you just need to get away
from<00:04:28.650> them<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.160> then<00:04:29.250> try<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.490> control<00:04:29.790> them
