00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
hi in this tutorial we're going to talk

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.490 
hi in this tutorial we're going to talk
about<00:00:10.670> making<00:00:11.150> a<00:00:11.240> watermark

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
about making a watermark

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.170 
about making a watermark
on<00:00:12.560> a<00:00:12.620> photo<00:00:12.950> that<00:00:13.250> you<00:00:13.280> export<00:00:13.970> from

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
on a photo that you export from

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.660 
on a photo that you export from
Lightroom<00:00:14.630> 4<00:00:14.900> so<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:15.920> first<00:00:16.160> step<00:00:16.309> would<00:00:16.610> be

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
Lightroom 4 so the first step would be

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.990 
Lightroom 4 so the first step would be
to<00:00:16.880> make<00:00:17.450> your<00:00:17.690> logo<00:00:18.170> and<00:00:18.470> to<00:00:19.130> have<00:00:19.340> it<00:00:19.369> be<00:00:19.700> on<00:00:19.970> a

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000

to make your logo and to have it be on a
transparent<00:00:20.930> background<00:00:21.080> you<00:00:21.740> could<00:00:21.890> do<00:00:22.099> this

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
transparent background you could do this

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.080 
transparent background you could do this
as<00:00:22.520> a<00:00:22.550> PNG<00:00:22.970> file<00:00:23.510> and<00:00:24.099> once<00:00:25.099> that's<00:00:25.279> made<00:00:25.670> I'll

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
as a PNG file and once that's made I'll

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.570 
as a PNG file and once that's made I'll
I<00:00:26.210> have<00:00:26.330> to<00:00:26.450> do<00:00:26.570> is<00:00:26.720> select<00:00:26.990> a<00:00:27.170> photo<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.770> then

it<00:01:05.270> to<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.600> screen<00:01:05.720> where<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.140> makes<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.500> large

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
it to the screen where it makes it large

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.920 
it to the screen where it makes it large
and<00:01:06.979> fit<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:07.250> all<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.430> way<00:01:07.520> across<00:01:07.750> you<00:01:08.750> could

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
and fit it all the way across you could

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.240 
and fit it all the way across you could
choose<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.229> fill<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:09.619> where<00:01:09.770> makes<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.070> really

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
choose to fill it where makes a really

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.359 
choose to fill it where makes a really
large<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:10.850> fills<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.450> entire<00:01:11.509> area<00:01:12.190> or<00:01:13.190> we

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
large and fills the entire area or we

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.830 
large and fills the entire area or we
can<00:01:13.520> make<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:13.789> proportional<00:01:14.360> which<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.600> think

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
can make it proportional which I think

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.070 
can make it proportional which I think
makes<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.110> most<00:01:15.229> sense<00:01:15.470> for<00:01:16.009> adding<00:01:16.549> it<00:01:16.670> to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
makes the most sense for adding it to

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.469 
makes the most sense for adding it to
all<00:01:18.080> of<00:01:18.140> your<00:01:18.439> images<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:19.460> here<00:01:20.090> i<00:01:20.119> chose

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
all of your images and here i chose

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.510 
all of your images and here i chose
thirty<00:01:20.869> one<00:01:21.110> percent<00:01:21.140> but<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:21.890> could<00:01:22.070> choose

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
thirty one percent but you could choose

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.780 
thirty one percent but you could choose
larger<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:25.729> then<00:01:26.689> a<00:01:26.990> little<00:01:27.350> lower<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:28.549> can

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
larger and then a little lower you can

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.789 
larger and then a little lower you can
even<00:01:29.090> adjust<00:01:29.450> these<00:01:29.810> sliders<00:01:30.170> to<00:01:30.500> move<00:01:30.650> it

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
even adjust these sliders to move it

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.660 
even adjust these sliders to move it
left<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.250> right<00:01:32.080> or<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.830> slider<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.340> move<00:01:34.520> it

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
left and right or the slider to move it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.310 
left and right or the slider to move it
up<00:01:34.759> or<00:01:34.909> down<00:01:35.290> and<00:01:37.240> these<00:01:38.240> little<00:01:38.570> boxes<00:01:38.810> make

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
up or down and these little boxes make

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.780 
up or down and these little boxes make
it<00:01:39.500> real<00:01:39.710> handy<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.250> move<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:40.549> in<00:01:40.670> two

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
it real handy to move it in two

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.420 
it real handy to move it in two
different<00:01:41.000> locations<00:01:41.180> top<00:01:42.140> right<00:01:42.500> top<00:01:43.100> left

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
different locations top right top left

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.719 
different locations top right top left
center<00:01:44.210> bottom<00:01:44.840> right<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:46.280> one<00:01:46.520> will

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
center bottom right and this one will

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.260 
center bottom right and this one will
make<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:47.180> once<00:01:47.479> a<00:01:47.810> bottom<00:01:48.350> right<00:01:49.220> and<00:01:49.670> then

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
make this once a bottom right and then

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.550 
make this once a bottom right and then
when<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:50.509> think<00:01:50.720> you've<00:01:50.840> got<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.079> all<00:01:51.290> right

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
when you think you've got it all right

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.310

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
you just click save as a preset and you

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.630 
you just click save as a preset and you
give<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.680> name<00:01:54.920> I'll<00:01:55.369> call<00:01:55.610> this<00:01:55.790> one<00:01:56.060> GCC

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
give it a name I'll call this one GCC

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:06.190
