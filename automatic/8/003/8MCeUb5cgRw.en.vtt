 the latest games at 4k resolutions with 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.590
 adjustments to the maximum and are interested in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.690
 virtual reality must be said that no 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.420
 to throw the current games does not 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.600
 missing so much card or graphics but 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.150
 as I said those who want 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.010
 4k resolutions no 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.340
 according to the purchase data of the 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.730
 own company the gtx 980 ti can 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.220
 running games like battlefield 4 and 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.340
 shadows of biting to 4k and maximum adjustments 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:15.050
 at 60 fps is the goal with a 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.050
 configuration very high at 31.6 fps or of 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.210
 widget 3 also to 4k not with settings not 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:25.390
 specified not at 45 fps 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.380
 to get this not to the gtx 980 ti 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:33.909
 makes use of a maxwell core of 200 gm 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:37.990
 trimmed with two thousand 816 cuda corts and 6 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.180
 gb of memory gddr5 to 7 gigahertz a 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.610
 normal clock frequency of one thousand mega 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.140
 hertz and a turbo of thousand 76 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.140
 megahertz 176 texture units and 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.750
 996 groups its consumption is 250 watts and 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.009
 At least one source of 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.259
 600 watts 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.610
 so remember that it will have a price 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:04.000
 of exit of 649 dollars and the gtx 980 in 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.160
 the previous one will go down to 499 dollars so 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.380
 the truth is that it is good at a price 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.370
 quite inferior to what would be a 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.560
 titan x what is a thousand dollars like that 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.989
 good who wants to get hold of it 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.610
 you know, a hug comes out 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.000
 lake and favorites and see you in the 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.000
