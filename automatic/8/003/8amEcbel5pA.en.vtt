and basically what it does is it helps
to<00:01:22.170> provide<00:01:22.470> some<00:01:22.710> acoustic<00:01:23.189> isolation

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
to provide some acoustic isolation

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.870 
to provide some acoustic isolation
around<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.780> microphone<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:26.070> prevents<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
around your microphone that prevents the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
around your microphone that prevents the
reflections<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:27.930> happening<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
reflections that are happening in the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
reflections that are happening in the
room<00:01:28.890> from<00:01:29.700> negatively<00:01:30.420> impacting<00:01:30.840> your

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
room from negatively impacting your

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.469 
room from negatively impacting your
recording<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.030> does<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
recording now what this does is it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.270 
recording now what this does is it
mounts<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> end<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.350> boom<00:01:34.530> stand<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.250> a

has a couple of components it's got

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.510 
has a couple of components it's got
acoustic<00:01:46.110> foam<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> inside<00:01:46.649> which<00:01:47.250> helps

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
acoustic foam on the inside which helps

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.969 
acoustic foam on the inside which helps
to<00:01:47.640> absorb<00:01:47.759> those<00:01:48.630> reflections<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.500> dead<00:01:49.799> in

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
to absorb those reflections and dead in

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.420 
to absorb those reflections and dead in
the<00:01:50.369> area<00:01:51.240> around<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> mic<00:01:52.049> now<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the area around the mic now on the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.990 
the area around the mic now on the
outside<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:55.140> has<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.320> plastic<00:01:55.770> shell<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
outside it has a plastic shell now the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880 
outside it has a plastic shell now the
reason<00:01:57.270> why<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.290> prime<00:01:58.500> acoustic

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
reason why I like the prime acoustic

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.709 
reason why I like the prime acoustic
product<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.460> you<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.149> there's<00:02:00.360> obviously<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
likelihood maybe to $3,000 mics so if

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.430 
likelihood maybe to $3,000 mics so if

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
you drop that it's a it's a big hazard

you drop that it's a it's a big hazard
destroys<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.099> mic<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.360> thing<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.660> like

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
destroys the mic so the thing I like

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.350 
destroys the mic so the thing I like

with<00:02:47.790> some<00:02:47.940> manufacturers<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.780> they<00:02:49.590> because

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
with some manufacturers is they because

acoustic<00:03:00.000> has<00:03:00.120> addressed<00:03:00.440> if<00:03:01.440> we<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.739> go

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
acoustic has addressed if we just go

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.009 
acoustic has addressed if we just go
around<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.099> back<00:03:02.340> you'll<00:03:03.180> see<00:03:03.239> they<00:03:03.840> have

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
around the back you'll see they have

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.650 
around the back you'll see they have
vents<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:05.069> are<00:03:05.190> cut<00:03:05.489> into<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.030> plastic<00:03:06.420> and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
vents that are cut into the plastic and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.140 
vents that are cut into the plastic and
what<00:03:07.110> these<00:03:07.230> vents<00:03:07.590> do<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:07.920> they<00:03:08.069> allow<00:03:08.280> some

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
what these vents do is they allow some

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.750 
what these vents do is they allow some
of<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.360> frequencies<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.870> escape<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.980> they

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
of the frequencies to escape and they

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.089 
of the frequencies to escape and they
don't<00:03:11.940> build<00:03:12.150> up<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.510> cause<00:03:12.660> unnecessary<00:03:13.530> and

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
don't build up and cause unnecessary and

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.490 
don't build up and cause unnecessary and
undesired<00:03:14.519> resonation<00:03:15.000> within<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.959> shell<00:03:16.260> of

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
undesired resonation within the shell of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.319 
undesired resonation within the shell of
the<00:03:16.920> reflection<00:03:17.670> filter<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:19.609> would<00:03:20.609> and

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
the reflection filter so I would and

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.240 
the reflection filter so I would and
again<00:03:21.570> these<00:03:21.720> are<00:03:21.780> not<00:03:21.900> very<00:03:22.200> expensive

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
again these are not very expensive

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.509 
again these are not very expensive
they're<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:24.239> over<00:03:24.420> 100<00:03:24.720> bucks<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.109> I<00:03:25.859> would

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
they're just over 100 bucks and I would

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.610 
they're just over 100 bucks and I would
highly<00:03:27.000> recommend<00:03:27.049> picking<00:03:28.049> one<00:03:28.170> up<00:03:28.380> if<00:03:28.530> you

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
highly recommend picking one up if you

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.930 
highly recommend picking one up if you
