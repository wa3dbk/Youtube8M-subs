00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
thought I might explain to you what does
materials<00:00:22.730> texture<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.939> bump<00:00:24.269> Maps<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.960> okay

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
materials texture and bump Maps do okay

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.429 
materials texture and bump Maps do okay
so<00:00:26.460> let's<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:27.150> moving<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:28.019> now<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> have

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
so let's get moving so right now I have

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
so let's get moving so right now I have
the<00:00:28.769> text<00:00:29.130> track<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.730> as<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.150> see<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> do

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the text track and as you can see I do

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.319 
the text track and as you can see I do
not<00:00:30.630> see<00:00:30.900> these<00:00:31.109> options<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:32.579> reason<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.120> it

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
not see these options the reason is it

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.910 
not see these options the reason is it
only<00:00:33.450> works<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.700> objects<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.840> let's<00:00:37.020> create<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
only works on objects so let's create a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.880 
only works on objects so let's create a
text<00:00:38.489> extruded<00:00:39.300> text<00:00:39.600> track<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.079> you're

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
text extruded text track and you're

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.069 
text extruded text track and you're
saying<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:42.000> said<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.480> won't<00:00:42.629> work<00:00:42.930> on

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
saying you just said it won't work on

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.680 
saying you just said it won't work on
text<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.100> correct<00:00:44.309> because

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
text and that is correct because

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.410 
text and that is correct because
extruded<00:00:45.690> text<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.950> actually<00:00:47.430> an<00:00:47.520> object<00:00:47.640> I'm

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
extruded text is actually an object I'm

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.950 
extruded text is actually an object I'm
gonna<00:00:48.570> write<00:00:48.840> take<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.530> such<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> way<00:00:50.960> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
gonna write take this in such a way that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.990 
gonna write take this in such a way that
you<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:52.920> bit<00:00:53.129> better<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you can see it a little bit better as I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.760 
you can see it a little bit better as I
apply<00:00:54.300> these<00:00:54.449> different<00:00:54.690> effects<00:00:55.320> okay

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
apply these different effects okay

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.160 
apply these different effects okay
little<00:00:56.100> bit<00:00:56.190> okay<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.030> now<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.930> look

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
little bit okay so now I have it look

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
little bit okay so now I have it look
materials<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:58.949> map<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.399> texture<00:00:59.910> so<00:00:59.940> let's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
materials but map and texture so let's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.950 
materials but map and texture so let's
go<00:01:00.750> into<00:01:01.079> materials<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> materials<00:01:03.750> well

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
go into materials what is materials well

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.420 
go into materials what is materials well
very<00:01:04.170> simple<00:01:04.909> what<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.689> object<00:01:07.430> made

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
very simple what is this object made

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.070 
very simple what is this object made
from<00:01:08.460> well<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.060> says<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.810> object

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
from well it says here that this object

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.340 
from well it says here that this object
is<00:01:10.500> plastic<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.909> there<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.200> what

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
is plastic so there you go that is what

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.380 
is plastic so there you go that is what
materials<00:01:13.890> are<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.760> different<00:01:15.060> options

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
materials are I have different options

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.810 
materials are I have different options
of<00:01:16.080> changing<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.040> gold

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
so let's do the same thing again apply a

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.289 
so let's do the same thing again apply a
gold<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:01.409> now<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.070> applied<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.969> everything

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
gold and now it applied to everything

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.109 
gold and now it applied to everything
because<00:02:03.659> I've<00:02:04.020> only<00:02:04.140> got<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.380> face<00:02:05.219> okay<00:02:06.060> so

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
because I've only got one face okay so

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.359 
because I've only got one face okay so
that's<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.630> does<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.129> can

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that's what it does and then I can

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.029 
that's what it does and then I can
change<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.030> different<00:02:09.179> colors<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:10.170> my<00:02:10.770> gold

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
change the different colors of my gold

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.740 
change the different colors of my gold
the<00:02:11.790> intensity<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> shine<00:02:12.900> is

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750

I've<00:02:35.620> only<00:02:35.740> applied<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.280> gall<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.700> front

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
I've only applied the gall to the front

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.000 
I've only applied the gall to the front
and<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.360> side<00:02:37.480> well<00:02:38.320> look<00:02:38.470> what<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.620> can<00:02:38.830> do

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
and to the side well look what I can do

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.710 
and to the side well look what I can do
see<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.550> bevel<00:02:39.850> track<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.360> can<00:02:40.600> actually

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
see the bevel track I can actually

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.000 
see the bevel track I can actually
delete<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.440> track<00:02:41.770> as<00:02:41.920> well<00:02:42.130> what's<00:02:43.030> this

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
delete that track as well what's this

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.410 
delete that track as well what's this
now<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.040> don't<00:02:45.250> actually<00:02:45.490> have<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.120> bevel

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
now I don't actually have the bevel

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.850 
now I don't actually have the bevel
track<00:02:46.630> it's<00:02:46.780> gone<00:02:46.990> so<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.320> have<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.530> little<00:02:47.709> bit

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
track it's gone so I have a little bit

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.370 
track it's gone so I have a little bit
more<00:02:48.010> control<00:02:48.490> I<00:02:48.880> can<00:02:49.060> control<00:02:49.420> my<00:02:49.600> object<00:02:49.990> a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
more control I can control my object a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.170 
more control I can control my object a
little<00:02:50.410> bit<00:02:51.130> more<00:02:51.310> if<00:02:51.490> that's<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.760> effect<00:02:52.030> I'm

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
little bit more if that's the effect I'm

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.680 
little bit more if that's the effect I'm
after

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
after

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.900 
after
well<00:02:52.870> that's<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.350> I've<00:02:53.500> done<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.890> okay<00:02:54.459> and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
well that's it I've done it okay and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.790 
well that's it I've done it okay and
there<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.720> go<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.620> said<00:02:56.680> before

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
there you go and like I said before

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.840 
there you go and like I said before
these<00:02:57.459> controls<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:59.650> how<00:02:59.890> much<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.550> want

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
these controls is how much you want

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.230 
these controls is how much you want
color<00:03:01.180> charting<00:03:01.930> this<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.440> reflectiveness

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
color charting this and reflectiveness

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.100 
color charting this and reflectiveness
okay<00:03:04.240> and<00:03:04.480> that's<00:03:04.600> it

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
okay and that's it

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.460 
okay and that's it
that's<00:03:05.350> what<00:03:06.660> materials<00:03:07.660> do<00:03:07.930> I'm<00:03:08.170> gonna<00:03:08.290> go

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
that's what materials do I'm gonna go

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.580 
that's what materials do I'm gonna go
change<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.010> all<00:03:09.100> back<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.840> plastic<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.320> can

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
change it all back to plastic so we can

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.850 
change it all back to plastic so we can
follow<00:03:11.770> it<00:03:11.980> easier<00:03:12.370> for<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.670> next<00:03:12.880> tab<00:03:13.770> mmm

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
follow it easier for the next tab mmm

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.160 
follow it easier for the next tab mmm
textures<00:03:15.370> here<00:03:15.550> we<00:03:15.640> go<00:03:15.730> all<00:03:16.420> right<00:03:16.600> textures

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
textures here we go all right textures

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.970 
textures here we go all right textures
again<00:03:18.070> as<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.400> can<00:03:18.519> see<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.910> have<00:03:19.120> four<00:03:19.390> tabs

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
again as you can see I have four tabs

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.410 
again as you can see I have four tabs
but<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.280> works<00:03:21.519> in<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.760> slightly<00:03:22.090> reverse

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
but this it works in a slightly reverse

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.210 
but this it works in a slightly reverse
I<00:03:22.570> can't<00:03:22.810> delete<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.410> texture<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:23.890> I<00:03:23.920> can<00:03:24.100> only

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
I can't delete the texture so I can only

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.880 
I can't delete the texture so I can only
add<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.209> got<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.660> face<00:03:25.959> count<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.380> four<00:03:26.620> so

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
add it so I got a face count of four so

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.560 
add it so I got a face count of four so
therefore<00:03:27.280> again<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.519> have<00:03:27.790> four<00:03:28.000> tracks<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.510> I

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
therefore again I have four tracks and I

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.870 
therefore again I have four tracks and I
can<00:03:28.720> also<00:03:28.870> make<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.320> one<00:03:29.560> whatever<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.370> do<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:30.640> can

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
can also make it one whatever I do I can

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.210 
can also make it one whatever I do I can
apply<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.420> whole<00:03:31.630> object<00:03:32.500> all<00:03:32.650> parts<00:03:33.130> of

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
apply to the whole object all parts of

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.130 
apply to the whole object all parts of
the<00:03:33.280> object<00:03:33.400> I'm<00:03:34.180> gonna<00:03:34.360> leave<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.720> at<00:03:34.810> four

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
the object I'm gonna leave it at four

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.600 
the object I'm gonna leave it at four
I'm<00:03:35.709> gonna<00:03:35.890> show<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.190> something<00:03:36.370> I'm<00:03:36.550> gonna

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
open up crypts there is my word text now

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.789 
open up crypts there is my word text now
if<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.350> turn<00:03:41.350> it<00:03:41.560> on<00:03:41.650> by<00:03:41.860> price<00:03:42.160> placing<00:03:42.760> an<00:03:42.850> X

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
if I turn it on by price placing an X

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.090 
if I turn it on by price placing an X
wallah<00:03:44.799> I<00:03:45.100> suddenly<00:03:45.549> have<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.510> new<00:03:47.100> texture

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
wallah I suddenly have a new texture

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.220 
wallah I suddenly have a new texture

go now I have four new media tracks in

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.460 
go now I have four new media tracks in
my<00:03:56.560> timeline<00:03:56.830> so<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.910> is<00:03:58.150> oh<00:03:58.510> sorry<00:03:59.380> about

object<00:04:08.799> I'm<00:04:09.580> gonna<00:04:09.760> go<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.299> first<00:04:10.570> one<00:04:10.900> so

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
object I'm gonna go to the first one so

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.180 
object I'm gonna go to the first one so
this<00:04:11.140> is<00:04:11.410> front<00:04:11.769> texture<00:04:12.750> left<00:04:13.750> click<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.410> I

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
this is front texture left click and I

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.940 
this is front texture left click and I
can<00:04:15.459> add<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.670> natural<00:04:16.000> media<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.169> us<00:04:17.320> here<00:04:17.709> we<00:04:17.799> go

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
can add a natural media to us here we go

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.550 
can add a natural media to us here we go
natural<00:04:18.430> media<00:04:18.760> and<00:04:19.030> by<00:04:19.570> default<00:04:19.810> it's<00:04:20.260> always

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
natural media and by default it's always

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.950 
natural media and by default it's always
the<00:04:20.739> wood<00:04:20.979> cried<00:04:21.370> so<00:04:22.000> now<00:04:22.210> I've<00:04:22.390> added<00:04:22.599> what

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.700 
the wood cried so now I've added what
grind<00:04:23.229> to<00:04:23.349> the<00:04:23.410> front<00:04:23.740> if<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:24.430> go<00:04:24.610> back<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:24.970> grips

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
grind to the front if I go back to grips

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.220 
grind to the front if I go back to grips
I'm<00:04:26.710> still<00:04:27.190> in<00:04:27.280> my<00:04:27.370> texture<00:04:27.789> try

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
I'm still in my texture try

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.370 
I'm still in my texture try
go<00:04:29.230> to<00:04:29.290> one<00:04:29.650> now<00:04:30.460> I've<00:04:30.639> applied<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.389> all<00:04:31.570> of

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
go back into my texture track like I

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.960 
go back into my texture track like I
said<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:46.690> can<00:04:46.870> change<00:04:47.560> this<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:48.160> each<00:04:48.580> one<00:04:48.850> of

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
said I can change this to each one of

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.790 
said I can change this to each one of
them<00:04:49.090> or<00:04:49.210> just<00:04:49.270> one<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.780> them<00:04:49.960> it's<00:04:50.260> up<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.590> you

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
and I can also add a movie file so let's

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.980 
and I can also add a movie file so let's
do<00:04:53.680> that

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
do that

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.180

file

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.540 
file
I'll<00:04:58.240> move<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.630> ctrl<00:04:59.230> R<00:04:59.500> and<00:04:59.800> you<00:04:59.889> can<00:05:00.070> see<00:05:00.280> the

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
I'll move the ctrl R and you can see the

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.030 
I'll move the ctrl R and you can see the
little<00:05:00.669> movie<00:05:00.930> only<00:05:01.930> playing<00:05:02.350> remember<00:05:02.950> this

movie fast would be boring so I'm going

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.000 
movie fast would be boring so I'm going
to<00:05:24.040> uncheck<00:05:24.250> all<00:05:25.090> of<00:05:25.150> these<00:05:25.540> because<00:05:26.290> I<00:05:26.470> don't

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
to uncheck all of these because I don't

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.830 
to uncheck all of these because I don't
want<00:05:27.220> any<00:05:27.460> different<00:05:28.090> type<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.450> texture

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
want any different type of texture

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.379 
want any different type of texture
occurs<00:05:29.080> I'm<00:05:29.530> gonna<00:05:29.770> go<00:05:29.919> to<00:05:29.979> the<00:05:30.490> bump<00:05:30.880> map

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
occurs I'm gonna go to the bump map

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.420 
occurs I'm gonna go to the bump map
alright<00:05:31.990> now<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.200> button<00:05:32.740> map<00:05:32.919> is<00:05:33.160> very

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
alright now the button map is very

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.659 
alright now the button map is very
interesting<00:05:34.000> it's<00:05:34.720> kind<00:05:35.140> of<00:05:35.320> like<00:05:35.669> the

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
interesting it's kind of like the

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.940 
interesting it's kind of like the
materials<00:05:37.360> where<00:05:37.840> I'm<00:05:37.930> going<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.140> change<00:05:38.500> what

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
materials where I'm going to change what

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.550 
materials where I'm going to change what
is<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.340> object<00:05:39.490> made<00:05:39.940> from<00:05:40.210> or<00:05:40.630> more<00:05:41.440> or<00:05:41.530> less

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
is the object made from or more or less

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.980 
is the object made from or more or less
I'm<00:05:41.830> gonna<00:05:41.979> apply<00:05:42.460> different<00:05:43.330> materials<00:05:43.810> on

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
I'm gonna apply different materials on

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.710 
I'm gonna apply different materials on
the<00:05:44.440> object<00:05:44.890> itself<00:05:45.340> and<00:05:45.729> why<00:05:46.180> is<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.419> called<00:05:46.570> a

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
the object itself and why is it called a

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.750 
the object itself and why is it called a
bump<00:05:46.990> map<00:05:47.200> well<00:05:47.919> I<00:05:47.950> can<00:05:48.310> only<00:05:48.430> conclude

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
bump map well I can only conclude

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.000 
bump map well I can only conclude
because<00:05:49.479> when<00:05:49.720> I<00:05:49.750> add<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.260> materials<00:05:50.710> to<00:05:50.890> it

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
because when I add the materials to it

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.670 
because when I add the materials to it
or<00:05:51.130> the<00:05:51.460> bump<00:05:51.789> it's<00:05:52.360> bumpy<00:05:52.930> why<00:05:53.169> because<00:05:53.530> it's

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
or the bump it's bumpy why because it's

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
or the bump it's bumpy why because it's
in<00:05:53.830> 3d

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
in 3d

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.730 
in 3d
alright<00:05:55.419> same<00:05:55.690> thing<00:05:55.990> you<00:05:56.200> need<00:05:56.320> to<00:05:56.440> highlight

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
alright same thing you need to highlight

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.850 
alright same thing you need to highlight
it<00:05:57.039> so<00:05:57.070> let's<00:05:57.430> do<00:05:57.580> that<00:05:57.640> and<00:05:58.169> as<00:05:59.169> you<00:05:59.289> can<00:05:59.410> see<00:05:59.680> I

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
it so let's do that and as you can see I

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.240 
it so let's do that and as you can see I
have<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:00.280> word<00:06:00.430> rock<00:06:00.850> here<00:06:01.120> so<00:06:01.360> my<00:06:01.750> type<00:06:02.110> of

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
have the word rock here so my type of

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
reptilian yeah even that it looks like a

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.050 
reptilian yeah even that it looks like a
flat<00:06:19.600> file<00:06:19.810> but<00:06:19.990> trust<00:06:20.289> me<00:06:20.380> that<00:06:20.910> actually<00:06:21.910> is

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
flat file but trust me that actually is

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.180 
flat file but trust me that actually is
depth<00:06:22.479> in<00:06:22.660> that<00:06:22.710> but<00:06:23.710> Rock<00:06:24.400> I<00:06:24.550> used<00:06:25.770> my<00:06:26.770> neon

brick is another one you know rock is
very<00:06:29.890> easy<00:06:30.610> to<00:06:30.760> use<00:06:31.120> to<00:06:31.150> demonstrate<00:06:31.870> what

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
very easy to use to demonstrate what

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.310 
very easy to use to demonstrate what
bump<00:06:33.370> Maps<00:06:33.729> is<00:06:34.000> and<00:06:34.240> again<00:06:34.479> the<00:06:34.660> same<00:06:34.870> thing<00:06:35.110> I

bump Maps is and again the same thing I
can<00:06:35.500> make<00:06:35.530> it<00:06:35.800> all<00:06:36.070> of<00:06:36.220> it<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:37.900> not<00:06:38.440> that<00:06:38.590> I

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
can make it all of it and not that I

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.990 
can make it all of it and not that I
would<00:06:38.890> because<00:06:39.070> it<00:06:39.190> looks<00:06:39.370> it<00:06:39.700> looks<00:06:39.729> like

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
would because it looks it looks like

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.910 
would because it looks it looks like
really<00:06:40.780> shitty<00:06:41.080> elf<00:06:41.380> or

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
really shitty elf or

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.770 
to ransom letter something anyway and
I'm<00:06:45.310> back<00:06:45.460> to<00:06:45.490> for<00:06:45.820> countin<00:06:46.240> and<00:06:46.510> the<00:06:46.600> same

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
to the different face count so I can

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.850 
to the different face count so I can
have<00:06:52.420> rock<00:06:52.630> on<00:06:52.780> one<00:06:52.960> and<00:06:53.230> reptilian<00:06:53.560> on<00:06:53.740> the
