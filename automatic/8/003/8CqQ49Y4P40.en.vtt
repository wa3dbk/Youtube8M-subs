00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.219
 let's talk about days on the quality of service 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.979
 i in the presentation 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.979
 there are a little lyrics but too small 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:14.559
 it is not true that says the quality 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.999
 or the race for quality 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.300
 has no goals 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.099
 and that's absolutely true, look 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.699
 ac 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.489
 more than 60 years 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.800
 an economist 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.960
 called Robert e 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.420
 at that time when the quality of service 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.140
 it was not essential 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.170
 because you will understand 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.040
 that there has been a moment 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.940
 in the world 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.860
 in which 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.980
 there was no competition 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.580
 that exists today there was not a concept 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.330
 or thing like that is not even dreamed of something like globalization 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.530
 and at that time Mr. Robert Kelley 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.540
 said the following 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.430
 you have to pass it 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.520
 he said soon it will be true because that is important before starting the talk 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.220
 Soon it will be true 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.210
 that all activity of the corporation 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.409
 from finance to sales production and as they called him in 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.210
 that time production of sales 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 will address the satisfaction of needs 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.990
 and the consumer's wishes 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.280
 Actually, at that time there was no 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.190
 that concept 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.550
 of service quality to meet needs and so on 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.380
 when this stage of development is reached 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
 the marketing revolution will be over 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.799
 talked about the marketing revolution a new concept 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.890
 and so 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.350
 All this 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.000
 we start adada some light is the first of them 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.100
 is that before there was the concept of quality of service 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.930
 by the way there was no 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.390
 that direction that lived there 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.570
 in what is the marketing plan in what is marketing and hospitality that 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.200
 what the quality of service 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.630
 which is to be directed towards meeting the needs of the people 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:10.829
 in all that 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:14.049
 he was absolutely right where he got it wrong 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.909
 because there was not 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.349
 the technology that exists today 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.249
 was that he said when zp development was reached the marketing revolution 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.339
 it will be over 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.209
 and that ibi to all of us we know what it is 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.889
 it's not true 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.979
 which is a concept 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:38.979
 it is not true that we in gold can apply the quality of service does not have 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:39.809
 today 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:45.739
 limits if every day we push more and more and in all this starts us 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.259
 edar technology 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.350
 but to be quality of service 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.710
 there is also another concept that I want to share with you and that I want 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.489
 reading it 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.819
 why 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.339
 It is very important to you and most of you students 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.319
 when they finish their careers 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.799
 when they come to work and go with new lights go with new ideas 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.319
 go with that desire to transform things are going to find 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.409
 the next one they will find 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.569
 with the following concept 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.429
 the real difficulty of changing the course of a company 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:26.989
 does not lie in the creation of new ideas without escaping the old 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.839
 this was said by the president of visa 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.359
 and the biggest problem to do quality of service in a company 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.709
 is not in you is not out 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.529
 instantly entered from the same workers 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.369
 Quickening that things do not change 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:52.369
 after so many years one gets involved in an iker job and that it does well 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:54.019
 things believe 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.109
 and often neglects 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.219
 all those new things that we are learning every day 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.030
 then it is important to know 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.169
 that you will find to do quality of service 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.169
 in a company where it is often difficult 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.570
 all these issues 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.959
 following 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.899
 and we are going to talk about what marketing and hospitality is about 

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.579
 what the quality of service 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.289
 and I want to tell you that the quality of service and I gave marketing and 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.569
 hospitality 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.569
 it's a whole philosophy is a concept 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:31.609
 way of doing things
