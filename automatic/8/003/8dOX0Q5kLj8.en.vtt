00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.449
 october minecraft has left for 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.730
 playstation vita gentlemen what so much 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.080
 we wait, may we already have it and 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.120
 Well then this video of it in the 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.129
 gameplay and also let them know by 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.930
 what do not upload the videos by the way 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.239
 recently the prison has been crossed 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.129
 half and it admits subjects that can 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.140
 modify the entire menu as you can see 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.270
 I'm fine, I have this 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.100
 has a different background song that 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.600
 at least if you know three schools now 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.790
 well let's see what the video is coming 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.760
 here we have what is minecraft for 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.369
 playstation vita as you can see say it 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.840
 with the first being the cover and good 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.890
 for those who have doubt this game 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.140
 I think it will be on October 15 for 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.390
 Europe and then the 14 already left for 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.710
 america on this occasion about how much 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.920
 weigh 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.340
 with a problem between 170 mb enough 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.230
 well I think it 's good about the micro in 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.360
 addictions 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.710
 to see how much the video game and how 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.020
 can see nothing else we will see the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.590
 descriptions and it comes about the kind of 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.570
 no more weapons 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.409
 and much more, because we are not going to 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.810
 seeing the good unfortunately came to them 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.630
 because they report that I no longer have 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.819
 computer me to follow also what 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.789
 I feel this and that's why I raised myself 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.009
 videos in two months I hope you can 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.899
 understand you also want to upload a 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.270
 video to explain the reasons but to 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.979
 the time you want to upload a video with this 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.289
 game that the truth is highly anticipated 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.920
 between the playstation vita users and 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.830
 Well, gentlemen, I think this video 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.020
 one of the few that I will upload but 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.330
 I'm praying for a new pc and I think 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.380
 that this year does not happen when I have my 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.940
 new pc and thing to come back with the videos 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.010
 also because he just started the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.720
 ipp high school or as you can see already 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.150
 we have a clearer life decision 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.160
 style that we have here is us 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.620
 saying about the saved car and then 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.990
 well we can install after packs of 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.100
 textures and all that I remind you of the 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.650
 version to minecraft to be able to facilitate 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.870
 is exactly the same as the version of 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.830
 playstation 3 I also have to tell you 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.640
 that if they buy the version for 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.830
 Playstation 3 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.690
 they have free visit right in 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.690
 buy the brazil to the production half 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.520
 and if they have the 433 decision it's going to cost 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.370
 least acquire it for a professional or 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.590
 publications and in the same way we can 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.410
 install new packages and textures 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.570
 steve among those things the controls are 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.220
 we also have the open world 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:12.670
 all equal to three times the song 11 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.280
 play a game with take out new world 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.230
 so I say I would leave it the same 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.020
 here we have what the paper can see 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.209
 of textures the difficulty we are going to create 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.890
 the world to not last long because of 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.290
 that I will not be this video is because 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.489
 I do not have to psd the voice and see if cuba and 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.920
 Well, as you can see 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.110
 quality has improved a lot / well to 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.790
 that I have acquired a new phone and 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.170
 well, as you can see here we are 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.459
 As you can see, it's pretty fluid 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.370
 the latest women studies that was 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.160
 I started silvera much I would propel me 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.690
 pretty slow I think it gives 20 fps and as 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.550
 can see in may they mess it up 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.980
 fluid in this case is loading the 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.340
 map and appeared a kind of snowy 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.350
 with a forest there and well, what else 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.269
 can i say about mike to the controls 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.590
 they are quite simple and for those who do not 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.470
 know this game is a game of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.390
 survival and creativity in this case 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.880
 let's start do not be winning the wood 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.860
 the wood is for with the button ere or 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.410
 rather it breaks and control 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.160
 we will approach then we take it 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.560
 in the case that we want 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.019
 in this case go down to earth in the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.000
 case we want to put on the floor 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.220
 to build on the arrows we move 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.400
 between the inventory and with the l 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.410
 we put as you can see that simple 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.930
 We open the menu with the triangle button and 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.490
 as you can see there we have to steve this 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.010
 exactly the same we can put the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.650
 armor terms comment here between 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.780
 those things and well in this case 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.550
 Let's take a little wood 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.250
 to do some odd things 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.490
 we also have to observe what 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.680
 is the rustle between those things all 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.230
 exactly the same gentlemen the truth that 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.400
 I already expected this game in fact I 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.680
 like it a lot because of what the 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.650
 creativity and survival I like 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.180
 much sent me a lot on the pc and then 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.460
 well let's see with precision half 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.310
 what better than having the version of 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.260
 portable playstation 3 here we have to 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.900
 arena and well as the mission is 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.090
 exactly the same we run giving to the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.690
 lever twice just like a 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.810
 computer and also like consoles 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:21.400
 and little is going 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.990
 that is, some small tools for 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.150
 see how this works we can 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.169
 kill pigs to acquire food due 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.699
 here in the game we die of hunger 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.999
 just as the night will also be a 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.580
 monster as you can see as a block 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.500
 ground 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.590
 how strange but good we are going to give 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.000
 create let's get wood to create 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.040
 table 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.130
 and we're going to put the right one here 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.740
 and then with the table we can work 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.830
 well to create many more things from 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.350
 what is this shovels to finish more 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.560
 quick peaks to chop stones more 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:01.230
 quick the ax to cut faster 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.970
 among those things as you can see here 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.730
 we have the whole art table or a 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.440
 staircase camera many things we have 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.690
 Well, do not create a shovel 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:16.450
 and then let's see what we can eat 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:18.610
 more things and well we want to be at 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.650
 sky in fact it's almost always common for 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.230
 our first houses on earth 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.750
 but good in this case we are not going to do 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.610
 more planks 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.800
 as a deposit 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.940
 We are going to create 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.720
 March 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.860
 and not treat them for practical 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.569
 and it is already 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.699
 then how can you see that we have the 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:45.539
 go here and we will have much more 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.539
 rational 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.240
 now that it looks pretty good in the 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.610
 resolution to which the game runs is the 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.040
 native of the precision half for which 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.950
 we see ourselves edges in terms of 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.570
 graphics accepts that these things are like this 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.700
 do not think it 's game error or anything 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.400
 it's typical of minecraft as you can see 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:09.130
 your block game after they have not 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.030
 noticed and well this is regulation of 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.770
 minecraft which have been the great thing 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.800
 select computer can be modified 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.330
 and be better but good nothing more gentlemen 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.100
 this is minecraft for the escape 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.040
 half distinction as you can observe 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.210
 when we run out the monkey and fire 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.610
 in a lot more gentlemen is 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.010
 exactly update 3 and then 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.330
 well sometime some other thing that I 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.280
 has put a comment then I the 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.680
 put that I'll answer and well then 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.900
 people this was all I remind you that 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.210
 Marquen is available at a price of 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.320
 20 dollars and well good perfect we 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.320
 let's go until next time
