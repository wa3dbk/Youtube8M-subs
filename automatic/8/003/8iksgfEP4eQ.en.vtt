00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.820
 have you read about brewer's yeast and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.810
 its innumerable properties in this 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.720
 video I want to talk to you about the real

 of beer is a unicellular organism 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.660
 very simple is a mushroom that is used 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.340
 industrially for the use of bread the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.810
 wine 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.300
 normally it is usually sold in 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.930
 isolated in herbalists or stores 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.110
 dietetics in the form of capsules or powder or 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.970
 They are like scales that is their own 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:11.930
 yeast well because yeast because 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.730
 when yeast can help you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.610
 the brewer's yeast is very rich in 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.840
 amino acids has all the amino acids 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.060
 essential amino acids are 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.820
 essential when controlling 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.550
 the weight because it controls what is the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.260
 appetite many overweight people 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.810
 They have an imbalance of 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.970
 essential amino acids and that 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.350
 imbalance over all lack of 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.710
 elements I could not create an anxiety 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.070
 of eating and brewer's yeast in 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 this case can help you 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.340
 the brewer's yeast is also rich 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.550
 in chromium and chromium is a mineral is a 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.130
 essential trace element for 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.990
 control glucose metabolism 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.179
 in the blood 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.489
 If you do not know what it is that the 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.140
 metabolism of blood glucose 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.800
 well I want to simplify you and tell you 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.950
 what if you eat a lot of sweets 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.420
 you get you have anxiety to eat buns 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.420
 or carbohydrates simply in your 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.450
 body there are ups and downs of the sugar level 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.599
 and the chrome I can help you for this 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.670
 anxiety of eating and chopping between hours 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.730
 and logically the brewer's yeast 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.210
 rich in chrome will help you control 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.910
 this anxiety 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.550
 the brewer's yeast is also rich 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.440
 in vitamins of group b that are 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.860
 essential to control the 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.620
 nervous system that is so important 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.090
 for overweight people like for 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.440
 people with weight deficiency 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.320
 that's why it's said 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.950
 that the brewer's yeast can act 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.770
 as an adaptogenic effect means that 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.070
 it's an effect that will benefit both 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.950
 people with excess weight like 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.920
 people with too low weight and 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.080
 as it does by simply balancing the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.630
 metabolism because we have both 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.840
 extremes in a case that the metabolism 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.120
 it works in excess 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.519
 the person who goes very quickly to the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.769
 calories and we have the deficiency of 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.830
 weight and on the other hand we have a 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:39.900
 metabolism very slow that the body 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.879
 It takes less calories than normal and 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.680
 then we have the overweight the 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.170
 brewer's yeast both in the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.769
 deficiency as in overweight is going to 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.470
 act as a common modulator 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:55.270
 balancer and will help get to the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.900
 normal weight 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:02.350
 I want to do just one warning there is a 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.390
 case in which it is totally prohibited 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.420
 brewer's yeast 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.000
 and is totally prohibited in all its 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.660
 forms and these are the cases of 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.420
 fungal infections known as 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.420
 candidiasis or candidiasis in this case 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.940
 I repeat, it is totally forbidden to use 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.640
 of brewer's yeast in all the rest 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:30.550
 of cases you can use the yeast of 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:33.190
 beer to lose weight now is the 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.220
 part maybe more important when you should 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.480
 of taking the brewer's yeast the best 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.200
 way to take the brewer's yeast 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.830
 like most supplements or 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.110
 food supplements is 15 minutes 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.810
 before breakfast before lunch and 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.700
 before dinner usually the best 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.980
 way and the most comfortable is in the form of 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.310
 capsules and it is recommended to take two 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.620
 capsules before breakfast 2 capsules 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.200
 before the meal and 2 capsules before 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.590
 dinner the capsules are usually from 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.169
 500 milligrams that is half a gram and that 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.550
 is the sufficient dose to supply 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.650
 their 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.710
 those nutrients for your body and so 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.420
