so<00:03:23.950> if<00:03:24.700> I<00:03:24.880> hadn't<00:03:25.180> done<00:03:25.300> that<00:03:25.330> done<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.230> nose

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
so if I hadn't done that done the nose

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.630 
so if I hadn't done that done the nose
really<00:03:26.710> well<00:03:26.920> um<00:03:27.900> anyway<00:03:28.900> Hogan<00:03:29.320> Hogan<00:03:30.280> view

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
really well um anyway Hogan Hogan view

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.330 
really well um anyway Hogan Hogan view
scan<00:03:30.910> sky<00:03:31.420> marks<00:03:31.780> I'd<00:03:31.960> get<00:03:32.110> Hogan<00:03:32.530> bit<00:03:32.920> cheaper

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
scan sky marks I'd get Hogan bit cheaper

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.630 
scan sky marks I'd get Hogan bit cheaper
and<00:03:33.930> they<00:03:34.930> must<00:03:35.140> detail<00:03:35.560> put<00:03:35.830> in<00:03:35.980> there's<00:03:36.550> a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
and they must detail put in there's a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.020 
and they must detail put in there's a
lot<00:03:36.730> more<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.240> these<00:03:38.490> are<00:03:39.490> lights<00:03:39.820> off

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
lot more and these are lights off

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.240 
lot more and these are lights off
because<00:03:40.210> it's<00:03:40.990> not<00:03:41.170> it's<00:03:41.530> not<00:03:41.620> all<00:03:41.680> plastic

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
because it's not it's not all plastic

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.770 
because it's not it's not all plastic
it's<00:03:42.490> hot<00:03:42.880> they've<00:03:43.120> actually<00:03:43.300> this<00:03:43.570> hollow

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
it's hot they've actually this hollow

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.420 
it's hot they've actually this hollow
through<00:03:44.590> down<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.040> middle

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
through down the middle

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.410 
through down the middle
so<00:03:46.420> yeah<00:03:47.340> I'll<00:03:48.340> probably<00:03:48.489> leave<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:48.940> I'm<00:03:49.060> I'm
