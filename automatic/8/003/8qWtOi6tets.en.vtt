00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.809 
domain and the low complexity domain so
this<00:05:18.110> would<00:05:18.319> be<00:05:18.349> the<00:05:18.680> translocation<00:05:19.279> product

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
this would be the translocation product

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.230 
this would be the translocation product
and<00:05:20.000> if<00:05:20.599> it's<00:05:20.779> bound<00:05:21.050> iteratively<00:05:21.710> to<00:05:22.129> DNA<00:05:22.520> we

and if it's bound iteratively to DNA we
