00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
everything all set up but right now this

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.440 
everything all set up but right now this
is<00:02:40.880> going<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.120> be<00:02:41.210> an<00:02:41.270> unboxing<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:43.450> the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
is going to be an unboxing and the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.270 
is going to be an unboxing and the
packers<00:02:44.810> in<00:02:44.930> very<00:02:45.140> nice<00:02:45.350> i<00:02:45.530> have<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.130> say<00:02:46.160> that

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
packers in very nice i have to say that

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.390 
packers in very nice i have to say that
it<00:02:46.580> feels<00:02:46.880> very<00:02:47.360> good<00:02:48.290> like<00:02:48.620> they<00:02:48.860> did<00:02:49.070> at<00:02:49.100> any

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
it feels very good like they did at any

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.160 
it feels very good like they did at any
time<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.760> figure<00:02:50.150> them<00:02:50.300> they<00:02:50.630> should<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.990> for

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
time I figure them they should it for

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.200 
time I figure them they should it for
the<00:02:51.260> amount<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.470> money<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.740> you<00:02:52.700> paid<00:02:52.910> on<00:02:53.180> it

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
the amount of money that you paid on it

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.640 
the amount of money that you paid on it
