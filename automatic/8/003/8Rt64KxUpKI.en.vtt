00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.700
 know now what to watch in the sky this 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.310
 week the naked eye 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.770
 at dusk it is possible to see a planet 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.760
 Venus shining to the west in the constellation 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.560
 Sagittarius the evening star is 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.560
 visible until 11 p.m. 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.699
 this week 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.600
 Jupiter is born at 22 and 30 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.309
 constellation of twins 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.950
 You can also see mars from the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.540
 three o'clock in the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.550
 lion constellation on the 27th the moon 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.850
 waning above the planet 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850
 red 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.100
 Last week we talked about the comet 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.250
 ison that this week makes its 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.900
 maximum approximation with the sun 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.119
 carefully observed by astronomers 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.690
 professionals and amateurs throughout the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.360
 year 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.340
 wilson gained space in the press for 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.460
 possibility of reaching a large 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.009
 until the beginning of November one 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.710
 comet behaved timidly with a 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.350
 lower than expected but on 13 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.890
 November showed a sudden increase in 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.470
 brightness in 72 hours went on to shine ten 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.960
 times more than before and its tail 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.090
 was small and noticeable only in 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.100
 large telescopes also increased 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.259
 considerably in size 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.490
 the news was received with 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.380
 enthusiasm 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.450
 finally he was bright 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.060
 enough to be seen with the naked eye 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.979
 although this was only possible in 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.470
 ideal conditions 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.320
 the photographer around the world took advantage of 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.330
 opportunity to record the evolution of 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.240
 horizon that in less than one 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.030
 week started to have a length of 15 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.599
 millions of kilometers almost 40 times 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.030
 distance from the Earth to the Moon more images 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.160
 of the comet nucleus revealed 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.950
 the cause of the brightness surge 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.770
 apparently the comet nucleus started 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.720
 a fragmentation process releasing 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.450
 a lot of gas 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.270
 the future of the comet now depends on the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.520
 evolution of fragmentation if it 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.520
 to continue a comet may not survive 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.390
 to the passage near the sound and that 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.380
 occurred with other comets as an enemy 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.930
 2011 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.180
 on the other hand love joy another comet 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.060
 who passed next to the sun in 2011 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.000
 thwarted expectations and survived 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.560
 to the fragmentation in the show in the week 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.200
 delayed christmas 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.780
 if you repeat this destination you can 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.000
 still be observed next week 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.629
 just before sunrise in the direction 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.849
 east this week a committee is very 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.610
 close to the sound to be 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.189
 earth only specialized satellites 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.140
 have been able to follow their trajectory 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.420
 nobody knows yet what will really 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.340
 to happen 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.709
 most experts believe that 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.000
 the scenario of complete fragmentation is 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.590
 more probable 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.959
 but history has taught us that 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.819
 nature may still surprise the 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.890
 human thought and that is why 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.110
 we keep looking at the sky 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.349
 until the next program and its books 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.349
 all
