is<00:00:10.920> just<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.309> short<00:00:11.639> one<00:00:11.759> about<00:00:12.269> some<00:00:12.450> ways<00:00:12.570> to

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
is just a short one about some ways to

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.810 
is just a short one about some ways to
clean<00:00:13.019> up<00:00:13.110> your<00:00:13.230> sequence<00:00:13.650> because<00:00:14.400> often

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
clean up your sequence because often

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.580 
clean up your sequence because often
after<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.179> do<00:00:15.480> your<00:00:15.570> rough<00:00:15.750> cut<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.170> you've

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
after you do your rough cut and you've

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.230 
after you do your rough cut and you've
moved<00:00:16.770> your<00:00:16.920> Clips<00:00:17.130> around<00:00:17.279> there's<00:00:18.000> little

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
moved your Clips around there's little

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.300 
moved your Clips around there's little
glitches<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.960> your<00:00:19.080> timeline<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:20.160> are

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
glitches in your timeline that are

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.800 
glitches in your timeline that are
perhaps<00:00:20.550> not<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:20.880> obvious<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> bigger<00:00:21.570> your

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
perhaps not so obvious the bigger your

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.509 
perhaps not so obvious the bigger your
timeline<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> longer<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.920> interation

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
timeline is the longer it is interation

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.660 
timeline is the longer it is interation
the<00:00:24.449> harder<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> kind<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.320> notice<00:00:25.830> small

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the harder it is to kind of notice small

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.820 
the harder it is to kind of notice small
little<00:00:27.240> areas<00:00:27.570> where<00:00:27.720> maybe<00:00:27.869> there's<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.320> frame

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
little areas where maybe there's a frame

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.460 
little areas where maybe there's a frame
missing<00:00:29.279> or<00:00:29.490> there's<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.539> gap<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.260> time

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
missing or there's a gap of your time

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.920 
missing or there's a gap of your time
when<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.859> don't<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.210> let's<00:00:33.540> take

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
when you just don't see it so let's take

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.139 
when you just don't see it so let's take
a<00:00:33.960> look<00:00:34.140> at<00:00:34.230> some<00:00:34.350> ways<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.530> locate<00:00:34.860> those<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
a look at some ways to locate those the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.160 
a look at some ways to locate those the
first<00:00:36.300> thing<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.540> want<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.719> point<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:36.960> though

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
first thing I want to point out though

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.869 
first thing I want to point out though
this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.950> something<00:00:38.190> called<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.399> match<00:00:38.610> frame

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
this is something called a match frame

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.330 
this is something called a match frame
if<00:00:39.420> i<00:00:39.600> zoom<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.110> clip<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:40.350> gonna<00:00:41.070> use

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
if i zoom in on this clip I'm gonna use

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.880 
if i zoom in on this clip I'm gonna use
the<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.879> magnifying<00:00:42.360> glass<00:00:42.450> technique<00:00:43.050> yeah

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the the magnifying glass technique yeah

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.729 
the the magnifying glass technique yeah
she<00:00:44.460> press<00:00:44.640> command<00:00:45.030> M<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.570> ctrl<00:00:46.020> M<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.440> PC

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
she press command M or ctrl M on the PC

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.770 
she press command M or ctrl M on the PC
you<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.789> kind<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.360> magnifying

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
you get this kind of little magnifying

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.220 
you get this kind of little magnifying
glass<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> lot<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> icon<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.510> drag<00:00:51.870> over<00:00:51.989> an

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
glass a lot of the icon you drag over an

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.270 
glass a lot of the icon you drag over an
area<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.489> highlights<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:54.000> section

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
area and it just highlights that section

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.549 
area and it just highlights that section
so<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.090> called<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.449> nice<00:00:57.570> frame<00:00:57.809> edit<00:00:58.079> now

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
so this is called a nice frame edit now

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.479 
so this is called a nice frame edit now
match<00:00:58.739> frame<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> means<00:00:59.370> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
match frame that it means that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.979 
match frame that it means that
technically<00:01:00.390> there's<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> cut<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
technically there's a cut in the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.810 
technically there's a cut in the
timeline<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.829> select<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.309> clip<00:01:02.579> or

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
timeline so you can select this clip or

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.759 
timeline so you can select this clip or
you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.059> select<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.420> clip<00:01:03.719> they<00:01:04.470> select

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
you can select that clip they select

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.010 
you can select that clip they select
differently<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> timecode<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> clip

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
differently but the timecode of the clip

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.289 
differently but the timecode of the clip
is<00:01:07.049> consistent<00:01:07.740> all<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.100> way<00:01:08.220> through<00:01:08.340> so

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
is consistent all the way through so

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.880 
is consistent all the way through so
when<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.750> play<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.020> as<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.650> see<00:01:10.799> up

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
when you play it back as you can see up

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
when you play it back as you can see up
in<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.040> record<00:01:11.340> monitor<00:01:11.729> there's<00:01:12.270> nothing<00:01:12.689> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
in a record monitor there's nothing to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.810 
in a record monitor there's nothing to
indicate<00:01:13.110> there's<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.530> clip<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
indicate there's really a clip there you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.310 
indicate there's really a clip there you
know<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.390> consecutive<00:01:15.990> all<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> way

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
know that it's consecutive all the way

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.990 
know that it's consecutive all the way
through<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.790> symbol

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
through because that little symbol

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.789 
through because that little symbol
although<00:01:18.390> hard<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.530> an

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
although hard to see it's really an

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.999 
although hard to see it's really an
equal<00:01:20.159> sign<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.420> white<00:01:21.710> equal<00:01:22.710> sign

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
equal sign and the white equal sign

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.070 
equal sign and the white equal sign
means<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.000> there's<00:01:24.180> no<00:01:24.330> difference<00:01:24.780> with

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
means that there's no difference with

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
means that there's no difference with
the<00:01:25.200> clip<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.530> left<00:01:25.890> hand<00:01:26.040> side<00:01:26.310> versus

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the clip on the left hand side versus

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.390 
the clip on the left hand side versus
the<00:01:27.150> clip<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:27.659> hand<00:01:27.869> side<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.250> some

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the clip on the right hand side and some

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.830 
the clip on the right hand side and some
other<00:01:29.520> places<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:30.509> any<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.750> my

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
other places if there's any in my

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.480 
other places if there's any in my
timeline<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:31.799> other<00:01:31.950> places<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.340> might

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
timeline but some other places you might

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.929 
timeline but some other places you might
see<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> red<00:01:33.240> equal<00:01:33.600> sign<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.470> means<00:01:34.650> that

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
see a red equal sign and that means that

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.310

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
want to remove all of them because

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.900 
want to remove all of them because
remember<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.010> people<00:02:19.220> at<00:02:19.310> home<00:02:19.340> can't<00:02:19.700> see

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
remember the people at home can't see

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.880 
remember the people at home can't see
them<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.780> if<00:02:21.020> they're<00:02:21.170> accidently<00:02:21.860> made

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
them so if they're accidently made

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.210 
them so if they're accidently made
because<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.340> were<00:02:22.580> shuffling<00:02:22.940> clips<00:02:23.180> around

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
because you were shuffling clips around

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:32.920 
because you were shuffling clips around
for<00:02:25.220> example<00:02:25.580> maybe<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:28.840> select<00:02:30.340> this<00:02:31.340> clip<00:02:31.930> and

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
for example maybe I select this clip and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.760 
for example maybe I select this clip and
I<00:02:32.990> move<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.560> over<00:02:33.650> here<00:02:37.060> by<00:02:38.060> dragging<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.770> and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
I move it over here by dragging it and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.360 
I move it over here by dragging it and
then<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.980> put<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.280> back<00:02:40.310> now<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:42.320> have<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.800> match

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
then I put it back now I have the match

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.220 
then I put it back now I have the match
frame<00:02:43.580> edit<00:02:43.850> because<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.720> put<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.930> clip<00:02:45.110> back

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
frame edit because I put the clip back

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.320 
frame edit because I put the clip back
but<00:02:45.470> there's<00:02:45.620> still<00:02:45.710> an<00:02:45.980> actual<00:02:46.250> cut<00:02:46.460> there<00:02:46.700> so

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
but there's still an actual cut there so

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.540 
but there's still an actual cut there so
you<00:02:47.390> want<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.660> remove<00:02:47.810> all<00:02:48.020> of<00:02:48.050> these<00:02:48.550> the

you want to remove all of these the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.160 
you want to remove all of these the
easiest<00:02:49.820> way<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.030> can<00:02:50.060> think<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.390> do<00:02:50.570> it<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:51.110> just

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
want to remove our little black frames

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.420 
want to remove our little black frames
that's<00:03:09.380> frames<00:03:09.650> where<00:03:09.800> there's<00:03:09.950> no<00:03:10.070> footage

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
that's frames where there's no footage

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.980 
that's frames where there's no footage
so<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:10.670> just<00:03:10.790> plays<00:03:10.940> back<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.360> like<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.600> puzzle

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
so it just plays back is like a puzzle

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.080 
so it just plays back is like a puzzle
well<00:03:12.350> there's<00:03:12.590> black<00:03:12.800> black<00:03:13.610> holes<00:03:13.820> are<00:03:13.940> often

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
well there's black black holes are often

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.090 
well there's black black holes are often
made<00:03:14.420> when<00:03:14.570> you<00:03:14.660> pick<00:03:14.780> up<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.990> clip<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.440> you

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
made when you pick up a clip and you

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.530 
made when you pick up a clip and you
move<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.490> but<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.760> don't<00:03:16.850> have<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.210> command

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
move it but you don't have the command

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.960 
move it but you don't have the command
key<00:03:17.690> held<00:03:17.900> down<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:19.010> when<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:19.370> go<00:03:19.490> to<00:03:19.520> set<00:03:19.850> it

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
key held down so when you go to set it

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.670 
key held down so when you go to set it
down<00:03:20.150> instead<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.840> being<00:03:21.020> exactly<00:03:21.440> on<00:03:21.530> the

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
down instead of being exactly on the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.960 
down instead of being exactly on the
frame<00:03:21.890> like<00:03:22.070> this<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.400> you<00:03:22.520> might<00:03:22.640> be<00:03:22.760> off<00:03:22.940> a

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
frame like this is you might be off a
