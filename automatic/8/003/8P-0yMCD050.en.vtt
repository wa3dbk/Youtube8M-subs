hey<00:00:11.670> gang<00:00:11.880> it's<00:00:11.910> last<00:00:12.300> username<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.960> I've

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
hey gang it's last username and I've

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.510 
hey gang it's last username and I've
been<00:00:13.889> working<00:00:14.219> on<00:00:14.429> an<00:00:14.759> afk<00:00:15.389> ice<00:00:15.839> machine<00:00:16.520> that

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
been working on an afk ice machine that

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.609 
been working on an afk ice machine that
is<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> machine<00:00:18.090> where<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.260> walk

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
is a machine where you can just walk

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.279 
is a machine where you can just walk
away<00:00:19.800> from<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:21.119> will<00:00:21.300> collect<00:00:21.720> ice<00:00:21.960> for

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
away from it and it will collect ice for

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.290 
away from it and it will collect ice for
you<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.710> put<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.550> your<00:00:23.580> inventory<00:00:24.119> until

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
you and put it in your inventory until

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.980 
you and put it in your inventory until
your<00:00:24.539> inventory<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.019> full<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.580> here's<00:00:26.580> a

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
your inventory is full and here's a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.609 
your inventory is full and here's a
simple<00:00:27.990> proof<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.470> concept<00:00:28.980> all<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
simple proof of concept all this is is

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.620 
simple proof of concept all this is is
for<00:00:31.619> water<00:00:31.920> source<00:00:32.219> blocks<00:00:32.520> held<00:00:32.969> up<00:00:33.120> by<00:00:33.270> signs

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
for water source blocks held up by signs

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.069 
for water source blocks held up by signs
and<00:00:34.370> that<00:00:35.370> will<00:00:35.670> give<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.030> an<00:00:36.270> infinite<00:00:36.899> water

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
and that will give you an infinite water

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.069 
and that will give you an infinite water
cloner<00:00:37.879> but<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.120> them<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.300> exposed<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
cloner but one of them is exposed to the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.040 
cloner but one of them is exposed to the
sky<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.700> as<00:00:41.700> long<00:00:41.850> as<00:00:41.969> you're<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> snow

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.450 
sky and as long as you're in a snow
biome<00:00:43.430> that<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:45.329> block<00:00:45.629> will<00:00:45.870> freeze

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
biome that one block will freeze

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.869 
biome that one block will freeze
repeatedly<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:48.469> if<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.649> stand<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.550> this

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
repeatedly and if you stand here in this

repeatedly and if you stand here in this
water<00:00:51.300> stream<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.370> get<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.760> silk<00:00:54.270> touch

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
water stream and get out your silk touch

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.200 
water stream and get out your silk touch
tool<00:00:54.860> point<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.949> at<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> sky<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.969> hold

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
tool point it at the sky and just hold

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.590 
tool point it at the sky and just hold
the<00:00:57.300> button<00:00:57.510> down<00:00:58.879> then<00:00:59.879> whenever<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.390> block

the button down then whenever that block

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.650 
the button down then whenever that block
freezes<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:02.039> will<00:01:02.309> instantly<00:01:02.879> mine<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.480> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
freezes you will instantly mine it and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
freezes you will instantly mine it and
we'll<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:04.379> into<00:01:04.530> your<00:01:04.619> inventory<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
we'll go into your inventory and the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.270 
we'll go into your inventory and the
water<00:01:05.729> will<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.330> cloned<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.100> this<00:01:08.100> will

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
water will be cloned and this will

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.800 
water will be cloned and this will
happen<00:01:08.430> over<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:08.939> over<00:01:09.030> again<00:01:09.240> until<00:01:09.510> your

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
happen over and over again until your

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.810 
happen over and over again until your
inventory<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.290> full<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:11.040> course<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.490> very

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
inventory is full of course is very very

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.960 
inventory is full of course is very very
slow<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> does<00:01:12.990> work<00:01:13.520> let's<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.850> get

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
slow but it does work let's just to get

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
slow but it does work let's just to get
an<00:01:15.060> action

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.830 

and<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.770> on<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:27.189> so<00:01:27.250> on<00:01:27.450> here's<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.540> very<00:01:28.750> simple

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
and so on and so on here's a very simple

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.170 
and so on and so on here's a very simple
way<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.290> improve<00:01:29.890> on<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.460> efficiency<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.000> that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
way to improve on the efficiency of that

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.219 
way to improve on the efficiency of that
machine<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:33.130> this<00:01:33.340> version<00:01:33.520> we<00:01:33.850> have<00:01:34.090> not<00:01:34.990> one

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
machine in this version we have not one

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.570 
machine in this version we have not one
but<00:01:35.259> four<00:01:36.030> water<00:01:37.030> blocks<00:01:37.390> exposed<00:01:37.899> to<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.229> sky

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
but four water blocks exposed to the sky

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.719 
but four water blocks exposed to the sky
one<00:01:39.580> two<00:01:39.880> three<00:01:40.330> four<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.369> there's<00:01:42.369> an<00:01:42.490> extra

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
one two three four and there's an extra

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.539 
one two three four and there's an extra
block<00:01:42.909> here<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.860> when<00:01:45.159> all<00:01:45.280> these<00:01:45.399> are

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
block here so that when all these are

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.480 
block here so that when all these are
broken<00:01:46.000> they<00:01:46.149> will<00:01:47.140> still<00:01:47.380> all<00:01:47.619> clone<00:01:48.039> back

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
broken they will still all clone back

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.630 
broken they will still all clone back
into<00:01:48.820> place<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.979> other<00:01:50.979> than<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.340> it's<00:01:51.520> the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
into place and other than that it's the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.520 
into place and other than that it's the
same<00:01:51.850> design<00:01:52.360> there's<00:01:52.630> current<00:01:53.020> here<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.320> push

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
same design there's current here to push

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.550 
same design there's current here to push
the<00:01:53.710> blocks<00:01:53.950> into<00:01:54.280> me<00:01:54.580> when<00:01:54.759> they<00:01:54.940> fall<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.560> I

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
the blocks into me when they fall and I

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.510 
the blocks into me when they fall and I
position<00:01:57.460> myself<00:01:57.610> right<00:01:58.119> here<00:01:59.159> as<00:02:00.159> close<00:02:00.399> to

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
position myself right here as close to

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.680 
position myself right here as close to
the<00:02:00.610> water<00:02:00.789> as<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.000> can<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:02.259> aim<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:04.119> the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
the water as I can and I aim just on the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.919 
the water as I can and I aim just on the
bottom<00:02:05.080> edge<00:02:05.259> of<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:06.390> closest<00:02:07.390> block<00:02:07.659> and

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
bottom edge of that closest block and

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.080 
bottom edge of that closest block and
press<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.560> button<00:02:11.370> then<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.489> will<00:02:12.640> mine<00:02:12.850> all

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
press the button then I will mine all

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.800 
press the button then I will mine all
four<00:02:13.300> blocks<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:15.250> course<00:02:15.569> as<00:02:16.569> they

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
four blocks and of course as they

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.500 
four blocks and of course as they
refreeze<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.560> will<00:02:18.250> continuously<00:02:18.819> my<00:02:19.120> them<00:02:19.330> and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
refreeze I will continuously my them and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.750 
refreeze I will continuously my them and
I'll<00:02:19.690> flow<00:02:19.870> into<00:02:20.110> me<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:20.440> we've<00:02:21.310> got<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.580> same

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
I'll flow into me so we've got the same

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.809 
I'll flow into me so we've got the same
machine<00:02:22.090> but<00:02:22.950> immediately<00:02:23.950> four<00:02:24.400> times<00:02:24.610> as

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
machine but immediately four times as

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:37.050 
machine but immediately four times as
fast<00:02:34.829> now<00:02:35.829> even<00:02:36.070> at<00:02:36.160> four<00:02:36.370> times<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.730> speed

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
fast now even at four times the speed

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.050 
fast now even at four times the speed
this<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.570> still<00:02:37.870> pretty<00:02:38.350> slow<00:02:38.880> probably<00:02:39.880> not

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
this is still pretty slow probably not

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.690 
this is still pretty slow probably not
satisfactory<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.019> most<00:02:41.230> people<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.400> there's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
satisfactory to most people but there's

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.039 
satisfactory to most people but there's
definitely<00:02:42.850> things<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:43.390> can<00:02:43.540> do<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.750> make<00:02:43.900> it

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
definitely things we can do to make it

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.500 
definitely things we can do to make it
much<00:02:44.260> faster<00:02:44.470> even<00:02:44.980> than<00:02:45.100> this<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.579> course<00:02:46.209> to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
much faster even than this of course to

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.060 
much faster even than this of course to
make<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.750> Machine<00:02:47.049> more<00:02:47.200> efficient<00:02:47.709> what<00:02:47.950> you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
make the Machine more efficient what you

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.539 
make the Machine more efficient what you
have<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.340> do<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.790> add<00:02:49.000> more<00:02:49.359> ice<00:02:49.630> blocks<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.549> if

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
have to do is add more ice blocks and if

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.819 
have to do is add more ice blocks and if
you<00:02:51.640> want<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.850> mine<00:02:52.170> many<00:02:53.170> many<00:02:53.380> ice<00:02:53.530> blocks

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
you want to mine many many ice blocks

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:54.930 
you want to mine many many ice blocks
when<00:02:54.040> you're<00:02:54.160> not<00:02:54.250> at<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.459> computer<00:02:54.609> you're

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
when you're not at the computer you're

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.069 
when you're not at the computer you're
going<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.150> need<00:02:55.239> something<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.720> move<00:02:55.930> you

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
going to need something to move you

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.190 
going to need something to move you
along<00:02:56.700> automatically<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.910> my<00:02:58.810> first<00:02:59.079> thought

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
along automatically and my first thought

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.030 
along automatically and my first thought
for<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.709> was<00:03:00.489> mine<00:03:01.030> cart<00:03:01.299> similar<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:02.049> my

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
for that was mine cart similar to my

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.319 
for that was mine cart similar to my
bread<00:03:03.430> factory<00:03:04.290> but<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.440> problem<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.329> mine

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
bread factory but the problem is mine

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.470 
bread factory but the problem is mine
carts<00:03:07.630> move<00:03:07.870> far<00:03:08.230> too<00:03:08.440> fast<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:09.549> actually<00:03:09.579> mine

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
carts move far too fast to actually mine

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.410 
carts move far too fast to actually mine
the<00:03:10.630> ice<00:03:10.780> blocks<00:03:11.700> even<00:03:12.700> if<00:03:12.820> you're<00:03:12.940> using<00:03:13.120> an

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
the ice blocks even if you're using an

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.780 
the ice blocks even if you're using an
efficiency<00:03:13.810> for<00:03:14.079> pick<00:03:14.410> it's<00:03:15.310> just<00:03:15.549> way<00:03:15.730> too

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
efficiency for pick it's just way too

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.960 
efficiency for pick it's just way too
fast<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:17.739> you'd<00:03:17.980> have<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.280> slow<00:03:18.609> down<00:03:18.790> the

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
fast and so you'd have to slow down the

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.509 
fast and so you'd have to slow down the
mine<00:03:19.120> cart<00:03:19.299> quite<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.690> bit<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:21.190> actually

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
mine cart quite a bit to to actually

mine cart quite a bit to to actually
mine<00:03:21.730> all<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.000> blocks<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.510> you<00:03:22.540> can<00:03:23.140> do<00:03:23.319> that

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
mine all the blocks and you can do that

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.789 
mine all the blocks and you can do that
with<00:03:23.769> one<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.160> these<00:03:24.280> clock<00:03:25.590> circuits<00:03:26.590> that

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
with one of these clock circuits that

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.840 
with one of these clock circuits that
pulses<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.549> track<00:03:27.760> on<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.120> off<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:30.010> in<00:03:30.310> order

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
pulses the track on and off but in order

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.150 
pulses the track on and off but in order
to<00:03:30.970> make<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.630> track<00:03:31.930> long<00:03:32.440> enough<00:03:32.769> you'd<00:03:32.979> have

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
to make the track long enough you'd have

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.479 
to make the track long enough you'd have
to<00:03:33.600> have<00:03:34.600> numerous<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:35.709> these<00:03:35.829> clocks<00:03:36.160> all

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
to have numerous of these clocks all

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:36.840 
to have numerous of these clocks all
along

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
along

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.220 
along
tracking<00:03:37.180> you'd<00:03:37.270> have<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.480> synchronize<00:03:37.990> them

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
tracking you'd have to synchronize them

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.080 
tracking you'd have to synchronize them
and<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:39.040> circuitry<00:03:39.400> we<00:03:39.550> get<00:03:39.670> very<00:03:39.820> very

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
and the circuitry we get very very

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.560 
and the circuitry we get very very
complicated<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.950> abandoned<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.090> minecart

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
complicated so I abandoned the minecart

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.370 
complicated so I abandoned the minecart
idea<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.100> figured<00:03:45.100> out<00:03:45.190> something<00:03:45.460> else

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
idea and figured out something else

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.560 
idea and figured out something else
instead<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.620> minecart<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.340> decided<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:49.000> try<00:03:49.240> a

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
instead of a minecart I decided to try a

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.380 
instead of a minecart I decided to try a
water<00:03:50.020> canal<00:03:50.380> so<00:03:51.220> what<00:03:51.550> we<00:03:51.670> have<00:03:51.850> here<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:52.240> a

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
water canal so what we have here is a

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.980 
water canal so what we have here is a
very<00:03:52.990> long<00:03:53.320> building<00:03:54.060> with<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> water<00:03:55.600> canal

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
very long building with a water canal

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.640 
very long building with a water canal
along<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.620> floor<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.150> ice<00:03:58.150> blocks<00:03:58.510> along<00:03:59.320> the

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
along the floor and ice blocks along the

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.150 
along the floor and ice blocks along the
roof<00:03:59.830> and<00:04:00.330> there's<00:04:01.330> 72<00:04:01.840> blocks<00:04:02.260> on<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:02.950> side

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
roof and there's 72 blocks on this side

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.820 
roof and there's 72 blocks on this side
and<00:04:03.570> then<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:04.660> loops<00:04:04.810> around<00:04:04.960> and<00:04:05.380> there's

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
and then it loops around and there's

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.680 
and then it loops around and there's
another<00:04:05.980> 72<00:04:06.430> blocks<00:04:06.760> on<00:04:06.970> this<00:04:07.090> side<00:04:07.270> on<00:04:07.600> the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
another 72 blocks on this side on the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.230 
another 72 blocks on this side on the
other<00:04:07.720> direction<00:04:07.960> so<00:04:08.560> 144<00:04:09.370> ice<00:04:09.550> blocks<00:04:09.880> total

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
other direction so 144 ice blocks total

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.240 
other direction so 144 ice blocks total
every<00:04:10.510> time<00:04:10.690> around<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.050> building<00:04:11.350> and

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.060 

around<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.370> outside<00:04:15.910> there's<00:04:16.770> water<00:04:17.770> source

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
around the outside there's water source

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.500 
around the outside there's water source
blocks<00:04:18.400> that<00:04:18.610> are<00:04:18.670> covered<00:04:18.970> up<00:04:19.060> so<00:04:19.239> they<00:04:19.330> don't

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
blocks that are covered up so they don't

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.140 
blocks that are covered up so they don't
freeze<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:20.080> this<00:04:20.860> ensures<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.760> water

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
freeze and this ensures that the water

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.060 
freeze and this ensures that the water
clones<00:04:22.540> back<00:04:22.810> into<00:04:23.140> place<00:04:23.350> when<00:04:23.620> you<00:04:23.710> mind<00:04:23.920> the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
clones back into place when you mind the

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.850 
clones back into place when you mind the
ice<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:25.020> underneath<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.200> canals<00:04:26.500> there's

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
ice and underneath the canals there's

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.790 
ice and underneath the canals there's
more<00:04:27.220> ice<00:04:27.400> blocks<00:04:27.840> now<00:04:28.840> these<00:04:29.080> don't<00:04:29.410> speed

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
more ice blocks now these don't speed

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.550 
more ice blocks now these don't speed
you<00:04:30.070> up<00:04:30.100> at<00:04:30.370> all<00:04:30.520> but<00:04:30.820> they<00:04:30.970> do<00:04:31.030> speed<00:04:31.660> up<00:04:31.840> the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
you up at all but they do speed up the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.680 
you up at all but they do speed up the
ice<00:04:32.920> block<00:04:33.250> items<00:04:33.670> that<00:04:33.910> fall<00:04:34.240> into<00:04:34.480> the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
ice block items that fall into the

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.470 
ice block items that fall into the
canals<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.260> that<00:04:35.410> just<00:04:35.680> makes<00:04:35.920> sure<00:04:36.190> that<00:04:36.480> the

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
canals and that just makes sure that the

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.940 
canals and that just makes sure that the
items<00:04:37.510> catch<00:04:38.140> up<00:04:38.290> with<00:04:38.470> you<00:04:38.620> as<00:04:38.800> you're

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
items catch up with you as you're

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.850 
items catch up with you as you're
floating<00:04:39.190> along<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:39.730> you<00:04:39.790> don't<00:04:40.000> miss<00:04:40.180> any<00:04:40.860> so

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
floating along so you don't miss any so

00:04:41.860 --> 00:05:06.180 
floating along so you don't miss any so
let's<00:04:42.220> see<00:04:42.400> this<00:04:42.580> thing<00:04:42.760> in<00:04:42.820> action

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.969 

and<00:05:07.190> that's<00:05:07.550> about<00:05:07.669> one<00:05:07.970> time<00:05:08.180> around<00:05:08.979> that

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
and that's about one time around that

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.370 
and that's about one time around that
entire<00:05:10.250> time<00:05:10.520> I<00:05:10.759> wasn't<00:05:11.419> touching<00:05:11.750> my<00:05:12.199> mouse

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
entire time I wasn't touching my mouse

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.770 
entire time I wasn't touching my mouse
or<00:05:12.560> my<00:05:12.680> keyboard<00:05:13.039> the<00:05:13.759> water<00:05:14.030> canal<00:05:14.330> did<00:05:14.660> all

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
or my keyboard the water canal did all

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.219 
or my keyboard the water canal did all
the<00:05:14.900> work<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.289> as<00:05:16.160> you<00:05:16.310> can<00:05:16.430> see<00:05:16.870> not<00:05:17.870> all<00:05:17.900> of

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
the work and as you can see not all of

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.680 
the work and as you can see not all of
the<00:05:18.350> blocks<00:05:18.530> freeze<00:05:19.009> over<00:05:19.479> when<00:05:20.479> you<00:05:20.570> go

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
the blocks freeze over when you go

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.890 
the blocks freeze over when you go
around<00:05:21.460> but<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.520> lot<00:05:22.699> of<00:05:22.729> them<00:05:22.910> do<00:05:23.090> and<00:05:23.240> the

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
around but a lot of them do and the

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.520 
around but a lot of them do and the
longer<00:05:24.320> you<00:05:24.410> make<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:25.490> canal<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.930> more<00:05:27.259> the

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
longer you make the canal the more the

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.930 
longer you make the canal the more the
higher<00:05:27.680> percentage<00:05:28.250> of<00:05:28.310> ice<00:05:28.430> blocks<00:05:28.729> will

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
higher percentage of ice blocks will

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.930 
higher percentage of ice blocks will
freeze<00:05:29.240> every<00:05:30.080> time<00:05:30.289> around<00:05:30.520> so<00:05:31.520> the<00:05:31.699> machine

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
freeze every time around so the machine

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.400 
freeze every time around so the machine
will<00:05:32.060> get<00:05:32.180> more<00:05:32.389> and<00:05:32.509> more<00:05:32.570> efficient<00:05:33.139> as<00:05:33.259> you

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
will get more and more efficient as you

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.670 
will get more and more efficient as you
make<00:05:33.560> it<00:05:33.710> larger<00:05:34.070> and<00:05:34.449> that<00:05:35.449> is<00:05:35.720> the<00:05:35.930> AF<00:05:36.199> K<00:05:36.410> is

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
make it larger and that is the AF K is

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.670 
make it larger and that is the AF K is
farm<00:05:37.100> works<00:05:38.000> great<00:05:38.389> really<00:05:39.199> simple<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.530> build

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
farm works great really simple to build

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.350 
farm works great really simple to build
I'm<00:05:40.669> last<00:05:40.970> username<00:05:41.210> stay<00:05:42.139> cool
