some more halo reach racetracks at this
time<00:00:17.160> i<00:00:17.190> have<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> map<00:00:17.640> called<00:00:17.880> pipeline<00:00:18.420> by

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
time i have a map called pipeline by

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.429 
time i have a map called pipeline by
treble<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.429> we<00:00:20.429> want<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.699> play<00:00:20.880> 21<00:00:21.420> now<00:00:22.289> this

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
treble and we want to play 21 now this

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.990 
treble and we want to play 21 now this
is<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> really<00:00:22.890> really<00:00:23.070> nice<00:00:23.250> map<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> lot<00:00:23.910> of

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
is a really really nice map for a lot of

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.779 
is a really really nice map for a lot of
reasons<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.890> one<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> main<00:00:26.220> reasons<00:00:26.640> is

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
reasons and one of the main reasons is

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.790 
reasons and one of the main reasons is
the<00:00:27.060> variety<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.630> pieces<00:00:27.839> because<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.679> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the variety of pieces because as the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.380 
the variety of pieces because as the
name<00:00:28.919> suggests<00:00:29.249> it's<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.669> you<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.179> you're

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
name suggests it's like you know you're

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.790 
name suggests it's like you know you're
some<00:00:30.599> pipe<00:00:30.839> last<00:00:31.050> pipes<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.499> and<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.740> like

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
some pipe last pipes in and it's like

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.790 
some pipe last pipes in and it's like
racing<00:00:32.310> on<00:00:32.490> top<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.290> just<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.740> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
racing on top of the just like at the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.740 
racing on top of the just like at the
very<00:00:35.160> top<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> sea<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> kind<00:00:36.660> of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
very top of the sea like on a kind of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.410 
very top of the sea like on a kind of
pipe<00:00:36.900> as<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.530> name<00:00:37.680> suggests<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.330> do

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
pipe as the name suggests so I really do

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.480 
pipe as the name suggests so I really do
like<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> pipeline's<00:00:40.080> end<00:00:40.380> because<00:00:40.830> they're

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.490 
like the pipeline's end because they're

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.070 
like the pipeline's end because they're
not<00:00:41.580> really<00:00:41.880> being<00:00:42.120> used<00:00:42.480> they're<00:00:42.750> quite<00:00:42.960> an

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
not really being used they're quite an

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.140 
not really being used they're quite an
unconventional<00:00:43.920> piece<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> use<00:00:44.400> I<00:00:44.610> mean<00:00:45.060> the

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
unconventional piece to use I mean the

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.580 
unconventional piece to use I mean the
only<00:00:45.270> other<00:00:45.480> time<00:00:45.660> I've<00:00:45.870> seen<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> muses<00:00:46.470> in

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
only other time I've seen the muses in

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.280 
only other time I've seen the muses in
horse<00:00:46.770> maps<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.420> i'm<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.600> sure<00:00:48.660> what<00:00:49.050> trap

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
horse maps and i'm not sure what trap

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.020 
horse maps and i'm not sure what trap
adore<00:00:49.530> has<00:00:49.650> done<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.130> in<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.430> map<00:00:50.670> it's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
adore has done but in this map it's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
adore has done but in this map it's
really<00:00:51.510> easy<00:00:51.900> to<00:00:52.110> race<00:00:52.380> on<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.650> like<00:00:52.980> there's

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
really easy to race on them like there's

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.410 
really easy to race on them like there's
only<00:00:53.310> one<00:00:53.520> place<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.790> you<00:00:53.970> can<00:00:54.090> come<00:00:54.270> off

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
only one place that you can come off

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.970 
only one place that you can come off
which<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.810> just<00:00:55.020> back<00:00:55.200> there<00:00:55.380> which<00:00:55.560> i<00:00:55.650> do<00:00:55.710> come

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
which is just back there which i do come

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.470 
which is just back there which i do come
off<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.250> next<00:00:56.340> lap<00:00:56.580> and<00:00:56.790> that's<00:00:57.390> only

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
off on the next lap and that's only

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.270 
off on the next lap and that's only
really<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.080> go<00:00:58.200> too<00:00:58.260> fast<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.980> all<00:00:59.160> they

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
really if you go too fast so all they

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.580 
really if you go too fast so all they
really<00:00:59.490> need<00:00:59.790> you<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.810> all<00:01:01.470> they

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
require you to do to get past them is

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.579 
require you to do to get past them is
just<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.570> full<00:01:03.870> throttle<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> down<00:01:04.439> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
just to not full throttle it down you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.380 
just to not full throttle it down you
just<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> slow<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.280> bit<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:06.360> just

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
just have to slow a little bit or just

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.690 
just have to slow a little bit or just
like<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.920> trace<00:01:08.160> on<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.550> normal

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
like you can trace on it like a normal

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.160 
like you can trace on it like a normal
track<00:01:09.060> as<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.240> curvature<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.050> not

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
track as the curvature but it's not

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.050 
track as the curvature but it's not
really<00:01:10.410> hard<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.980> doesn't<00:01:11.670> make<00:01:11.730> the<00:01:11.910> map

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
really hard and it doesn't make the map

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.690 
really hard and it doesn't make the map
look<00:01:12.270> nice<00:01:12.480> and<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.810> plays<00:01:12.960> very<00:01:13.110> well<00:01:13.670> so<00:01:14.670> i

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
look nice and it plays very well so i

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
look nice and it plays very well so i
weld<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.270> travel<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.930> improving<00:01:16.830> your<00:01:17.010> lap

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
weld on to travel for improving your lap

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.130 
weld on to travel for improving your lap
length<00:01:17.460> while<00:01:17.909> still<00:01:18.300> making<00:01:18.480> an<00:01:18.659> apple<00:01:18.870> look

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
length while still making an apple look

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.580 
length while still making an apple look
and<00:01:19.350> play<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:20.310> nice<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.820> well<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:22.080> yeah

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
and play really nice and well so yeah

and play really nice and well so yeah

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
they laplink just over a minute which is

they laplink just over a minute which is
a<00:01:24.240> big<00:01:24.420> improvement<00:01:24.510> on<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.110> like<00:01:25.290> 45<00:01:25.740> 50

a big improvement on is like 45 50
seconds<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.780> last<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:28.920> love

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
seconds or the last one and I do love

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.560 
seconds or the last one and I do love
like<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.700> start<00:01:29.970> their<00:01:30.090> lap<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.390> end<00:01:30.510> of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
like to start their lap on the end of

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.360 
like to start their lap on the end of
the<00:01:30.659> lap<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.800> see<00:01:31.830> around<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
the lap and as you can see around the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.340 
the lap and as you can see around the
map<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:33.030> underwater<00:01:33.450> which<00:01:34.080> for

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
map you go like underwater which for

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.480 
map you go like underwater which for
like<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.680> points<00:01:34.950> which<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.310> cool

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
like some points which is really cool

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.600 
like some points which is really cool
and<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.650> additional<00:01:37.650> time<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> effort<00:01:38.310> put

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and the additional time and effort put

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.340 
and the additional time and effort put
into<00:01:38.760> the<00:01:38.940> tunnels<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> make<00:01:40.080> them<00:01:40.200> all

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
into the tunnels just to make them all

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.170 
into the tunnels just to make them all
that<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.710> color<00:01:41.130> which<00:01:41.760> just<00:01:42.000> makes

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
that all that color which just makes

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.540 
that all that color which just makes
them<00:01:42.330> map<00:01:42.630> nice<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:43.080> play<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.310> way<00:01:44.460> of

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
them map nice to play and in the way of

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.039 
them map nice to play and in the way of
aesthetics<00:01:45.000> your<00:01:45.210> some<00:01:45.330> supporting<00:01:45.810> beams

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
aesthetics your some supporting beams

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.080 
aesthetics your some supporting beams
there<00:01:46.350> some<00:01:46.650> really<00:01:47.040> nice<00:01:47.220> just<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> top<00:01:47.940> of

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there some really nice just the top of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.969 
there some really nice just the top of
prices<00:01:48.510> because<00:01:49.320> they're<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.680> colorful

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
prices because they're a really colorful

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.230 
prices because they're a really colorful
piece<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.670> makes<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.940> map<00:01:51.090> with

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
piece and it just makes the map with

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.780 
piece and it just makes the map with
nice<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:52.590> you've<00:01:52.740> also<00:01:52.890> got<00:01:53.100> some<00:01:53.250> supporting

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
nice and you've also got some supporting

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.399 
nice and you've also got some supporting
like<00:01:54.150> a<00:01:54.180> big<00:01:54.390> supporting<00:01:54.870> brace<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
like a big supporting brace for the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.780 
like a big supporting brace for the
really<00:01:55.740> high<00:01:55.890> angle<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> start<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
really high angle at the start of the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.450 
really high angle at the start of the
lap<00:01:57.000> which<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:57.810> really<00:01:58.080> do<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.650> really<00:01:59.369> like

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
lap which I really do like I really like

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.120 
lap which I really do like I really like
a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.760> like<00:02:00.080> propel<00:02:01.080> like<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.770> propelled

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
a little like propel like not propelled

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.300 
a little like propel like not propelled
and<00:02:02.729> suspended<00:02:03.420> by<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> little<00:02:03.840> pole<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:05.130> here<00:02:05.280> I

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and suspended by a little pole so here I

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.460 
and suspended by a little pole so here I
come<00:02:05.520> off<00:02:05.700> buzzes<00:02:05.940> I<00:02:06.030> don't<00:02:06.180> slow<00:02:06.330> down<00:02:06.510> so<00:02:07.320> all

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
come off buzzes I don't slow down so all

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.289 
come off buzzes I don't slow down so all
they<00:02:07.650> really<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.459> required<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.970> do<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.179> just

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
they really like required to do is just

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:10.849 
they really like required to do is just
slow<00:02:09.599> down<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.810> little<00:02:10.019> bit<00:02:10.170> which<00:02:10.439> is<00:02:10.619> just

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:10.859 
slow down a little bit which is just

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:14.929 
slow down a little bit which is just
makes<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.219> map<00:02:11.370> really<00:02:11.609> good<00:02:13.099> excuse<00:02:14.099> me<00:02:14.219> but

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
makes the map really good excuse me but

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:15.860 
makes the map really good excuse me but
yeah

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
yeah

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.440 
yeah
as<00:02:15.930> long<00:02:16.200> as<00:02:16.530> far<00:02:16.890> as<00:02:17.069> other<00:02:17.519> players<00:02:17.790> goes<00:02:18.120> and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
as long as far as other players goes and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.479 
as long as far as other players goes and
like<00:02:18.870> racing<00:02:19.200> competitively<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.280> it'll<00:02:20.459> be

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
like racing competitively so it'll be

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.649 
like racing competitively so it'll be
really<00:02:20.730> i<00:02:20.819> think<00:02:21.000> it'd<00:02:21.209> be<00:02:21.299> really<00:02:21.420> good

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
really i think it'd be really good

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.500 
really i think it'd be really good
because<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.909> like<00:02:23.909> the<00:02:24.000> pipes<00:02:24.239> in<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
because of the like the pipes in the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.670 
because of the like the pipes in the
curvature<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.080> there's<00:02:25.230> quite<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.470> lot<00:02:25.590> of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
curvature so there's quite a lot of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.649 
curvature so there's quite a lot of
space<00:02:25.860> but<00:02:26.760> there<00:02:26.940> aren't<00:02:27.090> any<00:02:27.239> collision

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
space but there aren't any collision

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.390 
space but there aren't any collision
point<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.080> maybe<00:02:28.319> that's<00:02:28.590> probably<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.370> of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
point so maybe that's probably one of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.500 
point so maybe that's probably one of
the<00:02:29.519> only<00:02:29.580> things<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.120> i<00:02:30.150> would<00:02:30.330> say<00:02:30.450> to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
the only things that i would say to

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.080 
the only things that i would say to
improve<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:30.989> map<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.379> also<00:02:32.250> maybe<00:02:32.549> a<00:02:32.700> bit

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
improve this map and also maybe a bit

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
improve this map and also maybe a bit
more<00:02:33.120> variety<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.780> pieces<00:02:34.319> because<00:02:34.620> he<00:02:34.739> does

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
more variety in pieces because he does

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.350 
more variety in pieces because he does
use<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.280> pipeline<00:02:35.670> which<00:02:35.849> is<00:02:35.940> really<00:02:36.120> cool

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
use the pipeline which is really cool

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.600 
use the pipeline which is really cool
but<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.659> does<00:02:36.959> get<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.170> bit<00:02:37.260> repetitive<00:02:37.650> see

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
but it does get a bit repetitive see

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.800 
but it does get a bit repetitive see
personally<00:02:39.000> i<00:02:39.120> would<00:02:39.299> have<00:02:39.390> loved<00:02:39.659> to<00:02:39.750> see

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
personally i would have loved to see

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.270 
personally i would have loved to see
more<00:02:40.079> of<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.349> glass<00:02:40.560> covers<00:02:40.920> because<00:02:41.129> I<00:02:41.220> do

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
more of the glass covers because I do

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.640 
more of the glass covers because I do
like<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.700> when<00:02:41.819> people<00:02:41.849> use<00:02:42.239> them<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.650> yeah

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
like it when people use them and yeah

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.930 
like it when people use them and yeah
there<00:02:43.799> are<00:02:43.860> shield<00:02:44.099> doors<00:02:44.220> around<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.579> map<00:02:44.730> in

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
there are shield doors around the map in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.610 
there are shield doors around the map in
certain<00:02:45.360> areas<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.870> love<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.170> end<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
certain areas and I love the end of the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.440 
certain areas and I love the end of the
lap<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:46.980> these<00:02:47.400> man<00:02:47.640> cannons<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.150> propel

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
lap to just these man cannons to propel

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.660 
lap to just these man cannons to propel
you<00:02:48.569> nicely<00:02:48.870> back<00:02:49.230> up<00:02:49.410> into<00:02:49.560> lap<00:02:49.859> with<00:02:50.519> some

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
you nicely back up into lap with some

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.490 
you nicely back up into lap with some
beautiful<00:02:50.910> struts<00:02:51.540> lining<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.989> walls<00:02:52.049> just

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
beautiful struts lining the walls just

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.530 
beautiful struts lining the walls just
to<00:02:52.620> round<00:02:52.769> you<00:02:52.950> back<00:02:53.099> into<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.370> lap<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:54.269> we're

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
to round you back into the lap so we're

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.000 
to round you back into the lap so we're
on<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:54.720> final<00:02:54.870> lap<00:02:55.109> now<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.739> have<00:02:55.829> a<00:02:55.859> nice

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
on the final lap now and we have a nice

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.229 
on the final lap now and we have a nice
chilled<00:02:56.220> or<00:02:56.340> they're<00:02:56.489> just<00:02:56.519> slow<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.030> down

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
chilled or they're just slow you down

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.410 
chilled or they're just slow you down
just<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.810> make<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.140> drop<00:02:58.950> smooth<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.459> yeah

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
just to make this drop smooth and yeah

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.940 
just to make this drop smooth and yeah
it's<00:03:00.629> a<00:03:00.690> really<00:03:00.840> good<00:03:01.019> map<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.409> definitely

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
it's a really good map I definitely

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.470 
it's a really good map I definitely
recommend<00:03:02.129> it<00:03:02.430> for<00:03:02.549> download<00:03:02.700> as<00:03:03.090> always<00:03:03.329> the

tunnels<00:03:06.359> they're<00:03:06.450> really<00:03:06.659> cool<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.140> is

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
tunnels they're really cool and this is

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.839 
tunnels they're really cool and this is
a<00:03:07.319> really<00:03:07.680> nice<00:03:07.829> angle<00:03:08.340> because<00:03:08.609> it's<00:03:08.730> a

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
a really nice angle because it's a

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.910 
a really nice angle because it's a
really<00:03:09.390> sharp<00:03:09.690> angle<00:03:10.079> it's<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.319> harsh<00:03:10.530> angle

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
really sharp angle it's a harsh angle

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.949 
really sharp angle it's a harsh angle
but<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.609> st.<00:03:11.819> but<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.359> not<00:03:12.420> really

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
but the st. but like it's not really

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.180 
but the st. but like it's not really
hard<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.290> drive<00:03:13.500> unlike<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.010> previous

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
hard to drive unlike the previous

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.490 
hard to drive unlike the previous
episode<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.000> like<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:16.079> doesn't<00:03:16.290> make<00:03:16.349> the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
episode and like that doesn't make the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.140 
episode and like that doesn't make the
map<00:03:16.769> in<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.950> previous<00:03:17.220> upload<00:03:17.549> any<00:03:17.760> worse

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
map in the previous upload any worse

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.720 
map in the previous upload any worse
it's<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.690> like<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.739> don't<00:03:19.769> particularly<00:03:20.430> like

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
it's just like I don't particularly like

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.339 
it's just like I don't particularly like
that<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.120> not<00:03:21.209> my<00:03:21.359> personal<00:03:21.780> preference<00:03:22.019> but

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
that it's not my personal preference but

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.039 
that it's not my personal preference but
yeah<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.010> think<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.340> map<00:03:23.579> like<00:03:23.970> there's<00:03:24.930> not

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
yeah I think this map like there's not

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.629 
yeah I think this map like there's not
really<00:03:25.410> anything<00:03:25.859> that<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.130> can't<00:03:26.430> like

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
really anything that you can't like

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.120 
really anything that you can't like
about<00:03:26.880> this<00:03:27.000> map<00:03:27.739> like<00:03:28.739> it's<00:03:28.889> not<00:03:29.010> too

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
about this map like it's not too

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.460 
about this map like it's not too
difficult<00:03:29.310> or<00:03:29.639> like<00:03:29.819> too<00:03:30.079> boring<00:03:31.079> it's<00:03:31.260> just

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
difficult or like too boring it's just

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.569 
difficult or like too boring it's just
quite<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> bit<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.859> everything<00:03:32.280> so<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:32.549> a

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
quite a bit of everything so it's a

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.879 
quite a bit of everything so it's a
really<00:03:32.730> good<00:03:32.970> nice<00:03:33.209> rounded<00:03:33.780> map<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.799> has

really good nice rounded map and it has

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.699 
really good nice rounded map and it has
around<00:03:35.160> because<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.579> pipe<00:03:35.790> yeah<00:03:36.690> um<00:03:37.049> so
