00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
down the specifics about what people

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.369 
down the specifics about what people
have<00:00:55.640> been<00:00:55.699> asking<00:00:56.330> me<00:00:56.390> about<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:57.199> new

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
have been asking me about the new

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.009 
have been asking me about the new
earthquake<00:00:57.589> spell<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:59.210> first<00:00:59.510> let's<00:00:59.780> take<00:00:59.960> a

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
earthquake spell so first let's take a

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.200 
earthquake spell so first let's take a
look<00:01:00.350> at<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.530> maximum<00:01:01.190> level<00:01:01.430> 4<00:01:01.940> earthquake

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
look at a maximum level 4 earthquake

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.649 
look at a maximum level 4 earthquake
spell<00:01:02.839> hitpoints<00:01:03.710> lost<00:01:04.040> 12<00:01:04.640> percent<00:01:05.269> but

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
spell hitpoints lost 12 percent but

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.510 
spell hitpoints lost 12 percent but
you've<00:01:05.780> got<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.229> read<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:06.590> fine<00:01:06.890> print

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
you've got to read the fine print

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.820 
you've got to read the fine print
it<00:01:07.640> causes<00:01:08.090> structures<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.990> lose<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> portion

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
it causes structures to lose a portion

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.430 
it causes structures to lose a portion
of<00:01:09.950> their<00:01:10.220> remaining<00:01:10.850> hit<00:01:11.510> points<00:01:11.930> now<00:01:12.260> it

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
of their remaining hit points now it

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.710 
of their remaining hit points now it
also<00:01:12.650> specifies<00:01:13.130> they<00:01:13.640> can<00:01:13.850> cause<00:01:14.119> structures

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
also specifies they can cause structures

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.390 
also specifies they can cause structures
that<00:01:14.840> are<00:01:14.960> almost<00:01:15.170> destroyed<00:01:15.799> to<00:01:16.010> collapse

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
that are almost destroyed to collapse

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.670 
that are almost destroyed to collapse
instantly<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.780> there's<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:18.020> certain<00:01:18.380> threshold

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
instantly so there's a certain threshold

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.340 
instantly so there's a certain threshold
below<00:01:19.190> which<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.910> will<00:01:20.300> destroy<00:01:20.810> buildings

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
below which it will destroy buildings

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.870 
below which it will destroy buildings
but<00:01:21.500> you've<00:01:21.650> got<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.950> figure<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:22.430> number<00:01:22.760> is

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
but you've got to figure that number is

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.090 
but you've got to figure that number is
pretty<00:01:23.240> low<00:01:23.630> but<00:01:24.200> we're<00:01:24.410> going<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.770> get<00:01:24.860> back

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
pretty low but we're going to get back

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.580 
pretty low but we're going to get back
to<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.460> word<00:01:25.640> remaining<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:27.440> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
to the word remaining and that is the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.560 
to the word remaining and that is the
key<00:01:27.830> word<00:01:27.860> in<00:01:28.370> that<00:01:28.430> description<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
key word in that description of the

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.690 
key word in that description of the
earthquake<00:01:29.990> spell<00:01:30.320> what<00:01:30.830> that<00:01:31.040> means<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:31.670> that

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
earthquake spell what that means is that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.120 
earthquake spell what that means is that
each<00:01:32.060> successive<00:01:32.470> earthquake<00:01:33.470> spell<00:01:33.800> dropped

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
each successive earthquake spell dropped

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.520 
each successive earthquake spell dropped
on<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.490> same<00:01:34.760> structure<00:01:35.390> will<00:01:35.840> do<00:01:36.050> less

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
on the same structure will do less

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.650 
on the same structure will do less
damage<00:01:36.560> than<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.340> previous<00:01:37.730> one<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.450> for

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
damage than the previous one so for

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
damage than the previous one so for
instance<00:01:39.020> let's<00:01:39.410> take<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.710> townhall<00:01:40.430> 10<00:01:41.680> 5500

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
instance let's take a townhall 10 5500

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.770 
instance let's take a townhall 10 5500
hit<00:01:42.860> points<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.610> first<00:01:43.940> earthquake<00:01:44.240> spell

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
hit points the first earthquake spell

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.800 
hit points the first earthquake spell
dropped<00:01:45.170> on<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.500> building<00:01:46.130> will<00:01:46.310> do<00:01:46.810> 660

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
dropped on that building will do 660

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.370 
dropped on that building will do 660
damage<00:01:48.170> or<00:01:48.290> 12%<00:01:48.800> of<00:01:49.220> 5,500<00:01:50.180> but<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.810> second

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
damage or 12% of 5,500 but the second

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.740 
damage or 12% of 5,500 but the second
earthquake<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:52.100> going<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.700> do<00:01:52.820> 12<00:01:53.090> percent<00:01:53.600> of

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
earthquake is going to do 12 percent of

earthquake is going to do 12 percent of
the<00:01:53.810> remaining<00:01:55.180> 4840<00:01:56.180> hit<00:01:56.330> points<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.320> that

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
the remaining 4840 hit points so that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.399 
the remaining 4840 hit points so that
second<00:01:58.010> earthquake<00:01:58.159> only<00:01:58.640> did<00:01:59.030> 580<00:01:59.990> damage

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
second earthquake only did 580 damage
