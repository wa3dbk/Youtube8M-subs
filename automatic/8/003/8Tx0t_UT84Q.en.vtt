00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.550
 good I'm a little 28 I bring you another 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:11.309
 drink in a way in this case is a mod 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:14.459
 of the track and well then I guess that 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.310
 you will be tired of going to the mine in search of 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.890
 for example diamonds and with all the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.970
 illusion of the world find you 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.640
 lapis lazuli in it served absolutely 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.640
 for nothing just to make these blocks 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:31.380
 ugly and to make ink then with this 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.510
 way your problems are over because 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.769
 as we see we can do our 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.310
 lapis tools so good in the 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.250
 I'm searching, it's obvious 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:47.720
 we are going to take all in the sword the shovel 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.770
 the peak and the sickle are the ones that are 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:56.579
 pretty good you can sing here 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:59.550
 as we see at level 4 for example 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.760
 I do not have more level now 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.440
 I know I could put it on mine 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.479
 kill this sheep that does not make noise 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:13.050
 with this everything goes as we will be an engine 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.659
 of two strokes is pretty good or more 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.440
 this the truth is that it is the whole world 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.360
 but in mono 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.230
 but I'm going to teach a little things with 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.280
 the shovel 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.240
 it was good 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.390
 and let's make it more fluid to dig 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.740
 right under you but good we see the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.909
 peak also itches pretty well 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:40.090
 good everything all very well 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.750
 that leave here 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.929
 and good the ax then good is that the 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.850
 truth is that I do not know if they are if I believe 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.329
 which is better than iron I do not know 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 let's go a little better or similar but 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.850
 that we see that is going pretty well 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:08.340
 and the sides then one or just to the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:29.770
 time to give 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.450
 and well this is the whole world 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:39.180
 to how is it quite simple tools 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.810
 spade shovel peak and os 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.260
 and good is quite useful in my opinion 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.959
 personal and expensive everything I hope has 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.510
 liked that you give him light that is live 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.980
