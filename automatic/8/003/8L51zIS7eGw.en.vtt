how<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> don't<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> don't<00:01:58.469> I

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
how I don't know this but I don't I

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.469 
how I don't know this but I don't I
think<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.130> split<00:01:59.399> up<00:01:59.520> amongst<00:01:59.969> four<00:02:00.180> people

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
think it is split up amongst four people

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.209 
think it is split up amongst four people
because<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.899> 4v4<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.009> 4

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
because it's a 4v4 it's you know 4

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.830 
because it's a 4v4 it's you know 4
before<00:02:02.520> tournament<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> four<00:02:03.719> man

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
before tournament it's for a four man

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.170 
before tournament it's for a four man
team<00:02:03.899> tournament<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.189> mean<00:02:05.790> either<00:02:05.969> way

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
team tournament so I mean either way

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.550

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
stuff like that also there will be a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.289 
stuff like that also there will be a
stream<00:03:18.299> for<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:19.430> don't<00:03:20.430> know<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:20.849> exact

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
stream for this I don't know the exact

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.849 
stream for this I don't know the exact
time<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.690> stream<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.139> thought<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.440> think<00:03:22.739> the

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
time the stream I thought I think the

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.890 
time the stream I thought I think the
stream<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.280> just<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.639> a<00:03:23.669> semi<00:03:23.849> final<00:03:24.269> or<00:03:24.419> final

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
stream is just for a semi final or final

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.050 
stream is just for a semi final or final
round<00:03:25.109> I<00:03:25.349> think<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.459> starts<00:03:26.669> at<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.849> semi

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
round I think it starts at the semi

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.879 
round I think it starts at the semi
