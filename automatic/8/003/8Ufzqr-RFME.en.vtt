in this tutorial will show how resources

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.550 
in this tutorial will show how resources
are<00:00:04.859> distributed<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.609> tasks<00:00:06.180> will<00:00:07.020> start<00:00:07.350> with

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
are distributed to tasks will start with

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.250 
are distributed to tasks will start with
registering<00:00:08.220> our<00:00:08.429> task<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.150> use<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.870> manager

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260

resources are defined in yo however is
we<00:00:36.540> already<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.170> defined<00:00:37.620> our<00:00:37.920> resources

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
we already have defined our resources

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.090 
we already have defined our resources
what<00:00:39.450> we<00:00:39.629> need<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.860> go<00:00:41.040> to
