00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
pence and we're suggesting that you

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.220 
pence and we're suggesting that you
place<00:02:14.840> all<00:02:15.110> three<00:02:15.470> bets<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:17.030> would<00:02:17.360> give<00:02:18.110> you

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
place all three bets that would give you

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.010 
place all three bets that would give you
the<00:02:18.319> same<00:02:18.350> result<00:02:18.950> as<00:02:19.130> our<00:02:19.489> algorithm<00:02:20.270> but<00:02:20.870> of

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
the same result as our algorithm but of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.840 
the same result as our algorithm but of
course<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.530> don't<00:02:21.830> have<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.220> even<00:02:22.310> place<00:02:22.520> one

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
course you don't have to even place one

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.670 
course you don't have to even place one
or<00:02:23.060> two<00:02:23.450> or<00:02:23.660> all<00:02:23.870> three<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.920> bets<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:27.260> you

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
or two or all three of the bets so you

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.309 
or two or all three of the bets so you
would<00:02:27.830> be<00:02:27.980> placing<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.580> two<00:02:29.180> pound<00:02:29.390> back<00:02:29.720> bet<00:02:30.020> on

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
would be placing a two pound back bet on

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.210 
would be placing a two pound back bet on
Man<00:02:30.739> City<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.640> would<00:02:31.760> also<00:02:31.880> be<00:02:32.090> placing<00:02:33.050> a<00:02:33.220> 30

in these cases of loss the max exposure

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.050 
in these cases of loss the max exposure
is<00:03:36.799> showing<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.310> what<00:03:37.609> the<00:03:37.730> worst<00:03:37.940> case

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
is showing you what the worst case

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.180 
is showing you what the worst case
scenario<00:03:38.570> could<00:03:38.690> be<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.230> it's<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.859> lowest

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
scenario could be so it's the lowest

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.800 
scenario could be so it's the lowest
figure<00:03:40.609> of<00:03:40.700> these<00:03:40.820> three<00:03:41.150> so<00:03:41.359> here<00:03:41.570> we<00:03:41.690> have

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
figure of these three so here we have

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.289 
figure of these three so here we have
minus<00:03:42.290> three<00:03:42.470> point<00:03:42.650> seven<00:03:42.890> here<00:03:43.820> we<00:03:43.850> have<00:03:44.120> the

lowest figure minus three point six four

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.039 
lowest figure minus three point six four
here<00:03:46.760> we<00:03:46.880> have<00:03:47.000> minus<00:03:47.359> six<00:03:47.660> as<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:47.930> lowest

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
here we have minus six as the lowest

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.140 
here we have minus six as the lowest

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.840

result could have been an away win for
Tottenham<00:03:53.299> which<00:03:53.810> would<00:03:53.959> lose<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.320> six

here<00:04:22.109> of<00:04:23.010> 9.2<00:04:23.730> one<00:04:24.000> percent<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.540> it's<00:04:24.660> positive

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
here of 9.2 one percent so it's positive

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.560 
here of 9.2 one percent so it's positive
so<00:04:25.410> that<00:04:25.560> means<00:04:25.800> we<00:04:26.340> would<00:04:26.490> we'd<00:04:27.150> be<00:04:27.330> winning

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
so that means we would we'd be winning

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.690 
so that means we would we'd be winning
if<00:04:27.870> it<00:04:28.020> was<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.169> draw<00:04:28.410> we'd<00:04:28.980> be<00:04:29.160> winning<00:04:29.370> nine

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
if it was a draw we'd be winning nine

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.260 
if it was a draw we'd be winning nine
pound<00:04:29.970> twenty<00:04:30.360> one<00:04:30.570> for<00:04:30.810> every<00:04:30.960> 100<00:04:31.290> pounds

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
pound twenty one for every 100 pounds

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.850 
pound twenty one for every 100 pounds
now<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.900> result<00:04:34.169> was<00:04:34.260> actually<00:04:34.530> eight<00:04:34.620> point

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
now the result was actually eight point

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.230 
now the result was actually eight point
seven<00:04:35.070> five<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.700> reason<00:04:36.000> for<00:04:36.030> the

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
seven five and the reason for the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.950 
seven five and the reason for the
difference<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:37.080> for<00:04:37.410> every<00:04:37.740> win<00:04:38.100> Betfair<00:04:39.000> will

difference is for every win Betfair will

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.070 
difference is for every win Betfair will
take<00:04:40.260> five<00:04:40.620> percent<00:04:41.070> of<00:04:41.370> your<00:04:41.820> winnings<00:04:42.180> now

take five percent of your winnings now

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.200 
take five percent of your winnings now
Betfair<00:04:43.470> start<00:04:43.950> out<00:04:44.100> by<00:04:44.310> taking<00:04:44.490> five<00:04:44.850> percent

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
Betfair start out by taking five percent

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.300 
Betfair start out by taking five percent
you'll<00:04:45.360> reduce<00:04:45.660> that<00:04:45.960> if<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:47.010> more<00:04:47.190> you

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
you'll reduce that if you the more you

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.050 
you'll reduce that if you the more you
bet<00:04:47.520> with<00:04:47.700> Betfair<00:04:48.320> but<00:04:49.320> that's<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.520> percents

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
bet with Betfair but that's the percents

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.460 
bet with Betfair but that's the percents
they<00:04:51.210> start<00:04:51.480> with<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:51.720> that's<00:04:51.780> therefore<00:04:52.380> the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
they start with and that's therefore the

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.800 
they start with and that's therefore the
percentage<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.010> we<00:04:54.169> pay<00:04:55.169> within<00:04:56.010> these

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
percentage that we pay within these

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.469 
percentage that we pay within these
calculations<00:04:57.810> here<00:04:58.320> as<00:04:58.729> a<00:04:59.729> commission<00:05:00.270> so

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
calculations here as a commission so

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.290 
calculations here as a commission so
nine<00:05:00.690> four<00:05:00.930> -<00:05:01.110> one<00:05:01.290> less<00:05:01.889> 5%<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:02.790> eight<00:05:03.060> point

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
nine four - one less 5% is eight point

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.460 
nine four - one less 5% is eight point
seven<00:05:03.479> five<00:05:05.360> then<00:05:06.360> just<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:06.900> explain<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.200> rest

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
seven five then just to explain the rest

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.950 
seven five then just to explain the rest
of<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.890> sheets<00:05:08.310> we<00:05:08.520> have<00:05:08.729> yield<00:05:09.360> today<00:05:09.660> this

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
of the sheets we have yield today this

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.940 
of the sheets we have yield today this
is<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.260> total<00:05:10.979> return<00:05:11.430> over<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.990> maximum

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
is the total return over the maximum

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.940 
is the total return over the maximum
exposure<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.880> maximum<00:05:15.479> exposure<00:05:16.380> cumulative

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
exposure the maximum exposure cumulative

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.159 
exposure the maximum exposure cumulative
over<00:05:17.340> time<00:05:17.610> so<00:05:18.000> it<00:05:18.060> will<00:05:18.180> increase<00:05:18.630> with<00:05:18.900> wins

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
over time so it will increase with wins

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.700 
over time so it will increase with wins
and<00:05:19.440> it<00:05:19.500> will<00:05:19.590> decrease<00:05:19.950> with<00:05:20.280> losses<00:05:21.620> here<00:05:22.620> we

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
and it will decrease with losses here we

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.020
