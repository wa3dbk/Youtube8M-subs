00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.370 
I've never had narrowed hit that high on
the<00:01:56.759> machine<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> don't<00:01:57.930> think<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.229> can

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the machine so I don't think it can

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.889 
the machine so I don't think it can
happen<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:59.399> at<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.610> very<00:01:59.700> least<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.479> highly

happen or at the very least it's highly

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.080 
happen or at the very least it's highly
unlikely

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.330 

I<00:02:03.179> included<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.289> grabber<00:02:04.619> arm<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.070> make<00:02:05.219> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
I included this grabber arm to make it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:26.570 
I included this grabber arm to make it
easier<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.700> transport<00:02:06.119> items<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.160 
easier to transport items the
flamethrower<00:02:27.239> was<00:02:27.390> low<00:02:27.599> enough<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:28.019> reach<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
flamethrower was low enough to reach the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.199 
flamethrower was low enough to reach the
Sheep<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.129> it<00:02:29.220> doesn't<00:02:29.549> interfere<00:02:29.670> with
