00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:11.929 

now<00:00:57.940> let's<00:00:58.180> measure<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.340> cut<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.850> light<00:01:01.030> pink

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
so this is going to be row 21 chained up

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:23.660 
so this is going to be row 21 chained up
to<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:19.429> turn<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> last<00:01:22.710> two<00:01:22.979> rows<00:01:23.219> and
