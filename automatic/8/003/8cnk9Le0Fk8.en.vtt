00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
but there's just something about him

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
but there's just something about him
that<00:01:24.750> makes<00:01:25.229> him<00:01:25.320> play<00:01:25.619> way<00:01:25.860> better<00:01:25.890> than<00:01:26.280> his

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that makes him play way better than his

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.490 
that makes him play way better than his
stats<00:01:26.670> should<00:01:26.970> should<00:01:27.750> allow<00:01:27.990> him<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.320> play

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.440 
stats should should allow him to play
and<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.250> reason<00:01:29.310> he's<00:01:29.759> just<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.180> think

unfortunately just couldn't
keep<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.610> chip<00:02:13.819> down<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.299> he<00:02:14.750> ends<00:02:15.019> up

hitting the crossbar with that effort

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.039 
hitting the crossbar with that effort
the<00:02:16.700> good<00:02:16.970> effort<00:02:17.120> nonetheless<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.930> some

the good effort nonetheless and some

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.050 
the good effort nonetheless and some
good<00:02:18.200> play<00:02:18.379> for<00:02:18.440> us<00:02:18.650> then<00:02:19.159> Harold<00:02:19.519> Mina<00:02:19.760> came

83rd minute Sampdoria will just

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.449

determined<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.590> pass<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.920> ball<00:03:04.069> around<00:03:04.250> their

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
determined to pass the ball around their

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.130 
determined to pass the ball around their
defense<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.209> is<00:03:05.420> where<00:03:05.599> my<00:03:05.750> tactic

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
defense and this is where my tactic

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.240 
defense and this is where my tactic
comes<00:03:06.319> in<00:03:06.440> handy<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:06.739> is<00:03:07.010> what<00:03:07.159> I've

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
comes in handy this is what I've

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.069 
comes in handy this is what I've
mentioned<00:03:07.459> about<00:03:07.760> before<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.299> aggression

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
mentioned about before the aggression

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.720 
mentioned about before the aggression
that<00:03:09.230> stops<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.980> opposition<00:03:10.609> from

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
that stops the opposition from

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.309 
that stops the opposition from
containing<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:11.329> ball<00:03:11.450> in<00:03:11.629> their<00:03:11.780> defense<00:03:12.079> and

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
containing the ball in their defense and

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.280 
containing the ball in their defense and
that's<00:03:12.829> what<00:03:13.010> made<00:03:13.159> it<00:03:13.190> 5-1<00:03:13.750> true<00:03:14.750> Harold<00:03:15.079> Mina

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
that's what made it 5-1 true Harold Mina

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.899 
that's what made it 5-1 true Harold Mina
I<00:03:15.590> think<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:15.980> was<00:03:16.040> pellets<00:03:16.400> all<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.670> want<00:03:16.819> it

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
I think it was pellets all you want it

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.430 
I think it was pellets all you want it
back<00:03:17.030> or<00:03:17.180> maybe<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.450> was<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.630> alla<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.260> ball

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
back or maybe it was I alla the ball

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.259 
back or maybe it was I alla the ball
true<00:03:18.650> was<00:03:18.829> so<00:03:19.040> easy<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.519> finish<00:03:19.760> was<00:03:19.910> so<00:03:20.060> easy

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
true was so easy the finish was so easy

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.839 
true was so easy the finish was so easy
and<00:03:20.599> that's<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.410> sign<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:21.650> my<00:03:21.980> tactic<00:03:22.400> work<00:03:22.609> and

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
and that's a sign of my tactic work and

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.250 
and that's a sign of my tactic work and
you<00:03:22.940> know<00:03:23.060> that's<00:03:23.329> what<00:03:23.569> I<00:03:23.630> want<00:03:23.870> that's<00:03:24.049> why<00:03:24.230> I

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
you know that's what I want that's why I

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.890 
you know that's what I want that's why I
have<00:03:24.500> my<00:03:24.530> aggression<00:03:25.250> set<00:03:25.430> 289<00:03:25.849> that's<00:03:26.599> why<00:03:26.720> my

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
have my aggression set 289 that's why my

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.990 
have my aggression set 289 that's why my
passing<00:03:27.410> build-up<00:03:27.859> play<00:03:27.889> is<00:03:28.130> really<00:03:28.519> fast<00:03:28.790> and

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
passing build-up play is really fast and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.789 
passing build-up play is really fast and
that's<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:29.480> perfect<00:03:29.959> example<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.650> and

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
that's a perfect example of it and

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.379 
that's a perfect example of it and
another<00:03:31.040> reason<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.459> we<00:03:31.609> won<00:03:31.819> that<00:03:31.849> game<00:03:32.180> and

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
another reason that we won that game and

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.330 
another reason that we won that game and
played<00:03:32.959> as<00:03:33.109> well<00:03:33.139> as<00:03:33.290> we<00:03:33.500> did<00:03:33.680> is<00:03:33.829> because<00:03:34.010> ral

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
played as well as we did is because ral

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.190 
played as well as we did is because ral
sastra<00:03:34.760> Royce<00:03:34.910> had<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.269> freedom<00:03:35.569> in<00:03:35.930> midfield

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
sastra Royce had the freedom in midfield

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.470 
sastra Royce had the freedom in midfield
to<00:03:36.980> do<00:03:37.160> whatever<00:03:37.370> he<00:03:37.639> wanted<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.269> was

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
to do whatever he wanted and that was

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.289 
to do whatever he wanted and that was
bad<00:03:39.230> news<00:03:39.410> for<00:03:39.650> sampdoria<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:40.760> we<00:03:40.879> traveled

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
bad news for sampdoria but we traveled

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
take on the mighty motherwell who lost

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.619 
take on the mighty motherwell who lost
their<00:03:45.829> opening<00:03:45.949> game<00:03:46.190> against<00:03:46.549> Porto<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.150> now

their opening game against Porto and now
they're<00:03:47.780> playing<00:03:47.900> at<00:03:48.199> home<00:03:48.349> against<00:03:48.799> the

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
they're playing at home against the

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.879 
they're playing at home against the
might<00:03:49.069> of<00:03:49.099> AC<00:03:49.549> Milan<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.359> I'm<00:03:50.569> not<00:03:51.379> really<00:03:51.440> good

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
might of AC Milan so I'm not really good

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.379 
might of AC Milan so I'm not really good
times<00:03:52.160> for<00:03:52.370> motor<00:03:52.579> well<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:52.790> don't<00:03:53.060> think<00:03:53.269> I

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
times for motor well I don't think I

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.640 
times for motor well I don't think I
don't<00:03:53.449> think<00:03:53.599> they<00:03:53.780> would<00:03:53.900> have<00:03:53.959> expected<00:03:54.349> to

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
don't think they would have expected to

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.960 
don't think they would have expected to
do<00:03:54.769> well<00:03:54.919> in<00:03:55.099> this<00:03:55.190> game<00:03:55.400> but<00:03:55.549> it's<00:03:55.669> good<00:03:55.819> for<00:03:55.940> a

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
do well in this game but it's good for a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.220 
do well in this game but it's good for a
Scottish<00:03:56.239> football<00:03:56.569> in<00:03:56.810> fact<00:03:57.079> they<00:03:57.199> probably

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
Scottish football in fact they probably

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.629 
Scottish football in fact they probably
would<00:03:57.680> have<00:03:57.739> played<00:03:57.919> this<00:03:58.069> game<00:03:58.280> at<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.489> bigger

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
would have played this game at a bigger

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.099 
would have played this game at a bigger
venue<00:03:58.790> i'm<00:03:59.090> not<00:03:59.239> too<00:03:59.389> sure<00:03:59.419> but<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.840> lot<00:04:00.079> of

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
venue i'm not too sure but a lot of

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.770

the Spanish team and I know that because
I'm<00:07:04.770> the<00:07:04.860> Spanish<00:07:05.190> manager<00:07:05.580> so<00:07:05.730> I<00:07:05.760> think

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
I'm the Spanish manager so I think

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.640 
I'm the Spanish manager so I think

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
do see brothers in this game like i'm

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.670 
do see brothers in this game like i'm
sure<00:07:09.600> that<00:07:09.840> they're<00:07:09.960> definitely<00:07:10.230> brothers

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
sure that they're definitely brothers

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.220 
sure that they're definitely brothers
and<00:07:11.270> just<00:07:12.270> the<00:07:12.390> way<00:07:12.510> that<00:07:12.660> this<00:07:12.780> game<00:07:13.020> is<00:07:13.050> i

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.230 
and just the way that this game is i

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.930 
and just the way that this game is i
think<00:07:13.410> it's<00:07:13.710> the<00:07:13.800> same<00:07:13.980> as<00:07:14.010> football<00:07:14.550> manager

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
think it's the same as football manager

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.820 
think it's the same as football manager
when<00:07:15.180> it<00:07:15.300> generates<00:07:15.690> regions<00:07:16.080> like<00:07:16.170> that<00:07:16.440> but

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830
