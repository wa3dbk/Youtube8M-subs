00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
deadlift 330 maybe them kind of weights

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.020 
deadlift 330 maybe them kind of weights
genuinely<00:03:04.630> do<00:03:05.630> scare<00:03:05.989> me<00:03:06.019> either<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:07.760> fear<00:03:08.000> of

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
genuinely do scare me either the fear of

genuinely do scare me either the fear of
like<00:03:08.360> failing<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.260> them<00:03:09.410> weights<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:09.830> quite

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
like failing to them weights is quite

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.770 
like failing to them weights is quite
high<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.489> obviously<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.239> risk<00:03:11.420> associated

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
high and obviously the risk associated

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.020 
high and obviously the risk associated
with<00:03:12.110> out<00:03:12.200> with<00:03:12.320> injuries<00:03:12.709> if<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.519> want<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.850> be<00:03:14.000> a
