the<00:04:32.600> little<00:04:32.810> halo<00:04:32.960> 2<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.700> personally<00:04:35.090> felt

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
the little halo 2 and I personally felt

the little halo 2 and I personally felt
like<00:04:35.570> Halo<00:04:35.870> 2<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.140> halo<00:04:36.230> 3<00:04:36.650> were<00:04:36.830> almost

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
like Halo 2 and halo 3 were almost

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.410 
like Halo 2 and halo 3 were almost
exactly<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.790> same<00:04:39.400> except<00:04:40.400> for<00:04:40.460> halo<00:04:40.940> 3<00:04:41.240> had

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
exactly the same except for halo 3 had

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.170 
exactly the same except for halo 3 had
better<00:04:41.660> graphics<00:04:42.340> overall<00:04:43.340> that<00:04:43.880> made<00:04:44.060> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
better graphics overall that made the

game<00:04:44.210> better<00:04:44.630> for<00:04:44.840> me<00:04:44.990> because<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.320> think<00:04:45.530> for

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
game better for me because I think for

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.710 
game better for me because I think for
me<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.950> see<00:04:46.100> my<00:04:46.250> target<00:04:46.640> you<00:04:47.060> shoot<00:04:47.300> it<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:47.600> all

that kind of stuff but other than that I

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.830
