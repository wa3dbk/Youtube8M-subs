very important I think I think that kind

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.720 
very important I think I think that kind
of<00:01:20.050> practice<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.500> very<00:01:20.800> counterproductive<00:01:21.130> I

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
of practice is very counterproductive I

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.150 
of practice is very counterproductive I
discovered<00:01:22.570> for<00:01:22.660> myself<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.170> other<00:01:23.650> students

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.700 
more positive approach I probably a
mistake<00:01:45.820> or<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.360> fresh<00:01:46.630> frustrating<00:01:47.470> part<00:01:47.650> of

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
mistake or a fresh frustrating part of

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.230 
mistake or a fresh frustrating part of
the<00:01:47.800> piece<00:01:47.980> yeah<00:01:48.190> instead<00:01:48.670> of<00:01:48.790> approaching<00:01:49.000> it

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
the piece yeah instead of approaching it

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.390 
the piece yeah instead of approaching it
from<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.600> negative<00:01:50.590> aspect<00:01:51.010> right<00:01:51.160> well

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
from the negative aspect right well

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.920 
from the negative aspect right well
because<00:01:51.670> then<00:01:51.820> you<00:01:51.910> become<00:01:52.030> irrational<00:01:52.780> and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
because then you become irrational and

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.220 
because then you become irrational and
panicked<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.980> that<00:01:54.730> creates<00:01:55.720> all<00:01:55.870> sorts<00:01:55.930> of

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
panicked and that creates all sorts of

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.200 
panicked and that creates all sorts of
problems<00:01:56.290> so<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.040> better<00:01:57.490> go<00:01:57.640> balls<00:01:57.940> at

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
problems so it is better go balls at

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.870 
problems so it is better go balls at
that<00:01:58.330> point<00:01:58.570> totally<00:01:59.380> snowballs<00:01:59.710> so<00:01:59.950> just<00:02:00.400> you

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
that point totally snowballs so just you

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.870 
that point totally snowballs so just you
know<00:02:00.910> take<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.770> step<00:02:03.040> back<00:02:03.220> take<00:02:03.550> your<00:02:03.700> breath

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
know take a step back take your breath

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.120 
know take a step back take your breath
and<00:02:04.120> then<00:02:04.330> do<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:04.810> again<00:02:04.930> until<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:05.890> get<00:02:06.070> I

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
and then do it again until you get I

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.350 
and then do it again until you get I
mean<00:02:06.430> of<00:02:06.550> course<00:02:06.580> until<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.120> get<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.330> right

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
mean of course until you get it right

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.700 
mean of course until you get it right
but<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.739> complete<00:02:09.039> sentence<00:02:09.310> yeah
