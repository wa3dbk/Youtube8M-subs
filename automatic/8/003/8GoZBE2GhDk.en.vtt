00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.470
 you can be all boys and welcome 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.509
 you know happen to the channel we go today with a 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.480
 video in which I 'm going to show you a 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.309
 program is worth an add-on for the goal what 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.380
 first with this year you can not wade 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.720
 because you are going to change your 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.550
 server spoke to us there is no need to change 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.410
 our way of seeing it and as only 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.189
 it works for us it is not variable 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.189
 good 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.380
 as you can see this is the programmer 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.760
 it opens very fast and you give here to play 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.309
 and you can play perfectly and others 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.500
 you are going to teach what this program brings 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.440
 and then commented how to download it 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.890
 the first is a side that this serves 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.220
 for several things the first thing is 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.980
 bar you see here is worth 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.260
 in many places seen in my life this 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.520
 he does this he crowned me after the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.940
 busts of the jungle 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.589
 obviously this you chronometers from 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.700
 the maximum time for example 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.789
 if a buffoon takes 5 minutes to go out and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.819
 you do push instead of having to 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.439
 writing in your chat the blue burg comes out 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.030
 in three minutes 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.969
 this program is already written to you 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.270
 directly on the map then you 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:26.700
 saves writing time if that does 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.109
 an enemy and lasts five minutes in the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.500
 moment when you see that there is not the 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:34.590
 course starts counting and then when 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.399
 it comes out though not for the five minutes you 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:42.509
 says it's gone is the same as if it's not 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:45.270
 I had it, it's just that you have a count 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.149
 basically from the bus time with 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.009
 nine documents we have first the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.320
 stopwatch that we can activate it 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.840
 turn it off 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.800
 by default the chronometer 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.540
 activated or warns my dad is like a 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.030
 pingÃ¼e when there are wild and on the map 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.340
 where the bus leaves at the moment I will leave 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.900
 if you want to let the team know 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.630
 I have disabled because I do not like that 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.940
 put in the in the chaco is to be 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.790
 lethal so much in so much time I want to have 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.250
 estimates will put the blue group of 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.740
 Purple equipment comes out in 20 seconds and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.720
 always going to put the same thing goes for 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.440
 put the total bus of the equipment such it comes out 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.440
 in 20 seconds 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.900
 obviously only for your team if 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.999
 you want the time in the mini map to 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.829
 that for example those dots or a 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.769
 just under 2 minutes 44 seconds 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:39.570
 also to keep and the chronometer of 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:42.930
 the jungle is the bar is 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.240
 we have ski changer 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.190
 we have all the skin ground 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.590
 and free 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:57.650
 for example I will explain I have no 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.200
 I have is that I want to buy 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.049
 to give an example is here but 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.930
 Of course I do not want to spend the 1,300 rivers 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:09.500
 because it costs but to know if I like what 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:13.189
 I do so I come here and said hey can 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.709
 approve it clicked and I put it apply and 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.599
 within the smell very important when it 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.280
 we have them champion we have to put the 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.470
 classical 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.890
 agree that when we can 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.110
 let's see our character with the 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.910
 skin that we have selected our 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.910
 team and the opposing team are going to 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.670
 see with this one with the classic one for this is 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.350
 so it is not variable of the person 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.840
 I use this 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.700
 this a gift because everyone sees it 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.690
 normal except for us but 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.540
 let's see with the impressions we have 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.400
 within the same game when you were in 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.650
 champion action where usually the 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.480
 several of the opposite team we get the 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.610
 face of the character we would face 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.300
 of the world 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.740
 we puncture him and we get that same menu and 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.620
 we can say that we 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.620
 we want very well I tell you that more 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.950
 paths of those two quick mentions 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.050
 in case you do not go time here for example hey 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.860
 that they have to do 20 for costumes of the 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:18.770
 psuv in picture anything this you what 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.770
 they bring we can put them I do not know 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.099
 Hello 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.400
 friends of the channel and me when I give to of 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.580
 plus the number two that stays here goes to 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.580
 go out 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:40.259
 in the chat hello channel friends just going 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.259
 to leave in the Allied chat 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.979
 captured allows us to capture the 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.689
 screen save them where we want and the 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.009
 format that we want because there are many 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.969
 times that you try and impression of 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.919
 screen and they do not let you 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:53.899
 humble ways change the kind of 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.669
 cursor I personally have to 

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:57.639
 defined that which I like and we can 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.460
 change 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.580
 the skin of the war is worth me for example 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.150
 I have put is very good but in the 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.550
 within the topic costs it is worth it is 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.990
 the one that gives us the one we got from 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:17.920
 of silver in season 3 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:20.350
 then additional but if I inside 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.570
 of the sun I put the skin of the war is the 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.360
 of all the normal life that I have 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:29.860
 put is in the program I'm going to see 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.660
 my war with the recipe to this one but my 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.760
 team and the opposing team are going to 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.130
 see from the normal skin of all life 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.490
 of the guard why you can not bathe 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.290
 because you're just going to see it and now I'm going 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.460
 to put good commented that that mold 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.460
 abbas has a history worth 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.590
 possibly do not charge because as 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.040
 I have the computer will not load 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.250
 in a forum in case you want anything 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.250
 OK 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:08.890
 as it is external Carlos is called m 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.890
 I'm going because he's Portuguese 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:16.510
 you go very easily to www.emera.com 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:27.210
 and this is where you put all the plugins 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:29.700
 it's so easy, everything you click on 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.440
 will download and is a normal installer 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.910
 next next next next 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.910
 next until finished 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:41.750
 when this law goes doctor registers is 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.480
 do not worry , they take our account 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.330
 nobody is going to steal the account the account 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.370
 will happen to an uncle who wants 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.890
 anything 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.960
 it's safe I did not expect at first 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:58.400
 is I say to see if I like it or not I do not 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:00.150
 worry that it does not work for you and there 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.010
 stays 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.440
 I'm also going to ask you to link her age 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:07.670
 so that to make a record of 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.340
 all the victories that you know what 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.590
 I turned on and he caused the program to open 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.510
 balboa say today you've done a few more than 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.280
 today he has done down to right against 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.260
 collected so many victories 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.770
 will also give you the history of everything 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.540
 the roll and either I can not say anything 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.630
 more because there is nothing else very easy and 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:30.270
 will be quite useful rivers has not said 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.830
 nothing that the people who use it will be 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.710
 banned 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:37.080
 then it can be used until further notice 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:39.150
 and nothing if you liked the video you can 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.710
 give it a like you can comment if you want 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:46.020
 you can pass it to your friends so that 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:49.410
 later to prove him here he does not know 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:51.090
 spend the foolish money 2019 here and we 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.300
 we see in the next prison up 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.300
 then
