00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.959 
sweet in this one after we saw a couple
of<00:00:10.410> Swain's<00:00:10.679> already<00:00:11.190> what<00:00:11.639> did<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.820> make<00:00:11.940> of

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
of Swain's already what did you make of

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.910 
of Swain's already what did you make of
the<00:00:12.150> pic<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.570> one<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.990> actually<00:00:13.500> really

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
the pic in this one I actually really

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.440 
the pic in this one I actually really
like<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> swing<00:00:14.340> versus<00:00:14.670> meraki<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.360> they

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
like the swing versus meraki but they

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.000 
like the swing versus meraki but they
really<00:00:15.719> needed<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.020> force<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.500> into<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> 1v1

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
really needed to force it into the 1v1

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.160 
really needed to force it into the 1v1
so<00:00:17.880> unless<00:00:18.210> they<00:00:18.390> can<00:00:18.510> get<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.720> decent<00:00:19.080> one

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
so unless they can get that decent one

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.420 
so unless they can get that decent one
be<00:00:19.289> one<00:00:19.439> where<00:00:19.590> he<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.800> bully<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.220> have<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
be one where he can bully and have that

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.800 
be one where he can bully and have that
bully<00:00:20.640> matchup<00:00:21.060> he<00:00:21.270> really<00:00:21.480> doesn't<00:00:21.689> have

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
bully matchup he really doesn't have

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.570 
bully matchup he really doesn't have
that<00:00:21.960> much<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.230> an<00:00:22.320> impact<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.710> lane<00:00:22.890> phase<00:00:23.100> but

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
that much of an impact in lane phase but

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.160 
that much of an impact in lane phase but
when<00:00:23.699> they<00:00:23.789> started<00:00:24.060> getting<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.359> going<00:00:24.570> we

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
when they started getting that going we

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.929 
when they started getting that going we
could<00:00:25.320> survive<00:00:25.590> many<00:00:25.920> gangs<00:00:26.310> by<00:00:26.550> flashing

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
could survive many gangs by flashing

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.880 
could survive many gangs by flashing
walls<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.359> surviving<00:00:27.779> long<00:00:27.930> enough<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.740> yeah

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
walls and surviving long enough and yeah

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.839 
walls and surviving long enough and yeah
I<00:00:28.920> think<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> really<00:00:29.429> good<00:00:29.609> pick<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:29.789> by

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
I think it was a really good pick up by

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.880 
I think it was a really good pick up by
him<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.720> also<00:00:30.900> had<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:31.349> are<00:00:31.560> some<00:00:31.740> very

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
him and also had there are some very

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.290 
him and also had there are some very
good<00:00:32.009> snares<00:00:32.309> extra<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> team<00:00:33.059> fights

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
good snares extra in the team fights

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.209

fights<00:02:50.579> but<00:02:50.819> instead<00:02:51.150> SK<00:02:51.480> gaming<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.810> keep

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
fights but instead SK gaming it keep

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.509 
fights but instead SK gaming it keep
doing<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.260> same<00:02:52.319> deal<00:02:52.590> they<00:02:52.620> never<00:02:53.160> want<00:02:53.459> to

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
doing the same deal they never want to

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.740 
doing the same deal they never want to
buy<00:02:53.640> these<00:02:53.790> walls<00:02:54.000> like<00:02:54.209> him<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.599> just

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
buy these walls like him and it just

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.970 
buy these walls like him and it just
makes<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.049> hard<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.709> them<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.829> actually

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
makes it so hard for them to actually

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.979 
makes it so hard for them to actually
play<00:02:56.250> until<00:02:56.430> i<00:02:56.519> came<00:02:56.579> i'd<00:02:57.390> like<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.690> point<00:02:57.840> out

and yet so far all right then I want to

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.830 
and yet so far all right then I want to
