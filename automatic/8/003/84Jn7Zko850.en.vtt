00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
is the digital world and a physical

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.380 
is the digital world and a physical
world<00:01:14.909> still<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.780> separate<00:01:16.340> I<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:17.880> curious<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
world still so separate I was curious I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.310 
world still so separate I was curious I
didn't<00:01:18.570> know<00:01:18.630> anything<00:01:18.810> about<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> toy

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
didn't know anything about the toy

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
didn't know anything about the toy
industry<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> did<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> ton<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.030> research

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
industry when it did a ton of research

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
industry when it did a ton of research
found<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.500> quickly<00:01:22.619> why<00:01:23.189> they're<00:01:23.430> so

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
found out very quickly why they're so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.660 
found out very quickly why they're so
very<00:01:23.820> separate<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:25.170> all<00:01:25.320> about<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
very separate it's all about the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
very separate it's all about the
difficulty<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.840> long<00:01:28.080> timing<00:01:28.710> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
difficulty and the long timing of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.819 
difficulty and the long timing of
manufacturing<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.049> set<00:01:31.350> off<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.680> try

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
manufacturing and then set off to try

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.840 
manufacturing and then set off to try
and<00:01:31.979> bring<00:01:32.100> them<00:01:32.220> together<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.549> bit<00:01:32.759> more

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and bring them together a bit more

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.289 
and bring them together a bit more
there's<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.600> very<00:01:33.720> interesting<00:01:34.909> issue<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
there's a very interesting issue at the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.359 
there's a very interesting issue at the
center<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.689> which<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.380> injection

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
center of this which is that injection

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.830 
center of this which is that injection
molding<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> way<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> physical

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
molding the way that the physical

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.350 
molding the way that the physical
industry<00:01:40.170> has<00:01:40.350> worked<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> very<00:01:40.950> long<00:01:41.130> time

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
industry has worked for a very long time

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.330 
industry has worked for a very long time
requires<00:01:42.360> huge<00:01:43.140> volumes<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> same<00:01:44.040> thing

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
requires huge volumes of the same thing

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.160 
requires huge volumes of the same thing
to<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.610> made<00:01:44.790> whereas<00:01:45.149> 3d<00:01:45.450> printing<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
to be made whereas 3d printing is the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.260 
to be made whereas 3d printing is the
complete<00:01:46.470> opposite<00:01:46.799> exactly<00:01:47.369> exactly<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.210> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
complete opposite exactly exactly so it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.719 
complete opposite exactly exactly so it
felt<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.130> think<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> lot<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> people<00:01:50.430> say

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
felt like I think a lot of people say

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.340 
felt like I think a lot of people say
it's<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> replace<00:01:51.450> traditional

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
it's going to replace traditional

the<00:03:30.409> basic<00:03:30.829> idea<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.489> fit<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.419> it<00:03:32.599> does<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.019> we

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
the basic idea to fit and it does so we

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.530 
the basic idea to fit and it does so we
show<00:03:33.620> these<00:03:33.799> two<00:03:34.010> kids<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:35.090> way<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.359> works

with with making love when you take a
doll<00:05:24.870> into<00:05:25.229> those<00:05:25.410> me<00:05:25.620> so<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:26.070> moment<00:05:26.460> the

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
doll into those me so the moment the

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.490 
doll into those me so the moment the
site<00:05:26.760> in<00:05:26.910> the<00:05:26.940> app<00:05:27.120> is<00:05:27.360> effectively<00:05:28.110> just<00:05:28.380> a

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
site in the app is effectively just a

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.530 
site in the app is effectively just a
doll<00:05:28.710> builder<00:05:29.100> it's<00:05:29.310> kind<00:05:29.430> of<00:05:29.550> warm<00:05:29.729> way<00:05:29.970> path

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
doll builder it's kind of warm way path

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.900 
doll builder it's kind of warm way path
and<00:05:30.960> when<00:05:31.620> we<00:05:31.740> started<00:05:32.220> this<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.550> whole<00:05:32.700> idea

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
and when we started this the whole idea

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.150 
and when we started this the whole idea
was<00:05:33.330> virtual<00:05:33.900> goods<00:05:34.050> produce<00:05:34.560> physical<00:05:35.040> goods

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
was virtual goods produce physical goods

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.270 
was virtual goods produce physical goods
and<00:05:35.580> so<00:05:35.850> in<00:05:36.750> games<00:05:37.110> you<00:05:37.410> have<00:05:37.650> things<00:05:38.160> like

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
and so in games you have things like

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.850 
and so in games you have things like
leveling<00:05:38.760> up<00:05:38.910> and<00:05:39.150> rares<00:05:39.600> and<00:05:40.020> epics<00:05:40.350> and<00:05:40.650> all

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
leveling up and rares and epics and all

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.260 
leveling up and rares and epics and all
of<00:05:40.979> that<00:05:41.010> kind<00:05:41.130> of<00:05:41.340> stuff<00:05:41.550> you<00:05:41.700> know<00:05:41.790> an<00:05:41.910> item

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
of that kind of stuff you know an item

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.240 
of that kind of stuff you know an item
that<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:42.510> have<00:05:42.630> to<00:05:42.750> earn<00:05:42.930> or<00:05:43.320> that<00:05:44.100> you<00:05:44.160> have

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
that you have to earn or that you have

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.010 
that you have to earn or that you have
to<00:05:44.370> find<00:05:44.610> doing<00:05:44.850> someone<00:05:45.180> kind<00:05:45.360> of<00:05:45.419> amazing

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
to find doing someone kind of amazing

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.990 
to find doing someone kind of amazing
quest<00:05:46.229> or<00:05:46.410> whatever<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:46.800> we<00:05:47.610> always<00:05:47.760> thought

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
quest or whatever and we always thought

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.600 
quest or whatever and we always thought
that<00:05:48.060> would<00:05:48.419> be<00:05:48.540> just<00:05:48.660> brilliant<00:05:49.229> when

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
that would be just brilliant when

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.740 
that would be just brilliant when
associated<00:05:50.610> with<00:05:50.700> toys<00:05:50.880> so<00:05:51.150> when<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.630> game

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
associated with toys so when the game

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.750 
associated with toys so when the game
comes<00:05:51.930> in<00:05:52.140> it's<00:05:53.010> going<00:05:53.220> to<00:05:53.280> launch<00:05:53.400> in<00:05:53.669> the

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
comes in it's going to launch in the

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.250 
comes in it's going to launch in the
fall<00:05:53.789> in<00:05:54.150> the<00:05:54.330> autumn<00:05:56.300> there'll<00:05:57.300> be<00:05:57.390> digital

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
fall in the autumn there'll be digital

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.080 
fall in the autumn there'll be digital
goods<00:05:58.440> in<00:05:58.620> their<00:05:58.800> physical<00:05:59.310> goods<00:05:59.700> there'll

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
goods in their physical goods there'll

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.150 
goods in their physical goods there'll
be<00:06:00.120> things<00:06:00.390> that<00:06:00.600> you<00:06:00.840> can<00:06:01.050> earn<00:06:01.350> by<00:06:01.800> doing

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
be things that you can earn by doing

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.800 
be things that you can earn by doing
stuff<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:02.610> then<00:06:02.729> we'll<00:06:02.850> grow<00:06:03.030> that<00:06:03.300> over<00:06:03.630> time

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
stuff and then we'll grow that over time

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.020 
stuff and then we'll grow that over time
and<00:06:04.169> so<00:06:04.380> ultimately<00:06:04.710> kids<00:06:05.550> can<00:06:05.760> not<00:06:05.910> only

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
and so ultimately kids can not only

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.810 
and so ultimately kids can not only
create<00:06:06.660> a<00:06:06.690> character<00:06:06.990> but<00:06:07.979> their<00:06:08.340> character

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
create a character but their character

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.940 
create a character but their character
will<00:06:08.970> have<00:06:09.120> stuff<00:06:09.630> that<00:06:10.020> maybe<00:06:10.169> their<00:06:10.440> friends

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
will have stuff that maybe their friends

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.770 
will have stuff that maybe their friends
have<00:06:11.430> to<00:06:11.580> then<00:06:11.700> go<00:06:11.910> and<00:06:12.030> do<00:06:12.240> or<00:06:12.479> they<00:06:12.570> have<00:06:12.690> to

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
have to then go and do or they have to

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.690 
have to then go and do or they have to
do<00:06:12.870> something<00:06:13.380> together<00:06:13.530> to<00:06:13.979> earn<00:06:14.160> so<00:06:14.430> you

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
do something together to earn so you

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.010 
do something together to earn so you

somebody<00:06:51.570> to<00:06:51.720> prove<00:06:52.080> the<00:06:52.260> market<00:06:52.710> then<00:06:52.860> they

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
somebody to prove the market then they

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.760 
somebody to prove the market then they
come<00:06:53.130> in<00:06:53.280> and<00:06:53.490> probably<00:06:54.330> buy<00:06:54.540> them<00:06:54.810> so<00:06:55.350> they

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
come in and probably buy them so they

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.650 
come in and probably buy them so they
may<00:06:56.190> they<00:06:56.490> tend<00:06:56.790> to<00:06:56.880> move<00:06:57.060> in<00:06:57.270> the<00:06:57.360> kind<00:06:57.540> of

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
may they tend to move in the kind of

may they tend to move in the kind of

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
I'm thinking beyond this space that

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 
I bought my home 3d printer now why

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.260 
I bought my home 3d printer now why
can't<00:07:52.230> i<00:07:52.320> print<00:07:52.350> you<00:07:53.100> know<00:07:53.220> chocolate<00:07:53.940> cake<00:07:54.120> on

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:54.270 
can't i print you know chocolate cake on

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.630 
can't i print you know chocolate cake on
it<00:07:54.420> or<00:07:54.780> whatever<00:07:55.200> and<00:07:55.590> so<00:07:56.220> there'll<00:07:56.520> be<00:07:56.550> a

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:56.640 
it or whatever and so there'll be a

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.400 
it or whatever and so there'll be a
little<00:07:56.820> bit<00:07:57.000> of<00:07:57.120> that<00:07:57.300> but<00:07:57.570> fundamentally<00:07:58.380> I

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:58.410 
little bit of that but fundamentally I

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.890 
little bit of that but fundamentally I
don't<00:07:58.770> think<00:07:58.980> it's<00:07:59.130> a<00:07:59.190> problem<00:07:59.310> because<00:07:59.900> this

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 
don't think it's a problem because this

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.070 
don't think it's a problem because this
is<00:08:01.200> only<00:08:01.500> getting<00:08:02.160> better<00:08:02.640> and<00:08:03.060> more<00:08:03.540> varied

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 
is only getting better and more varied

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.590 
is only getting better and more varied
and<00:08:04.260> more

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:04.600 
and more

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.750 
and more
interesting<00:08:05.020> and<00:08:05.200> cheaper<00:08:05.740> on<00:08:05.890> a<00:08:05.920> daily<00:08:06.190> basis

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:06.760 
interesting and cheaper on a daily basis

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.180 
interesting and cheaper on a daily basis
so<00:08:07.120> Alice<00:08:07.930> Taylor<00:08:08.140> thank<00:08:08.440> you<00:08:08.530> very<00:08:08.740> much<00:08:08.890> than

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:09.190 
so Alice Taylor thank you very much than

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.030 
so Alice Taylor thank you very much than
really<00:08:09.580> interesting
