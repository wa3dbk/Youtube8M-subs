00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.769

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.329
 for another gta video here 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.240
 my channel today with the second part 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.560
 from logitech now six days until 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.560
 for the official release then next 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.000
 week on 17 9 and today we play one 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670
 round he goes live two times this time 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.240
 Commented So what do logically 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.260
 and that 's it goes on came 30 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.740
 september 1999 for the pc out and am 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.670
 25 october then still for the playstation 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:43.160
 1 and the gameboy color on pc it became 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.730
 at that time in the usa with one 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.730
 marked everything done 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.370
 So go like a mark from 18 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.200
 because sport also gave a speech output 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.559
 then what on the playstation on the 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.780
 Gameboy's luck was missing 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.460
 the first details about the game 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.899
 As I said I apologize 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.300
 if you might casually times ne 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.149
 has worked out their suggestions of the keys 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.340
 I can not avoid nature and therefore 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.200
 he goes two as I said two came 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.509
 years later and out 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.909
 graphic really a boost to 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.369
 first part there were for the first time 3d models 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.950
 like the cars and also for example the building 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.570
 you can see that the buildings are very nice 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.079
 3d are animated and i would be one 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:30.119
 were like in gta 1 also the 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:32.250
 Coloring winter games will be then 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.520
 already much more beautiful than the first 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.100
 let part of a pretty bland gm 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.200
 therefore , what did not happen 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.750
 a lot of fun the first he goes what 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.580
 I had not played a lot right 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.099
 like part 1 so i meant i too 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.319
 but not as much as we played 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:53.909
 then the second part last endes and 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.179
 where I always have to show up too 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.840
 a few skis by the way and out 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.700
 a given 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.459
 it would just be a little boring 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.439
 been and if we already on the subject 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.149
 weapons come then it is first time 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.329
 great arsenal of weapons then I go that 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:14.120
 There were four weapons here 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:18.389
 some times a rocket launcher 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.660
 Einstrom shocker he was me please 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:24.000
 people just kind of skeleton 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.650
 then turn me on again 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.650
 God is always able to throw extremely far 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.790
 Of course, we do not even realize it 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.610
 has me still grenades then another 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.610
 Pump does not hit properly 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.500
 The people do not manage one more 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.630
 slice of the company schiebel is working 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.209
 Like a laser pistol in the Oscar 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.860
 Knowledge quiz expands with sacrifice 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.350
 then you see the shot 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.900
 swiss side especially when he goes 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.230
 once with this globe like a typical one 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:17.470
 akad go from nintendo at that time or 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:19.360
 even cinema is 2 at a time to the 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.680
 include city say here you have in the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.060
 The city has played it so far in the 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.739
 history only once existed 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.480
 the city is here anyway city and in 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.690
 three islands so three urban area 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.460
 you split that too 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.700
 unlock fabric once industrieriese 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.319
 resident evil and in and below and 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.329
 animal species 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:45.010
 downtown and very nicely done 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.560
 As I said I would have been unique 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.989
 in gt2 otherwise never again massive matter 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.060
 damage model we knew you 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.739
 right pane harbor of the 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.680
 bird's-eye view from the left 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.859
 headlight broken 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.510
 others really play little hours 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.040
 I realize that is what I would say 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.329
 here curves was fallen 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.060
 automatically back to the right one 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:10.090
 So neither I was brought up 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.730
 always in the track when I am 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.410
 in many frank frankfurt you stop 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.720
 not but there should be a bit 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.840
 I already had it naked so I have it too 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:29.009
 already completely wrong 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:29.009
 I like to make quite a lot of damage here 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.890
 What the next innovation was here 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.900
 also a gear indicator to the left 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.890
 Here you can see on the doctors 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.000
 island one had yakuza other one 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:50.550
 video here is 58 on the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.570
 rednecks there were the batteries firmly akw 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.770
 if i have 99 gangs per city three gangs and 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.630
 whichever against the mission 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.950
 is the respect in the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.690
 others went down and you 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.760
 became one of the packages of their territory 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.140
 was and then he is this one of those bars 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.480
 how to look around now in the middle 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.650
 the gangs because of the respective stop not 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.150
 work was always down 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.390
 went 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:17.400
 exactly the problem soon for those then 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.070
 conditions really a world first 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.510
 so you try for real car too 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:26.190
 get their fat, to be precise money from to 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.230
 the best of the zg has so with 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.370
 the cr-z on top of the car was the car 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.740
 damn fast that is very good too 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.720
 like 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.460
 but also two stars but that 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.680
 are us without the two boys 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.990
 police dome and made funny and 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.230
 I am a car driver 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.790
 supplied planegg point 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.750
 and if you have normal shooting 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.150
 we are ten points 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.820
 I think I'm well armed 20 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.320
 and for what else had to consider as well 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.900
 that's how it was 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.170
 The act was won by several countries accident 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.170
 Has 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.530
 Soccer 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.240
 made 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:15.150
 st 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.150
 because at 80 points remained 40 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.810
 brothers and has now disappeared 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.000
 and so slowly the end chance is there 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.820
 not so sporty if to show here 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.980
 I'm so much at stake 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.280
 It's been a long time here 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.280
 came in 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:54.169
 no idea i have no idea 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:59.120
 50 points gives what we lost 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:07:04.060
 have you come up with something ? 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:13.130

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:16.160

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.600
 the first time that in three-dimensional 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.010
 gta 3 that was the reason industry set for 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.960
 all previous theaters in the way 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:40.380

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.010
 year 2001 I became aware of this 

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.200
