at New Orleans there's going to be a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.550 
at New Orleans there's going to be a
couple<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.400> teams<00:02:57.610> like<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.450> my<00:02:59.200> feeling

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
couple of teams like that and my feeling

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.370 
couple of teams like that and my feeling
is<00:02:59.680> it's<00:02:59.920> eight<00:03:00.400> why<00:03:01.239> not<00:03:01.420> think<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.780> Kings

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
is it's eight why not think the Kings

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.280 
is it's eight why not think the Kings
could<00:03:02.650> be<00:03:02.830> one<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.280> those<00:03:03.430> teams<00:03:05.310> 2008-2009

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
could be one of those teams 2008-2009

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.290 
could be one of those teams 2008-2009
