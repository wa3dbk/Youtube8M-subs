00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.370
 grace and peace on the part of the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.810
 lord jesus christ our lord that 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.160
 that frees us from death 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:15.330
 It's also called in my friend, my 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.730
 Friend, ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.119
 tell a revelation that there was 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.890
 I think it was two revelations I received 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.500
 an agreement was new converted house 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.820
 has just accept me as jesus 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.960
 lord of my life and the other 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:41.370
 It was just when I was in the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.129
 walk mid-course and so on. 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.289
 the first one was new and already 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.149
 He had gone is who has just arrived in 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:55.770
 church and sleep and I had almost no dream. 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:00.629
 no, but then she was asleep until 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:06.299
 My mother's bed and when I woke up I saw 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.500
 on the wall a man who is not and I think 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.350
 it was not jesus 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.810
 I was in ours, I think it was a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.299
 angel could be an angel I thought 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.560
 was god is the thought it was jesus because 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.360
 I was Catholic at the time I was Catholic 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.439
 it's clothes is not rational 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.960
 I was more or less however I was going to 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:34.140
 the church from time to time 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:39.840
 and so I saw an angel was spreading 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.280
 hand to me there behind him had a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.409
 huge paradise 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.100
 however of gold as it is written in 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.369
 book of apocalypse and extending the hand 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.549
 for me being here, holding my hand 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:59.369
 of this angel when I held this hand 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.030
 angel started a vision in front of me 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.460
 in my 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.780
 Before my eyes saying if you 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:12.620
 It will be with me if you will be found 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.540
 dead who is that question 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.720
 Then of course you think of dying a dream. 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.989
 die Sunday and then started listening 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.580
 my mother crying she said it's not only 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.730
 to have the angel's hand 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.440
 then he gave me a second chance 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.150
 This time when I held his hand, he 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.700
 said a word that I never had 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.780
 I've heard in my life that you want 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.030
 say that if you take your mother says more 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.650
 that he is not worthy of me and that 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:49.190
 It was the first dream and I woke up and 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.040
 tell us time was up to my brother and the 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:58.609
 that the colleague of mine 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:59.870
 and so we saw and I live, no, do not talk 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.810
 for them 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.670
 Is that Jesus thing I thought back then? 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:11.299
 but today I saw that it was an angel of the Lord 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:17.329
 it was not jesus it 's the second dream well 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:20.359
 The second dream was in the house of 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:23.389
 a colleague, my fast things 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:26.709
 things that happened was in the 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:30.950
 home at the house of a colleague of mine 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.530
 does not seem so a dream even was a 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.370
 bit confusing business and it was a dream 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.569
 translation and see contradiction 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.040
 and in this dream 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.739
 I was looking at Brother Domingo on the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.239
 domingão was lying on the couch having 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:53.180
 in the house of a colleague of mine who is not going 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:04:05.780
 cite the name and andré sp and pro cielo 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:08.120
 there were three light and in the sky but then 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.989
 when I looked at the sky again I went to the moon 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.239
 blood color 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:19.160
 andré luís branco 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:22.219
 Frank moves to pick and place when he is 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.470
 that white line was decreased in the 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:26.620
 expectancy 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.560
 won when I saw something white but not so 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.620
 the light that was there when 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.490
 I hit my hand like this in the sky, no 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:43.380
 when I went out looking in the total sky in the 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:46.240
 my room is and that's when I was there 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.210
 I realized that I had not been raptured 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:54.490
 I saw it was a dream and then come the re 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:58.920
 came the revelation of the three streets that you 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:03.310
 saw was the father the son and the holy spirit 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:08.230
 and to the moon the color of blood is what goes 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:11.050
 happen and the light and it catching coming from 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.930
 seeking is the previous rapture of 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.580
 surprise for everyone to be called and 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.590
 few are the chosen ones 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.100
 He did not say if it 's written, I'm 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.350
 saying now take heed unto jesus comes 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.600
 as a thief at night 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.790
 who will perceive or see the form that 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.380
 you do not realize 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.680
 Calm, you did not know Jesus or I know. 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.060
 huh 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:40.510
 looks will come and all that was love that 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.490
 was a pilot will resurrect the 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:48.790
 dead will work as it is written 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:52.570
 in the holy scriptures and where are you? 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:58.479

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.830
 terrible crew will be okay for me

 Are you in the world going to run for Jesus? 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.560
 Jesus is good, he wants to save the 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.919
 It was better, the better. 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:13.479

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:16.740
