00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.130
 hello friends today I'm going to present you a 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.040
 departure of the great Russian chess player 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.040
 alexandr alióshin or alec and how do you 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.439
 they called some and in the same we are going to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.029
 see an interesting one is the fairy who 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.910
 they have white pieces driven 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.550
 masterfully by the fourth champion 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.490
 world alexandra l'équipe 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.920
 the game starts with 4 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:35.140
 is 5 and bishop 64 this is the opening of 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.050
 the lpf and it 's a pretty opening 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.059
 interesting very seen in games 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.970
 fast and especially in games of 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.030
 beginners but it is a vegetable that 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.160
 It allows us from the beginning and 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.949
 also suggest the contrary position 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.910
 that we do not go out as usual 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.370
 move with the horse to efe de 3 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.970
 before this movement, Black plays a 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.750
 horse 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:06.210
 efe six white closed the exit 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.210
 at the turn of the sun philco of 3 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.039
 Bishop 65 reporting black attacking 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.500
 the point of f2 of white the future 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:21.460
 white castling 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 the plant responds on an easel 3 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.020
 Of 6 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.270
 is this movement allows already the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.380
 exit of the rows and squares white 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.750
 black fabrics 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.219
 and at this moment White makes a 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.840
 pretty interesting movement that is 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.899
 f4 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.960
 Efe four preparing and leaving the 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:46.260
 horse to f3 and for that reason not the well 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 developed and at the same time they are 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.100
 preparing a future castling to have 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.640
 the possibility of opening the column 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:59.670
 taking on the 5 or once blacks 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.350
 take back with the bishop and keep the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.860
 column open for a possible attack 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.259
 given the position already of his bishop in the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.099
 box 13 4 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.099
 to this advance 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.920
 Blacks developed their horse 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.920
 6 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.400
 white was f3 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.690
 Black took the opportunity to nail the 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.690
 f3 horse 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.890
 and right now as we can see 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.020
 Blacks need the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.920
 castling to place the tower in the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.710
 column 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.230
 efe therefore must try to 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.900
 eliminate the black squared bishop that 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.560
 is the one that prevents the castling therefore 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.920
 someone plays 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.530
 horse to four 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.770
 is pressing the horse forgiveness to 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.770
 bishop 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.010
 and black 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.450
 instead of giving check as the bishop or 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.379
 remove it backwards so that the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:04.800
 catch do not double a central decide 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.960
 Black for capturing the pawn of f4 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.180
 something that someone quickly captures 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.280
 black box bishop 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.280
 Black recovers the piece 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.610
 White captures in f 4 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.650
 and logically the capture of Black 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.120
 while you look 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.310
 has a goal in capturing the pawn 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.190
 tf4 which is none other than surely 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.260
 move the horse from 16 up 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.870
 the box of 5 to attack 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.780
 together with the bishop with another 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.580
 alfil attack the horse f3 at a time 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.870
 that would also 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.670
 problems 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.750
 on the position of the bishop of c4 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.420
 Well, at this moment, Black 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.349
 they played horse h5 playing the bishop of 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.720
 f4 garfil had to back off attacking 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.350
 to the pawn of c 5 and controlling the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.480
 important central box of 4 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.300
 and at this moment and blacks 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.190
 they saw the possibility of making a 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.810
 movement that was going to 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.549
 remember the attack that we were 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.310
 saying earlier that it was about the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.530
 bishop and the f3 knight here would have 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.230
 been very interesting and very necessary 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.260
 cast quickly or have prepared 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.720
 a play a play that will prepare 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.040
 by the way 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.690
 the long castling 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.600
 but Black saw the possibility 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:41.370
 of the double attack on bishop and horse 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.150
 and they used it and right now 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.150
 someone made a pretty nice move 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.350
 that reminds us 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:55.689
 to the typical Tuesday play of legal and 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.429
 captured the 5- horse leaving 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:00.189
 the possibility that the catch in your 

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:03.189
 lady logically blacks in capture 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:05.409
 the lady would lose in the bishop call or 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:10.529
 they would lose the horse they had just 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:13.289
 take therefore captured in lion 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.689
 before the capture of the black 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:19.110
 white 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:23.279
 they eat the boss 7 pawn with check 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.110
 right now the king of playing in in the 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.430
 box that fact would also receive a 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.300
 check 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.040
 with possessive bishop that logically 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.910
 would Black have to deliver his lady 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:39.670
 therefore the king played up to and 7 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.690
 kings 7 likewise the bishop took the 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:47.310
 forgiveness of 5 check king had to 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.710
 Forcibly moving to the center 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:54.810
 and black with white continue 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:57.760
 the attack with short castling with check and 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.640
 forcing black 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.490
 and logically to lock in even more already 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.590
 penetrate further into the position of the 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.730
 white we know well it is known that each 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:13.000
 once the king of one side goes to the 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.590
 opposite piece when it is extracted almost 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.580
 always ends up entering a network of 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.780
 Checkmate as is the case 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.599
 and in the real game Black 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:27.379
 captured the king horse by horse and 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:29.930
 they received checkmate with tower f5 what 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.969
 what happened in the game but good 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.389
 they would have endured a little more and 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:37.280
 they say played for example the king up is 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:41.680
 5 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.680
 they would receive jaque pins 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:49.020
 would cover the horse would be the most logical 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.870
 tower by efe 4 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.300
 and now such a play that 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.419
 would give black wings some of the plays 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.409
 all lead to mate and the loss of 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:03.500
 material let's assume that black 

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:09.370
 they would try 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.370
 to save surfing and how were bishop h5 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.080
 would you give that for example this h 4 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.280
 as p 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.310
 h4 hacking the only possible move would be 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.190
 move the king to g6 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:27.610
 sorry until 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:29.210
 h 6 and they would receive the mate 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.129
 A mate 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:34.550
 very pretty 

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:36.230
 from box 16 with the tower and from 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.500
 the box 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:41.030
 and 3 with the bishop as you can see is a 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.090
 pretty interesting game of which 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.520
 you can get some experience for 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.840
 own games and I hope that they 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.800
 I liked it 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.800
 thank you very much
