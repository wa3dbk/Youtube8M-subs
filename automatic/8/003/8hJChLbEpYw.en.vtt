00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.990
 ah it's beautiful what meaning matt illegal 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.179
 especially for us French because we 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.509
 saw a jimmy fire vicaut at 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.420
 interclubs in 10 02 he's in a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.180
 flamboyant form and he will have two 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.410
 greyhounds next 0.2 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.410
 their number 10 tells me that 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.900
 9 95 for his personal record us 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.510
 had delighted eugene 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.419
 but too windy last year and so 10 0 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.660
 2 in the final of the tourcoing interclubs 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.239
 justin gatlin 9 74 poor of the season to 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.239
 doha and then we still have a very 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.309
 monitored justin gatlin 1.8 that remains 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.790
 on an impressive series of 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.879
 victories 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.320
 he's the next favorite jimmy vicaut he 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.000
 stayed in the stars jennÃ© then 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.710
 that justin went all the way justin 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.720
 gatlin alone he will still put a 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.320
 czink pair may have made it back 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.170
 sterling thank you esteem you 74 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.720
 but lyon earth during this equaled world 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.760
 with a trip certainly in business class 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.100
 he arrives from eugene to ask his 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.520
 suitcases in italy and right away he 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.470
 is sacred emperor extraordinary justin 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.280
 gatlin but I want to say it's not 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.610
 A suprise 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.780
 since doha we know it's his level 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.580
 chronometer 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.650
 he is reminded is the same races he 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.900
 repeat the same thing jimmy I believe in 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.659
 takes a superb second place then 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.990
 michael rodgers was very close to tyson 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.780
 gay to eugene gay tyson ran 9 88 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.850
 just in front of rogers and I think tim 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.710
 illico dominates mike rodgers 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.229
 what does it mean that maybe 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.079
 today with usain bolt who is 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.570
 not yet ready and well jim illico to 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.270
 perhaps it is perhaps now 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.289
 the same level as a gay attention tyson 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.569
 because rogers 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.710
 we said it's typing the offset 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.340
 hourly the nine hours off 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.020
 schedule 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.999
 therefore perhaps it is the same 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.859
 freshness that eugene but I think that 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.020
 what does the jimmy vicaut do in the 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.700
 justin gatlin's stride and well the 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.030
 position as samir said with a 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.580
 departure 1 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.200
 yes is recovering and his fault when he 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.090
 is at the brawl behind keeping the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.500
 goods is really well jimmy way and 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.690
 I learn from the second page concert 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.069
 on michael rogers and eco tax would 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.750
 certainly a time under 10 we're going 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.790
 wait for our but it seems like a 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.530
 chrono under the 10 for jimmy or any 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.270
 close around 10 because there is when 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.180
 even about 2 meters 50 squares 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.430
 but we are at 9 75 aol bcc tuna 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.350
 red be and 1,15 for justin gatlin on 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.060
 is we are very satisfied for jimmy on 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.709
 wish him the best young man 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.760
 cry to fart at me I believe in it I think 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.030
 that it will be under the speeches 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.769
 jimmy level so justin gatlin we 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.040
 had said one to doa I can go over 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.380
 quick 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.030
 look look gatlin grazing foot 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.000
 the stones to dance what's called the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.410
 direct hatch you know the lot foot the 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.810
 big mistake on the departure is 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.319
 leave in heels buttocks and there is this 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.550
 which is called the direct trace is a 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.560
 technical expertise to come up with 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.569
 master his and a foot that at the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.840
 four-wheel drive just after the games 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.269
 olympic los angeles the records of the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.310
 meeting and 9 98 for jimmy lee that he 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.739
 fits under the 10 seconds ahead 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.750
 michael rodgers is superb and he gets 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.090
 clearly positions as a finalist 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.360
 Global potential may have even 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.880
 better 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.829
 howie maybe better sincerely when 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.829
 we saw gay tyson be in the fight
