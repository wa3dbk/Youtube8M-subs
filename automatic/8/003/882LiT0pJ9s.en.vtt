00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.619
 Quick neighbor for you to see how it is. 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.170
 That we do the alpha game, you go. 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.960
 to see that it has no mystery at all 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.210
 less than ten minutes from the Jordan test 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.199
 first a house of people that people 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.019
 use that wafer maria 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.570
 Believe if you want to be wonderful. 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.290
 tasted is made of wafer 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.160
 then that brand that the brand 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.860
 Because she is not cheaper, but she is. 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.140
 a cookie that breaks coconut is more 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.390
 resistant I 've tried other brands 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.309
 you can try also cheaper if 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.590
 find a cockroach who does not want much 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.110
 my daughter because I thought now 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.350
 so this is a perfect brand as well 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.070
 which then yields then paste call 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:07.530
 chocolate for you the ingredients that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.860
 we use is the one that this one sweet 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.180
 fresh linen soy milk serum 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.210
 milk 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.200
 It's not very sweet because it's 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.110
 very sweet 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.180
 if you fix this dulce de leche it's 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.450
 a little brighter than the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:29.130
 normal and he is not as sweet as 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.439
 so this is what we use 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.950
 You can find in the olive market 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.190
 okay then r $ 18 buckets and buckets to give 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.820

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.230

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.960
 market in note 3 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:02:00.020
 the half- bitter chocolate that I find 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.140
 who can find another brand they like 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.830
 but what I like 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.030
 half a bit bitter the chocolate that 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.020
 we use it to cover 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.660
 I wish I told you about another brand 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.370
 cheap challen cheaper 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.370
 this one is around 12 reais 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.030
 White chocolate from the same brand today does not 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.830
 needs to be of the same brand may be a 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.500
 other because only to make the drawing of 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.290
 top 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:35.060
 these are all the leaders 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.080
 Now we 'll just do it to do it. 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.150
 very simple 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.530
 will pick up here is good so is to take part 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.110
 from behind and we will make a good layer 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:53.500
 sweet milk of the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:59.450
 milk whey a chubby 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.120
 close tight makes another layer 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.760
 chubby 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.270
 Look how hard it is brothers how difficult it is. 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.270
 do yourself a favor 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.720
 I bet the little sister is having the 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.550
 same idea as I did when I learned 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.440
 also saying so I do not 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.600
 I think I do not believe it's just that. 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.160
 The one who taught me was marcia marcia 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.570
 even thank you for the opportunity 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.519
 here the people after you have done 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.880
 another tight little camadinha well in 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:46.900
 half will be sticking out is to take a 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:46.900
 cleaned to be able to correct for it 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:57.580
 then the role of a young woman in truth 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.580
 now it's just to vote coverage 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:14.000
 now got to the chocolate part 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.260
 chocolate in pieces so more or less 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.410
 this big 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.209
 It's put there like that in the pot, more or less. 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.650
 somewhat as you can perceive 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.440
 a pot 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.240
 the pot and is already with the chocolate 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.690
 freedom and always work the same 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:40.400
 You can enjoy it, come on, it's okay. 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:42.830
 easy minute to leave one minute later 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.470
 That one minute ago it opens, it moves a little bit. 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.400
 put one more minute later I'll show 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.400
 to you how it is 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:05.600
 Who, how can you see now? 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.180
 to start working but still so 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.250
 bit still has some well there 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.840
 a little there we will only put 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.590
 30 seconds 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.400
 only you can tell if the photo 2 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.620
 minutes and 30 already direct is not going to do 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.570
 I separate so I move because people 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.620
 do not put a 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.020
 chocolate 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:32.270
 so it 's good to make 11 and 30 seconds 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.860
 good now you have to take when the 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.600
 chocolate has to be careful with the 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.729
 chocolate why not cook 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.699
 It covers all the time it can not be proud 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:46.510
 show how chocolate was left 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:50.030
 I stole it from editing 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:54.830
 Now we'll do the following look. 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:06:00.410
 that easy to get to help jo plays there 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:02.050
 inside and here with a 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.000
 spoon help give some runnings 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.360
 chocolate 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.760
 the thicker the chocolate is 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.300
 chocolate will spend so have to 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:20.260
 try to leave it at the right spot because 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.260
 it's more economical, do not rush 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.650
 ran places here on the paper 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:38.580
 is more a chocolate round pick well 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:42.210
 laginhas of place or just a little tap 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.370
 so I like to make one get caught up with 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.050
 spoon are realizing that it is not 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.080
 dripping a lot because chocolate does not 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.360
 It was well on point and it's a little bit 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:56.240
 when he gets so he spends 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.240
 more and ready 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:08.550
 so yes but civil is very easy too 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:11.669
 well now that I used the game everyone is already 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.490
 with the chocolates demanded that he not 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:16.229
 if stands now comes the most chances share 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.180
 after repeating the same form as 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:22.979
 melt the black chocolate melts 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:28.050
 White is got a little bag puts the 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:32.789
 chocolate inside makes a room 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:37.610
 alone a little bit that is 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:37.610
 just spruce so easy 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.560
 not seeing 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.449
 Good people, that's what I had to 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.470
 show you think it was super 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:47.419
 of course not 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.070
 I hope god bless a lot of business 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:51.050
 I ask you to look also at 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:54.759
 me since she's just a different parish one 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.759
 perfect kiss
