here<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:06.960> are<00:00:06.990> with<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.529> new<00:00:08.000> f15<00:00:09.170> from<00:00:10.170> Star

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
here we are with the new f15 from Star

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.390 
here we are with the new f15 from Star
Max<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.580> time<00:00:11.820> they<00:00:12.540> have<00:00:12.660> brought<00:00:12.870> us<00:00:12.900> a

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
Max and this time they have brought us a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.950 
Max and this time they have brought us a
great-looking<00:00:14.400> color<00:00:14.670> scheme<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.660> plane

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
great-looking color scheme this plane

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.710 
great-looking color scheme this plane
will<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.199> very<00:00:16.470> very<00:00:16.710> visible<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> sky

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
will be very very visible in the sky

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.599 
will be very very visible in the sky
here<00:00:18.720> all<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.650> things<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.279> need<00:00:20.430> to

assemble I have just put them on the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:04:25.680 
assemble I have just put them on the
floor<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.720> let's<00:00:24.720> get<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.140> work

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.860 

all<00:04:26.690> that<00:04:27.020> mess<00:04:27.670> was<00:04:28.670> neatly<00:04:29.120> put<00:04:29.510> inside

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
all that mess was neatly put inside

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.290 
all that mess was neatly put inside
already<00:04:30.260> all<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.830> cables<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.970> radio

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
already all the cables the radio

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.070 
already all the cables the radio
receiver<00:04:32.840> is<00:04:33.350> even<00:04:34.240> everything<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.480> connected

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
receiver is even everything is connected

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.610 
receiver is even everything is connected
I'm<00:04:36.560> using<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.040> stock<00:04:37.340> radio<00:04:38.530> projector<00:04:39.530> you

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
I'm using the stock radio projector you

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.130 
I'm using the stock radio projector you
cam<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.130> airplane<00:04:40.580> channel<00:04:41.510> 5<00:04:41.750> for<00:04:42.020> the

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
cam to the airplane channel 5 for the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.860 
cam to the airplane channel 5 for the
gear<00:04:42.350> you're<00:04:42.830> up<00:04:43.070> and<00:04:43.760> you're<00:04:43.970> down<00:04:44.330> is

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
gear you're up and you're down is

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.010 
gear you're up and you're down is
channel<00:04:45.290> 5<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.740> channel<00:04:46.610> 6<00:04:46.970> if<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.630> turn<00:04:47.900> it

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
channel 5 and channel 6 if you turn it

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.460 
channel 5 and channel 6 if you turn it
off<00:04:48.290> you<00:04:48.650> will<00:04:49.520> have<00:04:49.700> only<00:04:50.060> elevators<00:04:50.990> and

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
off you will have only elevators and

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.550 
off you will have only elevators and
rudder<00:04:52.120> which<00:04:53.120> is<00:04:53.300> just<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.750> steering<00:04:54.050> working

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
rudder which is just a steering working

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.770 
rudder which is just a steering working
and<00:04:54.950> if<00:04:55.190> you<00:04:55.280> turn<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.610> on<00:04:55.790> then<00:04:56.300> you<00:04:56.570> have

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
and if you turn it on then you have

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.930 
and if you turn it on then you have
vector<00:04:57.170> thrust<00:04:57.440> system<00:04:57.920> working<00:04:58.700> together

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
vector thrust system working together

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.470 
vector thrust system working together
with<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.450> so<00:05:00.020> that's<00:05:00.890> it<00:05:01.100> for<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.610> Assembly<00:05:02.060> of

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
with it so that's it for the Assembly of

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
with it so that's it for the Assembly of
this<00:05:02.780> beautiful<00:05:03.280> little<00:05:04.280> bird
