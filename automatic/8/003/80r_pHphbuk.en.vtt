00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
which seems impossible to me but uh

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.690 
which seems impossible to me but uh
whatever<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.860> watched<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.040> video<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.550> guy

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
whatever I watched the video of the guy

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.260 
whatever I watched the video of the guy
who<00:02:17.760> took<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.739> 6<00:02:19.739> plus<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.220> he<00:02:20.310> literally<00:02:20.610> bent

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
who took a 6 plus and he literally bent

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.960 
who took a 6 plus and he literally bent
it<00:02:21.480> with<00:02:21.900> his<00:02:22.020> hands<00:02:22.440> he<00:02:22.530> had<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.850> use

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
it with his hands he had it and to use

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.280 
it with his hands he had it and to use
some<00:02:24.239> pretty<00:02:25.610> extreme<00:02:26.610> pressure<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.230> able

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
some pretty extreme pressure to be able

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.479 
some pretty extreme pressure to be able
to<00:02:28.440> do<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.739> so<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.519> think<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.239> would<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:32.220> should

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.210 
to do it so I think you would you should
know<00:02:32.910> if<00:02:33.360> there's<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.230> much<00:02:34.410> pressure<00:02:34.920> on

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
know if there's that much pressure on

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.020 
know if there's that much pressure on
your<00:02:35.550> phone<00:02:35.910> if<00:02:36.540> you're<00:02:37.080> sitting<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:38.030> should

your phone if you're sitting you should

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.050 
your phone if you're sitting you should
I<00:02:39.300> mean<00:02:40.019> something<00:02:40.769> should<00:02:40.950> enter<00:02:41.280> your<00:02:41.459> head

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.009
