00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.809
 very good guys we are again in 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.540
 minecraft to bring you a new way 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.340
 for minecraft 17.2 called nou club 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.200
 it works with because so do not forget 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.000
 download it and install it and what it's going to 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.800
 adjust is this block that I have in the 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.259
 hand that is the block of grass that 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.540
 Well, here sent in a certain way 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.180
 so that the terrain is adjusted and at the same time 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.070
 I mold it as we are going to leave our 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.290
 down and let's see how here that 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.590
 it is a good terrain not flat semi flat 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.390
 well there is nothing cubic good the wall 6 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.880
 kubica the mycelium is cubic but the 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.580
 grass is not cubic as you see this 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.100
 flat terrain but it has been formed from 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.320
 certain way that it seems that it is not 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.650
 I seem to be flying but if it is 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.050
 bad because of course the block I have it 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.570
 right here underneath this is a block 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.380
 I'm going to do this again as you can see 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.689
 is adjusting and if f1 is a block and 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.280
 really the grass would end at the end 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.680
 of this block but of course it ends up like 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.110
 if it was at the end of the block 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.310
 land that has just below so 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.920
 so much 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.960
 when we press efe 5 we will see how 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.790
 if we were flying this is the only 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.380
 failure to one of the few flaws that 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.180
 I can find in this way that always 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.659
 I like to teach the failures of the same 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.390
 the benefits because I think it's worth it 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.390
 so if we walk if we do not look 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.179
 below and we do not press the f5 to check 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.429
 that we are not flying because I think 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:40.270
 which is pretty cool no good here 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:43.840
 here you see the fact talking about it no no 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.880
 it looks good but it looks very cool I think 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 there is enough water and that in the future 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.840
 this mod can be pretty much better 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.330
 you can adjust in other ways you can 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.970
 do in other ways and may the 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.549
 mod so be a little more realistic than 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.869
 which is now so this will be guys 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.549
 does not have anything else does not have any 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.340
 character does not have anything that we have to 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.770
 do simply put it and as mode 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.659
 graphic that is to modify the style 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.989
 of the earth as if it were a suhr greg 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.660
 pack but without being and will be adjusted 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.400
 this way then here the video ends 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.230
 guys I hope you liked a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.640
 bunch if like that for being like and favorites 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.640
 see you in the next video 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.340
