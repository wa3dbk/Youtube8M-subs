00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.380
 video because of the combined things you fly 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.759
 this summer to know what you do 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.259
 nothing now I'll show you the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.350
 location the location very interesting 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.140
 I am in the garden on my driving 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.229
 in the vegetable garden where you see tomato plants 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.149
 courgette beans then there is the thing there 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.450
 they are supposed to be aubergines that no 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.590
 those are hot peppers plant 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.509
 of for sweet and spicy 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.719
 then there's some salad back there 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.500
 see if you see onion so much onion 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.590
 grain and then the school are all right 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.719
 all our strawberries here to explain 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.459
 what's in my garden but I'll give you a 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.600
 little video about something delicious 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:15.140
 then these are what they are 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.370
 no raspberries here is a raspberry plant 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.140
 therefore he must then did something that 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.460
 I must never eat raspberry 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.750
 without looking at what was inside because 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.980
 already two or three times I am in charge of 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.500
 eat raspberry and ant 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.890
 I taste for charity very tasty a little more 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.380
 crunchy however you have to know that when 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.080
 take a raspberry you have to check 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.220
 the inside that is if you take from the plant 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.080
 because there are ants here 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.530
 turn insects once then 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.270
 sometimes together with raspberry 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.890
 crunch an ant ants that 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.710
 however they give a certain flavor to a 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.510
 cook like me know which one 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.850
 delicacy I know therefore 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.200
 then so careful of raspberries no 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.600
 I 'll show you a beautiful thing from 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.430
 do with the raspberries we see her take 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.030
 this raspberry here we make the collections 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.470
 of raspberries to be delicate you see 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.890
 detached bastard came off we take 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.660
 in the other a little bit of raspberries if 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.160
 let's have a little chat guys 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.110
 they are very good raspberries 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.900
 oh fuck here we are here flashed in without 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.240
 ant inside without ant inside 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.950
 perfect and after the raspberries here we have 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.030
 a marijuana plant 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.240
 no mint this no mint leaves 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.680
 very delicious wild mint 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.080
 no and I do n't know if it's written in his own 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.790
 weed among other things half is 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.190
 a beast thing that we put in a while 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.140
 of light and so it increases and becomes from 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.650
 I'm collecting mint leaves e 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:48.120
 now in hand what or raspberries and 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.320
 of mind but I waited a moment is 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.850
 a mess because alone there is a little 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:57.060
 hard measured of a leaf of 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.380
 mint just a presence of more but there is 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.850
 a but you don't know what is saved is 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.550
 however I lose the mint leaf a 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.850
 put it in your mouth and at this point 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.640
 chew a little but you've gotten away with it 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.190
 to give you a little taste refresh yourself there 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.680
 Mint mouth and then take the raspberry 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:19.329
 and put the chewed together 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.699
 it can't even be very good then 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.210
 the concept is a mint leaf raspberry 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.560
 mint leaf chewed a little 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.050
 music because I then heard the 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.789
 bitter taste so just to refresh 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:38.289
 the mouth then a little and my god but 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:41.910
 the exaltation of delicious taste 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:45.370
 then did you know the mint leaf 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.930
 this stuff thrown here that is if the 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.009
 you want to eat eaten by your own sea 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:54.460
 then recapping guys sheet 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:05:01.479
 of mint with controlled and no poses 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:03.789
 ant an extremely hard cock here agazzi 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:07.240
 for this very quiet video though 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.530
 myth and backlighting ok it's all in the garden 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.880
 a virus from that to ask you what 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:16.120
 combines ten you what combines kept 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.830
 summer and I showed a one 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.599
 very good raspberries completely boys 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.220
 if you had the raspberry plant of mind 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.780
 at home do it and that 's all for 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.030
 this video we feel next 20 then 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.430
 in the near future block fave a bio in which 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.169
 I do a small tour of the house 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.510
 problem with we are in the wax lot 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.620
 hot and that the factor positioned in 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.289
 my father in the middle of the garden 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.440
 then slyly finished like that while at the 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:41.500
 point of the house and then many ask me 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.210
 the tour of the room you take it 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.099
 even the room tour which was a bit 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.440
 updated but I do it later 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.590
 we are at the end of July and beginning of August because 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.720
 because I have to dress goes we say I have to 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.880
 to paint her having to put some things 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.590
 pull wires make a bow case of trouble 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.490
 and then I will make the video with the camera a 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.680
 day room home next video that 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.120
 that all will arrive after lunch then 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.289
 they must stop video files after lunch 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.120
 because every time it comes from me 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:10.860
 throw away I don't know why then instead 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.860
 everything and it was a next video bye
