the<00:01:29.750> shoe<00:01:29.960> being<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.650> murder<00:01:31.220> mystery<00:01:31.640> show

Twin<00:01:32.330> Peaks<00:01:32.570> I<00:01:32.930> thought<00:01:33.110> maybe<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.920> made<00:01:34.100> sense

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
Twin Peaks I thought maybe it made sense

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.190 
Twin Peaks I thought maybe it made sense
that<00:01:34.580> they<00:01:34.670> took<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.060> SP<00:01:35.600> over<00:01:35.840> there<00:01:36.020> and

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
that they took the SP over there and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.749 
that they took the SP over there and
they<00:01:36.259> put<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.560> behind<00:01:36.710> there<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:37.310> sort<00:01:37.550> of<00:01:37.610> like

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
they put it behind there I sort of like

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.130 
they put it behind there I sort of like
a<00:01:37.790> little<00:01:38.060> mystery<00:01:38.330> and<00:01:38.509> I<00:01:38.570> like<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.930> search
