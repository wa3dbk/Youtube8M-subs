during one and a half horsepower model M
engine<00:00:25.199> somebody<00:00:25.560> might<00:00:25.680> call<00:00:25.860> out<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
engine somebody might call out a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.740 
engine somebody might call out a
hit-and-miss<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:26.880> that's<00:00:27.420> kind<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
hit-and-miss but that's kind of a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.510 
hit-and-miss but that's kind of a
misnomer<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.619> particular<00:00:28.890> model<00:00:29.490> but

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
misnomer for this particular model but

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.150 
misnomer for this particular model but
anyway<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.660> second<00:00:31.080> part<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.710> a

anyway this is the second part of a
video<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.690> made<00:00:33.870> two<00:00:34.680> years<00:00:34.710> ago<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.309> I

video that I made two years ago and I
made<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:35.789> improvements<00:00:36.449> since<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.170> time

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
made some improvements since that time

my videos for McCormick during and you
should<00:00:47.280> find<00:00:47.519> it<00:00:47.729> but<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.899> recall<00:00:49.229> in<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
should find it but if you recall in the

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.410 
should find it but if you recall in the
last<00:00:49.620> video<00:00:50.429> I<00:00:51.120> set<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.109> up<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.589> a<00:00:53.420> ignition

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
last video I set this up with a ignition

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.590 
last video I set this up with a ignition
system<00:00:54.929> with<00:00:55.889> points<00:00:56.579> condenser<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.299> coil

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
system with points condenser and coil

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.029 
system with points condenser and coil
and<00:00:57.959> used<00:00:58.409> a<00:00:58.559> battery

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and used a battery

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.889 
and used a battery
and<00:00:59.729> the<00:00:59.879> reason<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.179> did<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.389> is<00:01:00.600> when<00:01:00.870> I

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and the reason I did that is when I

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.259 
and the reason I did that is when I
bought<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.379> engine<00:01:01.799> for<00:01:01.920> about<00:01:02.100> 250<00:01:02.940> dollars

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
bought this engine for about 250 dollars

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.960 
bought this engine for about 250 dollars
a<00:01:03.299> few<00:01:03.600> years<00:01:03.839> back<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.530> no<00:01:04.769> Magneto<00:01:05.700> on

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
a few years back there was no Magneto on

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090 
a few years back there was no Magneto on
it<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.360> calls<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.690> an<00:01:06.869> e<00:01:07.110> cave<00:01:07.380> magneto

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
it and it calls for an e cave magneto

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.060 
it and it calls for an e cave magneto
well<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.970> e<00:01:09.000> cave<00:01:09.360> magneto<00:01:10.050> is<00:01:10.590> worth<00:01:10.830> more

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
well the e cave magneto is worth more

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.460 
well the e cave magneto is worth more
than<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> engine<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.090> being<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.230> cheap

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
than the engine and I being the cheap

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.899 
than the engine and I being the cheap
son<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.920> gun<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.310> am<00:01:14.460> I

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.489 
son of a gun that I am I
I'm<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.689> put<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.049> kind<00:01:16.469> of

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
I'm not about to put out that kind of

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:26.270 
I'm not about to put out that kind of
money<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.399> I<00:01:17.780> have<00:01:18.780> removed<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:20.090> system<00:01:25.280> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
money but I have removed this system and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.789 
money but I have removed this system and
I'll<00:01:26.789> throw<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.090> away<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.469> I've<00:01:28.619> done

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
I'll throw that away and what I've done

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.569 
I'll throw that away and what I've done
is<00:01:28.859> I've<00:01:29.250> installed<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.950> magneto<00:01:31.950> back<00:01:32.310> there

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
is I've installed a magneto back there

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.520 
is I've installed a magneto back there
now<00:01:32.729> I'm<00:01:32.850> gonna<00:01:33.030> rotate<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.750> engine<00:01:33.929> so<00:01:34.439> you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
now I'm gonna rotate the engine so you

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.260 
now I'm gonna rotate the engine so you
can<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> better<00:01:35.130> view<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.119> it's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
can get a better view of that and it's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.589 
can get a better view of that and it's
chain<00:01:36.630> driven<00:01:37.079> off<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> main<00:01:38.849> crankshaft

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:39.599 
chain driven off of the main crankshaft

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.599 
chain driven off of the main crankshaft
and<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> two<00:01:40.619> sprockets<00:01:41.340> there

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
and you can see the two sprockets there

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.649 
and you can see the two sprockets there
there<00:01:42.240> are<00:01:42.329> 40<00:01:42.689> tooth<00:01:42.959> sprockets<00:01:44.659> one-to-one

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
there are 40 tooth sprockets one-to-one

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.630 
there are 40 tooth sprockets one-to-one
ratio<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.170> wanted<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> go<00:01:46.740> 1<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.189> 2<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.579> I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
ratio I wanted to go 1 to 2 but I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.270 
ratio I wanted to go 1 to 2 but I
couldn't<00:01:47.969> find<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.390> right<00:01:48.860> sprocket<00:01:49.860> so

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
couldn't find the right sprocket so

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.949 
couldn't find the right sprocket so
these<00:01:50.399> are<00:01:50.549> old<00:01:50.670> bicycle<00:01:51.209> sprockets<00:01:51.689> again

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
these are old bicycle sprockets again

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.510 
these are old bicycle sprockets again
I'm<00:01:52.110> not<00:01:52.289> wanting<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> spend<00:01:52.770> much<00:01:53.039> money<00:01:53.250> you

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
know that's a fairbanks-morse magneto

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.749 
know that's a fairbanks-morse magneto
and<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.020> came<00:02:01.200> off<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.439> wisconsin<00:02:02.399> single

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759

I<00:02:12.140> made<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> casting<00:02:13.859> and<00:02:14.010> made<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.129> pattern<00:02:14.549> and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
I made a casting and made a pattern and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.370 
I made a casting and made a pattern and
then<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> casting<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.829> is<00:02:16.829> in<00:02:17.250> two<00:02:17.609> pieces<00:02:17.819> and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
then a casting that is in two pieces and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.970 
then a casting that is in two pieces and
clamps<00:02:19.380> over<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.920> crankshaft<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:22.590> was

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
clamps over the crankshaft and that was

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.979 
clamps over the crankshaft and that was
the<00:02:23.190> real<00:02:23.370> difficulty<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
the real difficulty here is that the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.170 
the real difficulty here is that the
sprocket<00:02:25.470> had<00:02:25.620> had<00:02:25.889> to<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:26.099> cut<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.489> two<00:02:26.579> also

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
sprocket had had to be cut in two also

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.750 
sprocket had had to be cut in two also
when<00:02:27.329> an<00:02:27.450> intern<00:02:27.690> bolted<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.760> casting

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
when an intern bolted on to that casting

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.420 
when an intern bolted on to that casting
and<00:02:30.169> because<00:02:31.169> I<00:02:31.200> couldn't<00:02:31.560> get<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.769> flywheel

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
and because I couldn't get the flywheel

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
and because I couldn't get the flywheel
off<00:02:32.669> or<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.030> might<00:02:33.569> have<00:02:33.720> been<00:02:33.810> able<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.019> get<00:02:34.200> it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
off or I might have been able to get it

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.379 
off or I might have been able to get it
off<00:02:34.410> with<00:02:34.620> heat<00:02:34.799> but<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.040> didn't<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.639> ruin

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
off with heat but I didn't want to ruin

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.039 
off with heat but I didn't want to ruin
anything<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.200> thought<00:02:37.769> it'd<00:02:37.919> be<00:02:37.950> better<00:02:38.160> to

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
anything so thought it'd be better to

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.870 
anything so thought it'd be better to
put<00:02:40.049> everything<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.530> there<00:02:40.799> so<00:02:41.519> that<00:02:41.669> I<00:02:41.730> can

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
put everything on there so that I can

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.400 
put everything on there so that I can
take<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.150> off<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.450> throw<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.780> away<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:43.139> I<00:02:43.230> run

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
take it off and throw it away if I run

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.460 
take it off and throw it away if I run
across<00:02:43.709> an<00:02:43.919> EK<00:02:44.280> mag<00:02:44.519> needle<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.630> down<00:02:46.230> at<00:02:46.349> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
across an EK mag needle and down at the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.930 
across an EK mag needle and down at the
bottom<00:02:46.799> there<00:02:46.980> we've<00:02:47.190> got<00:02:47.370> an<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:47.639> and<00:02:47.849> off

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
bottom there we've got an on and off

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.020 
bottom there we've got an on and off
switch<00:02:48.000> which<00:02:48.569> simply<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.200> grounds<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:50.030> to

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
switch which simply just grounds it to

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.909 
switch which simply just grounds it to
turn<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.359> off<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.780> same<00:02:51.810> as<00:02:52.109> any<00:02:52.260> Magneto<00:02:52.739> was

turn it off the same as any Magneto was

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:58.729 
turn it off the same as any Magneto was

grown I haven't grounded to kill it the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.830 
grown I haven't grounded to kill it the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.559 
magneto was mounted in that bracket that
I<00:03:00.870> welded<00:03:01.410> up<00:03:01.530> such<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.579> it<00:03:02.760> also<00:03:02.970> can<00:03:03.359> be

fine timing of the rough timing was done

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.680 
fine timing of the rough timing was done
just<00:03:11.609> by<00:03:12.000> selecting<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.660> right<00:03:14.329> spot<00:03:15.329> on<00:03:15.359> the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
and the sprocket and I do have a change

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.960 
and the sprocket and I do have a change
that<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> put<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.620> there<00:03:25.950> here<00:03:26.220> when<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.400> run<00:03:26.850> it

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
that I put on there here when I run it

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.090 
that I put on there here when I run it
because<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.690> tell<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.230> if<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.410> do<00:03:28.470> anything<00:03:28.920> that

because I tell you if I do anything that

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.580 
because I tell you if I do anything that
is<00:03:29.460> even<00:03:29.760> minutely<00:03:30.150> dangerous<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.170> sure<00:03:31.320> hear

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
is even minutely dangerous I sure hear

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.480 
is even minutely dangerous I sure hear
about<00:03:31.800> it<00:03:32.270> considering<00:03:33.270> how<00:03:34.490> dangerously

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
about it considering how dangerously

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.330 
about it considering how dangerously
most<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.060> probably<00:03:36.570> work<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.560> I

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
most of you probably work and and I

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.520 
most of you probably work and and I
always<00:03:38.970> thought<00:03:39.120> myself<00:03:39.390> as<00:03:39.780> pretty<00:03:40.020> safe<00:03:40.290> and

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
always thought myself as pretty safe and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.730 
always thought myself as pretty safe and
I'll<00:03:40.620> show<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.830> why<00:03:45.020> there's<00:03:46.020> ten<00:03:46.320> fingers

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
I'll show you why there's ten fingers

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.580 
I'll show you why there's ten fingers
and<00:03:46.920> are<00:03:47.010> all<00:03:47.130> still<00:03:47.520> there<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:49.170> moment<00:03:49.470> here

and are all still there in a moment here

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.010 
and are all still there in a moment here
we'll<00:03:49.740> run<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.130> beauty<00:03:53.420> okay<00:03:54.420> safety<00:03:54.900> and

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
we'll run this beauty okay safety and

Nazis<00:03:55.410> I've<00:03:55.620> got<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:56.150> chain<00:03:57.150> guard<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:58.280> I

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
Nazis I've got the chain guard on and I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.070 
Nazis I've got the chain guard on and I
think<00:04:00.060> that's<00:04:00.180> a<00:04:00.240> pretty<00:04:00.450> good<00:04:00.600> view<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.960> it

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
think that's a pretty good view of it

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.210 
think that's a pretty good view of it
and<00:04:01.770> now<00:04:02.280> let's<00:04:02.670> see<00:04:03.450> if<00:04:03.510> she'll<00:04:03.750> start<00:04:07.220> let

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
and now let's see if she'll start let

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.190 
and now let's see if she'll start let
the<00:04:08.370> oil<00:04:08.400> around<00:04:08.700> gasoline<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:09.720> there<00:04:09.960> water

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
the oil around gasoline in there water

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.070 
the oil around gasoline in there water
on<00:04:10.610> everything<00:04:11.610> has<00:04:11.700> been<00:04:11.790> oiled<00:04:11.970> up<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.570> I

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
on everything has been oiled up and I

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:35.580 
on everything has been oiled up and I
think<00:04:13.680> she's<00:04:13.890> ready<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.220> go<00:04:14.400> let's<00:04:14.670> see

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:05:00.090 

and<00:04:35.860> away<00:04:36.100> she<00:04:36.280> goes

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100
