messed that one up but to be honest I'm

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.620 
messed that one up but to be honest I'm
pretty<00:01:14.490> sure<00:01:14.790> he<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.150> came<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
pretty sure he just came up with that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
pretty sure he just came up with that
recently<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.200> thought<00:01:16.439> he<00:01:16.590> had<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.890> plan<00:01:17.130> from

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
recently I thought he had that plan from

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
recently I thought he had that plan from
the<00:01:17.430> beginning<00:01:17.549> that's<00:01:17.970> why<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.930> he<00:01:19.080> had

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the beginning that's why you know he had

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
the beginning that's why you know he had
to<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.470> through<00:01:19.680> each<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:19.979> every<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> them

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
to go through each and every one of them

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.480 
to go through each and every one of them

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that much attention to it but it was

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.429 
that much attention to it but it was
still<00:01:32.880> interesting<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.479> Kobo<00:01:34.049> took<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
still interesting that Kobo took the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
still interesting that Kobo took the
time<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.920> even<00:01:35.430> if<00:01:35.610> he<00:01:35.700> didn't<00:01:35.939> really<00:01:36.030> have

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
time to even if he didn't really have

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.520 
time to even if he didn't really have
this<00:01:36.360> plan<00:01:36.600> now<00:01:36.720> he<00:01:36.780> didn't<00:01:37.140> time<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.439> go

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
this plan now he didn't time to go

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.130 
this plan now he didn't time to go
through<00:01:37.740> each<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.040> every<00:01:38.159> occasion<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:39.479> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
through each and every occasion that to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
through each and every occasion that to
my<00:01:40.290> knowledge<00:01:40.500> he<00:01:40.829> he<00:01:41.100> got<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.729> basically

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
my knowledge he he got and basically

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330 
my knowledge he he got and basically
explained<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> broke<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.869> down<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.710> as<00:01:44.159> far

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
explained and broke it down now as far

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.800 
explained and broke it down now as far
as<00:01:44.430> Ichiro<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> bankai<00:01:45.180> goes<00:01:45.360> here's<00:01:45.630> what

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.170 
as Ichiro the bankai goes here's what

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I'm thinking he has a close relationship

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.389 
I'm thinking he has a close relationship
and<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> way<00:01:48.689> he<00:01:49.020> explained<00:01:49.439> about<00:01:49.680> komamura

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
and the way he explained about komamura

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.340 
and the way he explained about komamura
with<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.030> bankai<00:01:51.630> how<00:01:51.810> he's<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.170> close

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
with the bankai how he's really close

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.260 
with the bankai how he's really close
with<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.920> when<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> bomb<00:01:53.790> contacted

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
with it so when the bomb contacted

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.850 
with it so when the bomb contacted
damage<00:01:54.570> Coleman<00:01:54.869> was<00:01:55.049> okay<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.560> when<00:01:55.680> Cole

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
damage Coleman was okay but when Cole

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.670 
damage Coleman was okay but when Cole
more<00:01:56.070> heals<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.610> bankai<00:01:56.969> heels<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.360> well

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
more heals the bankai heels as well

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.200 
more heals the bankai heels as well
maybe<00:01:58.680> since<00:01:59.100> Ichiro<00:01:59.520> has<00:01:59.640> such<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.939> close

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
maybe since Ichiro has such a close

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.840 
maybe since Ichiro has such a close
relationship<00:02:00.750> or<00:02:01.110> close<00:02:01.920> bond<00:02:02.250> or<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.640> one

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
relationship or close bond or at one

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
relationship or close bond or at one
point<00:02:03.060> anyway<00:02:03.509> had<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.899> some<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.350> soon

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
point anyway had with some get soon

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.109 
point anyway had with some get soon
maybe<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.369> could<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.820> particular

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
maybe it could be of that particular

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.900 
maybe it could be of that particular
situation<00:02:07.049> now<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:07.950> haven't<00:02:08.190> seen<00:02:08.310> John<00:02:08.640> get

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
so in a while so it really all depends

never go back to me the same again this
could<00:02:27.190> be<00:02:27.280> bad<00:02:27.459> but<00:02:27.819> I'm<00:02:28.090> more<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:28.480> leaning

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
could be bad but I'm more so leaning

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.410 
could be bad but I'm more so leaning
towards<00:02:29.080> its<00:02:29.380> going<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.680> be<00:02:29.800> good<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.280> he<00:02:31.060> was

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
towards its going to be good and he was

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.479 
towards its going to be good and he was
gonna<00:02:31.510> master<00:02:32.080> whatever<00:02:32.350> problem<00:02:32.830> he<00:02:32.950> has<00:02:33.160> and

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
gonna master whatever problem he has and

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.699 
gonna master whatever problem he has and
come<00:02:33.940> out<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:34.300> top<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.870> stronger<00:02:35.380> from<00:02:35.680> it

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
come out on top and stronger from it

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.590 
come out on top and stronger from it
that's<00:02:36.310> really<00:02:36.580> where<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.760> see<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.120> situation

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
that's really where I see that situation

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.850 
that's really where I see that situation
going<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:37.989> was<00:02:38.080> interesting<00:02:38.319> that<00:02:38.500> Kubo

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
going but it was interesting that Kubo

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.350 
going but it was interesting that Kubo
went<00:02:39.069> through<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.400> gave<00:02:39.580> an<00:02:39.760> explanation<00:02:39.970> for

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
went through it gave an explanation for

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.420 
went through it gave an explanation for
every<00:02:40.569> one<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.750> them<00:02:40.959> but<00:02:41.500> if<00:02:41.590> he<00:02:41.980> missed<00:02:42.220> one

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
every one of them but if he missed one

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.729 
every one of them but if he missed one
let<00:02:42.819> me<00:02:42.849> know<00:02:43.060> if<00:02:43.269> he<00:02:43.300> missed<00:02:43.600> one<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.080> why<00:02:44.709> I

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
let me know if he missed one and why I

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.170 
let me know if he missed one and why I
think<00:02:44.800> he<00:02:45.160> didn't<00:02:45.400> explain<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.819> one<00:02:45.970> if<00:02:46.090> he

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
think he didn't explain that one if he

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.850 
think he didn't explain that one if he
just<00:02:46.420> couldn't<00:02:46.660> know<00:02:46.810> whatever<00:02:47.110> but<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.739> my

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
just couldn't know whatever but to my

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.900 
just couldn't know whatever but to my
knowledge<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:48.250> think<00:02:48.280> he<00:02:48.519> got<00:02:48.610> all<00:02:48.819> the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
knowledge I think he got all the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.970 
knowledge I think he got all the
occasions<00:02:49.180> where<00:02:49.569> a<00:02:49.600> bankai<00:02:49.840> was<00:02:50.290> broken<00:02:50.799> and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
occasions where a bankai was broken and

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.720 
occasions where a bankai was broken and

for<00:04:54.770> it<00:04:55.400> setup<00:04:55.669> because<00:04:55.910> that's<00:04:56.120> pretty<00:04:56.240> much

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
for it setup because that's pretty much

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.029 
for it setup because that's pretty much
what<00:04:56.449> it<00:04:56.660> was<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:57.110> was<00:04:57.260> freaking<00:04:57.620> awesome<00:04:57.770> we

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
what it was it was freaking awesome we

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.920 
what it was it was freaking awesome we
got<00:04:58.190> you<00:04:58.340> know<00:04:58.430> squad<00:04:59.060> zero<00:04:59.360> and<00:04:59.630> then<00:04:59.720> we<00:04:59.780> got

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
got you know squad zero and then we got

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.540 
got you know squad zero and then we got
the<00:05:00.050> discussion<00:05:00.470> regarding<00:05:00.620> hero's<00:05:01.130> bankai

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
the discussion regarding hero's bankai

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.210 
the discussion regarding hero's bankai
which<00:05:01.699> again<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.270> think<00:05:02.600> that<00:05:02.870> his<00:05:03.110> bankai<00:05:03.350> is

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
which again I think that his bankai is

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.340 
which again I think that his bankai is
fun<00:05:04.520> to<00:05:04.639> give<00:05:04.760> him<00:05:04.910> problems<00:05:05.150> he<00:05:05.810> will<00:05:05.960> master

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
fun to give him problems he will master

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.990 
fun to give him problems he will master
it<00:05:06.440> eventually<00:05:06.680> and<00:05:06.949> come<00:05:07.190> out<00:05:07.310> stronger<00:05:07.820> and

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
it eventually and come out stronger and

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.909 
it eventually and come out stronger and
hopefully<00:05:08.690> this<00:05:08.840> means<00:05:08.990> we'll<00:05:09.199> get<00:05:09.350> some

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
hopefully this means we'll get some

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.340 
hopefully this means we'll get some
zangetsu<00:05:10.190> and<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.330> holo<00:05:11.539> pretty<00:05:12.080> soon

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
zangetsu and the holo pretty soon

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.950 
zangetsu and the holo pretty soon
because<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:12.949> mean<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.940> know<00:05:14.060> if<00:05:14.270> this<00:05:14.479> is<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.840> do

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
because I mean you know if this is to do

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.839 
because I mean you know if this is to do
with<00:05:15.080> his<00:05:15.169> bankai<00:05:15.380> being<00:05:15.770> broken<00:05:15.979> maybe<00:05:16.639> it's

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
with his bankai being broken maybe it's

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.310 
with his bankai being broken maybe it's
on<00:05:16.940> against<00:05:17.180> was<00:05:17.360> broken<00:05:17.660> as<00:05:17.780> well<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.229> the

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
on against was broken as well and the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.810 
on against was broken as well and the
last<00:05:18.500> time<00:05:18.680> we<00:05:18.770> seen<00:05:18.949> zangetsu<00:05:19.220> if<00:05:19.669> I'm

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
last time we seen zangetsu if I'm

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.909 
last time we seen zangetsu if I'm
correct<00:05:19.970> was<00:05:20.300> during<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.139> whole<00:05:21.260> Aizen<00:05:21.710> thing

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
correct was during the whole Aizen thing

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.950 
correct was during the whole Aizen thing
when<00:05:22.099> Ichigo<00:05:22.490> was<00:05:22.639> training<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.180> final<00:05:23.720> to

when Ichigo was training the final to
get<00:05:24.080> final<00:05:24.380> getsugatensho<00:05:24.500> so<00:05:25.190> we<00:05:25.310> haven't

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
get final getsugatensho so we haven't
