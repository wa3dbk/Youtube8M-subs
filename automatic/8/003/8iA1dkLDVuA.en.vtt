00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
field reporting Mike I mean there are

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.500 
field reporting Mike I mean there are
there<00:02:16.079> are<00:02:16.189> there<00:02:17.189> are<00:02:17.250> much<00:02:17.790> better<00:02:17.819> quality

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
there are there are much better quality

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.330 
there are there are much better quality
Mike's<00:02:18.689> but<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.019> is<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:20.010> good<00:02:20.129> test

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
Mike's but this is a really good test

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.339 
Mike's but this is a really good test
because<00:02:20.579> this<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.879> a<00:02:20.909> low-cost<00:02:21.150> Mike<00:02:21.689> and<00:02:21.930> so

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
because this is a low-cost Mike and so

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.289 
because this is a low-cost Mike and so
but<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.799> means<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.159> in<00:02:23.250> wide<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:23.879> common

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
but that means it's in wide and common

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.429 
but that means it's in wide and common
use<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:25.049> know<00:02:25.310> as<00:02:26.310> budgets<00:02:26.909> are<00:02:27.120> not<00:02:28.079> always

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
use you know as budgets are not always

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.050 
use you know as budgets are not always
so<00:02:28.680> great<00:02:28.970> for<00:02:29.970> broadcasters<00:02:30.720> and

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
so great for broadcasters and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.759 
so great for broadcasters and
journalists<00:02:33.060> doing<00:02:33.569> electronic<00:02:34.230> multimedia

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
journalists doing electronic multimedia

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:35.990 
journalists doing electronic multimedia
so<00:02:35.040> I'm<00:02:35.129> going<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.280> switch<00:02:35.489> over<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.819> that

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
so I'm going to switch over to that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.569 
so I'm going to switch over to that
microphone<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.629> second<00:02:36.959> but<00:02:37.680> when<00:02:38.430> i<00:02:38.459> do

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
microphone in a second but when i do

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.280 
microphone in a second but when i do
that<00:02:38.670> i'm<00:02:38.939> going<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.120> then<00:02:39.720> change<00:02:39.750> that

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
that i'm going to then change that

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.500 
that i'm going to then change that
silver<00:02:40.709> knob<00:02:40.889> to<00:02:41.430> adjust<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.879> input<00:02:42.030> levels

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
silver knob to adjust the input levels

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.110 
silver knob to adjust the input levels
and<00:02:42.719> so<00:02:43.109> bear<00:02:43.260> with<00:02:43.290> me<00:02:43.469> while<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.769> do<00:02:43.889> that

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
and so bear with me while I do that

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.979 
and so bear with me while I do that
because<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.299> think<00:02:45.359> it's<00:02:45.540> important<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.930> do

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
because I think it's important to do

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.479 
because I think it's important to do
that<00:02:46.139> on<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.349> fly<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:47.040> know<00:02:47.159> whenever<00:02:47.340> you

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
that on the fly you know whenever you

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.069 
that on the fly you know whenever you
change<00:02:47.700> Mike's<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.450> calibrate<00:02:48.659> that

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
change Mike's you have to calibrate that

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.750 
change Mike's you have to calibrate that
knob<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.680> thing<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.489> don't<00:02:50.579> want

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
knob and the thing is you don't want

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.690 
knob and the thing is you don't want
that<00:02:50.849> knob<00:02:51.090> changing<00:02:51.629> its<00:02:52.230> setting<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.579> when

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
that knob changing its setting so when

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.449 
that knob changing its setting so when
you<00:02:53.790> take<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.389> preamp<00:02:54.810> out<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.109> your<00:02:55.400> out<00:02:56.400> of
