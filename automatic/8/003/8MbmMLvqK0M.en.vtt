call the secret code the Copic numbering
system<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.820> made<00:00:18.119> up<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.359> three<00:00:18.660> parts<00:00:18.830> let's

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
system is made up of three parts let's

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.750 
system is made up of three parts let's
take<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> closer<00:00:20.430> look<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:22.250> first<00:00:23.250> part<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
take a closer look the first part of the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.779 
take a closer look the first part of the
code<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.570> letter<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.710> letter<00:00:25.920> stands<00:00:26.519> for

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
code is the letter the letter stands for

system is the saturation saturation
basically<00:00:51.270> tells<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.570> how<00:00:51.750> vibrant<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.500> marker

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
basically tells you how vibrant a marker

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.540 
basically tells you how vibrant a marker
is<00:00:53.190> let's<00:00:54.090> take<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> look

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
is let's take a look

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.040 
is let's take a look
saturation<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.730> represented<00:00:57.420> by<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.750> first

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050

let's<00:01:14.159> take<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> look<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.790> some<00:01:14.939> examples<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
let's take a look at some examples I

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.929 
let's take a look at some examples I
have<00:01:18.540> two<00:01:18.750> red<00:01:18.960> markers<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.250> saturation

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
have two red markers here the saturation

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.210 
have two red markers here the saturation
is<00:01:21.030> different<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.509> both<00:01:21.540> markers<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.799> example

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
is different on both markers for example

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
is different on both markers for example
on<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.520> marker<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.270> saturation<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> two

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
on this marker the saturation is a two

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.980 
on this marker the saturation is a two
so<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.310> almost<00:01:26.549> fully<00:01:27.060> saturated<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.900> it's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
so it's almost fully saturated so it's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.920 
so it's almost fully saturated so it's
going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.320> very<00:01:28.560> vibrant<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.189> very<00:01:29.310> bright

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
going to be very vibrant and very bright

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.590 
going to be very vibrant and very bright
this<00:01:30.930> marker<00:01:31.409> has<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.680> saturation<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.549> eight<00:01:32.909> so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
this marker has a saturation of eight so

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.260 
this marker has a saturation of eight so
it's<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.110> much<00:01:34.439> less<00:01:34.770> vibrant<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it's going to be much less vibrant the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.060 
it's going to be much less vibrant the
last<00:01:36.479> part<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> Copic<00:01:37.290> numbering<00:01:37.320> system

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
marker has a nine for the shade so it's

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.790 
marker has a nine for the shade so it's

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
a much higher number so it's going to be

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
Copic numbering system let's put it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.910 
Copic numbering system let's put it
together<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.600> help<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.900> pick<00:02:31.140> good<00:02:31.380> blending

groups<00:02:32.330> there<00:02:33.330> are<00:02:33.480> just<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.810> few<00:02:33.840> basic<00:02:34.290> rules

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
groups there are just a few basic rules

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.130 
groups there are just a few basic rules
for<00:02:35.250> putting<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.700> together<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.510> pick<00:02:36.690> markers

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
for putting it together to pick markers

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.860 
for putting it together to pick markers
that<00:02:37.320> will<00:02:37.470> blend<00:02:37.740> well<00:02:38.070> together<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:39.510> basic

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
that will blend well together the basic

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.590 
that will blend well together the basic
rules<00:02:40.140> are<00:02:40.430> always<00:02:41.430> pick<00:02:41.640> markers<00:02:42.090> from<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
rules are always pick markers from the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.810 
rules are always pick markers from the
same<00:02:42.870> color<00:02:43.200> family<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:44.130> they<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.610> same

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
same color family so they have the same

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.300 
same color family so they have the same
letter<00:02:45.230> pick<00:02:46.230> markers<00:02:46.650> from<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.070> same

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
letter pick markers from the same

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.090 
letter pick markers from the same
saturation<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.720> they<00:02:48.870> have<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.170> same<00:02:49.440> first

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
saturation so they have the same first

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.060 
saturation so they have the same first
number<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.940> then<00:02:51.720> pick<00:02:52.500> two<00:02:52.710> or<00:02:52.740> three

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
number and then pick two or three

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.130 
number and then pick two or three
markers<00:02:53.490> with<00:02:54.120> two<00:02:54.480> or<00:02:54.600> three<00:02:54.630> digits

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
markers with two or three digits

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.770 
markers with two or three digits
difference<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.310> last<00:02:56.490> number<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.630> you'll

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
difference in the last number so you'll

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.560 
difference in the last number so you'll
have<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.960> light<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.560> medium<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.760> dark<00:02:59.790> marker

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
have a light a medium and a dark marker

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.860 
have a light a medium and a dark marker
in<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.500> same<00:03:01.740> saturation<00:03:02.210> same<00:03:03.210> family<00:03:03.720> if

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
in the same saturation same family if

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.840 
in the same saturation same family if

you do that you're going to have markers

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.270 
you do that you're going to have markers
that<00:03:06.030> blend<00:03:06.360> really<00:03:06.720> well<00:03:07.020> together<00:03:07.260> for<00:03:08.070> more
