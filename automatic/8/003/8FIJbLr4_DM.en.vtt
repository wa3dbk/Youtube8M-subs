00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.160
 including kompressor with forums team 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 we can do 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.809
 for the jelly cake hummus rice with 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 milk even for coffee 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.550

 will teach them what is like a rice with 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.870
 milk and its derivatives that we can 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.800
 do it more to make our plan 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:07.110
 Neapolitan we need a liter of three 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.210
