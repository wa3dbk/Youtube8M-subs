00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello my name is emmanuel des 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.340
 tanzimat i will teach you 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.410
 today how to make your own 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.570
 softening why make your own 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.530
 softening simply for 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.809
 economic reasons 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.550
 it costs a lot less for 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.170
 ecological reasons you know 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.480
 exactly what's in your 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.820
 product so you avoid everything that 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.769
 is allergy problems and rejection of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.029
 things not necessarily very positive in 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 nature 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.980
 and then another benefit you have to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.899
 white vinegar in your fabric softener 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.180
 you will see it and it also allows you 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.190
 to avoid all that is limestone in 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.739
 your machine to make your own 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.600
 softeners you are going to need to 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.200
 white vinegar of water and bicarbonate 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.110
 soda 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.070
 you're just going to mix in one 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.680
 containing 500 milliliters of water 250 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.480
 milliliters of white vinegar and 2 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.039
 tablespoons of baking soda 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.059
 soda 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.559
 once you've done all that 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.470
 put it in a container 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.330
 be careful as any household product that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.820
 you do it yourself very 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.380
 be careful to put it in a container 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.900
 dedicated that can not be confused 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.060
 with a container you use to 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.270
 food purposes 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:28.650
 I take 500 milliliters of water 250 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:36.210
 liters by a little bit of vinegar 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.520
 white and 2 tablespoons of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.159
 baking soda 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.810
 watch it foam you mix well 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.420
 and you will be able to pay your teen 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.840
 six years in a reception reserved for this 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.880
 use 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.520
 you just have to put 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.710
 the equivalent of a drink at each laundry 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.000
 you know now how to do 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.000
 your own softener
