a full tape jobs and we really were
feeling<00:00:45.100> ourselves<00:00:45.520> out<00:00:45.640> there<00:00:45.670> in<00:00:46.060> the<00:00:46.120> first

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
feeling ourselves out there in the first

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.299 
feeling ourselves out there in the first
quarter<00:00:46.630> second<00:00:47.500> quarter<00:00:47.620> we<00:00:47.800> just<00:00:47.980> basically

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
quarter second quarter we just basically

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.580 
quarter second quarter we just basically
just<00:00:48.940> decided<00:00:49.360> played<00:00:49.540> great<00:00:49.780> defense<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.440> I

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
just decided played great defense and I

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.630 
just decided played great defense and I
think<00:00:50.770> for<00:00:50.860> a<00:00:50.920> second<00:00:51.220> quarter<00:00:51.460> through

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
think for a second quarter through

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.490 
think for a second quarter through
midway<00:00:51.970> through<00:00:52.150> the<00:00:52.180> third<00:00:52.480> quarter<00:00:52.750> I<00:00:53.050> don't

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
midway through the third quarter I don't

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.780 
midway through the third quarter I don't
think<00:00:53.650> they<00:00:53.770> scored<00:00:54.129> they<00:00:54.309> may<00:00:54.640> have<00:00:54.700> only

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
think they scored they may have only

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.250 
think they scored they may have only
scored<00:00:55.090> one<00:00:55.300> field<00:00:55.330> goal<00:00:55.629> for<00:00:55.930> two<00:00:56.050> full

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
scored one field goal for two full

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.530 
scored one field goal for two full
quarters<00:00:56.650> but<00:00:56.830> our<00:00:57.280> girls<00:00:57.489> is<00:00:57.670> tremendous<00:00:58.180> job

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540
