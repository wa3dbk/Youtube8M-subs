00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
stuff over here this is actually the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
stuff over here this is actually the
airtime<00:01:59.909> Hill<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.960> second<00:02:01.290> airtime<00:02:01.590> Hill

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
airtime Hill on the second airtime Hill

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.350 
airtime Hill on the second airtime Hill
for<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> green<00:02:02.670> track<00:02:02.939> where<00:02:03.180> you're<00:02:03.299> gonna

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
for the green track where you're gonna

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.389 
for the green track where you're gonna
zero-g<00:02:04.110> roll<00:02:04.140> over<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> blue<00:02:04.860> track<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
zero-g roll over on the blue track and

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.980 
zero-g roll over on the blue track and
they've<00:02:05.490> actually<00:02:05.640> banked<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> zero<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
they've actually banked the zero the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.380 
they've actually banked the zero the
airtime<00:02:07.979> Hill<00:02:08.190> which<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.819> don't<00:02:09.030> remember<00:02:09.179> in

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
airtime Hill which I don't remember in

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.180 
airtime Hill which I don't remember in
the<00:02:09.479> rendering<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.140> I'm<00:02:10.920> gonna<00:02:11.099> actually

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the rendering so I'm gonna actually

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.830 
the rendering so I'm gonna actually
watch<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.520> after<00:02:12.090> I'm<00:02:12.150> done<00:02:12.270> recording<00:02:12.450> this

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
watch it after I'm done recording this

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.150 
watch it after I'm done recording this
to<00:02:13.230> see<00:02:13.410> if<00:02:13.440> I'm<00:02:13.560> right<00:02:13.709> or<00:02:13.739> wrong<00:02:15.980> yeah<00:02:16.980> this

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
to see if I'm right or wrong yeah this

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.500 
to see if I'm right or wrong yeah this
whole<00:02:17.280> right-hand<00:02:17.730> side<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.030> looks<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.330> all

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
whole right-hand side it looks like all

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.240 
whole right-hand side it looks like all
the<00:02:18.870> headers<00:02:19.050> are<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.379> place<00:02:19.560> or<00:02:19.830> just<00:02:19.860> about

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the headers are in place or just about

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.740 
the headers are in place or just about
all<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.610> headers<00:02:20.849> are<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.090> place<00:02:21.300> all<00:02:21.569> I've

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
all the headers are in place all I've

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.770 
all the headers are in place all I've
got<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.989> do<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> stack<00:02:23.160> track<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.780> keep

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
got to do is a stack track and keep

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.270 
got to do is a stack track and keep
pushing<00:02:25.140> forward<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.590> would<00:02:25.650> expect<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
pushing forward I would expect to

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.460 
pushing forward I would expect to
probably<00:02:26.640> see<00:02:26.849> all<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.270> track<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.810> by<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.230> end

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
probably see all the track in by the end

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.130 
probably see all the track in by the end
of<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.650> month<00:02:28.980> which<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.489> April<00:02:30.140> but

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
of this month which is April but

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.270 
of this month which is April but
probably<00:02:31.440> not<00:02:31.560> any<00:02:31.709> test<00:02:32.190> runs<00:02:32.900> until<00:02:33.900> May<00:02:34.280> of

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
probably not any test runs until May of

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.140 
probably not any test runs until May of
course<00:02:35.550> there's<00:02:35.700> gonna<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.120> know

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
course there's gonna be you know

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.729 
course there's gonna be you know
logistical<00:02:37.050> stuff<00:02:37.230> they've<00:02:37.379> got<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.620> deal

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
logistical stuff they've got to deal

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.040 
logistical stuff they've got to deal
with<00:02:37.769> electrical<00:02:38.519> air<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.540> all<00:02:39.629> that<00:02:39.780> stuff

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
with electrical air and all that stuff

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.430 
with electrical air and all that stuff
so<00:02:41.300> they<00:02:42.300> were<00:02:42.360> actually<00:02:42.540> placing<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.290> is

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440
