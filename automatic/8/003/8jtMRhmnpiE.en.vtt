00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:09.130
 there is the chamomile doctor patricia 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:12.730
 bristle brightens the hair that could be 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.920
 making a chamomile is a chopping but 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.510
 to make more blonde apply the 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.449
 functionality when chiquitita that is 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.590
 in the manzanilla perÃº 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.590
 powdered 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.369
 There is a myth but I would say that one of the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.890
 of the best flowers in our 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.679
 body cosmetics is the camomile 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 because the first things chamomile 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:38.850
 it's called a stretcher 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.030
 the stretcher one of the main 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.800
 virtues is the anti-inflammatory so 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.070
 So what are we doctors 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.260
 a lot in sunburns in pink 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.559
 towards the channel 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.559
 we use concentrated chamomile water 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.880
 as clarifying that says the father 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
 result 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.470
 if it clarifies 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.810
 I keep it because I want to make a 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.270
 save is not that I have a hair 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.060
 black and I clarify the chamomile that 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.640
 blond clear today I feel like I can 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.200
 make an infusion but great more 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.930
 rings are four spoonfuls more 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.260
 rings in half a liter of water and then 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.030
 I sided and I placed it as I say 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.330
 of joseba away my hair as better the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.330
 hair 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.750
 and I forget the day and time 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.340
 in people who do not want to use chemicals 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.500
 to go on vacation 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.630
 and already in December it ends and if we already 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.900
 I want to marry until March opening the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.330
 We only do rinses with 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.160
 chamomile and these things to write your 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.050
 put up the spray things and the bayern 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.149
 you just put it on and give it a 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.310
 golden color but without unprotecting the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.340
 cuticle chest 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.010
 for children and also for adults who 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.350
 are lightening or chamomile shampoo e 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.100
 even chamomile balsam is a lot 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.440
 more than buying an inflammatory diary 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.930
 she has her hair color 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.239
 I do not want you to do the envelope, they are not 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.239
 at least 168 the hot water 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.370
 how long are the results more 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:53.110
 or less as at 45 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:54.790
 and in shampoo or chamomile water to the 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.750
 hairs clear and if I start to put a 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.090
 little very yellow medium false the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:08.800
 chamomile is because you also the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:12.040
 little monkey walks if you put the 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.000
 sun water sea water color 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.000
 a lot of hair 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.720
 does not go very well in the hair only what 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.820
 do on the skin but will dye the hair 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.500
 of color to chamomile not of color and 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.500
 the most perfect brightness
