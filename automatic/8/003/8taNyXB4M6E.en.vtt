00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.580
 after a training course focused on 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.529
 muscular work in the center 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.330
 Expertise and performance of dijon 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.309
 it's amnéville that david's team 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.469
 chastan went for three days 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.230
 from 16 to 18 July to resume 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.999
 skis training the structure of 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.830
 Amnéville's indoor ski presents 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.840
 advantage for skiers to work 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.279
 more technical and physical 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.869
 there we are on a block of three days 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.640
 because on a discipline like the 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.369
 slalom and snowhall piste relief 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.019
 we work more technical also the 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.500
 physical because as there is very little 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.070
 slope 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.050
 there is a big job 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.850
 creating speed to do on 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.350
 the spirit so of movement so 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.640
 fatally muscle contractions and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.320
 then after that we also benefit 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.110
 work technically everything that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.239
 sharpens equilibration the timing of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.239
 triggering all the work on the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.220
 easy parts because good ski on 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.290
 may not win a race over 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.670
 flat parts but we lose it so 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.830
 it's very important as strategic 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.420
 it allows us to set up it's 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.050
 it will try to improve on the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.330
 easy parts 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.519
 this type of training requires 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.830
 particular conditions to which the 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.119
 track of this name it corresponds in the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.600
 conditions that we come to seek is 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.890
 simply winter transitions 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.899
 because the snowhall system is 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.220
 a fridge system a little bit between 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.600
 quotes that is to say that there is a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.780
 temperature that is equal which is 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.820
 negative so who keeps up and snow 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.979
 cold and especially hard since we have 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.299
 hardened by watering two days to a 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.860
 a few days before our coming 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.080
 it allows us to have conditions 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.150
 very regular that gets closer all this 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.220
 we will find the winter even if it is 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.840
 not various snow but hey it's still 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.270
 very interesting for the period 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.460
 nine athletes participated in this course 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.380
 including Julien lizeroux who returns from 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.540
 white season due to injury 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.040
 this ski to the French who participated for 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.229
 the first time at the Olympic Games 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.430
 vancouver in 2010 this makes his comeback to 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.409
 his greatest pleasure 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.060
 these two white seasons it was 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.429
 complicated but the main thing is that 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.570
 now it's going a lot better than I've 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.640
 resumed a physical training block 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.920
 with the whole team for two months and 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.750
 that now we are back to 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.770
 serious things in the pickets and that 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.179
 just feels good 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.530
 go skiing without having too much pain 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.880
 and then it feels good to be able to 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.590
 new being in the group life with 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.509
 all the friends be in the life of 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.890
 group with the fraternal spirit that reigns 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.480
 in this beautiful team of France has 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.920
 probably helped julien lizeroux to 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.170
 come back from his wounds 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.300
 and despite doubts he may have had 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.019
 will retain from him only his will and his 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.610
 perseverance 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.380
 I needed nobody to me 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.430
 convince of hesitation I believe 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.570
 that he has doubts every day 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.100
 is part of the life of the high sportsman 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.390
 level sure it was not 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.360
 simple it was very long but at the same 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.290
 time it went pretty fast so I 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.790
 continues for the simple and good reason 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.500
 I love sport at a passionate 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.870
 and that I wanted to finish on a 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.880
 good note my career and so that's it 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.989
 took me some time I'm great again 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.120
 to get where I want to go because 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.989
 that the goal is to be able to resort 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.730
 cups of the world and power 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.930
 to score points but in any case 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.620
 it's a great challenge 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.909
 me and 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.580
 I hope to finish my career 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.840
 on a positive note julien lizeroux 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.340
 enjoy these three days 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.930
 to reconnect with the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.129
 feelings of slips but also 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.420
 to test the material 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.430
 as far as I am concerned this year I 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.170
 changed material so these same little ones 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.640
 new ones even very very important 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.069
 for me to be able to ski here 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.760
 turn the skis on one hand but especially 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.980
 the shoes 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.840
 and then to be able to find me 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.190
 the sensations and then little by little 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.060
 refine the models that I will choose 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.519
 for the upcoming season 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.470
 a coming season where the skier from the 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.090
 Plagne sets itself the goal of returning 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.709
 at his pre-injury level 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.780
 one goal is first slalom 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.799
 world cup of the season already to be 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.690
 at the start and then 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.700
 the ideal would be to be at the start of the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.049
 second run after if I'm at 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.329
 start of a second round of 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.709
 world everything will be possible so I will have the 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.379
 banana I will smile and then I 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.730
 will give 100% give themselves 100% such 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.560
 are the watchwords of skiers 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.909
 French who prepares the Olympic Games 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.980
 of sochi with a schedule 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.640
 adapted training we go on the 2 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.890
 Alps 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.560
 monday so placed outside on a 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.090
 glacier not by cons we will change 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.489
 because we are going to work on jars 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.870
 of altitude and then also on uneven 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.549
 more important is to help others 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.769
 disciplines the super-g errors including 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.880
 lg years because here it's a little bit short 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.380
 for these two disciplines 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.000
 so we will try to denigrate the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.680
 track length and after so guys 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.579
 and boys are going to cut a little bit 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.680
 since he's going and going out of a 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.319
 also physical link to dijon on 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.879
 recovered them on the road have made a 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.620
 big bowl of physics there we will recover 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.300
 because you have to be cool behind 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.790
 actually we speak 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.290
 south ouch in argentina for a month 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.760
 so August 8th 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.620
 it is a wise which is very long it is going 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.230
 which is pretty much every day very 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.850
 intensive so you have to be cool and then 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.650
 after behind in Argentina is released 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.390
 will certainly find the glaciers or 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.740
 maybe too much of this Christmas we'll see 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.930
 conditions 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.820
 this fall david chastan the coach 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.740
 blues technique delivers us the 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.890
 goals he sets to his team 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.540
 first objective is in any case to 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.620
 medium term since it is in the month of 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.290
 February is the Olympic Games 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.210
 this is the most important event in 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.250
 sport in general is all 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.110
 four years on the other hand for us to arrive 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.410
 after and we can defend our 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.480
 odds 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.410
 in February, we absolutely must 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.940
 makes good world cup so the 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.790
 first goal in the short term is 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.520
 holden october 27 october so try 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.560
 to win with one or two guys and then 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.030
 to win places in alpine skiing on 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.970
 world rank is very important 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.680
 since there is a lot of back to there is a 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.560
 first group from 1 to 7 who is shot at 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.230
 fate how much world premiere in the 7th 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.190
 world and from 8 to 15 and after that it is by 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.020
 a global so 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.360
 it's very important because the snow 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.100
 she was working it's important to 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.450
 leave in front for now we have some 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.850
 boys guys in front but it takes 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.260
 still improve or how health 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.570
 this team there are already foals 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.610
 ah well it's a team where there is a 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.710
 world champion already winner of 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.820
 globe it's winners cutting the 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.170
 world but who was hurt 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.750
 unfortunately but that's part of 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.450
 skiing is a sport at risk of injury 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.310
 unfortunately for him it delayed him 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.930
 in his career but then I think he 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.530
 back very well with a big 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.020
 experience 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.340
 after yes we have a nice team one of 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.170
 best teams in the world in these 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.660
 two disciplines so with victories 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.590
 medal podiums as there are 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.570
 a lot of medals and in this 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.010
 team so we will try to be a high 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.460
 level of what we did up 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.930
 present or better 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.669
 the French team and for sure carrier 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.229
 of hope and when one asks 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.120
 the coach to give us a name of 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.889
 foal his answer is up to the 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.139
 goals he sets for his skiers 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:21.120
 prefers to see her several will all 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:24.210
 not die but after that it's there 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.919
 leaders alexis pinturault after one to 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.120
 jean baptiste angers in thomas fanara 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:32.009
 and cyprien richard are not there they 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.970
 will be there at the next internship and learn 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.410
 to young people who can create 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.699
 surprises and then we go to julien who is going 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.979
 try to come back with his experience 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.330
 lizeroux so no but after we have a 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.530
 fairly homogeneous group and actually 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.570
 we have two three four guys who are 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.009
 well placed globally and that's 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.979
 sure it's with a morale over 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:48.389
 luck but after skiing it's a sport 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:50.419
 with a lot of external factors and 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:52.919
 anything can happen if we are well 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.360
 a lot of possibilities the team of 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:55.770
 France is actually considered 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.240
 as one of the strongest and we 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.449
 promises already beautiful 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.449
 satisfaction
