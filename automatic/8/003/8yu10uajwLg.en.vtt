00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
pretty much like guaranteed but of

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.539 
pretty much like guaranteed but of
course<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.619> possibility<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.430> there

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
course there is possibility that there
