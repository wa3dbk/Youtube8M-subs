hi<00:00:02.370> I<00:00:02.399> want<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.760> talk<00:00:03.030> about<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.300> thyroid

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hi I want to talk about a thyroid

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.400 
hi I want to talk about a thyroid
function<00:00:03.859> because<00:00:04.859> it's<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.190> very<00:00:06.410> complex

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
function because it's a very complex

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.990 
function because it's a very complex
subject<00:00:07.649> system<00:00:08.189> that's<00:00:08.460> been<00:00:08.610> simplified

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
subject system that's been simplified

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.890 
subject system that's been simplified
too<00:00:09.900> much<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.679> our<00:00:10.800> society<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.849> if<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.389> are

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
too much in our society so if you are

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.770 
too much in our society so if you are
diagnosed<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.830> hypothyroid<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:15.570> has

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
diagnosed with hypothyroid that has

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.980 
diagnosed with hypothyroid that has
meant<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.320> your<00:00:16.980> doctor<00:00:17.279> has<00:00:17.789> taken<00:00:18.330> TSH

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
meant that your doctor has taken TSH

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.260 
meant that your doctor has taken TSH
test<00:00:19.350> thyroid<00:00:20.070> stimulating<00:00:20.369> hormone<00:00:20.670> test

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
test thyroid stimulating hormone test

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.040 
test thyroid stimulating hormone test
and<00:00:21.590> if<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.619> has<00:00:22.890> been<00:00:23.070> elevated<00:00:24.050> basically

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
and if that has been elevated basically

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.230 
and if that has been elevated basically
if<00:00:25.170> your<00:00:25.320> hypothalamus<00:00:25.680> telemus<00:00:26.670> has

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
if your hypothalamus telemus has

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.620 
if your hypothalamus telemus has
actually<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:28.380> given<00:00:28.800> off<00:00:29.119> not<00:00:30.119> gotten<00:00:30.449> enough

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
are going to have an elevated TSH if you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.540 
are going to have an elevated TSH if you
have<00:00:36.360> no<00:00:36.510> other<00:00:36.630> TSH<00:00:37.260> you're<00:00:37.469> given<00:00:37.770> typically

conventional medicine the problem with
that<00:00:46.230> model<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.690> if<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.190> still

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
that model is that if you have a still

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.720 
that model is that if you have a still
normal<00:00:51.360> TSH<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.160> some<00:00:53.309> reason<00:00:53.610> you're

normal TSH but for some reason you're

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.930 
normal TSH but for some reason you're

T 4 which is the synthroid that you

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.119 
T 4 which is the synthroid that you
might<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.489> getting<00:00:59.640> 2<00:01:00.210> t-3<00:01:00.920> in<00:01:01.920> your

might be getting 2 t-3 in your

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.609 
might be getting 2 t-3 in your
peripheral<00:01:02.579> body<00:01:02.879> fat<00:01:03.149> there<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.780> no<00:01:03.960> testing

peripheral body fat there is no testing

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.600 
peripheral body fat there is no testing
that's<00:01:04.769> traditionally<00:01:05.729> done<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:07.619> tell<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.369> if

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that's traditionally done to tell you if

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
that's traditionally done to tell you if
you're<00:01:08.970> actually<00:01:09.119> converting<00:01:09.689> or<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
you're actually converting or not and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.810 
you're actually converting or not and
you<00:01:10.530> may<00:01:10.650> still<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.920> experiencing<00:01:11.430> symptoms

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
you may still be experiencing symptoms

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.499 
you may still be experiencing symptoms
because<00:01:12.420> t3<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.400> between<00:01:14.400> three<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.790> ten

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
because t3 is between three and ten

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.539 
because t3 is between three and ten
times<00:01:15.810> more<00:01:15.930> powerful<00:01:16.409> than<00:01:16.619> t4<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.490> may

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
times more powerful than t4 so you may

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.100 
times more powerful than t4 so you may
be<00:01:17.610> getting<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.880> huge<00:01:18.270> amount<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.659> synthroid

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
be getting a huge amount of synthroid

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.170 
be getting a huge amount of synthroid
but<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.130> receiving<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> benefits<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
but not be receiving the benefits of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.990 
but not be receiving the benefits of
that<00:01:21.240> centroid<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.909> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that centroid so what you would want to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.890 
that centroid so what you would want to
do<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.810> offset<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.350> would<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> TS

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
do to offset that would be to do a TS

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
do to offset that would be to do a TS
hat3<00:01:27.900> m3<00:01:28.110> t3<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> at<00:01:29.280> three<00:01:29.490> key<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.210> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
hat3 m3 t3 and at three key for and that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.300 
hat3 m3 t3 and at three key for and that
would<00:01:30.420> give<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.689> information<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.409> not

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
would give you the information that not

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.770 
would give you the information that not
only<00:01:32.430> do<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.700> not<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.090> enough<00:01:33.270> thyroid<00:01:33.450> in

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
only do you not have enough thyroid in

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
only do you not have enough thyroid in
your<00:01:33.900> system<00:01:34.259> generally<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
your system generally but you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.999 
your system generally but you
specifically<00:01:35.880> don't<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.509> enough<00:01:37.290> g4<00:01:37.770> or

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
specifically don't have enough g4 or

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.580 
specifically don't have enough g4 or
enough<00:01:38.310> t3<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.170> problem

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
enough t3 so you can see the problem

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
enough t3 so you can see the problem
here<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.310> actually<00:01:41.490> have

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
here is that you can actually have

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
here is that you can actually have
someone<00:01:42.840> taking<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.290> huge<00:01:43.470> amount<00:01:43.649> of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
someone taking a huge amount of

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
someone taking a huge amount of
synthroid<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> doctor<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.390> saying

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
synthroid going to the doctor and saying

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.410 
synthroid going to the doctor and saying
hey<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.439> continued<00:01:46.890> problem<00:01:47.280> i<00:01:47.520> still

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
hey I have a continued problem i still

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.480 
hey I have a continued problem i still
feel<00:01:48.540> all<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> symptoms<00:01:48.960> i<00:01:49.170> had<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
feel all the symptoms i had and the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.370 
feel all the symptoms i had and the
doctor<00:01:50.759> returns<00:01:50.880> its<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.390> well<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.720> TSH<00:01:52.350> is

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
doctor returns its as well your TSH is

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.429 
doctor returns its as well your TSH is
in<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> normal<00:01:53.009> range<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.520> must<00:01:53.759> not<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.240> that

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
in the normal range it must not be that

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.300 
in the normal range it must not be that
when<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.560> haven't<00:01:55.920> done<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.130> further

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
when they haven't done the further

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.990 
when they haven't done the further
testing<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.509> actually<00:01:57.990> possible<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:59.000> test

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
testing it's actually possible to test

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.020 
testing it's actually possible to test
for<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.930> range<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.920> other<00:02:02.159> things<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.820> test

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
is a little more range so if you have

at least the three numbers to give you

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.729 
at least the three numbers to give you
an<00:03:01.969> idea<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.299> where<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.599> are<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.019> now<00:03:03.680> the

an idea of where you are and now the

an idea of where you are and now the

majority of people that's fine because

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.509

that's<00:03:49.699> only<00:03:49.879> been<00:03:50.090> since<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.449> 70s<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:50.989> since

that's only been since the 70s and since

that's only been since the 70s and since
that<00:03:51.319> time<00:03:52.150> it's<00:03:53.150> been<00:03:53.329> standardized<00:03:53.870> as<00:03:54.139> well

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
as the sense of the synthetic stuff so

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.499 
as the sense of the synthetic stuff so
the<00:03:58.069> combination<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.669> armour<00:03:58.939> thyroid<00:03:58.969> that's

00:03:59.499 --> 00:03:59.509 
the combination of armour thyroid that's

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.270 
the combination of armour thyroid that's
got<00:03:59.719> about<00:03:59.870> eighty<00:04:00.049> percent<00:04:00.109> t<00:04:00.709> four<00:04:00.979> and

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
got about eighty percent t four and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.039 
got about eighty percent t four and
twenty<00:04:01.489> percent<00:04:01.699> t3<00:04:02.180> so<00:04:02.359> you<00:04:02.449> can<00:04:02.599> see<00:04:02.750> in<00:04:02.959> a

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
twenty percent t3 so you can see in a

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.779 
twenty percent t3 so you can see in a
subgroup<00:04:03.379> of<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:03.829> population<00:04:04.459> it<00:04:04.549> would<00:04:04.579> be

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:04.789 
subgroup of the population it would be

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:07.089 
subgroup of the population it would be
better<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.180> have<00:04:05.509> them<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:05.930> armor<00:04:06.439> because

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
better to have them on armor because

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.189 
better to have them on armor because
then<00:04:07.519> I'm<00:04:07.639> able<00:04:07.789> to<00:04:07.939> convert<00:04:08.299> to<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.629> t3<00:04:09.169> and

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
then I'm able to convert to the t3 and

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.629 
then I'm able to convert to the t3 and
I'm<00:04:09.439> armors<00:04:09.739> and<00:04:09.769> give<00:04:10.039> them<00:04:10.189> the<00:04:10.219> nice

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
I'm armors and give them the nice

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.219 
combination of the t4 which is what you

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.189 
combination of the t4 which is what you
thought<00:04:13.969> most<00:04:14.180> years<00:04:14.359> are<00:04:14.569> going<00:04:14.719> to<00:04:14.780> be<00:04:14.870> and

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199
