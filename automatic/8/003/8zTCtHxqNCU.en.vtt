 hello today I bring you a recipe 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.960
 refreshing and delicious let's do 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.790
 water with natural fruit flavors is 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.370
 perfect for summer even for 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.309
 lose weight is super healthy and what 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.410
 best of all it's easy to do what 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.080
 first we need these masons 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.359
 jr are these glass containers me 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.480
 I have them in transparent in green and in 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:31.189
 fruit pink I'm going to use raspberries 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.189
 you can use the ones you want 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.250
 and also out there I have 6 zamora 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.080
 Play berries or blackberries as I mentioned 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.910
 this is super easy to do will come or 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.880
 let's put the raspberries in the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.250
 flask in the messenger I'll put the 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.590
 raspberries and half of the other half 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.630
 I'm going to put orange I recommend that you 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.910
 put very little amount of orange 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.140
 because it tends to turn the water into fag 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.920
 another option are yellow lemons it gives 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.250
 a very nice taste and finally 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.190
 we add water and ready in the second 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.680
 I'm going to put blueberries or blueberries 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.580
 after filling half as well 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.020
 I'm going to add raspberries and orange and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.840
 clear water 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.790
 the only fruit that I do not recommend is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.030
 the banana but you can put what you 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.530
 you want the delicious watermelon pineapple or 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.770
 pin and me and in the last senior month 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 I'll add lemons as I also 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.659
 they can use the yellow lemons and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.060
 another option that I love is water from 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.240
 cucumber puts lemon mint leaves 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.840
 yellow and ginger that helps you get off 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.729
 weight and is a good saying that what 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.159
 I'm going to do now is to cover the and 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.650
 put them in the fridge these last until 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.350
 three days in the fridge all depends on 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.340
 your tastes if you want more concentrated 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.619
 with that more intense flavor or if you prefer 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.229
 you can put crimes and serve them 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.740
 You can share this drink with your 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.810
 family on a beach or picnic picnic 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.420

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.959
