00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:05.910
 so hello girls now we will 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.919
 paint 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.849
 my eyebrows attach not just the right eyebrow 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:14.589
 I will leave the left one for comparison, we 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.970
 skip the eyebrow correction shop with 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.010
 using tweezers 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.230
 because yesterday I only for gestures bobbi 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.400
 brown and the shape of my eyebrows is adjusted 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.490
 and so the first step is combing right 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.380
 with the help of such a brush 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.720
 to put our hairs in the right 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.710
 side and in the right position in front 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.710
 contour creation 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.800
 the next step is just the contour i take 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.500
 my pencil is fling away from mac 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.820
 first i draw them ivanter try 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.820
 Recreate as possible. 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.700
 in order to draw an eyebrow by 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.920
 I put the top contour three points and 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.670
 I connect them very simply as a child 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.370
 coloring pages 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.540
 so i can easily draw about 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.540
 eyebrow symmetrical 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.630
 the third step is a flat bevel brush with 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.630
 with which we are healthy and drugs 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.160
 then we turn to the execution of the eyebrow 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.120
 I put flowers on a flat pencil 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.530
 bevel brush 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.530
 and start filling 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.530
 blood 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.630
 Yes 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.480
 in order to achieve more 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.520
 color intensity i found 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.080
 directly pencil on eyebrow but i 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.630
 blonde i need to be with this very 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.930
 neat and because otherwise color may 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.930
 be too saturated and tell you again 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.870
 the next step is I was growing up 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.100
 mark on the eyebrows so that it is not 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.410
 so intense and i use again 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.870
 this brush that we had in the first 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.880
 step you can use a joke like that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.880
 mascara but I prefer to do and 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.700
 Further our eyebrow gel fixer 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.700
 me from vivienne sabo 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.599
 the next step that many miss 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.640
 a series of application concealer under and I direct 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.910
 I use the easiest concealer who 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.230
 i have here of the wounds and 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.380
 feather it with a flat brush 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.130
 for concealer this step is needed in order 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.790
 to bend or break our brow and 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.239
 looked clearer and more strict if 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.239
 so to speak 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.090
 the last step is applying the highlighter I 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.629
 I use not the brightest and we can say 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.170
 slightly shimmer light shadows under her on 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.170
 android 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.380
 and that's what we ended up with by 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.010
 I thank you all enough 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.010
 bye guys
