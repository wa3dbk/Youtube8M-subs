00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.430
 methods a cylinder and this tank from 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.239

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.580
 we pass along the whole range of cactus 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.900
 actually, I think they are all full led 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:55.720
 but something more tangible come with 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:02:03.400
 me because we have the new ds3 with i 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:06.729
 led headlights you see xenon and led with the 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.820
 led band around the lighthouse e 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.459

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.870
