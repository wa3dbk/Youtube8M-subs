00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.360 
I'm definitely putting this and because
this<00:03:06.240> is<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> great<00:03:06.810> unit<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:08.130> actually

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
this is a great unit and I actually

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.730 
this is a great unit and I actually
wouldn't<00:03:08.790> mind<00:03:09.000> using<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.390> daily<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:10.530> was

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
wouldn't mind using this daily this was

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.220 
wouldn't mind using this daily this was
connected<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.400> heavy<00:03:12.330> wooden<00:03:12.630> door<00:03:12.960> and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
connected to a heavy wooden door and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.610 
connected to a heavy wooden door and
something<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.100> noticed<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:15.720> trolley<00:03:16.020> actually

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
something I noticed the trolley actually

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.410 
something I noticed the trolley actually
doesn't<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.040> any<00:03:17.100> play<00:03:17.460> with<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.790> or<00:03:18.060> isn't

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
doesn't have any play with it or isn't

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.500 
doesn't have any play with it or isn't
supposed<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.760> springs<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.420> the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
supposed to but the springs on the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.530 
supposed to but the springs on the
trolley<00:03:22.400> looks<00:03:23.400> like<00:03:23.640> that<00:03:23.910> right<00:03:24.150> one<00:03:24.420> was

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
trolley looks like that right one was

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.020 
trolley looks like that right one was
replaced<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.320> they<00:03:25.740> didn't<00:03:26.010> put<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.550> roll

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
replaced and they didn't put the roll

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.230 
replaced and they didn't put the roll
pin<00:03:27.240> back<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.740> so<00:03:28.740> I<00:03:28.770> just<00:03:29.040> stuck<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.490> screw<00:03:30.090> in

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
pin back in so I just stuck a screw in

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.050 
pin back in so I just stuck a screw in
there<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:31.020> seems<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.680> hold<00:03:31.800> fine<00:03:32.100> but<00:03:32.760> it

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
there and that seems to hold fine but it

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.990 
there and that seems to hold fine but it
was<00:03:33.180> just<00:03:33.420> hitting<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.140> nut<00:03:34.850> instead<00:03:35.850> of

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
was just hitting the nut instead of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.160 
was just hitting the nut instead of
hitting<00:03:36.230> being<00:03:37.230> firm<00:03:37.650> against<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.980> roll<00:03:38.190> pen

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
hitting being firm against the roll pen

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.030 
hitting being firm against the roll pen
so<00:03:41.300> it's<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.330> great<00:03:42.540> unit<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:43.410> door<00:03:43.680> bracket

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
so it's a great unit this door bracket

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.940 
so it's a great unit this door bracket
