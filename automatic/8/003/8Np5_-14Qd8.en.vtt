00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
just enough peach and coral in it so it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.580

can be warming to the lips but it still

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.350 
can be warming to the lips but it still
has<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.800> sheer<00:02:08.100> aspect<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.060> actually

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
has a sheer aspect so it will actually

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.840 
has a sheer aspect so it will actually
blend<00:02:09.570> in<00:02:09.690> with<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.899> lot<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.170> skin<00:02:10.380> tones<00:02:10.850> of
