00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.879
 planets to conquer 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.930
 no no no 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.850
 an aspiring hero called nao part 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.130
 in the search for the legendary weapon at 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.660
 find a sarcophagus and believe that 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.030
 He was inside opens 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.060
 appearing a girl named call 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.490
 sign that makes more of a god 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.590
 while they are walking they are attacked by 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.780
 pig and is curious to discover 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.970
 what they hide is losing 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.939
 accidentally all his powers 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.920
 divine to give them back irma has 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.020
 to do with another mind your galaxy to 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.149
 that the sarcophagus absorbs the power of 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.860
 other twelve gods who dwell there not 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.850
 it remains at the beginning of an adventure 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.850
 hilarious 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.590
 and at any time we want to go 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.870
 directly to the action we can pass 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.770
 quickly the events or accelerate the 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.770
 conversations 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.290
 playable we find one of 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.000
 pgn that explore their huge stages 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.700
 to meet the objectives that we 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.710
 they pose to dominate planets that their gods 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.630
 as we get breaths 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.490
 we get new skills that we 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.980
 allow you to reach areas that used to be 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.660
 inaccessible so we recommend going 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.260
 advancing in the adventure before 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.260
 explore thoroughly 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.090
 and we can avoid the enemies from entering 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.460
 in contact with them or hit them for 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.050
 take the initiative in combat these 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.730
 they are still the same as those of the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.740
 first delivery only that this time 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.900
 we handle sherman who receives 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.390
 souto instructions to learn to 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.050
 use be pure bunnies pawns 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.050
 first game 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.360
 these battles take place in turns 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.700
 and we can move freely for a 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.950
 area bounded by a circle having 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.739
 other smaller ones that mark the scope 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.230
 of our character we can open the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.640
 menu by pressing the x button and selecting the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.640
 objective if we are sufficiently 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.150
 close when we have no enemy 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.010
 around so we can only defend the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.480
 here we find the typical commands of 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.640
 role - playing games like attacking 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.380
 skills held together with others 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.380
 exclusive of the protagonist 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.230
 when we attack any enemy 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.360
 activating a special ability exists 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.099
 the possibility of selecting the plan what 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.230
 that allows you to throw which ball of 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.349
 pool to cause more damage and hit 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.390
 to other rivals you have to be careful already 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.280
 that enemies can also use them 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.760
 reducing the vitality of 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.760
 our group 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.610
 there are some crystals that offer 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.620
 improvements for our character to the 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.510
 entrance in their area had their different 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.489
 characteristics according to their color and 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.450
 being able to consult their functions in 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.450
 any moment 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.590
 we can also convert enemies on 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.720
 money pawns that help in the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.180
 operation of gigas that serve us 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.950
 to launch to other rivals to 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.990
 get it we have to get closer to 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.300
 they try to convince them by giving 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.430
 different speeches being some more 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.090
 effective than others depending on the type 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.090
 of enemies 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.729
 at the end of the fighting we get 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.680
 money objects and experience so that 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.750
 our characters may suffer ten and 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.310
 see what improves its characteristics 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.310
 and allows to learn new skills 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.259
 Okay, yes 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.080
 as we travel we can be 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.880
 attacked by determining the 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.670
 characteristics of our ship the 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.830
 pawns that we are carrying are transformed 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.630
 or throws him to fight in need 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.090
 this way a lot of management by 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.590
 our part here will start a mini 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.660
 game with which we have different 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.430
 options to choose being luck a 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.380
 important factor to consider already 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.490
 that it is a kind of stone 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.490
 babel scissors 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.030
 in the giant we find all the 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.250
 stores available where we can 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.650
 Buy weapons by making them with objects 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.410
 obtained from useful enemies and clothing 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.330
 just like the weapons of this clothes not to 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.610
 its 'number two' since each complement 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.050
 serves to endow the characters with 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.050
 new abilities and powers 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.080
 technically it is quite poor in all 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.300
 its sections except for its 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.890
 striking and original designs both 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.070
 for the characters as of the 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:07.110
 scenarios we also find a low 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.780
 front being a bit strange when 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.460
 we started playing it's a shame that 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.860
 appear no better in the section 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.930
 graphics since I would make him how he will win 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.790
 many points for players who do not 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.390
 are used to this type of 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.390
 Titles 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.479
 the songs that accompany the title 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.509
 they are very cheerful giving a funny tone 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.550
 the adventure has selector 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.740
 voices in English or Japanese what gives us 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.900
 an opportunity to enjoy with your 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.910
 original dubbing as it has been 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.050
 usual in this type of games only 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.050
 comes subtitled in English 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:48.049
 in conclusion very dense theta is a 

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:49.999
 title with a story always pro 

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:52.149
 fun although to understand it 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:54.649
 missing a decent level of English 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:56.419
 your battle system has 

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:58.039
 multitude of options that occasionally 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:01.309
 makes the rhythms but once 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.509
 dominated it becomes very intuitive the 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:05.209
 multitude of customization options 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:07.309
 and the high level of reach by our 

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:10.509
 characters guarantee us lots of 

00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:10.509
 hours of entertainment 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.990
 the graphic section is still one of 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.460
 the pending tasks of the company already 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.169
 that your good designs look 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.539
 wasted with an execution 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:26.660
 quite poor three-dimensional and a low 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:28.789
 frame rate the melodies the voices by 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.020
 another part enjoy a good quality of 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:32.020
 that force with the game 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:39.520
 a title that we recommend to lovers 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.649
 of the classic Japanese role-playing games 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.819
 with lots of options despite their 

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:44.819
 poor technical section
