 Greetings from currency I think that was 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.780

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.800
 they should do that but then it became 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.320
 We decided to go back with man and mouse 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.950
 together and go to the project and 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.950

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.600

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.570
 cut off at a height of about 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.089
 300 millimeters then we started 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.759
 have constructed this intermediate floor 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.950
 that of the vibration and the face 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.650

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.990
