00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.509
 nothing 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.560
 lose 3 is one of them 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.119
 we like to define it as a project 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.519
 of songs 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.560
 if we are going to say it in a more sophisticated way 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.870
 a day oratory of songs because all the time we are developing 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.649
 songs 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.110
 so that people listen 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.010
 then that skips a bit about the styles 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.770
 by the way it's fine 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.860
 or we can say radio music is fine 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.580
 but beyond that 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.100
 we do not like it will start to return it too much to classify styles that 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.630
 things because it's the same 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.830
 It seems to me that people have long since realized that they stamped themselves 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.290
 of output I think not 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.260
 the public at a time that knows that that no longer 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.330
 that if it is no longer used in any way 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
 yes carrier simply group 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 ansa 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.920
 nothing we work on this project of songs from 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.270
 the miners 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.650
 when 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.870
 Eliana was the singer's 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.510
 the video recording 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.360
 of michou first done in the colon 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.430
 in 2002 so we started diego simeone very experimental 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.640
 i 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.350
 from there we started working and developing here developing 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 materials i 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.070
 I had the songs that he composed many years ago and we started 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.770
 arias is also what electronic fashion and all this 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.370
 at that moment 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.829
 then percent 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.650
 it was the only chance to say good we want to do things 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.460
 because john is interested in listening then let's assemble a project to do 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.090
 sound those songs 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.090
 and so was born 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.569
 public we did not have anything 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.939
 we had made a song for a movie that every pc in the movie 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.319
 and that it was in a disc that the embassy took off Spain as it would be in 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.959

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.669

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:29.299
 remix expressed after versions and variations iun 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.789

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.999

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.249
