mess because I don't want to spoil
anything<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.250> about<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.700> for

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
anything so I think that's about it for

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.179 
anything so I think that's about it for
this<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:10.110> thing<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> show<00:01:10.920> now

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
this the thing what I want to show now

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.250 
this the thing what I want to show now
is<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.000> room<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:12.750> are<00:01:12.930> all<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
is all the room so these are all the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.990 
is all the room so these are all the
rooms<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.650> think<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:14.310> these<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> rooms

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
rooms I think if these are all the rooms

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880 
rooms I think if these are all the rooms
where<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.360> mobs<00:01:15.630> are<00:01:15.840> spawning<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
where the mobs are spawning so the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.490 
where the mobs are spawning so the
monster<00:01:17.159> spawning<00:01:17.460> over<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.689> these<00:01:19.439> are

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
monster spawning over here and these are

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.039 
monster spawning over here and these are
all<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.009> sick<00:01:20.490> rooms<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> go

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
all the sick rooms and you have to go

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.780 
all the sick rooms and you have to go
down<00:01:22.320> there<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:22.979> see<00:01:23.100> how<00:01:23.250> much<00:01:23.460> rest

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
down there so you can see how much rest

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.090 
down there so you can see how much rest
on<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> map<00:01:24.210> make<00:01:24.390> use<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.869> buy<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.740> rest<00:01:25.950> we

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
on the map make use and buy the rest we

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.270 
on the map make use and buy the rest we
could<00:01:26.280> see<00:01:26.580> how<00:01:27.020> like<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.439> cool<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> map

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
could see how like really cool this map

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.999 
could see how like really cool this map
is<00:01:29.460> because<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.060> always<00:01:30.659> said<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.829> more

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
is because I always said how the more

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.069 
is because I always said how the more
redstone<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.640> map<00:01:32.850> maker<00:01:33.119> use<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.810> better

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
redstone the map maker use is the better

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.160 
redstone the map maker use is the better
it<00:01:34.549> most<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.729> time<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.960> looks

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
it most of the time is so this looks

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.990 
it most of the time is so this looks
really<00:01:37.439> sick<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.009> he<00:01:38.220> used<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:38.700> of

you<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.790> into<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.299> map<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> take

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
you get into the map you have to take

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.130 
you get into the map you have to take
this<00:01:49.140> word<00:01:49.380> with<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.130> some<00:01:50.909> food<00:01:51.899> with

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.870 
this word with you and some food with
you<00:01:52.320> because<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:52.860> playing<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.280> survival

you because you are playing in survival

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.060 
you because you are playing in survival
mode<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.600> we're<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.079> down<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:55.890> so

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
mode so we're going down in here so

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.389 
mode so we're going down in here so
let's<00:01:56.399> jump<00:01:56.640> down<00:01:57.680> open<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.799> finger<00:01:59.280> over

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
let's jump down open this finger over

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.929 
let's jump down open this finger over
here

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
here

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.270 
here
I<00:01:59.969> think<00:02:00.450> yep<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.170> there<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.979> we're<00:02:02.130> in

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
I think yep and there we go so we're in

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.499 
I think yep and there we go so we're in
the<00:02:02.430> map<00:02:02.579> right<00:02:02.759> now<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.030> I've<00:02:03.119> explained

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the map right now and I've explained

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.660 
the map right now and I've explained
really<00:02:03.960> quick<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.310> do<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.520> here

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
really quick what you can do in here

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.119 
really quick what you can do in here
because<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.149> map<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.450> more<00:02:06.920> expanded<00:02:07.920> than

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
because this map is more expanded than

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.600 
because this map is more expanded than
all<00:02:08.340> other<00:02:08.670> planets<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.860> Freddy's<00:02:10.860> maps<00:02:11.099> so

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
all other planets of Freddy's maps so

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.910 
all other planets of Freddy's maps so
you<00:02:11.640> can't<00:02:12.120> pause<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.319> line<00:02:13.530> because

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
you can't pause this line because

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.040 
you can't pause this line because
mess<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.459> redstone<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.300> stay<00:02:15.630> in<00:02:15.840> this

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
mess up the redstone so stay in this

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.580 
mess up the redstone so stay in this
area<00:02:16.260> over<00:02:17.220> here<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.090> two<00:02:18.239> fences<00:02:18.690> well

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
area over here we have two fences well

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.320 
area over here we have two fences well
once<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.040> press<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> button<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.849> fence<00:02:21.120> will

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
once you press a button the fence will

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.680 
once you press a button the fence will
close<00:02:21.599> in<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:23.550> room<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:24.180> once<00:02:24.510> you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
close in that that room so once you

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.620 
close in that that room so once you
press<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:25.319> button<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:26.730> will<00:02:26.760> close<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.390> room

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
press this button it will close the room

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.890 
press this button it will close the room
I<00:02:27.900> think<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.709> mean<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:28.980> fence<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
I think I mean the fence in the in the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900 
I think I mean the fence in the in the
second<00:02:31.319> room<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:31.890> will<00:02:32.040> turn<00:02:32.220> green<00:02:32.250> and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
second room and it will turn green and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.520 
second room and it will turn green and
once<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.420> press<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.440> example

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
once you press this one for example

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.790 
once you press this one for example
fourth<00:02:35.160> one<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:36.270> one<00:02:36.540> will<00:02:36.660> close<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.260> this

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
fourth one this one will close and this

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.180 
fourth one this one will close and this
one<00:02:38.270> will<00:02:39.270> get<00:02:39.780> open<00:02:40.050> again<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.010> base

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
one will get open again so this base

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.720 
one will get open again so this base
that<00:02:41.220> works<00:02:42.709> now<00:02:43.709> over<00:02:44.099> here<00:02:44.280> we<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.550> two

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
that works now over here we have two

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.390 
that works now over here we have two
lights<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.360> spring-trap<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.190> just

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
lights on spring-trap so you can just

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.870 
lights on spring-trap so you can just
take<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.060> look<00:02:48.269> over<00:02:48.480> here<00:02:48.600> where<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.200> mobs<00:02:49.500> are

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
take a look over here where the mobs are

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.370 
take a look over here where the mobs are
once<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:50.970> are<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.360> 10th<00:02:51.690> room<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.350> are

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
once you are in the 10th room you are

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.979 
once you are in the 10th room you are
basically<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.040> dead<00:02:53.850> yeah<00:02:54.750> that's

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
basically just dead yeah that's

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.559 
basically just dead yeah that's
basically<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.530> would<00:02:55.620> work<00:02:55.890> sure<00:02:56.130> it's<00:02:56.280> just

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
basically I would work sure it's just

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.059 
basically I would work sure it's just
you're<00:02:57.569> just<00:02:57.600> screwed<00:02:58.080> up<00:02:58.230> if<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.620> happens

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
you're just screwed up if that happens

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.220 
you're just screwed up if that happens
so<00:02:59.670> very<00:02:59.970> if<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.239> audio<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.870> press<00:03:01.049> off

playing they can turn the camera audio
defense<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.150> all<00:03:09.269> of<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.630> off<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.980> once<00:03:11.190> this

turn audio often once this is off they
turn<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.260> fence<00:03:19.530> off<00:03:19.829> so<00:03:20.010> that's<00:03:20.190> basically<00:03:20.489> I

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
turn the fence off so that's basically I

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.490 
turn the fence off so that's basically I
work<00:03:20.880> it's<00:03:21.120> pretty<00:03:21.450> hard<00:03:21.750> ass<00:03:22.019> awesome<00:03:22.380> of
