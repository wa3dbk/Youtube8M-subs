00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 good friends of law today I want to talk to you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.109
 from a special guide the yorick guide 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.780
 only top but before I start 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.700
 like to say a personal thing I have 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.349
 I see that in the forum they tell me 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.080
 that my guide are quite lazy 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.539
 compared to the others and then I really 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.029
 they said to put me to look at a 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.070
 little more the very the guides in general 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.590
 and that I put myself to prove it enough 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.349
 I have done it before I started with 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.349
 this guide I've been about four or five 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.360
 hours trying the character watching him what 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.660
 commented with colleagues and they have 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.850
 therefore recommended more or less this guide 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.220
 I want to show the I would like a good 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 opinion that people will think of their will 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.530
 and everything else as well let 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.000
 start with yorick the gravedigger the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.860
 death is only the beginning 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.290
 well in this guide I will explain how 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.400
 go jolie in only top as you know 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.670
 attributes of yori is melee 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.900
 pusher and fighter to start good 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.110
 we'll talk a little bit of your skills 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.120
 the passive pact sent yorick suffer 5% 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.860
 less damage and its basic attack perhaps 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.900
 in 5% more damage for each invocation 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.970
 active meanwhile the so 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.230
 Yoris has 35 percent of his life 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.230
 and total attack damage 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.790
 now harbinger of war the next 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.920
 yorick attack infinity physical damage 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.420
 additional and invoke a demon affects 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.590
 to which he fixes additional damage and moves 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.450
 faster than the other demons of 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.610
 yorick while spectral demon follow 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.610
 I live jolie also moves faster 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.230
 his next skill is an omen of 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.940
 yorick pestilence invoking demons 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.440
 decomposed that comes with a violent 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.240
 damaging explosion slows down the 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.980
 nearby enemies while demons 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.450
 decomposed keep the enemies alive 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.450
 close still slowed 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.630
 the ability is presages hunger 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.310
 Jordi new life to his goal himself with 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.509
 voracious demon that heals york and the same 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.509
 amount of damage it inflicts 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.579
 now we have the final omen of 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.829
 death jordi not with spectral demon 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.239
 with the image of one of his allies without 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.340
 allies die while demons follow 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.050
 with life he sacrifices himself to bring him 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.330
 back and let the copper be charged 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.040
 revenge to also think that of 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.040
 death can be thrown on itself 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.000
 the invoker joke that we should 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.890
 use would be flash and cure as you know 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.770
 flash serves to avoid gun that you 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.450
 jump over the enemy and heal will not 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.780
 that we endure much more the lane 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.780
 enemy 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.300
 now I talk about his sequence of 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.100
 skills as you see primarily 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.500
 I raise the weighing of hunger as you know 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.660
 when we throw the demon we steal the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.430
 life and also the devil when it hits 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.440
 it does not happen to the same amount of damage 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.840
 that inflicts then goes up weighing the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.760
 presidency because as you can see when the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.830
 jungle can not what up we can 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.770
 slow down enemies and the possibility of 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.630
 kill from killing, then raise the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.580
 definitive and finally the weighing of 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.080
 war in case you want to do more 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.090
 damage instead of reducing the speed of 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.380
 enemy I will raise jce more times the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.480
 character of the war that is of the 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.330
 pestilence that's more player adjustment 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.830
 although it is advisable to get on the 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.830
 order that I am teaching the screen 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.330
 at the beginning of the game we will catch boots 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.790
 of speed since with the movement 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.530
 faster we will hold much more in the 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.060
 top lane then we have two 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.550
 life positions as well 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.410
 we will hold the lane much more and then 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.880
 pillaremos an option since mana 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.980
 Yorick skills consume much more 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.810
 if we have the top 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.430
 enemies that cause us a lot of damage 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.980
 we should catch the chalice of the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.690
 harmony so we can generate more 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.580
 fast mana and endure much more the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.020
 survival of carlita up in case 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.520
 that in the top lane there is not a 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.320
 character that can be so much threat 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.180
 as to tear down we should 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.650
 villains the tear of the goddess since 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.360
 it gives us a lot of mana and in the future 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.950
 we could do not manna munné that no 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.100
 would benefit enough to eliminate 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.540
 many enemies in future team fight the 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.370
 bottle that I recommend are the boots 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.720
 mercury since they reduce us in 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.120
 trainings and also gives us 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.620
 improved movement +2 now we had 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.260
 villain to the wood of war moore as 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.550
 you know ladies 920 of life patents of 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.890
 life registration every five seconds 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.360
 and also his passive doing 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.600
 accumulations for each path we 're going 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.830
 eliminating with a total of 350 of life and 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.000
 more than life reception every five 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.560
 seconds 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.020
 the next object that we should 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.180
 catch us would be ice heart like 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.670
 you know both 99 of armor and more 500 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.140
 mana plus only passive gives 20% of 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.060
 foundation reduction and has an aura 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.840
 unique that reduces by 20 percent the 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.780
 Attack speed of enemies 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.460
 close it never comes more to have veil 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.010
 the Banshee no longer facing 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.500
 375 of life plus 300 is identified from 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.270
 mana plus 50 magic resistance and one 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.680
 only passive that grants a shield of 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.510
 spell that blocks the next life of 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.070
 enemy this we will do that we do not suffer 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.380
 training in my both the triumphant 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.510
 I would recommend that you catch eiser in 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.100
 stopped guns since they give you more 45 of 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.870
 armor to 18 percent of 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.640
 critical impact probability and in addition 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.710
 a single passive that grants a damage of 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.630
 attack equal to 15 percent of your life 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.270
 maximum this will serve us so that the 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.950
 casting fight we can cause damage in 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.630
 If we do not buy the tear 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.460
 the goddess we would sell the chalice of the 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.560
 mania and we would not lack the activity 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.510
 since it gives us many benefits that are 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.460
 the following patients attack damage 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.710
 will keep power gives life enough of 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.390
 attack speed by 15% priority 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.889
 of critical impact plus 12 speed 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.620
 of movement plus 250 divided into 205 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.120
 we also have a single passive that 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.889
 when we make a basic attack we have 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.449
 a 25 percent chance of 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.490
 slow down the movement speed 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.800
 of objectives by 35 percent during 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.659
 25 seconds we also have technique 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.580
 passive than when we make a skill 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.949
 our next have basic and fix 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.319
 additional physical damage equal to 150% of 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.300
 total damage that basic in case 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.370
 we bought the cream of the goddess where 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.710
 we would see to do manna munné since 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.150
 gives us more than 150 weeks plus 7 of 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.340
 mana regeneration every five seconds 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.870
 and more 20 attack damage and we also have 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.490
 a massive one that gives us damage 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.740
 of attack equal to those present to take 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.539
 to maximum and also another single passive 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.129
 every time you use a basic attack you 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.569
 Mana will increase by 1 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.029
 and every time we use a skill 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.919
 our mana will increase in box if 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.539
 that you want to tank more could 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.519
 do it then the guardian angel or 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.279
 force nature if you want to generate 

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:17.779
 the most make a force nature and if 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.969
 you want to resurrect and take more 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:22.669
 our definitive should we do the 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:24.759
 generates saves briefly in case of 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.809
 that we have a more difficult top 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.919
 we should use the following 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:31.009
 objects that are marked with the 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.559
 arrows in case the top is more 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.639
 soft and we want to do more damage 

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:36.889
 we should catch the objects that 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.199
 are marked with the arrows I hope 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.969
 that you like the video and this time I 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.429
 taken this guide more calmly the 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:45.259
 vila I went up yesterday but that guide I did not take 

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:47.240
 So much detail is he has taken more 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.529
 quiet and I think it was more advanced 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.709
 and studied them more thoroughly 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:53.779
 I hope you like this guide more if it is 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:57.439
 so I will take more calm in those in the 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:59.300
 strong guides and I will observe it day by day 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:00.800
 I will also show you a picture of how 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.529
 I played in the four parts games 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.899
 before making the video and you will see that it gives 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:07.189
 statistics are not so bad then nothing 

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:08.719
 more then I hope you like the video 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:10.490
 I'll upload a gameplay so you can see how 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:12.199
 is the evolution of the character 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.490
 and good that I give to I like and I hope 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.490
 subscribe a greeting
