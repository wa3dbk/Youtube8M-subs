be able to share them with other people
and<00:00:21.410> caught<00:00:22.410> emblem<00:00:22.769> tutorials<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.460> you

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
and caught emblem tutorials if you

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.420 
and caught emblem tutorials if you
showed<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.180> choose<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.650> first<00:00:25.859> step<00:00:26.010> or

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
showed so choose so the first step or

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.160 
showed so choose so the first step or
basically<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> main<00:00:27.390> way<00:00:27.570> we're<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> be

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
basically the main way we're going to be

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.230 
basically the main way we're going to be
doing<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.980> pull<00:00:29.279> them<00:00:29.490> off<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.730> call

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
doing that is to pull them off of call

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.749 
doing that is to pull them off of call
duty<00:00:30.510> elite<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.590> first<00:00:31.800> step<00:00:31.920> would<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
duty elite so the first step would be to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.340 
duty elite so the first step would be to
go<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.090> call<00:00:33.480> duty<00:00:33.690> elite<00:00:34.610> call<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.880> duty<00:00:36.350> elite

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
go to call duty elite call of duty elite

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.860 
go to call duty elite call of duty elite
I<00:00:37.649> think<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> URL<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:38.940> called<00:00:39.300> duty<00:00:39.540> calm

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
I think the URL is called duty calm

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.139 
I think the URL is called duty calm
elite<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.820> don't<00:00:41.969> have<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
elite so go to that if you don't have a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.720 
elite so go to that if you don't have a
profile<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:42.870> an<00:00:42.960> account<00:00:43.260> made<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:44.550> sign<00:00:44.700> up

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
profile or an account made just sign up

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.940 
profile or an account made just sign up
for<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.300> free<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.050> point<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.559> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
for it it's free at this point and I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.410 
for it it's free at this point and I
don't<00:00:47.129> think<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
don't think that you have to be a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.209 
don't think that you have to be a
subscriber<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:49.110> anything<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:50.039> all

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
subscriber or anything like that for all

subscriber or anything like that for all
that<00:00:50.370> dlc<00:00:50.850> stuff<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.809> pay<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:51.989> the

that dlc stuff like you can pay for the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.700 
service i think if you want but i don't
think<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.050> do<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.379> i<00:00:55.530> don't

think that you have to do like i don't

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.069 
think that you have to do like i don't
think<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.949> will<00:00:56.219> affect<00:00:56.640> anything<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.570> log

very<00:01:45.000> small<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:45.960> we're<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.439> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
very small so what we're going to do is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.190 
very small so what we're going to do is
change<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.100> size<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> actual<00:01:48.299> image<00:01:48.720> URL

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
change the size in the actual image URL

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.649 
change the size in the actual image URL
or<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> actual<00:01:49.649> page<00:01:50.009> URL<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.820> here<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.270> you'll

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
or the actual page URL up here so you'll

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.319 
or the actual page URL up here so you'll
see<00:01:51.899> towards<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> end<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.130> dress<00:01:53.460> size

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
see towards the end of that a dress size

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.109 
see towards the end of that a dress size
equals<00:01:54.899> 40<00:01:55.320> we're<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.430> select<00:01:56.640> 40

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
equals 40 we're just going to select 40

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.580 
equals 40 we're just going to select 40
and<00:01:57.299> change<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> different<00:01:58.049> number<00:01:58.229> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and change it to a different number I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.200 
and change it to a different number I
would<00:01:59.070> recommend<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.579> changing<00:01:59.909> it<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.090> like

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
would recommend just changing it to like

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.209 
would recommend just changing it to like
500<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.380> pretty<00:02:01.770> decent

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
500 you know it's a pretty decent

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.520 
500 you know it's a pretty decent
default<00:02:02.759> size<00:02:03.000> hit<00:02:03.930> enter<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.469> then

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
default size hit enter and then

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.459 
default size hit enter and then
magically<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:06.119> size<00:02:06.299> will<00:02:06.540> change<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.320> here

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
magically the size will change so here

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.090 
magically the size will change so here
we<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:07.619> here's<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.009> five<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> 500<00:02:09.509> pixel<00:02:10.229> image

player card ran into some problems with

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.010 
player card ran into some problems with
how<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.160> was<00:02:17.280> displayed<00:02:17.760> yeah<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.870> this

how it was displayed yeah it like this

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.660 
how it was displayed yeah it like this
is<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.200> common<00:02:19.560> problem<00:02:19.710> like<00:02:20.010> what<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.310> create

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
is a common problem like what you create

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.900 
is a common problem like what you create
in<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.000> an<00:02:21.690> actual<00:02:22.380> emblem<00:02:23.250> editors<00:02:23.640> and

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
in the an actual emblem editors and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.820 
in the an actual emblem editors and
always<00:02:24.090> what's<00:02:24.300> displayed<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:25.170> your<00:02:25.200> profile

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
always what's displayed on your profile

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.980 
always what's displayed on your profile
ran<00:02:26.460> into<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.730> problem<00:02:26.850> with<00:02:27.450> certain<00:02:27.780> lines

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
ran into that problem with certain lines

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.650 
ran into that problem with certain lines
or<00:02:28.380> layer<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.340> I'll<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:29.820> note<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.150> but

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
or layer so I'll just note that but

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.170 
or layer so I'll just note that but
anyway<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.460> bad<00:02:32.670> thing<00:02:32.880> about<00:02:32.910> this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
anyway so the bad thing about this

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.810 
anyway so the bad thing about this
method<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.470> can't<00:02:34.800> just<00:02:35.070> save<00:02:35.370> you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
method is that you can't just save you

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.250 
method is that you can't just save you
know<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.000> can't<00:02:36.270> right<00:02:36.510> click<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.050> image

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
know you can't right click on this image

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.230 
know you can't right click on this image
and<00:02:37.620> save<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.070> image<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.030> can't

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
and save the image and you can't

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.110 
and save the image and you can't
actually<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.750> on<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.230> small<00:02:40.470> one<00:02:40.740> either

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
actually do that on the small one either

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.200 
actually do that on the small one either
but<00:02:42.120> um<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.620> what<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:43.980> would<00:02:44.250> recommend<00:02:44.400> you're

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
but um so what I would recommend you're

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.970 
but um so what I would recommend you're
like<00:02:45.360> like<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:46.140> still<00:02:46.350> part<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.740> web

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
like like it's still part of the web

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.700 
like like it's still part of the web
page<00:02:47.190> you're<00:02:47.490> like<00:02:47.610> there's<00:02:47.790> no<00:02:47.970> save<00:02:48.240> image

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
page you're like there's no save image

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.110 
page you're like there's no save image
or<00:02:49.710> anything<00:02:49.980> like<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.460> if<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.640> save<00:02:50.880> as

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
or anything like that like if I save as

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.060 
or anything like that like if I save as
it'll<00:02:51.750> actually<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:52.230> save<00:02:52.380> like<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.890> web

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
it'll actually just save like the web

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.610 
it'll actually just save like the web
page<00:02:53.360> so<00:02:54.360> that's<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:54.720> what<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:54.990> want<00:02:55.230> we<00:02:55.590> want

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
page so that's not what we want we want

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.170 
page so that's not what we want we want
the<00:02:55.890> actual<00:02:56.280> image<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.790> what<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.000> would

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the actual image so what I would

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.670 
the actual image so what I would
recommend<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.810> just<00:02:58.080> take<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.290> screenshot

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
recommend is to just take a screenshot

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.520 
recommend is to just take a screenshot
of<00:02:59.070> your<00:02:59.160> desktop<00:02:59.820> on<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.720> every<00:03:00.930> keyboard<00:03:01.320> has

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
of your desktop on so every keyboard has

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.590 
of your desktop on so every keyboard has
like<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.770> print<00:03:02.100> screen<00:03:02.220> button<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:03.300> either<00:03:03.480> a

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
like a print screen button it's either a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.080 
like a print screen button it's either a
like<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.080> your<00:03:04.260> f<00:03:04.410> buttons<00:03:04.920> at<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.790> top<00:03:05.910> of

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
like in your f buttons at the top of

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.880 
like in your f buttons at the top of
your<00:03:06.240> keyboard<00:03:06.720> or<00:03:06.900> like<00:03:07.170> directly<00:03:07.530> next<00:03:07.740> to

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
your keyboard or like directly next to

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.680 
your keyboard or like directly next to
them<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.520> I'm<00:03:08.610> just<00:03:08.700> going<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.910> hit<00:03:09.060> my<00:03:09.450> print

to<00:04:57.560> just<00:04:57.710> go<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.920> imager<00:04:58.460> on<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:59.390> then<00:04:59.600> you<00:04:59.690> can

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
to just go to imager on and then you can

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.230 
to just go to imager on and then you can
just<00:05:00.020> go<00:05:00.170> to<00:05:00.610> upload<00:05:01.610> images<00:05:02.000> from<00:05:02.180> your

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
just go to upload images from your

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.020 
just go to upload images from your
computer<00:05:02.860> find<00:05:03.860> where<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:04.400> uploaded<00:05:04.940> that

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
computer find where you uploaded that

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.180 
computer find where you uploaded that
image<00:05:05.390> so<00:05:05.570> this<00:05:05.690> is<00:05:05.810> where<00:05:05.990> I<00:05:06.020> save<00:05:06.890> that<00:05:07.070> image

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
image so this is where I save that image

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.360 
image so this is where I save that image
to<00:05:07.850> my<00:05:07.970> computer<00:05:08.440> so<00:05:09.440> we'll<00:05:09.830> click<00:05:10.010> on<00:05:10.190> that

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
to my computer so we'll click on that

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.210 
to my computer so we'll click on that
start<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.510> upload<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.170> then<00:05:12.830> you're<00:05:13.010> going

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
start the upload and then you're going

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.330

although<00:06:30.950> i<00:06:31.070> guess<00:06:31.220> that<00:06:31.550> would<00:06:31.700> be<00:06:31.730> like<00:06:32.060> the

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
although i guess that would be like the

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.450 
although i guess that would be like the
best<00:06:32.419> case<00:06:32.630> scenario<00:06:33.080> you<00:06:33.710> know<00:06:34.010> whether<00:06:34.250> it's

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
best case scenario you know whether it's

best case scenario you know whether it's
just<00:06:34.520> emblems<00:06:35.060> that<00:06:35.330> you've<00:06:35.570> made<00:06:35.960> from<00:06:36.229> our
