they don't get as much reading done and
that's<00:01:57.570> perfectly<00:01:57.960> okay

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that's perfectly okay

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.590

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
watching TV or sleeping sometimes but i

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.719 
watching TV or sleeping sometimes but i
think<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> thing<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.560> people<00:02:07.979> need<00:02:08.489> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
think the thing that people need to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.260 
think the thing that people need to
constantly<00:02:09.119> remember<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.929> there

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
constantly remember is that there

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.960 
constantly remember is that there
no<00:02:10.420> like<00:02:11.200> raking<00:02:11.770> system<00:02:12.220> in<00:02:12.580> terms<00:02:12.760> of

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
no like raking system in terms of

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.000 
no like raking system in terms of
reading<00:02:13.300> like<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:14.260> person<00:02:14.590> who<00:02:14.680> reads<00:02:14.860> a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
reading like the person who reads a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.830 
reading like the person who reads a
hundred<00:02:15.280> books<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.670> year<00:02:15.820> is<00:02:16.060> not<00:02:16.270> twice

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
hundred books in the year is not twice

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.780 
hundred books in the year is not twice
as<00:02:17.170> good<00:02:17.410> as<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.740> person<00:02:18.190> who<00:02:18.280> read<00:02:18.460> 50<00:02:18.760> books

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
as good as the person who read 50 books

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.580 
as good as the person who read 50 books
in<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.210> year<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.690> think<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:20.020> setting<00:02:20.320> goals<00:02:20.470> for

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
in a year I think that setting goals for

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.980 
in a year I think that setting goals for
yourself<00:02:20.710> is<00:02:21.220> like<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.670> great<00:02:22.090> idea<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
yourself is like a great idea and a

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.480 
yourself is like a great idea and a
great<00:02:23.110> way<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.350> motivate<00:02:23.560> yourself<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.460> I

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
great way to motivate yourself but I

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.270 
great way to motivate yourself but I
think<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:25.000> problem<00:02:25.540> with<00:02:25.780> reading<00:02:26.530> goals<00:02:26.890> is

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
think the problem with reading goals is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.040 
think the problem with reading goals is
that<00:02:27.490> people<00:02:27.820> get<00:02:28.000> too<00:02:28.210> bogged<00:02:28.480> down<00:02:28.570> in<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
that people get too bogged down in the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.320 
that people get too bogged down in the
numbers<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.890> really<00:02:30.220> especially<00:02:31.090> here<00:02:31.300> at

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
numbers and really especially here at
