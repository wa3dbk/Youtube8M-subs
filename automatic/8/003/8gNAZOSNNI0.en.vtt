00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
underneath and then i follow this and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.880 
underneath and then i follow this and
then<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.260> go<00:03:01.500> back<00:03:01.650> over<00:03:02.070> with<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.580> q-tip<00:03:03.390> or<00:03:03.890> some

then I go back over with a q-tip or some

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.090 
then I go back over with a q-tip or some
sort<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.540> kleenex<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:07.290> make<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.560> really<00:03:07.830> fine

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
sort of kleenex to make it really fine

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.650 
sort of kleenex to make it really fine
but<00:03:08.490> even<00:03:08.730> then<00:03:08.880> I'm<00:03:09.030> not<00:03:09.060> getting<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
but even then I'm not getting the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.570 
but even then I'm not getting the
results<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.200> they<00:03:10.440> have<00:03:10.800> here<00:03:11.160> in<00:03:11.340> these

not<00:03:16.590> really<00:03:17.450> willing<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.750> go<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.140> say<00:03:19.290> that

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
not really willing to go and say that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.470 
not really willing to go and say that
it's<00:03:19.680> not<00:03:19.890> not<00:03:20.190> lie<00:03:20.490> that<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.000> can't<00:03:21.300> get

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
it's not not lie that you can't get

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.390 
it's not not lie that you can't get
exactly<00:03:22.110> these<00:03:22.620> results<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:24.750> um<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.709> haven't

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
exactly these results but um I haven't

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.800

mastered<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.090> I've<00:03:27.300> had<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.600> for<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.750> couple

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
mastered it and I've had it for a couple

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.110 
mastered it and I've had it for a couple
of<00:03:28.080> weeks<00:03:28.200> so<00:03:28.890> if<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.190> expect<00:03:29.610> this<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.970> be<00:03:30.000> a

to<00:04:36.330> makeup<00:04:36.540> this<00:04:37.080> is<00:04:37.200> how<00:04:37.320> much<00:04:37.500> roughly

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
to makeup this is how much roughly

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.210 
to makeup this is how much roughly
roughly<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.450> have<00:04:39.960> used<00:04:40.140> this<00:04:40.380> a<00:04:40.590> fair<00:04:41.100> amount

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
roughly I have used this a fair amount

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.840 
roughly I have used this a fair amount
of<00:04:41.430> times<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:42.450> this<00:04:42.630> is<00:04:42.780> roughly<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:44.700> amount

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
of times so this is roughly the amount

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.260 
of times so this is roughly the amount
you<00:04:45.210> get<00:04:46.160> in<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.310> tube<00:04:47.580> I'm<00:04:47.789> sure<00:04:48.030> there's

you get in the tube I'm sure there's

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.740 
you get in the tube I'm sure there's
more<00:04:48.660> inside<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.740> tube

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
more inside of the tube

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.440 
more inside of the tube
that<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.710> can<00:04:51.890> scoop<00:04:52.220> out<00:04:52.400> later<00:04:52.700> if<00:04:53.030> you're

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
that you can scoop out later if you're

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.030 
that you can scoop out later if you're
