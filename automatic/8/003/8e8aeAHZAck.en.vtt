00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
hilarious because most of the shops are

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.460 
hilarious because most of the shops are
closed<00:05:19.220> up<00:05:19.430> shots<00:05:19.669> with<00:05:20.600> like<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.810> blue<00:05:21.139> sky

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470

background or like an out-of-focus
building<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:24.410> this<00:05:24.710> was<00:05:24.860> made<00:05:25.010> in<00:05:25.039> 2006<00:05:25.580> and

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
building and this was made in 2006 and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.279 
building and this was made in 2006 and
as<00:05:26.120> you<00:05:26.240> can<00:05:26.389> see<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.750> animation<00:05:26.990> is<00:05:27.229> really

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
as you can see the animation is really

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.700 
as you can see the animation is really
subpar<00:05:28.070> totally<00:05:28.789> subpar<00:05:29.270> and<00:05:29.510> I<00:05:30.260> didn't

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
subpar totally subpar and I didn't

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.980 
subpar totally subpar and I didn't
expect<00:05:30.800> much<00:05:31.190> more<00:05:31.250> than<00:05:31.639> subpar<00:05:32.030> so<00:05:32.330> I<00:05:32.360> can't

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
expect much more than subpar so I can't

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.080
