00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.810
 Hello everyone today I am going to talk about this 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.220
 so beautiful plant that is called heather its 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.950
 scientific name is that there is a 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.420
 vulgaris is a plant that does not lose 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.449
 leaf that has some pink flowers in 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.369
 the tip of the branches and that is ideal 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.189
 for our garden to place it in the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.650
 area dumbrÃ­a the leaves are very small 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.170
 and are as similar to that of the pines 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.779
 it's a very tiny circulate are from a 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.750
 striking green color and as I said 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.850
 before they do not fall to get it to be 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.760
 leafy in winter after it 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.010
 the flowers fall, we can give you a 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.440
 cut-out worth we can put a 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.000
 little bit and so we make it stay dense 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.250
 and leafy the plant 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.520
 they have some fruits that come out in capsules 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.080
 but that is not very striking either 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.230
 The most striking thing about this plant are 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.560
 these beautiful flowers 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.130
 with this lovely rose 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.160
 in their natural habitat they are in zones of 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.110
 saw that are wet and with enough 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.330
 shadow then we should imitate their 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.790
 natural habitat as much as possible not 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.550
 put in the sun because then it will be a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.050
 disaster over all the summer sun if 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.510
 it's winter maybe you can hold it a little 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.370
 more but the summer not even the 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.470
 substrate that needs good the one that is 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.430
 more suitable for her is a substrate that 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.730
 it has been acidic and especially that it does not have 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.680
 lime the earth in the garden is often used 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.950
 putting like that a few because 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 there are also white colored the the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.670
 little flower or a denser pink and little more 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.590
 a plant very easy to care if you 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.180
 we set the ideal conditions to remember 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.070
 shade moisture and acidic earth any 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.619
 doubt you have suggestion or comment 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.710
 you can leave it down here or in my 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.390
 facebook page or via twitter 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.540
 thank you very much see you soon and until 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.540
 then
