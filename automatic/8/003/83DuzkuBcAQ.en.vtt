00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
sky so let's continue on with the right

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.060 
sky so let's continue on with the right
side<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:58.080> we're<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:58.800> going<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.100> down<00:03:01.070> when

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
side and we're just going to down when

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.670 
side and we're just going to down when
we<00:03:02.160> have<00:03:02.190> enough<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.970> brush<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:03.690> we're

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
we have enough on the brush and we're

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.510 
we have enough on the brush and we're
going<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:05.010> down

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.490 

now<00:03:12.060> when<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.390> comes<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.750> cream<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.080> powder<00:03:13.230> I

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
now when it comes to cream to powder I

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.960 
now when it comes to cream to powder I
tend<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.070> stay<00:03:14.400> away<00:03:14.430> too

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
tend to stay away too

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.400 
tend to stay away too
because<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.300> feel<00:03:15.690> like<00:03:15.720> they're<00:03:16.020> too<00:03:16.200> thick

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
because I feel like they're too thick

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.220 
because I feel like they're too thick
for<00:03:16.440> my<00:03:16.710> skin<00:03:17.130> but<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:17.970> one<00:03:18.210> to<00:03:18.720> my<00:03:18.840> surprise

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
for my skin but this one to my surprise

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.450 
for my skin but this one to my surprise
is<00:03:19.550> very<00:03:20.550> very<00:03:20.940> light<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.390> skin<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:23.280> I'll

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
is very very light on the skin and I'll

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.390 
is very very light on the skin and I'll
just<00:03:23.730> dab<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.680> find<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.280> get

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
just dab that and I find it that to get

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.430 
just dab that and I find it that to get
more<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.000> full<00:03:27.240> coverage<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.660> have<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.230> dab

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
more of a full coverage you have to dab

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.140 
more of a full coverage you have to dab
the<00:03:28.740> foundation<00:03:29.280> especially<00:03:29.790> if<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:30.000> a

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
the foundation especially if it's a

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.760 
the foundation especially if it's a
compact<00:03:30.690> form<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.010> let's<00:03:32.730> try<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:33.930> ugly

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
compact form and let's try this ugly

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.920 
compact form and let's try this ugly
pimple<00:03:35.160> on<00:03:35.280> top<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:35.730> see<00:03:35.910> if<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.120> covers<00:03:36.300> or<00:03:36.750> if

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
pimple on top to see if it covers or if

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.050 
pimple on top to see if it covers or if
it<00:03:37.020> does<00:03:37.170> any<00:03:37.470> good<00:03:39.470> voila<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.250> look<00:03:41.730> at<00:03:41.880> that

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
it does any good voila so look at that

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.000 
it does any good voila so look at that
you<00:03:42.360> guys<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.780> definitely<00:03:42.900> tell<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.980> is

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
you guys can definitely tell that it is

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.630 
you guys can definitely tell that it is
a<00:03:44.400> very<00:03:44.700> full<00:03:45.690> coverage<00:03:45.890> foundation<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:47.010> really

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
a very full coverage foundation I really

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.030 
a very full coverage foundation I really
like<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.330> have<00:03:49.200> difficulties<00:03:49.890> finding

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
like this I have difficulties finding

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.890 
like this I have difficulties finding
foundations<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.730> give<00:03:50.850> me<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> nice<00:03:51.450> coverage

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
foundations that give me a nice coverage

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.620 
foundations that give me a nice coverage
that's<00:03:52.170> light<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.580> medium<00:03:53.760> feeling<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:54.570> if

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
that's light to medium feeling so if

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.840 
that's light to medium feeling so if
this<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:54.930> very<00:03:55.200> lightly<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.010> skin<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.670> it

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
this is very lightly on the skin and it

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.320 
this is very lightly on the skin and it
gives<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.270> very<00:03:58.020> nice<00:03:58.380> coverage<00:04:02.150> just<00:04:03.150> bring

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
gives you very nice coverage just bring

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.460 
gives you very nice coverage just bring
it<00:04:03.420> down<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.780> neck

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.100 

so<00:04:07.450> this<00:04:08.450> is<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.930> first<00:04:09.200> layer<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:10.810> if<00:04:11.810> I<00:04:11.930> go

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
so this is the first layer and if I go

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.150 
so this is the first layer and if I go
up<00:04:12.230> close

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.220 

I'm<00:04:16.160> up<00:04:16.340> close<00:04:16.670> you<00:04:17.000> can<00:04:17.030> see<00:04:17.480> that<00:04:17.930> there's

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
I'm up close you can see that there's

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.650 
I'm up close you can see that there's
still<00:04:18.590> some<00:04:19.430> scarring<00:04:19.850> seeping<00:04:20.269> through<00:04:20.299> but

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660

trip<00:05:18.530> to<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:18.860> store<00:05:19.160> so<00:05:19.220> I<00:05:19.730> actually<00:05:20.150> picked

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
trip to the store so I actually picked

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.270 
trip to the store so I actually picked
up<00:05:20.600> the<00:05:20.780> shade<00:05:21.020> lighter<00:05:21.320> than<00:05:21.440> this<00:05:21.770> which<00:05:22.010> is

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
up the shade lighter than this which is

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.270 
up the shade lighter than this which is
a<00:05:22.580> line<00:05:23.060> buff<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:23.750> they<00:05:24.320> did<00:05:24.530> claim<00:05:24.710> to<00:05:25.040> have

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
a line buff and they did claim to have

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.210 
a line buff and they did claim to have
nine<00:05:26.240> shades<00:05:26.630> but<00:05:26.960> I<00:05:27.140> only<00:05:27.380> saw<00:05:27.620> four<00:05:27.919> shades

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
nine shades but I only saw four shades

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.700 
nine shades but I only saw four shades
