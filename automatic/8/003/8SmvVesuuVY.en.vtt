00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
and the reason why is because

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.990 
and the reason why is because
I<00:04:05.020> didn't<00:04:06.020> like<00:04:06.740> I<00:04:06.890> like<00:04:07.130> that<00:04:07.340> ending<00:04:07.670> it<00:04:07.910> was

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.460 
I didn't like I like that ending it was
a<00:04:08.060> good<00:04:08.210> ending<00:04:08.390> but<00:04:08.840> it<00:04:08.990> wasn't<00:04:09.290> what<00:04:09.440> I

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
a good ending but it wasn't what I

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.890 
a good ending but it wasn't what I
wanted<00:04:09.830> like<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.550> wanted<00:04:10.820> more<00:04:11.090> I<00:04:11.450> didn't<00:04:11.780> want

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
wanted like I wanted more I didn't want

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.610 
wanted like I wanted more I didn't want
it<00:04:11.990> to<00:04:12.050> end<00:04:12.170> where<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.250> didn't<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:14.020> so<00:04:17.620> like

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
it to end where it didn't and so like

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.699 
it to end where it didn't and so like
I'm<00:04:19.070> just<00:04:19.100> really<00:04:19.489> big<00:04:19.760> on<00:04:19.910> endings<00:04:20.360> like<00:04:20.720> if<00:04:21.470> I

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
I'm just really big on endings like if I

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.920 
I'm just really big on endings like if I
don't<00:04:21.890> like<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.280> ending<00:04:22.610> then<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:23.300> usually

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
don't end up like in the book because I

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.630 
don't end up like in the book because I
mean<00:04:26.420> a<00:04:26.690> great<00:04:27.140> story<00:04:27.470> but<00:04:27.830> then<00:04:28.010> like<00:04:28.220> if<00:04:28.430> you

try<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.620> just<00:04:30.620> cut<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.370> ending<00:04:31.790> to<00:04:32.090> finish<00:04:32.990> a

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
try to just cut the ending to finish a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.720 
try to just cut the ending to finish a
book<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.680> know<00:04:33.770> just<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.190> try<00:04:34.400> to<00:04:34.430> quickly

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
book you know just to try to quickly

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.650

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.420 
finish the book
then<00:04:36.200> I<00:04:36.970> usually<00:04:37.970> don't<00:04:39.070> really<00:04:40.070> have<00:04:40.280> that

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
then I usually don't really have that

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.370 
then I usually don't really have that
much<00:04:40.610> respect<00:04:41.060> for<00:04:41.300> it<00:04:41.420> anymore<00:04:44.050> but<00:04:45.050> I<00:04:45.110> mean

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
much respect for it anymore but I mean

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.750 
much respect for it anymore but I mean
it<00:04:45.560> wasn't<00:04:45.890> good<00:04:45.980> endings<00:04:46.340> but<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.610> just

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
it wasn't good endings but it just

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.160 
it wasn't good endings but it just
wasn't<00:04:46.970> what<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.240> wanted<00:04:48.040> so<00:04:49.040> I<00:04:50.170> definitely

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
wasn't what I wanted so I definitely

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.110 
wasn't what I wanted so I definitely
definitely<00:04:52.040> think<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:52.760> you<00:04:52.880> guys<00:04:53.060> should

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
definitely think that you guys should

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.340 
definitely think that you guys should
check<00:04:53.390> this<00:04:53.540> book<00:04:53.720> out<00:04:53.840> if<00:04:54.050> you<00:04:54.170> haven't

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
already because I probably would have

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.770 
already because I probably would have
never<00:04:56.570> checked<00:04:56.780> out<00:04:56.960> this<00:04:57.140> book<00:04:57.380> if<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:58.780> didn't
