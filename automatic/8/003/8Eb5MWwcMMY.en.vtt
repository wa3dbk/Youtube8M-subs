00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Let's get 19 and 3/18 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.400
 with 18 and 2/3. 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.742
 I want to divide the targets from the fragments. 

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:14.065
 19 and 3/18 is the same as 19 plus 3/18. 

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:18.465
 And we will add 18 and 2/3, 

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:23.346
 which is the same as 18 plus 2/3. 

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:26.970
 And now we can assemble the whole parts, 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.060
 that is, we can assemble 19 and 18 

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:35.561
 And then we can collect the fragments - 

00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:38.298
 plus - let me do it green - 

00:00:38.298 --> 00:00:45.618
 plus 3/18, plus 2/3. 

00:00:45.618 --> 00:00:50.299
 Now, 19 plus 18 is easy. How is this? 

00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:52.284
 19 plus 19 will be 38, so 

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.386
 will be one less than that - 

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:57.086
 will be 37. 

00:00:57.093 --> 00:00:59.401
 And then 3/18 plus 2/3 - 

00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:01.536
 to get them together I have to have the same denominator. 

00:01:01.536 --> 00:01:05.086
 And the smallest total of 18 and 3 is 18. 

00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:09.238
 Let us present 2/3 as something on 18. 

00:01:09.238 --> 00:01:13.899
 2/3 if I want to write it as something on 18 - 

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:16.527
 I have multiplied the denominator by 6, 

00:01:16.527 --> 00:01:19.096
 so I'll have to multiply the numerator by 6. 

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:23.092
 So 2/3 will be the same as 12/18. 

00:01:23.092 --> 00:01:27.067
 I can turn 2/3 into 12/18. 

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:29.241
 And now I can put together these two things. 

00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:32.521
 Will be equal to - I have 37 plus - 

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:37.535
 plus something on 18. 

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:42.286
 3 plus 12 is 15 - plus 15/18. 

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:44.827
 If we present this as a mixed number, 

00:01:44.827 --> 00:01:48.727
 we get 37 and 15/18. 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.587
 This is the right number, but we can simplify it. 

00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:54.429
 We can simplify 15/18 - 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.279
 and the numerator and the denominator are divided into 3. 

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.466
 So let's divide them at 3. 

00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:02.772
 We do not change the value because we do 

00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:04.982
 the same thing with the numerator and the denominator. 

00:02:04.982 --> 00:02:09.853
 That gives us - we still have our 37, 

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:14.306
 but the numerator is now 5 and the denominator is 6. 

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:18.685
 So, we get 37 and 5/6.
