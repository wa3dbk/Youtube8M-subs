00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:10.600
 john goodman 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.160
 there is a strange but like from the card smith 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.160
 on the new zidane 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.790
 Saturday tommy robe is here 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.400
 precisely to go analyze this 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.019
 new uprising dlc to be released on the 16th 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.160
 April on xbox 360 and May 16 on ps3 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.810
 and pc 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.170
 at the beginning of the video you saw precisely 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.489
 a part of the trailer of this dlc 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.349
 subtitles with Italian subtitles 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.540
 I made them I realized after that 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.340
 on the official call of duty channel was 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.620
 released a video already subtitled mi 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.709
 sorry so i decided to leave them 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.410
 then this new dlc will understand how 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.620
 always four magma multiplayer maps 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.560
 in corner tigo and studio is a new one 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.540
 zombie mode movie of the third ci 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.250
 this time they will be weapons or things 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.769
 special in these 10 then I in the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.660
 trailer I decided to show you how 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.129
 multiplayer maps only studio a 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.500
 fund because I considered it very much 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.069
 interesting this map studies precisely 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.620
 as you will have understood a remake 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.989
 contemporary adapted then all 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.420
 era of black ops beautiful appafre 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.810
 ring range of black ops 1 so this 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:41.239
 remake will be set in hollywood with 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:44.000
 of the film sets of 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.790
 hollywood from the old west all 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.889
 to the aliens sum will be a map that 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.389
 It will keep the same style of fi ring 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:53.269
 range is just that it will be a bit adapted 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.130
 as it was already mine with 2,025 for 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.859
 as regards the far more 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.870
 interesting zombie mode we do n't have 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.299
 still our old characters but 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.450
 we have four new characters that 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.669
 are four gangsters of the time who 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.810
 they are practically from the time of 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:14.299
 prohibitionism then these four 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:19.250
 characters are just gangsters 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:21.220
 from the period around 1920 early 1930 in which 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.539
 this prohibition was very widespread 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.330
 you have seen the names of the characters 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.940
 during the trailer and that were 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.630
 precisely imprisoned in Alcatraz while 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.160
 they try while they are in Alcatraz 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.950
 comes to a zombie invasion so from the 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.110
 nothing 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.260
 they must then try to escape 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.720
 will have to make their way through the bars between 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.180
 in short, the island between the walls is to try to 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.670
 defeat all the SMA predictions zones 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.470
 interesting how a new one 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.200
 dynamic that was introduced with 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.670
 this map or the characters when 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.530
 will be killed will not come 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:02.030
 they will disappear but will be brought into one 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.560
 species of another area called purgatory 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.350
 still let's say we don't know how 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.260
 this thing works but it's a new one 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.970
 dynamics that could also be a lot 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.730
 interesting this purgatory than one 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.620
 once dead you can continue to 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.230
 play somewhere else then maybe not 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.270
 we know how it will work we'll find out 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.670
 at the exit more precisely but already 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.010
 this could be really a lot 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.220
 interesting as regards instead 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.030
 the easter eggs in quotation marks present 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.670
 in this video 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.220
 I found let's say a frame 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.440
 you can look good on this part 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.690
 of video these few frames e 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.230
 slow down beware of it seems there is 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.730
 almost a head of a dog coming out of the 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.350
 fire now you can not understand well 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.720
 if he has legs because he is 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.910
 impossible because it would be too high 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.950
 so probably that point an area 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.960
 passing between purgatory could 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.270
 be that one of his people died there 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.640
 comrades and this indicates that yes 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.560
 find purgatory at the moment because yes 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.650
 look at you there is this dog head that 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.990
 seems to come out seems to be wrapped 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.750
 in short, it does not look like a dog from the flames 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.100
 normal because too high you don't know 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.530
 still good what another image is 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.530
 instead it was originally found 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.090
 da magna is located approximately is located 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.560
 video fragments before 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.530
 Robert's explanation from and is this 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.110
 frame here a frame this 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.420
 image does not know precisely what it is 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.070
 but you can see the clamp probably 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.210
 we'll find out maybe we'll find out something 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.690
 more when it comes out 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.680
 the map then this is a lot 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.700
 interesting for this mob of the dead 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.830
 even if we see the old ones again 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.930
 we see new characters and 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.160
 it could still be really one 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.880
 beautiful thing 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.760
 this new style of play that has been 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.920
 also introduced these maps 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.470
 for they also seem to deserve enough 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.850
 so congratulations to brera trier that i 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.620
 dlc unless it is good it goes well, pity for 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:02.180
 the xbox that receives as always everything 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.700
 first but we still on pc and also 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.840
 those on ps3 will wait 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:10.520
 quietly and we'll see a little 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.590
 severely indeed we will see players 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.000
 xbox what this dlc will look like thanks to 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.530
 youtube who will not want to ruin the 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.940
 surprise you simply won't look 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.220
 video because maybe even I will put gods 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.180
 videos about the new right dlc 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.400
 immediately at day one 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.580
 let's see now a little as if I can 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.900
 combine with someone's xbox thanks to 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.640
 all those for looking at this 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.890
 video if you liked left a nice one 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.110
 I like to comment below with the 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.550

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.920
