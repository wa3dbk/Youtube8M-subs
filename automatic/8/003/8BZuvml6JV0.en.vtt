00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.720
 hi to all these simple pools 52 of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.040
 square hands and we find ourselves for 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.309
 arte tutorial our first tutorial on how 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.020
 although she does it again this time 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.699
 I'm alone I will not be everything 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.070
 alone often and this time it's all 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.710
 alone and i 'm going to show you five 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.279
 techniques to hide your chest 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.050
 so we will start right away with 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.750
 the first technique that is for the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.920
 kitchens the kitchens that are in 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.930
 corners as is known for example and must 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.570
 to have a corner crisis like this with 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.820
 a tap like that and if you have a 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.420
 cooking like that you can hide 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 your chest 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.449
 I am the master here that's what 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.100
 someone he's going to see your kitchen he's going 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.520
 not have the reflex to look into the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.579
 tap so will not see it's a 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.019
 body here for the first tip she 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.860
 is quite simple the others are they 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.090
 are even better than done then for 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.060
 the second trick she's pretty well known 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:19.890
 this is the one we go into the thing 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.150
 in the panel a year palvadeau the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.150
 poster let's say because I have 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:30.210
 totally forgotten no and then here it is 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:35.720
 there is a chest that's very simple 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:41.760
 do it like that 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:45.360
 that's how it is and then we can 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.230
 to return after enough to do a little 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.230
 trap it's still me 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.400
 And now, voila 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.310
 on the other hand, do not end up getting 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:05.880
 angers you understood when I say that 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.950
 but I finish but here and there 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.170
 you want that suspended very low you 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.080
 close and there we can get in and we 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.600
 can even little more open it 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.560
 here it is so that was the second 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.610
 hints then the third I like 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.890
 particularly 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.620
 all this you can do anywhere 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.360
 that's why she's good 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.870
 is that just coffee in 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.660
 the wash 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.810
 what no one rattles idea if you 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.470
 are on xbox of iron Ltd. in 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.720
 anase so no one can know who 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.810
 is a chest in there 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:52.550
 So here it is super simple enough to 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:55.070
 do two and you're done 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:01.830
 So here it was at third tips 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:04.650
 then the fourth the fourth which 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.209
 is for a trick or trick that can 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.660
 look like a tour without whip a 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.760
 people to do anywhere just 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.950
 break to block 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.380
 the ja you see a little bug 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.830
 of display and have done lt on it and ya 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.360
 a safe offers crap I did not do anything 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.690
 too weak 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.170
 so here to do it in fact it's 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:38.670
 simple it cons cons it takes a car 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:41.820
 with lacoste on then we do that we 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:58.620
 do not need to do that we do like 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:04:04.709
 this hop and eva law that's all and there there 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:06.000
 will and the break here I am very good 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.570
 to aim as you can 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.209
 find out and then here is your little trick 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.660
 you have a coffee chest that was for 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.750
 the 4th tricks and for the last trick 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.299
 did not know what I appreciate 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.669
 especially because nobody 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.050
 will not have the idea to do that she has 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:34.139
 done in a way so very good coffee 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:36.150
 is simply not good 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:42.330
 that's because I know very well 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:44.999
 targeted there is a little black band 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.610
 if you have seen and here I am going 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:51.620
 show how we do it so it's very 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.620
 simple make a small staircase like that 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:05:03.029
 then you put a chest here and 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.569
 you dread you do like that as 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:08.210
 this and going to be the little black band 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.949
 and you can open it 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.990
 so that's how you can break 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.770
 diamonds without people little 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:21.270
 do you come the shutter and all that's it 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:24.960
