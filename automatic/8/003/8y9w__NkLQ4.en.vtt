00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.179 
and then there is a chance at the end
this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.229> guaranteed<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
this is not guaranteed it's not one of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.800 
this is not guaranteed it's not one of
those<00:01:17.340> defeat<00:01:18.000> him<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.240> definitely<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
those defeat him you definitely get it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.570 
those defeat him you definitely get it
it<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.080> still<00:01:19.290> random<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.070> any<00:01:20.250> drop<00:01:20.460> in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580

know<00:03:01.530> tweak<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.920> again<00:03:02.130> because<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:03.030> nerf<00:03:03.210> was

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
know tweak it again because the nerf was

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.850 
know tweak it again because the nerf was
quite<00:03:03.690> drastic<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.230> also<00:03:04.350> affects<00:03:04.680> its

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
quite drastic and it's also affects its

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.380 
quite drastic and it's also affects its
performance<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.340> PvE<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.880> people<00:03:06.210> are<00:03:06.300> sort

you<00:03:09.780> know<00:03:09.870> as<00:03:09.960> a<00:03:09.990> result<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.380> banjee<00:03:10.830> kind

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
you know as a result of that banjee kind

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.260 
you know as a result of that banjee kind
of<00:03:11.070> probably<00:03:11.400> will<00:03:11.610> rebalance<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.120> because

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
of probably will rebalance it because

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.850 
of probably will rebalance it because
they<00:03:12.330> want<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.570> sort<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.080> know<00:03:13.200> viable<00:03:13.770> in

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
they want to sort be you know viable in

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.440 
they want to sort be you know viable in
that<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.160> also<00:03:14.280> still<00:03:14.520> usable<00:03:14.880> in<00:03:14.940> PvP<00:03:15.300> was

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
that and also still usable in PvP was

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.180 
that and also still usable in PvP was
just<00:03:15.630> not<00:03:15.720> overpowered<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:16.680> do<00:03:16.830> expect<00:03:17.130> this

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
just not overpowered so do expect this

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.290 
just not overpowered so do expect this
to<00:03:17.280> change<00:03:17.490> again<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.820> future<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.180> for

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
to change again in the future but for
