00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
critical thinking skills and I think the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.070

hallmark again of truly inquiry based

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.630 
hallmark again of truly inquiry based
learning<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.890> they're<00:01:42.010> coming<00:01:42.310> home<00:01:42.460> and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
learning is that they're coming home and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.030 
learning is that they're coming home and
asking<00:01:42.940> really<00:01:43.330> great<00:01:43.630> questions<00:01:44.230> it's<00:01:44.920> not

asking really great questions it's not

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.380

about<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.400> dates<00:01:45.610> it's<00:01:45.940> not<00:01:46.060> about<00:01:46.240> the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
about the dates it's not about the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:47.850 
about the dates it's not about the
content<00:01:46.660> as<00:01:47.050> much<00:01:47.260> as<00:01:47.440> it's<00:01:47.620> their
