concept<00:01:07.740> which<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.040> actually<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.490> pretty<00:01:09.060> good

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
concept which is actually a pretty good

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.630 
concept which is actually a pretty good
damn<00:01:09.510> idea<00:01:09.869> i<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.080> love<00:01:10.650> randomized<00:01:11.189> maps<00:01:11.460> I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
damn idea i do love randomized maps I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
damn idea i do love randomized maps I
love<00:01:11.850> randomized<00:01:12.600> areas<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.200> honestly

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
love randomized areas and honestly

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.130 
love randomized areas and honestly
speaking<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.010> has<00:01:14.430> no<00:01:14.760> replay<00:01:15.180> ability<00:01:15.299> to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
speaking it has no replay ability to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.840 
speaking it has no replay ability to
grow<00:01:16.320> bigger<00:01:16.590> numbers<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:16.950> score<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> whole

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
grow bigger numbers all score as a whole

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.469 
grow bigger numbers all score as a whole
and<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.310> really<00:01:20.820> good<00:01:20.939> idea<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.299> fact

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and this is a really good idea in fact

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.060 
and this is a really good idea in fact
they<00:01:22.110> could<00:01:22.259> maybe<00:01:22.380> even<00:01:22.650> take<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> step

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
they could maybe even take it a step

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
they could maybe even take it a step
further<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.640> your<00:01:23.909> future<00:01:24.689> expansion<00:01:25.259> packs

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
further in your future expansion packs

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.830 
further in your future expansion packs
and<00:01:25.680> allowed<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> entire<00:01:27.119> planet<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.750> be

and allowed for the entire planet to be
randomized<00:01:28.259> which<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.650> actually<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.310> pretty

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
randomized which you actually be pretty

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.690 
randomized which you actually be pretty
good<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.060> would<00:01:30.420> love<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.869> quite<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.700> so

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
good I would love that quite a bit so

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
good I would love that quite a bit so
anyway<00:01:32.970> another<00:01:33.720> our<00:01:33.900> new<00:01:34.079> feature<00:01:34.290> that

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
anyway another our new feature that

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.539 
anyway another our new feature that
they're<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.860> add<00:01:35.040> into<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.369> game

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
they're going to add into this game

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.340 
they're going to add into this game
would<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.700> more<00:01:36.210> Native<00:01:36.630> American<00:01:36.990> factions

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
would be more Native American factions

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
would be more Native American factions
this<00:01:37.619> was<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> big<00:01:38.070> problem<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.729> long<00:01:38.880> time

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
this was a big problem for a long time

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.030 
this was a big problem for a long time
in<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.360> big<00:01:39.570> universe<00:01:39.869> else<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.770> Native

in your big universe else for the Native
American<00:01:41.369> factions<00:01:41.729> we're<00:01:42.420> very<00:01:42.450> little<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
