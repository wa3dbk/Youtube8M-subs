00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.540
 yes 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello everyone how about in this video os 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.000
 I'm going to teach a facial 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.490
 intensive moisturizer we can do 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.189
 at home naturally you will see that 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.520
 It is very effective if you have dry skin or 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:24.130
 sensitive skin if you have been irritated 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.779
 by the cold or by the heat too 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.570
 really like I'm done many times 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.180
 the skin we can have it dry 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.010
 let's say serious to say it so or can 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.739
 be that by circumstances because of the cold 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.510
 by the sun for some product even 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.550
 that we have put on a tonic a 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.770
 little strong we dried up what 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.840
 let's say temporarily then we can 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.540
 do this facial at home 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.360
 intensive moisturizer that will help us 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.070
 much to recover that hydration in the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.750
 skin you will see that it is very simple 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.480
 but it is very effective 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.260
 We are going to need a small wipe 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.360
 of these faces are from ikea and 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.890
 a moisturizer in which you want 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.390
 which you use that you do well 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.460
 first thing we're going to do is take the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.370
 wipe and moisten the under the tap 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.860
 we wet it well and cover it 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.680
 and we place it like that on a little plate 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.810
 and we're going to put it in the microwave during 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.220
 two minutes a minute and a half depends 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.470
 also a little bit of the power of 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.600
 your microwave until you touch it and 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.820
 come out very warm if you do not have 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.190
 microwave you can just put one 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.960
 cook with water and when it starts 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.940
 to boil you put the wipe the part 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.070
 from the fire and leave it like that for a while 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.960
 when I can choose her to burn us 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.240
 and draw it out if it's more or less 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.580
 the effect is the same the case is that what 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.550
 what we are going to get is a wet towel 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.410
 and hot what we're going to do is have 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.320
 the face as I have it and right now 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.180
 already washed clean well with nothing else 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.700
 no more product than the face well 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.830
 clean with soap with cleansing milk 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.170
 that you use and we are going to take the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.600
 Wipe as I tell you that it is wet and 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.490
 hot and we will place it on top of the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.070
 face and we'll leave it for 10 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.440
 minutes during those 10 minutes as 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.450
 I always tell you we just have to 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.570
 throw us out and relax without moving the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.430
 face without getting to speak anything we 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.030
 we lay on the bed on the couch wherever 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.230
 and we put on the towel 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.230
 for 10 minutes 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.510
 we let it act and what we are going to 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.569
 get during those 10 minutes is that 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.090
 the hot moistened towel we 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.130
 go opening the pores after 10 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.470
 minutes the towel cooled sag the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.110
 we remove and take a moisturizer 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.210
 whatever we use and we the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.260
 we apply 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:49.080
 we apply it as usual it is not 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.940
 You need to apply a lot of amount because 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.420
 many times we believe that 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.400
 apply more quantity is going to be more more 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.170
 effective then the skin does not come 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.150
 let's say we no longer absorb more 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.250
 in fact look at this is one thing that I 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.700
 you have asked sometimes what do you say to me and 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.700
 I applied the cream and when I put the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.950
 come out as pellets let's say good 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.680
 this is because the skin does not absorb anymore 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.970
 cream and then also because the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.160
 skin is not very clean then no 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.130
 absorb well cream and then we arrive 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.140
 he spits it on us then nothing simply 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.240
 we apply it also by the neck 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.280
 you can apply if you want because in addition 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.500
 the towel according to how big it is 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.390
 we can do this same treatment in 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.270
 face and neck 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.580
 we apply it and well once applied to 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.190
 the cream we do again the same 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.980
 operation with the wipe again the 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.050
 We wet the drain, we put it in 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.450
 microwave for one minute two minutes 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.950
 and as it goes warm care of not 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.130
 burn them of course has to be 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.900
 We lose the warm and with the 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.610
 applied cream we put it back 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.610
 over like this 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.500
 and we stay put again 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.440
 resting for another 10 minutes is 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.280
 say still prepared clean face 10 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.650
 minutes 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.099
 we remove moisturizer again the 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.489
 face towel over moisturizer 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.540
 another 10 minutes and that's how we make that 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.970
 product the moisturizer that we 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.100
 we have thrown open the choirs so that 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.079
 the skin takes it much more and then with the 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.480
 heat let's help it penetrate a lot 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.510
 more and this is a way let's say to make 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.669
 an intensive moisturizing treatment in 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.370
 home so naturally nothing 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.410
 more this was the trick the care that 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.490
 I wanted to teach you I hope you try it 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.110
 because I'm sure it's going to 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.030
 love and see you in the next 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.240
 video a little kiss 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.240
 bye
