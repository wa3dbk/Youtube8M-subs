we<00:06:33.469> got<00:06:33.649> it<00:06:33.769> together<00:06:33.919> again<00:06:34.369> yeah<00:06:34.879> we<00:06:35.059> had<00:06:35.179> a

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:35.209 
we got it together again yeah we had a

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:37.299 
we got it together again yeah we had a
fixed<00:06:35.689> struggle<00:06:36.049> getting<00:06:36.199> the<00:06:36.499> exhaust<00:06:36.979> pipes

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:37.309 
fixed struggle getting the exhaust pipes

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:41.559 
fixed struggle getting the exhaust pipes
on<00:06:38.289> but<00:06:39.639> everything<00:06:40.639> else<00:06:40.909> use<00:06:41.149> silicon

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:41.569 
on but everything else use silicon

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.100 
on but everything else use silicon
sealant<00:06:41.779> instead<00:06:42.439> of<00:06:42.469> gaskets<00:06:43.149> mm<00:06:44.149> did<00:06:44.839> it<00:06:44.959> all

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
sealant instead of gaskets mm did it all

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.479 
sealant instead of gaskets mm did it all
that<00:06:45.349> because<00:06:45.529> usually<00:06:45.649> have<00:06:45.860> the<00:06:46.009> gaskets

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:46.489 
that because usually have the gaskets

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.689 
that because usually have the gaskets
and<00:06:46.639> we<00:06:46.699> broke<00:06:46.909> a<00:06:47.119> lot<00:06:47.239> of<00:06:47.299> the<00:06:47.419> gaskets<00:06:47.929> too

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:48.699 
and we broke a lot of the gaskets too

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.279 
and we broke a lot of the gaskets too
but<00:06:49.699> yeah<00:06:49.909> bad<00:06:50.209> for<00:06:50.479> people<00:06:50.689> put<00:06:50.959> in<00:06:51.049> saying
