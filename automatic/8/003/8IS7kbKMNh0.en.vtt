00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.700
 top of this site 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:19.260
 we're going to insert a logo we'll go to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.940
 create various pages within which 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.590
 will be recalled from our menu 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.430

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.940
 text in one of the present pages 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.740

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.130

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.860
 sport safety 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.420
 let us remember that safety in the 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.770
 snowboarding is very important 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.220
 but let's go back to our talk 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:17.320
 site then finally we'll go to see how 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:20.440
 insert information in the footer 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.540
 about the site or who created it in 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.660
 so I created it myself 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.910

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.100

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.310
 eye-catching background on our site 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.950
