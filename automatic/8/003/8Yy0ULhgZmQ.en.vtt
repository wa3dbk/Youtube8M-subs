doing<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.660> because<00:00:24.810> there<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> risk<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
doing it because there is a risk of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.200 
doing it because there is a risk of
getting<00:00:25.859> banned<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.789> really

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
recommend to do it just just keep away

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.589 
recommend to do it just just keep away
from<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:29.609> if<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.970> want<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.179> do<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.449> then

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
from it but if you do want to do it then

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.479 
from it but if you do want to do it then

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
description below and go get the dns

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.299 
description below and go get the dns
codes<00:00:34.170> yourself<00:00:34.649> i'm<00:00:34.770> not<00:00:34.920> going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> leave<00:00:35.160> it

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
in the description and i think because

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.420 
in the description and i think because
