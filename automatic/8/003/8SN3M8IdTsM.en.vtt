anything but when it's on it kind of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.979 
anything but when it's on it kind of
makes<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:47.100> almost<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:47.730> light<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.450> being

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
makes it's almost as if light is being

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
makes it's almost as if light is being
shined<00:00:49.410> through<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.520> white<00:00:50.820> bezel<00:00:51.360> it's

shined through the white bezel it's
definitely<00:00:51.719> noticeable<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:53.070> doesn't

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
definitely noticeable and it doesn't

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
definitely noticeable and it doesn't
happen<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.570> regular<00:00:55.699> s6<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
happen on the regular s6 here at all so

should do but on the s6 edge it kind of

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.500 
should do but on the s6 edge it kind of
illuminates<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.880> rest<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> bezel

set so in this case kind of a greenish
bluish<00:01:32.460> tint<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.810> turning<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> brightness

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
bluish tint so turning the brightness

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.429 
bluish tint so turning the brightness
down<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.540> bezel<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.200> not

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
illuminated anymore so this is what it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.289 
illuminated anymore so this is what it
should<00:01:40.920> look<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.189> when<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> brightness<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
should look like when the brightness is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.969 
should look like when the brightness is
set<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> full<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.200> turning<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.680> back<00:01:43.829> up

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979

and<00:01:55.770> bottom<00:01:56.270> bezels<00:01:57.270> there<00:01:57.479> I'd<00:01:57.719> be

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
and bottom bezels there I'd be

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.350 
and bottom bezels there I'd be
interested<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.680> any<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> other

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
colors of the s6 edge do this as well so

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.399 
colors of the s6 edge do this as well so
if<00:02:02.909> you've<00:02:03.060> got<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.390> black<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:04.020> or<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> blue

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
if you've got the black one or the blue

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.620 
if you've got the black one or the blue
or<00:02:04.649> green<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:05.189> if<00:02:05.549> they<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.119> same<00:02:06.149> thing

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
or green one if they do the same thing

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.350 
or green one if they do the same thing
so<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.290> bring<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.829> regular<00:02:08.310> s6<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so if you bring in the regular s6 you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.150 
so if you bring in the regular s6 you
can<00:02:09.539> see<00:02:09.720> brightness<00:02:10.170> set<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.440> fall<00:02:10.709> it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
can see brightness set to fall it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.220 
can see brightness set to fall it
doesn't<00:02:11.640> illuminate<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.450> side<00:02:12.690> bezels<00:02:13.260> what

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
doesn't illuminate the side bezels what

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.369 
doesn't illuminate the side bezels what
so<00:02:14.560> we're<00:02:14.830> both<00:02:15.010> knock<00:02:15.489> them<00:02:15.610> down<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.970> zero

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
so we're both knock them down to zero

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.320 
so we're both knock them down to zero
completely<00:02:17.379> dark<00:02:17.620> as<00:02:17.860> you'd<00:02:18.069> expect<00:02:18.549> and<00:02:18.790> then

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.630 
completely dark as you'd expect and then
bring<00:02:19.659> them<00:02:19.810> back<00:02:19.959> up<00:02:20.170> again<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:21.010> 100%

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
bring them back up again to 100%

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.930 
bring them back up again to 100%
brightness<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:23.379> can<00:02:23.560> see<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:24.340> s6<00:02:24.760> edge

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940

here<00:03:00.250> I'm<00:03:00.609> of<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.120> thinking<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.720> doesn't

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
here I'm of the thinking it doesn't

here I'm of the thinking it doesn't
happen<00:03:02.230> on<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.530> regular<00:03:02.859> variant<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.579> why

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
happen on the regular variant so why

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.520 
happen on the regular variant so why
should<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.090> happen<00:03:04.269> on<00:03:04.599> the<00:03:04.720> edge<00:03:04.930> variant

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
should it happen on the edge variant

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.520 
should it happen on the edge variant
obviously<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.370> curved<00:03:06.700> edge<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.599> having

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
obviously that curved edge is a having

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.610 
obviously that curved edge is a having
some<00:03:08.769> effect<00:03:09.459> on<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:10.569> bezel<00:03:11.260> being

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
some effect on this bezel being

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.369
