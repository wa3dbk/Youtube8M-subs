 Such traces are gathered when a Formula One motorist collects 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.420
 But think about what's happening in day-to-day tournaments 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.800
 They go one or two laps back to the boxing street disappearing from a few pillars for a few ... moments, then 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.660
