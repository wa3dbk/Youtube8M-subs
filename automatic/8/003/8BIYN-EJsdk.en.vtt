00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
battlefield force the first thing we

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.689 
battlefield force the first thing we
need<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:57.989> cover<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.559> fact<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.129> reconning

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
need to cover is the fact that reconning

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.040 
need to cover is the fact that reconning
is<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.850> little<00:01:00.059> bit<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.300> important<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.899> role

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
is a little bit more important of a role

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.080 
is a little bit more important of a role
now<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.410> battlefield<00:01:01.890> 4<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.309> above<00:01:02.820> all

sniping<00:01:03.660> has<00:01:03.750> become<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:04.619> bit<00:01:04.769> easier

the<00:01:05.909> reason<00:01:06.180> for<00:01:06.330> being<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> movements<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the reason for being is the movements a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.600 
the reason for being is the movements a
little<00:01:07.320> bit<00:01:07.530> easier<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> aiming<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.280> sights

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610

that and nobody can argue it that using

that and nobody can argue it that using
a<00:01:37.890> mouse<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.329> gives<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.720> unique

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
a mouse it just gives you this unique

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.899 
a mouse it just gives you this unique
precision<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.829> cannot<00:01:41.100> acquire<00:01:41.520> with

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
precision that you cannot acquire with

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.780 
precision that you cannot acquire with
console<00:01:42.649> controllers<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.460> can't<00:01:44.670> happen

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
console controllers it just can't happen

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.850 
console controllers it just can't happen
it's<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.930> sounds<00:01:46.229> weird<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.590> I'm<00:01:46.770> not

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
it's I know it sounds weird but I'm not

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.960 
it's I know it sounds weird but I'm not
dishing<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.399> I'm<00:01:47.520> not<00:01:47.640> saying<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.939> can't

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
dishing and I'm not saying you can't

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.569 
dishing and I'm not saying you can't
snipe<00:01:48.479> on<00:01:48.689> console<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:50.100> saying<00:01:50.310> it's

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
snipe on console I'm just saying it's

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.300 
snipe on console I'm just saying it's
hard<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> mean<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.649> case<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.070> somebody

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
hard so I mean in that case if somebody

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.130 
hard so I mean in that case if somebody
just<00:01:53.490> demolishes<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.450> console<00:01:54.840> okay<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.079> do

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
just demolishes on console okay and do

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.050 
just demolishes on console okay and do
what<00:01:55.290> PC<00:01:55.710> players<00:01:55.950> do<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.759> means<00:01:56.909> that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
what PC players do that just means that

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.330 
what PC players do that just means that
person<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> more<00:01:57.810> skilled<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.829> I'm<00:01:58.920> not<00:01:59.040> saying

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
person is more skilled so I'm not saying

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.530 
person is more skilled so I'm not saying
anything<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.850> that<00:01:59.909> I'm<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.299> saying<00:02:00.420> it's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
anything like that I'm just saying it's

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.380 
anything like that I'm just saying it's
harder<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.860> long<00:02:02.579> range<00:02:02.850> sniping<00:02:03.240> is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
harder to do so long range sniping is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.969 
harder to do so long range sniping is
kind<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.780> pain<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.110> ass<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.530> one<00:02:04.740> reason

inside<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.000> little<00:03:06.150> pole<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:06.900> these<00:03:07.050> are

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
inside the little pole but these are

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.390 
inside the little pole but these are
smaller<00:03:07.470> now<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.860> don't<00:03:07.920> know<00:03:08.100> if<00:03:08.220> they<00:03:08.340> did

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
smaller now and I don't know if they did

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.370 
smaller now and I don't know if they did
that<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.670> adapt<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.209> smaller<00:03:09.480> children<00:03:09.750> hands

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
that to adapt to smaller children hands

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.090 
that to adapt to smaller children hands

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
or girl gamers or or whatever it was but

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.830 
or girl gamers or or whatever it was but
I<00:03:14.370> think<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.670> idea<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:15.000> making<00:03:15.150> smaller<00:03:15.570> thumb

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
I think the idea of making smaller thumb

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.840 
I think the idea of making smaller thumb
sticks<00:03:16.110> with<00:03:16.320> ridges<00:03:16.830> like<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.280> was<00:03:17.730> the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
sticks with ridges like this was the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.220 
sticks with ridges like this was the

stupidest idea ever
for<00:03:19.650> one<00:03:19.860> it's<00:03:20.370> harder<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.970> aim<00:03:21.120> it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
for one it's harder to aim it

love<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.730> controller<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.870> sniping

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
love is the controller so the sniping

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.960 
love is the controller so the sniping
itself<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.830> working<00:04:02.220> good<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.430> found<00:04:02.730> myself

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
itself is working good I found myself

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.460 
itself is working good I found myself
doing<00:04:03.330> ok<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.780> with<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.080> little<00:04:04.290> bit<00:04:04.440> of

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
doing ok and with a little bit of

doing ok and with a little bit of
practice<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.950> little<00:04:05.130> bit<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.400> time<00:04:05.610> I<00:04:05.820> can

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
practice a little bit of time I can

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.430 
practice a little bit of time I can
adjust<00:04:06.480> around<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.870> after<00:04:07.080> about<00:04:07.170> two<00:04:07.410> hours

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440

of<00:04:07.920> sniping<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.549> found<00:04:09.090> myself<00:04:09.269> being<00:04:09.600> a<00:04:09.660> little

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
of sniping I found myself being a little

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:10.640 
of sniping I found myself being a little
bit<00:04:09.989> more<00:04:10.110> consistent

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650

I<00:04:10.709> found<00:04:10.980> myself<00:04:11.130> learning<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.820> manage<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.360> and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
I found myself learning to manage it and

I found myself learning to manage it and
I<00:04:12.840> also<00:04:12.959> found<00:04:13.230> myself<00:04:13.350> completely<00:04:13.890> ignoring

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
I also found myself completely ignoring

breath I would just shoot and shoot and
that's<00:04:18.419> what<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:18.630> had<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.810> do<00:04:18.989> with<00:04:19.109> aggressive

long-range<00:04:32.880> shot<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.420> I<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.840> have<00:04:34.050> my<00:04:34.230> time

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
long-range shot and I and I have my time

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.950 
long-range shot and I and I have my time
to<00:04:34.680> line<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:34.920> up<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:36.030> be<00:04:36.150> completely<00:04:36.300> honest

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
to line it up so to be completely honest

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.510 
to line it up so to be completely honest
sniping<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:37.680> think<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.920> much<00:04:38.130> better<00:04:38.340> on

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
sniping I think is much better on

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.520 
sniping I think is much better on
console<00:04:38.970> now<00:04:39.090> I'm<00:04:39.570> just<00:04:39.810> not<00:04:39.960> preferring<00:04:40.440> in

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
console now I'm just not preferring in

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.930 
console now I'm just not preferring in
the<00:04:40.590> controller<00:04:40.920> and<00:04:41.130> I'm<00:04:41.190> pretty<00:04:41.400> sure<00:04:41.490> that

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
the controller and I'm pretty sure that

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.790 
the controller and I'm pretty sure that
if<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:42.960> were<00:04:43.050> able<00:04:43.170> to<00:04:43.350> get<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.470> different

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
if you were able to get a different

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.290 
if you were able to get a different
controller<00:04:44.100> or<00:04:44.460> something<00:04:44.850> like<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:45.150> or<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
controller or something like that or the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.060 
controller or something like that or the
sticks<00:04:45.630> were<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.810> little<00:04:46.020> bit<00:04:46.200> bigger<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.680> they

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
sticks were a little bit bigger and they

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.950 
sticks were a little bit bigger and they
got<00:04:47.250> rid<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.460> these<00:04:47.640> ridges<00:04:47.910> that<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.720> would<00:04:48.840> be

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
got rid of these ridges that it would be

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.210 
got rid of these ridges that it would be
really<00:04:49.110> really<00:04:49.380> good<00:04:49.500> so<00:04:49.740> it's<00:04:49.890> a<00:04:49.920> complaint

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
really really good so it's a complaint

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.680 
really really good so it's a complaint
with<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.340> controller<00:04:50.670> not<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.060> game<00:04:51.270> because

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
with the controller not the game because

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.600 
with the controller not the game because
I<00:04:51.930> think<00:04:52.080> it's<00:04:52.320> great<00:04:52.500> I<00:04:52.800> found<00:04:53.100> myself<00:04:53.250> doing

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
I think it's great I found myself doing

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.220 
I think it's great I found myself doing
a<00:04:53.790> little<00:04:54.000> bit<00:04:54.090> better<00:04:54.240> as<00:04:54.450> I<00:04:54.600> got<00:04:54.750> more<00:04:54.960> used

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
a little bit better as I got more used

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.140 
a little bit better as I got more used
to<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.530> so<00:04:56.130> there's<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.400> very<00:04:56.610> very<00:04:56.820> good<00:04:56.970> chance

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
to it so there's a very very good chance

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.370 
to it so there's a very very good chance
in<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.420> future<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:57.750> could<00:04:57.900> start<00:04:58.140> to<00:04:58.230> try<00:04:58.350> to

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
in the future I could start to try to

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.470 
in the future I could start to try to
make<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.700> PlayStation<00:04:59.700> four<00:04:59.910> montage<00:05:00.300> or

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
make a PlayStation four montage or

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.550 
make a PlayStation four montage or
something<00:05:00.750> like<00:05:00.840> that<00:05:00.900> for<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.230> guys<00:05:01.380> if

hopefully you enjoyed it you guys have

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.160 
hopefully you enjoyed it you guys have
been<00:05:11.340> asking<00:05:11.550> to<00:05:12.090> see<00:05:12.240> what<00:05:12.540> sniping<00:05:12.960> is<00:05:13.020> like

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
been asking to see what sniping is like

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.660 
been asking to see what sniping is like
and<00:05:13.350> how<00:05:13.410> it's<00:05:13.620> changed<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.160> think<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.550> is

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
and how it's changed and I think it is

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.260 
and how it's changed and I think it is
ten<00:05:14.910> times<00:05:15.060> better<00:05:15.330> than<00:05:15.540> it<00:05:15.630> was<00:05:15.750> in<00:05:15.930> bf3

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
ten times better than it was in bf3

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.070 
ten times better than it was in bf3
again<00:05:18.270> that<00:05:18.420> applies<00:05:18.690> to<00:05:18.720> next-gen<00:05:19.200> but<00:05:21.080> again

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
again that applies to next-gen but again

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.240 
again that applies to next-gen but again
with<00:05:22.260> these<00:05:22.410> controllers<00:05:22.830> it<00:05:23.100> just

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
with these controllers it just

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.130 
with these controllers it just
complicates<00:05:23.640> things<00:05:23.910> I<00:05:24.300> mean<00:05:24.660> I<00:05:24.750> just<00:05:24.990> may<00:05:25.110> be

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
complicates things I mean I just may be

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.110 
complicates things I mean I just may be
spoiled<00:05:25.650> with<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.860> mouse<00:05:26.040> but<00:05:26.070> it's<00:05:26.880> just<00:05:27.030> a

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
spoiled with the mouse but it's just a

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.610 
spoiled with the mouse but it's just a
little<00:05:27.270> bit<00:05:27.420> harder<00:05:27.570> for<00:05:27.720> me<00:05:27.960> and<00:05:28.170> I<00:05:28.560> think

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
little bit harder for me and I think

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.080 
little bit harder for me and I think
with<00:05:28.830> enough<00:05:29.040> practice<00:05:29.460> or<00:05:29.610> people<00:05:29.880> that<00:05:29.970> have

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
with enough practice or people that have

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.610 
with enough practice or people that have
been<00:05:30.180> doing<00:05:30.330> this<00:05:30.450> for<00:05:30.570> a<00:05:30.690> long<00:05:30.870> time<00:05:31.110> I<00:05:31.290> expect

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
been doing this for a long time I expect

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.720 
been doing this for a long time I expect
there<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.830> be<00:05:31.950> some<00:05:32.160> really<00:05:32.400> really<00:05:32.520> good
