00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.660
 spoon photo 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.970
 that the video fell in love with a fool all big 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.519
 hi i got back to you with enough 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.130
 an interesting topic that I generally think about 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.560
 learning that my motivates that you can 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.420
 motivate and i think it is 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.939
 quite interesting and controversial topic 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.930
 because everyone has their own 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.390
 opinion and i'm sure that most 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.849
 viewers did not agree with me because 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 I don't know, but now this opinion 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.410
 youth that something happened but I 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.530
 slightly different opinion and I wanted with you 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.510
 today to share and ask you what 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.110
 you think on this topic you can 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.969
 write your thoughts in the comments or 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.539
 to me in a personal message so that it was 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.820
 so let's say anonymously and yes I will be glad 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.010
 if you write your reasoning this 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.410
 very interesting and since this video I 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 rented together with Dasha such 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 Blonde 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.910
 you can go to her channel she removes 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.430
 interesting video before she starred 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.470
 Friend, by the way, I've been watching their channel 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.200
 and recently my written off such uh come on 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.460
 take off let's combine here so what if 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.439
 you wonder what she thinks about it 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.570
 about me by the way is also interesting so 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.939
 call on her channel and link in description 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.200
 as always 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.360
 so I don't even know where to start 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.810
 I'll probably start by saying that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.330
 and now many many many with me not 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.630
 agree, and now I will tell you how 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.320
 I think the bulk of young people like her 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.140
 now reason they think that 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.710
 education study and assessment is not important 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.720
 there are such cases that a man is terrible 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.509
 study he did not finish school he was 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.369
 some twos but in life he has achieved very 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.770
 a lot of hair a popular rich 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.869
 successful and so on for example there are 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.630
 a man with higher education and he 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.270
 working in mcdonalds at checkout and if 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.360
 honest i don't agree yes definitely 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.300
 such cases when people do not learn 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.410
 many are making huge strides already 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.650
 but there is a lot here but who gives you 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.590
 guarantee that you will reach the top if you 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.410
 can not make an effort heaps how 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.660
 you will achieve something let's start 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.820
 probably with 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.670
 what's the most improvement now 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.490
 many schoolchildren i don't know many people 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.780
 love to compare themselves with others for example 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.430
 with their peers 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.210
 and constantly constantly compare and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.600
 unconditionally in the world 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.160
 everywhere there are people who are better than you you are not 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.690
 can be the perfect serious you 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.510
 can be the best in some 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.700
 a certain industry is always on him 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.450
 there will be people who will be better than you in 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.270
 anything 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.730
 him all of course about some part in 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.840
 some industry some skill 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.380
 people like to chase after others and 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.990
 compete and don't say that 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.580
 competition is bad but here is another 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.050
 meaning that you are constantly 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.020
 comparing yourself with some 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.410
 an excellent student this is what the hell am I 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.709
 stupid how stupid i am you can't do that 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.720
 you can’t compare yourself with other people 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.750
 who achieve something in the first place 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.040
 I think you need to compete with yourself 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.070
 yourself past need 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.670
 stop better like you should 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.530
 be better now than yesterday i know 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.540
 many such people even from my class 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.190
 and these are the people who worked on 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.910
 after a while 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.310
 overtook the rest in school and you have everything 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.900
 get the most important of these goals and not to sit 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.480
 on the pope exactly and wait for some 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.790
 magic and miracles will not happen 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.540
 you just need to work, I still think 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.700
 that you need to try to study and you 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.220
 there must be a lot of motivation I don't know 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.489
 at least just please yourself parents 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.770
 your family to be proud of you and you 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.310
 will respect here you know in primary 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.900
 Excellent classes were not respected simply 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.180
 children don't understand they think that 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.210
 honors students are some nerds for glasses 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.330
 boring 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.760
 food in childhood still here for example even 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.210
 in our class and special 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:17.170
 excellent students but when you grow up and 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.150
 when you are already in the eighth seventh 9 10 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.240
 childhood class if you 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.760
 An excellent student how to tell us if you just 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.540
 know learn try 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.520
 and then you get good marks for you 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.000
 begin to respect here seriously at us in 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.640
 classroom 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.100
 respect those who study well I, too 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:40.350
 I respect such people, but it’s not important 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.580
 go too far and does not study day and night 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.590
 of course maybe I am a little bit now 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.690
 conflicting things I say but need 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.970
 just finding the balance you need 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.180
 pay huge attention because i 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.880
 planted her eyesight because of the books and 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.400
 I memorized it for sure now I wear glasses 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.100
 constantly and try to study need 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.050
 also in the measures they are too driven 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.160
 just recently I have such a period that I 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.420
 everything is shorter with just blow up and brain 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.170
 exploded from studying 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.210
 but my father said to me that should not be so 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.670
 get nervous and spend your nerve cells 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.300
 on this ie it is necessary to find the gold 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.370
 the middle does not bend too far 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.280
 not to be broken I really hope that 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.590
 you understand my opinion that I wanted to you 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.770
 say i know that everyone is different 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.900
 situations and speak for everyone i can't 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.330
 because the teacher's serious reason 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.690
 just a nightmare and the impossibility is not me 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.890
 how to study i know it all happens in 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.600
 classmates it's horrible to me 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.180
 probably with luck and I like that 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.880
 it's easier to talk about it because I 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.380
 lucky with classmates with pins and me 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.990
 I want to give you another little advice 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.100
 and quarrel with the teachers is the same 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.250
 that you can't quarrel with your parents just 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.530
 shut up 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.110
 I certainly understand that you are so cool and 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.300
 you want to cheat on a teacher but you know 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.180
 it did not help you in future teachers they 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.130
 still not rated objectively but 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.889
 subjectively if the teacher see you 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.990
 are trying 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.199
 what really you make an effort you 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.710
 working in the classroom and at home he already has 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:18.499
 respects you as a student and there are even 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.439
 that estimates put more so free 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:24.969
 total if the student is a bad student avid then 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:26.599
 he is immediately asked he is so not ready 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.999
 caught 2 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:30.979
 it was such a short video with a mass 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:33.159
 information what i think i am 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:37.189
 I hope you understood me correctly 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:39.080
 because here is such a fine line of it 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:41.180
 for you, then probably all that I am to you 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.770
 wanted to say do not forget to write your 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.560
 opinion in the comments I'm sure that 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.529
 you other thoughts maybe you are with me 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.389
 agree disagree is your right 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:52.729
