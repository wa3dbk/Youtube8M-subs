00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.440
 january and welcome to a new one 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.010
 tutorial from me 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.300
 and today it will be about apple 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.109
 password from a mac computer 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.300
 reset or set a new one 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.920
 holds a protected account 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.029
 deal or again 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.100
 to get in one's own way 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.080
 password forgot has for it there 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.010
 Two methods the first one works with 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.720
 So the recovery hard drives to the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.170
 important or recovery 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.910
 partition the new macs and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.870
 or the new software 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.610
 is installed 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.780
 that will start now and in the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.719
 second video I will then one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.640
 tutorial about how to do this 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.840
 Unlock network account if you can 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.190
 No recovery is available and that 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.730
 then works differently then but then 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.800
 in the next video so now at lay 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 some lend or mavericks that 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.940
 also reset start with the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.270
 pc first time on the recovery disk 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.470
 that means we press old and thereby the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:11.060
 button and hold as long pressed 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.060
 is the menu appears 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.100
 so here we have that would already be 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.319
 we recover hd from these 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.719
 restore disk is in 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:28.729
 the same as the macintosh 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.729
 installation city only on the computer like that 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.380
 it will take a while 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.450
 so when the cio has arrived at the top 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.250
 does not use anything of this program here 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:15.840
 but we go to utilities 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:17.250
 and if you leave that terminal out so that 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.780
 can you already see us here 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.360
 now in the loop this is us 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.519
 have every right and that allows 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.170
 Just breathe the password 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.269
 reset from our account 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.310
 while or from any one 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:34.230
 account on this bill that we 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:38.640
 Let's put together a reset world 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.239
 press everything and press once and change it 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.920
 a window opens 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.319
 Here we are now the petition 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.170
 on which the operating system is located 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.989
 was account available can here 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 with the user select 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.349
 take my user now and give 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.250
 now a new password for it so 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.329
 that must then repeat and then goes 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.190
 you can still here a hint 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.170
 adjust if you want and then go 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.130
 also secure 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.450
 Now he says once the registration 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:16.739
 password expires you stop 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:23.030
 reset blabla and can do 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.030
 the whole end so 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.010
 then we drive the computer it out 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.540
 Back up this time on our account 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.810
 who changed the password of now 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.810
 to have 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.670
 very important now what is coming now 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.880
 We now go to the new password 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.200
 that we have set and now he will 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.819
 Ask me the system could do it 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.410
 once the keychain does not release 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.230
 because the keyring on the old one 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.459
 password is set that is yes 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.140
 not so bad now 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.840
 theoretically a new keychain 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.670
 continue to apply or create 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.610
 one day the old password 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.890
 found out or by a miracle 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.319
 found somewhere on the computer 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.549
 You can also update to password 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.889
 go enter a password and 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.859
 already the data from the keychain 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.510
 to which the new password transferred so 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.250
 but you do not even have to 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.310
 It would have been right from the beginning 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.350
 just log on anyway 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.660
 can and would be in operating systems in it 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.639
 could have done anything 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.729
 just do not have this keychain 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.889
 having the passwords here is that 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.240
 but not necessary with the 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.610
 batman account could be pretty 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.130
 do everything and these were keys 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.640
 specific thing yes you have to finally 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.320
 minister 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.770
 Well, I hope so 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.330
 could a few of you help yourself yes 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.360
 very practical in any case our 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.250
 Pass forgot or yes if 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.650
 you bought mac and there unfortunately 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.789
 Everything is locked on it and you know 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.789
 not really make out now 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.450
 then you will see second video now 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.970
 come to grips with how to do that 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.590
 at a computer where none of the new 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.260
 operating systems on it is so that we 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.229
 no recovery hd also have it very much 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.970
 simple and then until next time 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.960
 you can just ask in the 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.970
 Write comments 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.080
 I am ready to help you 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.080
 Answer bye
