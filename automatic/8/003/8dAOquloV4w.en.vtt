job<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.410> little<00:02:21.280> bit<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:22.720> making<00:02:22.870> the

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
job a little bit of that it's making the

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.400 
job a little bit of that it's making the
drum<00:02:23.200> noise<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.680> then<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:26.140> add<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.380> two

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
drum noise and then you add the two

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.790 
drum noise and then you add the two
together<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:27.390> know<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.630> that's<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.560> water

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
together you know and that's the water

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.160 
together you know and that's the water
drop<00:02:30.069> and<00:02:30.280> that's<00:02:30.400> all<00:02:30.700> about<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.840> got<00:02:32.019> to
