00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
it's really creating an atmosphere in

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.430 
it's really creating an atmosphere in
which<00:02:18.250> we<00:02:18.489> can<00:02:18.670> be<00:02:19.180> productive<00:02:19.510> all<00:02:19.930> day<00:02:20.230> and

not really have to leave as much so

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.089 
not really have to leave as much so
think<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.780> having<00:02:23.140> such<00:02:23.379> a<00:02:23.410> nice<00:02:23.620> business

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
think that having such a nice business

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.039 
think that having such a nice business
school<00:02:24.370> not<00:02:24.819> only<00:02:25.209> gives<00:02:25.660> students

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
school not only gives students

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.250 
school not only gives students
confidence<00:02:26.410> but<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.069> also<00:02:27.370> shows<00:02:27.849> us<00:02:28.750> how<00:02:29.049> much

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
confidence but it also shows us how much

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.190 
confidence but it also shows us how much
that<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.160> school<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.879> our<00:02:31.360> business<00:02:31.780> alumni

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
that the school and our business alumni

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.069 
that the school and our business alumni
scare<00:02:32.560> about<00:02:32.650> us<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.250> work<00:02:33.970> hard<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.569> provide

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
scare about us to work hard to provide

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.740 
scare about us to work hard to provide
such<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> learning<00:02:35.920> atmosphere<00:02:36.459> for<00:02:36.700> us<00:02:36.750> I

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
such a learning atmosphere for us I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.440 
such a learning atmosphere for us I
think<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.260> definitely<00:02:38.769> lends<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:40.030> better

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
think it definitely lends to a better

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.330 
think it definitely lends to a better
learning<00:02:40.720> environment<00:02:40.840> for<00:02:41.470> us<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.890> all<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
learning environment for us just all the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.030 
learning environment for us just all the
resources<00:02:42.879> that<00:02:43.000> we<00:02:43.269> have<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.840> think<00:02:44.500> it's<00:02:44.650> it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
resources that we have I think it's it's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.280 
resources that we have I think it's it's
also<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.400> good<00:02:45.609> feeling<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.090> know<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.599> you
