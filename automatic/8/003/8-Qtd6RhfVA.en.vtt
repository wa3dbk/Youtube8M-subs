hi<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:05.430> tutorial<00:00:06.090> is<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.300> first<00:00:06.480> in<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
hi this tutorial is the first in the

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.459 
hi this tutorial is the first in the
pharmacokinetic<00:00:08.100> series<00:00:08.660> so<00:00:09.660> first<00:00:09.930> of<00:00:10.110> all<00:00:10.260> I

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
pharmacokinetic series so first of all I

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.710 
pharmacokinetic series so first of all I
should<00:00:10.799> talk<00:00:10.980> about<00:00:11.040> what<00:00:11.720> pharmacokinetics

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:12.720 
should talk about what pharmacokinetics

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.210 
should talk about what pharmacokinetics
is<00:00:14.269> with<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.420> pharmacology<00:00:15.990> we<00:00:16.619> often<00:00:16.980> talk

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
is with in pharmacology we often talk

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.940 
is with in pharmacology we often talk
about<00:00:17.250> two<00:00:17.759> distinct<00:00:18.450> but<00:00:19.020> unfortunately

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
about two distinct but unfortunately

pharmacokinetics we ask questions like

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.639 
pharmacokinetics we ask questions like
how<00:00:57.030> does<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.359> drug<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.809> into<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> body<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
how does the drug get into the body and

is<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.280> branch<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.820> pharmacology<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:10.079> we

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
is this branch of pharmacology that we

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.010 
is this branch of pharmacology that we
will<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.470> looking<00:01:10.649> at<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.399> series<00:01:12.020> so

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
will be looking at in this series so

pharmacology add me a DM II this stands
for<00:01:25.670> absorption<00:01:26.670> which<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.780> how<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> drug

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
for absorption which is how the drug

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.179 
for absorption which is how the drug
gets<00:01:28.530> into<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> body<00:01:30.290> distribution<00:01:31.290> which<00:01:32.009> is

gets into the body distribution which is

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.870 
gets into the body distribution which is
where<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> drug<00:01:32.820> goes<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.539> the<00:01:33.630> body

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
where the drug goes to in the body

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.399 
where the drug goes to in the body
metabolism<00:01:35.880> which<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.780> how<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.079> body

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
metabolism which is how the body

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.810 
metabolism which is how the body
chemically<00:01:38.039> modifies<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.939> drug<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.740> finally

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
chemically modifies the drug and finally

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
chemically modifies the drug and finally
excretion<00:01:41.899> which<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.079> how<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.350> body<00:01:43.649> gets<00:01:43.979> rid

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
excretion which is how the body gets rid

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.130

of the drug these are four elements we

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.830 
of the drug these are four elements we
need<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.439> consider<00:01:49.770> when<00:01:50.009> talking<00:01:50.280> about

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
and here on the y-axis we have the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.870 
and here on the y-axis we have the
concentration<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.650> drug<00:02:19.860> within<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.640> body

and<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.320> x-axis<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.760> time<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.250> we

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
and on the x-axis we have time so if we

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.780 
and on the x-axis we have time so if we
give<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> person<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.300> drug<00:02:27.450> at<00:02:27.750> time<00:02:28.200> zero<00:02:28.800> then

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
give a person a drug at time zero then

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.550 
give a person a drug at time zero then
we<00:02:30.000> will<00:02:30.180> see<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.480> concentration<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
we will see the concentration of the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.910 
we will see the concentration of the
drug<00:02:31.680> go<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:33.050> then<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.170> will<00:02:34.230> fall<00:02:34.500> slowly

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
drug go up and then it will fall slowly

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.870 
drug go up and then it will fall slowly
as<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.490> drug<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.850> removed<00:02:36.209> from<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.450> body<00:02:36.600> and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
as the drug is removed from the body and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.910 
as the drug is removed from the body and
that's<00:02:38.880> what<00:02:39.060> we<00:02:39.180> see<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.630> graph<00:02:42.920> so

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
that's what we see on this graph so

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.220 
that's what we see on this graph so
looking<00:02:44.250> at<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.430> graph<00:02:44.490> we<00:02:44.940> can<00:02:45.209> see<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:46.050> in

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
looking at this graph we can see that in

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.800 
looking at this graph we can see that in
this<00:02:46.440> section<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.700> drug<00:02:47.970> enters<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.600> body

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
this section the drug enters the body

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.699 
this section the drug enters the body
faster<00:02:49.410> than<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.830> being<00:02:49.890> removed<00:02:50.459> from<00:02:50.760> it

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
faster than it is being removed from it

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.160 
faster than it is being removed from it
therefore<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:54.000> concentration<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.989> drug

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
therefore the concentration of the drug

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.020 
therefore the concentration of the drug
in<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.650> body<00:02:55.830> increases<00:02:58.160> then<00:02:59.160> after<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
in the body increases then after the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.180 
in the body increases then after the
peak<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.570> graph<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.590> drug<00:03:01.860> is<00:03:02.010> being

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
peak of this graph the drug is being

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.580 
peak of this graph the drug is being
removed<00:03:02.670> from<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.180> body<00:03:03.360> faster<00:03:04.140> than<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.440> is

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
removed from the body faster than it is

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.220 
removed from the body faster than it is
entering<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.270> concentration<00:03:07.020> of<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
entering so the concentration of the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.750 
entering so the concentration of the
drug<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.680> body<00:03:07.860> starts<00:03:08.340> decreasing<00:03:10.760> this

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
drug in the body starts decreasing this

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.460 
drug in the body starts decreasing this
point<00:03:12.150> at<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.480> top<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.020> graph<00:03:13.200> is

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
point at the top of the graph is

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.949 
point at the top of the graph is
important<00:03:14.070> because<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.390> highest

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
important because it is the highest

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.070 
important because it is the highest
concentration<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.770> drug<00:03:17.070> in<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.520> body

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
concentration of drug in the body

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.140 
concentration of drug in the body
therefore<00:03:19.080> we<00:03:19.620> call<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.519> maximum

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
therefore we call this the maximum

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.360 
therefore we call this the maximum
concentration<00:03:21.600> or<00:03:22.670> C<00:03:23.670> max<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.890> important

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
concentration or C max this is important

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.680 
concentration or C max this is important
because<00:03:26.400> knowing<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.209> maximum

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
because knowing the maximum

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.110 
because knowing the maximum
concentration<00:03:28.160> can<00:03:29.160> help<00:03:29.459> predict<00:03:29.850> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
concentration can help predict the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.330 
concentration can help predict the
therapeutic<00:03:30.660> benefit<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.290> also<00:03:32.040> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
therapeutic benefit and also the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.460 
therapeutic benefit and also the
likelihood<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.970> side-effects<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.959> time<00:03:37.260> at

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
likelihood of side-effects the time at

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.800 
likelihood of side-effects the time at
which<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.830> maximum<00:03:38.010> concentration<00:03:38.810> occurs

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
which the maximum concentration occurs

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.810 
which the maximum concentration occurs
is<00:03:40.200> called<00:03:40.549> T<00:03:41.549> Max<00:03:43.160> now<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> slightly<00:03:44.549> more

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
is called T Max now a slightly more

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.479 
is called T Max now a slightly more
confusing<00:03:45.390> concept<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.620> half-life<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.400> a

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
confusing concept is the half-life of a

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.620 
confusing concept is the half-life of a
drug<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.930> half-life<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.709> by<00:03:50.280> definition<00:03:50.670> the

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
drug the half-life is by definition the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.900 
drug the half-life is by definition the
time<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.049> takes<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.920> remove<00:03:53.250> half<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
time it takes to remove half of the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.390 
time it takes to remove half of the
current<00:03:54.209> concentration<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:55.140> drug<00:03:55.320> from<00:03:56.250> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
current concentration of drug from the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.870 
current concentration of drug from the
body<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:58.230> let's<00:03:58.470> consider<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.160> half-life<00:03:59.670> on

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
body so let's consider the half-life on

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.759 
body so let's consider the half-life on
this<00:04:00.329> graph<00:04:00.709> if<00:04:01.709> we<00:04:02.459> begin<00:04:02.820> at<00:04:02.970> T<00:04:03.450> Max<00:04:03.750> we<00:04:04.530> want

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
this graph if we begin at T Max we want

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.560 
this graph if we begin at T Max we want
to<00:04:04.890> see<00:04:05.070> how<00:04:05.310> much<00:04:05.459> time<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.850> takes<00:04:06.239> for<00:04:06.510> the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
to see how much time it takes for the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.990 
to see how much time it takes for the
concentration<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.500> drug<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:08.459> decrease

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
concentration of the drug to decrease

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.180 
concentration of the drug to decrease
from<00:04:09.510> C<00:04:09.840> max<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.890> half<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.400> C<00:04:11.670> max<00:04:12.769> so<00:04:13.769> here<00:04:14.070> is

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
from C max to half of C max so here is

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.900 
from C max to half of C max so here is
the<00:04:14.370> half<00:04:14.640> C<00:04:15.060> max<00:04:15.329> line<00:04:15.660> here<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.910> therefore

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
the half C max line here and therefore

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.530 
the half C max line here and therefore
the<00:04:18.660> half-life<00:04:19.260> which<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.280> often<00:04:20.549> denoted<00:04:20.880> T

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
the half-life which is often denoted T

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.180 
the half-life which is often denoted T
half<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:24.270> time<00:04:24.570> between<00:04:24.750> T<00:04:25.289> Max<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.890> where

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
half is the time between T Max and where

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.890 
half is the time between T Max and where
I've<00:04:26.340> drawn<00:04:26.700> T<00:04:27.300> half<00:04:27.599> here

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
I've drawn T half here

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.719 
I've drawn T half here
so<00:04:29.900> just<00:04:30.139> to<00:04:30.259> summarize<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:31.189> time<00:04:31.460> it<00:04:31.639> is

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
so just to summarize the time it is

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.029 
so just to summarize the time it is
taken<00:04:32.210> for<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.479> drug<00:04:32.749> to<00:04:32.930> drop<00:04:33.169> from<00:04:33.830> its

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
taken for the drug to drop from its

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.790 
taken for the drug to drop from its
maximum<00:04:34.610> level<00:04:34.759> to<00:04:35.599> half<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:36.110> its<00:04:36.229> maximum

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
maximum level to half of its maximum

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.659 
maximum level to half of its maximum
level<00:04:36.919> is<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:38.089> half-life<00:04:38.449> on<00:04:39.309> this<00:04:40.309> graph

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
level is the half-life on this graph

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.869 
level is the half-life on this graph
this<00:04:41.539> is<00:04:41.599> the<00:04:41.900> time<00:04:42.139> between<00:04:42.409> T<00:04:42.949> Max<00:04:43.219> and<00:04:43.520> where

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
this is the time between T Max and where

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.189 
this is the time between T Max and where
I've<00:04:44.029> drawn<00:04:44.300> T<00:04:44.599> half<00:04:46.479> there's<00:04:47.479> a<00:04:47.569> lot<00:04:47.749> more<00:04:47.930> to

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
I've drawn T half there's a lot more to

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.709 
I've drawn T half there's a lot more to
talk<00:04:48.409> about<00:04:48.469> with<00:04:48.979> half-lives<00:04:49.419> there's<00:04:50.419> a<00:04:50.539> lot

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:50.719 
talk about with half-lives there's a lot

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:52.469 
talk about with half-lives there's a lot
more<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.050> talk<00:04:51.229> about<00:04:51.289> with<00:04:51.620> half-lives

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
more to talk about with half-lives

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.239 
more to talk about with half-lives
including<00:04:53.479> rate<00:04:53.960> laws<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.589> orders<00:04:55.099> of

including rate laws and orders of
reactions<00:04:55.759> but<00:04:56.539> that<00:04:56.719> is<00:04:56.839> beyond<00:04:57.139> the<00:04:57.229> scope

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.529 
reactions but that is beyond the scope
of<00:04:57.710> this<00:04:57.830> video<00:04:58.039> so<00:04:58.909> we'll<00:04:59.089> talk<00:04:59.240> about<00:04:59.300> that

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
of this video so we'll talk about that

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:05.320 
of this video so we'll talk about that
in<00:04:59.960> a<00:05:00.139> later<00:05:00.289> tutorial<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:04.639> last<00:05:04.879> thing<00:05:05.180> to

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
in a later tutorial the last thing to

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.799 
in a later tutorial the last thing to
look<00:05:05.479> at<00:05:05.659> is<00:05:05.899> the<00:05:06.169> area<00:05:06.620> under<00:05:07.039> the<00:05:07.159> curve<00:05:07.189> and

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:07.809 
look at is the area under the curve and

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.600 
look at is the area under the curve and
this<00:05:08.809> I<00:05:09.020> have<00:05:09.169> it<00:05:09.319> illustrated<00:05:09.889> by<00:05:10.009> shading<00:05:10.490> in

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
this I have it illustrated by shading in

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.450 
this I have it illustrated by shading in
the<00:05:10.729> space<00:05:11.029> under<00:05:11.539> the<00:05:11.629> graph<00:05:12.460> this

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
the space under the graph this

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.760 
the space under the graph this
represents<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.270> total<00:05:14.539> exposure<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.409> a<00:05:15.439> drug

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
represents the total exposure to a drug

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.639 
represents the total exposure to a drug
that<00:05:16.099> the<00:05:16.249> body<00:05:16.460> receives<00:05:17.439> this<00:05:18.439> is<00:05:18.620> a

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:18.649 
that the body receives this is a

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:20.589 
that the body receives this is a
function<00:05:19.129> of<00:05:19.219> how<00:05:19.399> high<00:05:19.699> the<00:05:19.729> concentration

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
function of how high the concentration

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.929 
function of how high the concentration
of<00:05:20.689> the<00:05:20.779> drug<00:05:20.930> gets<00:05:21.259> as<00:05:21.559> well<00:05:22.309> as<00:05:22.460> how<00:05:22.639> quickly

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939 
of the drug gets as well as how quickly

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.459 
of the drug gets as well as how quickly
it's<00:05:23.300> excreted<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:25.659> that's<00:05:26.659> an<00:05:26.899> introduction

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469 
it's excreted and that's an introduction

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:30.399 
it's excreted and that's an introduction
to<00:05:27.499> the<00:05:27.710> basics<00:05:28.189> of<00:05:28.309> pharmacokinetics<00:05:28.849> in<00:05:29.509> the

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
to the basics of pharmacokinetics in the

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.499 
to the basics of pharmacokinetics in the
next<00:05:30.680> video<00:05:30.949> we'll<00:05:31.309> look<00:05:31.460> at<00:05:31.610> roots<00:05:32.059> of<00:05:32.300> drug

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
next video we'll look at roots of drug

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.959 
next video we'll look at roots of drug
administration<00:05:33.289> and<00:05:33.469> how<00:05:34.189> different<00:05:34.550> roots

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
administration and how different roots

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:40.209 
administration and how different roots
can<00:05:35.599> affect<00:05:35.959> C<00:05:36.649> Max<00:05:36.919> and<00:05:37.129> T<00:05:37.580> Max<00:05:38.919> if<00:05:39.919> you've

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:40.219 
can affect C Max and T Max if you've

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:42.309 
can affect C Max and T Max if you've
