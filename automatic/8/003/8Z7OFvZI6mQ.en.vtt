um<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.500> was<00:00:37.710> thinking<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:38.219> day<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.850> would

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000

happen if I combined be sticking with

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.410 
happen if I combined be sticking with
the<00:00:42.059> PK<00:00:42.420> jump<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.890> got<00:00:44.340> something<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.120> called

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the PK jump and I got something I called

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.010 
the PK jump and I got something I called
a<00:00:45.690> fire<00:00:46.500> round<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:48.239> really<00:00:48.570> interesting

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.609 

alright<00:01:19.850> that's<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.479> regular<00:01:20.930> short<00:01:21.170> hopping<00:01:21.470> a

alright that's a regular short hopping a

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.910 
alright that's a regular short hopping a
fire<00:01:21.880> worth<00:01:22.880> wild<00:01:23.240> land<00:01:23.540> but<00:01:23.900> short<00:01:24.470> range<00:01:24.740> and

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
fire worth wild land but short range and

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.210 
fire worth wild land but short range and
hard<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.220> do<00:01:25.659> at<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.810> wave<00:01:26.990> bounce<00:01:27.259> PK<00:01:27.650> fire<00:01:27.860> a

hard to do at the wave bounce PK fire a

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.430 
hard to do at the wave bounce PK fire a
little<00:01:28.909> more<00:01:29.090> defensive<00:01:29.210> but<00:01:29.810> still<00:01:30.080> too

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
little more defensive but still too

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.070 
little more defensive but still too
short<00:01:30.770> range<00:01:31.369> to<00:01:31.549> be<00:01:31.640> very<00:01:31.850> useful<00:01:31.940> at<00:01:32.780> the

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
short range to be very useful at the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.680 
short range to be very useful at the
full<00:01:33.649> hops<00:01:33.920> one<00:01:35.710> it's<00:01:36.710> okay<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:37.399> mean<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.450> do

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
full hops one it's okay I mean you do

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.719 
full hops one it's okay I mean you do
get<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:38.990> lot<00:01:39.170> of<00:01:39.229> defense<00:01:39.710> but<00:01:40.039> if<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:40.460> can't

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
get a lot of defense but if you can't

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.499 
get a lot of defense but if you can't
follow<00:01:41.030> up<00:01:41.420> your<00:01:41.600> PK<00:01:41.990> fire<00:01:42.549> it's<00:01:43.549> not<00:01:44.030> really

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
follow up your PK fire it's not really

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.030 
follow up your PK fire it's not really
worth<00:01:44.659> hitting

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.030 

that's<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:49.030> PK<00:01:49.480> jump<00:01:49.750> knows<00:01:49.990> how<00:01:50.170> far<00:01:50.530> lunged

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
that's a PK jump knows how far lunged

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.820 
that's a PK jump knows how far lunged
forward<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.020> way<00:01:53.200> from<00:01:53.290> over<00:01:53.620> there<00:01:53.770> I

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
forward all the way from over there I

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.680 
forward all the way from over there I
hit<00:01:54.040> with<00:01:54.190> PK<00:01:54.520> fire<00:01:54.700> out<00:01:54.940> of<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.150> single<00:01:55.360> jump

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
hit with PK fire out of a single jump

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.660 
hit with PK fire out of a single jump
and<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.680> end<00:01:56.830> up<00:01:56.950> right<00:01:57.160> in<00:01:57.190> front<00:01:57.430> of<00:01:57.520> them

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
and you end up right in front of them

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.230 
and you end up right in front of them
perfect<00:01:58.480> for<00:01:58.510> comboing<00:01:58.960> as<00:01:59.850> shown<00:02:00.850> right

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240

there<00:02:02.100> now<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.720> where<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.050> try<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.440> combine

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
there now here is where I try to combine

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.200 
there now here is where I try to combine
the<00:02:05.860> two<00:02:06.750> there<00:02:07.750> we<00:02:07.990> go<00:02:08.429> did<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.580> just<00:02:09.759> see

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
the two there we go did you just see

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.360 
the two there we go did you just see
that<00:02:10.240> sexiness<00:02:11.580> tell<00:02:12.580> me<00:02:12.700> did<00:02:12.850> it<00:02:12.970> okay<00:02:13.540> well

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
that sexiness tell me did it okay well

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.400 
that sexiness tell me did it okay well
anyways<00:02:15.370> if<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.640> didn't<00:02:16.000> notice<00:02:16.120> Ness<00:02:16.570> swung

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
anyways if you didn't notice Ness swung

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.770 
anyways if you didn't notice Ness swung
backwards<00:02:18.100> with<00:02:18.640> about<00:02:18.850> half<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.510> height<00:02:19.720> of

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
backwards with about half the height of

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.160 
backwards with about half the height of
his<00:02:20.400> double<00:02:21.400> jump<00:02:21.670> shot<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.570> PK<00:02:22.870> fired

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
his double jump shot the PK fired

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.680 
his double jump shot the PK fired
downward<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.040> moved<00:02:24.730> back<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:24.970> very<00:02:25.150> good

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
downward and moved back a very good

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.960 
downward and moved back a very good
distance<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.550> think<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:27.670> because<00:02:27.760> it's

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
distance I think it's because it's

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.510 
distance I think it's because it's
combining<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.570> horizontal<00:02:29.320> prowess<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.070> PK

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
combining the horizontal prowess of a PK

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.780 
combining the horizontal prowess of a PK
jump<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.720> backward<00:02:31.930> momentum<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:33.610> wave

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
jump and the backward momentum of a wave

bouncer<00:02:34.300> be<00:02:34.570> stick<00:02:34.900> now<00:02:35.860> let's<00:02:36.280> see<00:02:36.430> if<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.640> can

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
bouncer be stick now let's see if I can

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.880 
bouncer be stick now let's see if I can
pull<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.480> off<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.570> few<00:02:37.840> more<00:02:37.959> times<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.620> don't

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
pull it off a few more times I don't

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.229 
pull it off a few more times I don't
remember<00:02:39.010> if<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.310> did<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.700> few<00:02:39.730> times<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.209> the

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
remember if I did it a few times in the

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:49.830 
remember if I did it a few times in the
vid

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.580 

there<00:02:50.500> we<00:02:50.680> go<00:02:51.060> there<00:02:52.060> we<00:02:52.090> go<00:02:52.330> again<00:02:52.840> look<00:02:53.470> at

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
there we go there we go again look at

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.880 
there we go there we go again look at
that<00:02:53.709> funky<00:02:54.400> s-curve<00:02:55.360> his<00:02:55.900> double<00:02:56.410> jump<00:02:56.650> seems

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
that funky s-curve his double jump seems

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.380 
that funky s-curve his double jump seems
to<00:02:57.160> follow<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:59.129> that's<00:03:00.129> pretty<00:03:00.280> much<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.489> it

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
to follow and that's pretty much it it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.630 
to follow and that's pretty much it it
looks<00:03:01.599> pretty<00:03:01.900> cool<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:03.040> could<00:03:03.220> have<00:03:03.340> its<00:03:03.489> uses

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
looks pretty cool it could have its uses

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.420 
looks pretty cool it could have its uses
I<00:03:03.849> can<00:03:04.030> see<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.239> having<00:03:04.360> its<00:03:04.569> uses<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:05.019> very

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
I can see it having its uses it's very

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.729 
I can see it having its uses it's very
very<00:03:06.430> defensive<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.720> gives<00:03:08.200> pika<00:03:08.500> fire<00:03:08.709> a

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
very defensive and it gives pika fire a

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.970 
very defensive and it gives pika fire a
lot<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.160> range<00:03:09.370> yeah<00:03:10.299> that's<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.930> detail<00:03:11.230> jab

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
lot of range yeah that's a detail jab

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.729 
lot of range yeah that's a detail jab
lock<00:03:12.599> works<00:03:13.599> at<00:03:13.810> high<00:03:13.959> percentages<00:03:14.530> but

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
lock works at high percentages but

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.190 
lock works at high percentages but
that's<00:03:15.040> off<00:03:15.160> topic<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.629> was<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.840> point<00:03:17.049> is

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
that's off topic and it was the point is

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.360 
that's off topic and it was the point is
this<00:03:17.410> could<00:03:17.470> provide<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.310> very<00:03:18.879> useful

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
this could provide a very useful

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.180 
this could provide a very useful
defensive<00:03:21.370> PK<00:03:21.700> fire<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.739> unlike<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.980> regular

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
defensive PK fire and unlike the regular

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.729 
defensive PK fire and unlike the regular
wave<00:03:24.519> bounce<00:03:24.819> it<00:03:25.120> has<00:03:25.450> actually<00:03:26.110> pretty<00:03:26.440> good

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
wave bounce it has actually pretty good

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.780 
wave bounce it has actually pretty good
range<00:03:27.099> on<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.549> I<00:03:27.760> mean<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.769> PK<00:03:30.160> jump<00:03:30.489> lets

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
range on it I mean you the PK jump lets

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.990 
range on it I mean you the PK jump lets
you<00:03:30.940> hit<00:03:31.269> from<00:03:31.420> peak<00:03:31.630> with<00:03:31.870> PK<00:03:32.319> fire<00:03:33.000> from

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
you hit from peak with PK fire from

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.970 
you hit from peak with PK fire from
jumping<00:03:34.450> from<00:03:34.629> a<00:03:34.750> pretty<00:03:35.319> good<00:03:35.500> distance<00:03:35.560> away

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
jumping from a pretty good distance away

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.280 
jumping from a pretty good distance away
from<00:03:36.129> the<00:03:36.340> opponent<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:37.690> it's<00:03:37.930> pretty<00:03:38.079> hard

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
from the opponent and it's pretty hard

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.069 
from the opponent and it's pretty hard
to<00:03:38.379> do<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:39.670> gotta<00:03:40.319> do<00:03:41.319> a<00:03:41.349> PK<00:03:41.860> jump<00:03:42.420> by<00:03:43.420> holding

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
to do you gotta do a PK jump by holding

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.990 
to do you gotta do a PK jump by holding
forward<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.890> pressing<00:03:45.220> back<00:03:45.400> on<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.640> c-stick

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
forward and pressing back on the c-stick

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.280 
forward and pressing back on the c-stick
at<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.269> same<00:03:46.510> time<00:03:46.750> but<00:03:47.680> I've<00:03:47.950> gotten<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.030> down

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
at the same time but I've gotten it down

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.110 
at the same time but I've gotten it down
fairly<00:03:50.290> well<00:03:50.650> since<00:03:51.160> I've<00:03:51.340> recorded<00:03:51.730> this<00:03:51.910> man

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
fairly well since I've recorded this man

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.660 
fairly well since I've recorded this man
I<00:03:52.150> couldn't<00:03:52.569> do<00:03:52.870> it<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:53.290> good<00:03:54.010> amount<00:03:54.220> at<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.459> time

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
I couldn't do it a good amount at a time

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.250 
I couldn't do it a good amount at a time
a<00:03:54.940> little<00:03:55.299> practice<00:03:55.660> i'm<00:03:55.780> pretty<00:03:55.989> sure<00:03:56.079> you'll

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
a little practice i'm pretty sure you'll

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.750 
a little practice i'm pretty sure you'll
be<00:03:56.380> able<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.590> pull<00:03:56.739> this<00:03:56.769> off<00:03:57.040> pretty<00:03:57.310> often<00:03:57.519> as

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
be able to pull this off pretty often as

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.650 
be able to pull this off pretty often as
well<00:03:58.170> so<00:03:59.170> that's<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:02.010> yep

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
well so that's it yep

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.040 
well so that's it yep
