the slagged enemy and easily just take

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
the slagged enemy and easily just take
them<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.780> shot<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.560> tree

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
them out with one shot because the tree

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.530 
them out with one shot because the tree
caterer<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.340> definitely<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.329> one

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
caterer can definitely do that and one

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.210 
caterer can definitely do that and one
problem<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.619> weapon<00:01:35.070> is

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
problem that I do have this weapon is

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.249 
problem that I do have this weapon is
the<00:01:35.430> ammo<00:01:35.759> consumption<00:01:36.150> although<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.049> can

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the ammo consumption although you can

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.780 
the ammo consumption although you can
shoot<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.710> fast<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.250> pull<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> trigger

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
shoot as fast you can pull the trigger

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.630 
shoot as fast you can pull the trigger
it<00:01:39.060> does<00:01:39.299> consume<00:01:39.720> 3<00:01:40.079> ml<00:01:40.409> per<00:01:40.530> shot<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.979> my<00:01:41.400> case

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it does consume 3 ml per shot in my case

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.310 
it does consume 3 ml per shot in my case
I<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.820> shoot<00:01:42.119> three<00:01:42.360> times<00:01:42.570> before<00:01:42.840> reloading

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
I can shoot three times before reloading

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.840 
I can shoot three times before reloading
because<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> skill<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.340> siren<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
because I have a skill with siren that

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.179 
because I have a skill with siren that
increases<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.450> magazine<00:01:46.049> size<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.530> usually

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
increases my magazine size but usually

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.249 
increases my magazine size but usually
only<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.579> able<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.939> shoot<00:01:48.180> two<00:01:48.450> maybe<00:01:48.720> three<00:01:49.140> if

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
only be able to shoot two maybe three if

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.050 
only be able to shoot two maybe three if
you<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.530> skill<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.880> is

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
you have a skill like that so that is

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.120 
you have a skill like that so that is
the<00:01:51.180> triquetra<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> very<00:01:52.619> very<00:01:52.920> powerful

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the triquetra it is a very very powerful

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.069 
the triquetra it is a very very powerful
weapon<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.909> does<00:01:54.090> consume<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.600> ammo<00:01:54.840> pretty

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
weapon it does consume your ammo pretty

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.380 
weapon it does consume your ammo pretty
quickly<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.159> only<00:01:56.460> good<00:01:56.850> really

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
quickly and it's it's only good really

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.940 
quickly and it's it's only good really
when<00:01:57.540> you're<00:01:57.659> shooting<00:01:57.810> close<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.799> meeting

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
distance at least now I'm sure this next

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
best shotguns in the game now it's not

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.970 
best shotguns in the game now it's not
as<00:02:12.150> good<00:02:12.300> as

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
as good as

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.680 
as good as
used<00:02:13.159> to<00:02:13.310> be<00:02:13.430> when<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.790> bee<00:02:13.970> shield<00:02:14.269> was<00:02:14.450> at

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
used to be when the bee shield was at

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.570 
used to be when the bee shield was at
its<00:02:14.840> prime<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:15.409> it's<00:02:15.860> still<00:02:16.099> a<00:02:16.159> very<00:02:16.400> powerful

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
its prime but it's still a very powerful

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.160 
its prime but it's still a very powerful
weapon<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.269> it<00:02:17.420> definitely<00:02:17.810> makes<00:02:17.930> the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
weapon and it definitely makes the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.930 
weapon and it definitely makes the
countdown<00:02:18.590> now<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.040> guys<00:02:19.159> might<00:02:19.430> be<00:02:19.549> asking

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
countdown now you guys might be asking

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.369 
countdown now you guys might be asking
what<00:02:20.209> about<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.720> interface<00:02:21.110> or<00:02:21.290> the

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
what about the interface or the

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.830 
what about the interface or the
interface<00:02:21.560> er<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.340> serif<00:02:23.150> sibling<00:02:23.599> of<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
interface er is the serif sibling of the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.440 
interface er is the serif sibling of the
conference<00:02:24.470> hall<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.549> my<00:02:25.879> video<00:02:26.090> where<00:02:26.420> I

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
conference hall and in my video where I

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.330 
conference hall and in my video where I
compared<00:02:26.870> these<00:02:27.019> two<00:02:27.230> weapons<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.709> did<00:02:27.980> say<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
compared these two weapons I did say the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.280 
compared these two weapons I did say the
interface<00:02:28.700> er<00:02:28.879> was<00:02:29.030> better<00:02:29.269> but<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.959> I've

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
interface er was better but I have I've

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.199 
interface er was better but I have I've
changed<00:02:30.920> my<00:02:31.040> opinion<00:02:31.430> since<00:02:31.610> then<00:02:31.879> because

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
changed my opinion since then because

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.970 
changed my opinion since then because
the<00:02:32.750> thing<00:02:32.989> about<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.260> interface<00:02:33.620> er<00:02:33.799> is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
the thing about the interface er is

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.500 
the thing about the interface er is
which<00:02:34.489> is<00:02:34.640> different<00:02:34.940> from<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.150> conference

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
which is different from the conference

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.660 
which is different from the conference
call<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:36.080> consumes<00:02:36.470> two<00:02:36.739> ammo<00:02:36.920> per<00:02:37.160> shot<00:02:37.370> that

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
call it consumes two ammo per shot that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.180 
call it consumes two ammo per shot that
is<00:02:37.760> just<00:02:37.970> really<00:02:38.780> not<00:02:39.019> worth<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.799> slight

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
is just really not worth the slight

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.650 
is just really not worth the slight
amount<00:02:40.579> of<00:02:40.670> damage<00:02:41.000> difference<00:02:41.420> the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
amount of damage difference the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.030 
amount of damage difference the
interface<00:02:41.989> er<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.379> slightly<00:02:42.680> more<00:02:42.980> powerful

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
interface er is slightly more powerful

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.470 
interface er is slightly more powerful
than<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.610> conference<00:02:43.970> call<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:44.360> it's

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
than the conference call but it's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.479 
than the conference call but it's
definitely<00:02:44.720> not<00:02:45.049> worth<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.590> because<00:02:45.950> it

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
definitely not worth it because it

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.640 
definitely not worth it because it
consumes<00:02:47.180> two<00:02:47.450> ammo<00:02:47.629> Prashad<00:02:48.019> twice<00:02:48.319> as<00:02:48.500> much

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
consumes two ammo Prashad twice as much

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.800 
consumes two ammo Prashad twice as much
ammo<00:02:48.860> just<00:02:49.160> not<00:02:49.310> worth<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.910> my<00:02:49.940> opinion<00:02:50.060> so

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
ammo just not worth it in my opinion so

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.970 
ammo just not worth it in my opinion so
that's<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.170> conference<00:02:51.500> call<00:02:51.620> for<00:02:51.859> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
that's the conference call for the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.350 
that's the conference call for the
number<00:02:52.640> three<00:02:52.819> spot<00:02:52.940> on<00:02:53.180> my<00:02:53.269> list

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.820 

so<00:03:01.360> further<00:03:01.540> runner-up<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.080> puts<00:03:02.500> the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
so further runner-up I puts the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
of people may disagree with but in my

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.850 
of people may disagree with but in my
opinion<00:04:22.060> this<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.660> best<00:04:23.050> shotgun<00:04:23.680> in<00:04:23.770> the

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
opinion this is the best shotgun in the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.710 
opinion this is the best shotgun in the
game<00:04:24.040> which<00:04:24.610> is<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.940> teeth<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.390> terror

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
game which is the teeth of terror

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.900 
game which is the teeth of terror
amorphous<00:04:26.169> this<00:04:26.410> is<00:04:26.560> ridiculously<00:04:27.340> good<00:04:27.610> for

amorphous this is ridiculously good for
quite<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.390> few<00:04:28.600> reasons

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
quite a few reasons

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.690 
quite a few reasons
now<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:29.380> know<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.710> range<00:04:29.950> on<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:30.340> weapon

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
now I know the range on this weapon

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.219 
now I know the range on this weapon
isn't<00:04:30.850> that<00:04:31.090> good<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.540> accuracy<00:04:31.960> is<00:04:32.200> a

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
isn't that good and the accuracy is a

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.320 
isn't that good and the accuracy is a
bit<00:04:32.530> questionable<00:04:33.160> but<00:04:33.400> if<00:04:33.580> you're<00:04:33.729> close<00:04:34.150> to

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
bit questionable but if you're close to

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.780 
bit questionable but if you're close to
the<00:04:34.419> enemy<00:04:34.600> you<00:04:34.930> can<00:04:35.140> master<00:04:35.830> any<00:04:36.100> single

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
the enemy you can master any single

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.510 
the enemy you can master any single
normal<00:04:37.360> enemy<00:04:37.960> with<00:04:38.169> just<00:04:38.500> one<00:04:38.860> shot<00:04:39.160> if<00:04:39.400> you

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
normal enemy with just one shot if you

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.190 
normal enemy with just one shot if you
use<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.790> right<00:04:40.000> what<00:04:40.510> I<00:04:40.540> like<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.840> do<00:04:40.960> with<00:04:41.110> the

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
use the right what I like to do with the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.650 
use the right what I like to do with the
siren<00:04:41.590> is<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:41.979> hold<00:04:42.669> them<00:04:42.820> in<00:04:42.880> one<00:04:43.030> place<00:04:43.060> get

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
siren is just hold them in one place get

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.300 
siren is just hold them in one place get
up<00:04:43.810> close<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.410> just<00:04:44.650> take<00:04:44.800> them<00:04:44.890> out<00:04:45.070> with

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
up close and just take them out with

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.860 
up close and just take them out with
just<00:04:45.520> one<00:04:45.669> shot<00:04:45.940> it's<00:04:46.180> very<00:04:46.419> simple<00:04:46.750> to<00:04:46.840> use

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
just one shot it's very simple to use

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.690 
just one shot it's very simple to use
now<00:04:47.530> what<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.710> really<00:04:48.040> like<00:04:48.190> about<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.520> teeth

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
now what I really like about the teeth

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.060 
now what I really like about the teeth
the<00:04:48.850> Terra<00:04:49.030> morph<00:04:49.240> is<00:04:49.390> it<00:04:49.570> has<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:50.080> doesn't

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
the Terra morph is it has it doesn't

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.830 
the Terra morph is it has it doesn't
consume<00:04:51.370> much<00:04:51.580> ammo<00:04:51.820> at<00:04:52.000> all<00:04:52.150> because<00:04:52.390> it<00:04:52.660> cuts

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
consume much ammo at all because it cuts

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.050 
consume much ammo at all because it cuts
one<00:04:53.200> ammo<00:04:53.470> per<00:04:53.740> shot<00:04:53.979> and<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.580> clip<00:04:54.880> is

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
one ammo per shot and the clip is

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.240 
one ammo per shot and the clip is
humongous<00:04:55.810> like<00:04:56.050> it's<00:04:56.290> usually<00:04:56.470> around<00:04:56.740> 20<00:04:57.190> or

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
humongous like it's usually around 20 or

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.890 
humongous like it's usually around 20 or
something<00:04:57.430> that's<00:04:57.820> really<00:04:58.390> really<00:04:58.419> helpful

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
something that's really really helpful

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.600 
something that's really really helpful
so<00:04:59.050> that's<00:04:59.380> why<00:04:59.890> this<00:04:59.950> is<00:05:00.100> my<00:05:00.310> favorite

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
so that's why this is my favorite

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.950 
so that's why this is my favorite
shotgun<00:05:00.970> because<00:05:01.120> you<00:05:01.360> can<00:05:01.479> use<00:05:01.660> it<00:05:01.780> for<00:05:01.900> a

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
shotgun because you can use it for a

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.780 
shotgun because you can use it for a
long<00:05:02.110> time<00:05:02.320> without<00:05:02.440> stopping<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:03.250> it's<00:05:03.610> also

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
long time without stopping and it's also

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.460 
long time without stopping and it's also
extremely<00:05:04.330> powerful<00:05:04.840> especially<00:05:05.350> when

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
extremely powerful especially when

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.870 
extremely powerful especially when
you're<00:05:05.560> shooting<00:05:05.680> from<00:05:05.950> close<00:05:06.160> range<00:05:06.310> what's
