the top I'm going to click settings and
under<00:00:45.000> connections<00:00:45.480> we're<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> see

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
under connections we're going to see

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.520 
under connections we're going to see
Bluetooth<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.640> see<00:00:47.820> we've<00:00:47.969> got<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
Bluetooth you can see we've got the

that will send switch off we can then
tap<00:00:54.899> into<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.920> where<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.219> can

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
tap into here and this is where we can

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.270 
tap into here and this is where we can
manage<00:00:56.610> bluetooth<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.140> bit<00:00:58.320> more<00:00:58.530> detail<00:00:59.039> so

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
manage bluetooth in a bit more detail so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.389 
manage bluetooth in a bit more detail so
let's<00:00:59.910> switch<00:01:00.090> bluetooth<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:02.250> it's

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
let's switch bluetooth on so it's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.160 
let's switch bluetooth on so it's
turning<00:01:02.640> bluetooth<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:04.019> now

turning bluetooth on and it's now

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.190 
turning bluetooth on and it's now
scanning<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.549> other<00:01:05.700> devices<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.930> if

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
scanning for other devices as it was if

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.330 
scanning for other devices as it was if
we<00:01:08.030> switch<00:01:09.030> bluetooth<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:10.020> from<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.799> shortcut

cannot detect any other Bluetooth
devices<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.610> range<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> what<00:01:25.619> we're<00:01:25.740> going<00:01:25.860> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
devices in range so what we're going to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.880 
devices in range so what we're going to
do<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.610> we're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:28.700> make<00:01:29.700> another<00:01:30.329> device

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
do is we're going to make another device

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.230 
do is we're going to make another device
visible<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.990> scan<00:01:34.320> again<00:01:34.729> will<00:01:35.729> now<00:01:35.909> see

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
visible so if I scan again will now see

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.819 
visible so if I scan again will now see
that<00:01:36.479> we've<00:01:36.600> got<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> g2<00:01:37.530> visible<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:39.680> now<00:01:40.680> it's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that we've got a g2 visible to now it's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.800 
that we've got a g2 visible to now it's
a<00:01:40.890> connect<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.400> device<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:42.240> will<00:01:42.360> tap<00:01:42.630> on

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
a connect to that device you will tap on

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.510 
a connect to that device you will tap on
that<00:01:42.840> connection<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:43.979> ask<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.189> pair

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
that connection and it will ask to pair

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.560 
that connection and it will ask to pair
then<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> passkey<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:48.180> g2

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
then you get a passkey and on the g2

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.969 
then you get a passkey and on the g2
that<00:01:48.810> I've<00:01:48.899> got<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> shot<00:01:49.530> I've<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:49.829> been

that I've got out a shot I've now been

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.639 
that I've got out a shot I've now been
asked<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.670> pair<00:01:50.909> where<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.689> cancel<00:01:52.170> or<00:01:52.380> pair

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
asked to pair where I can cancel or pair

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.190 
asked to pair where I can cancel or pair
so<00:01:52.860> let's<00:01:53.040> cancel<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:54.270> now<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.020> two

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
so let's cancel that for now and the two

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.600 
so let's cancel that for now and the two
devices<00:01:55.470> will<00:01:55.860> not<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.189> able<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> connect

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
devices will not be able to connect

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.719 
devices will not be able to connect
let's<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.909> again<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.990> time<00:02:01.460> we<00:02:02.460> shall

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
let's do it again and this time we shall

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.230 
let's do it again and this time we shall
pair<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> two

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.630 

so<00:02:07.240> now<00:02:07.659> we've<00:02:07.869> paired<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.289> two<00:02:08.500> we<00:02:09.310> actually

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
so now we've paired the two we actually

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.850 
so now we've paired the two we actually
get<00:02:09.850> a<00:02:10.119> little<00:02:10.600> cog<00:02:10.899> icon<00:02:11.080> with<00:02:11.560> some<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.800> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
get a little cog icon with some of the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.890 
get a little cog icon with some of the
settings<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.550> depending<00:02:13.480> on<00:02:13.540> what<00:02:13.750> you're

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
settings and depending on what you're

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.420 
settings and depending on what you're
connecting<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.380> will<00:02:14.800> depend<00:02:15.069> on<00:02:15.190> what

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
connecting to will depend on what

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.430 
connecting to will depend on what
actions<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.239> so<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.959> best<00:02:17.140> we've<00:02:17.319> got

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
actions you have so the best we've got

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.370 
actions you have so the best we've got
here<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.920> use<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.520> GT<00:02:19.090> for<00:02:19.540> internet

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
here is to use the GT for internet

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.740 
here is to use the GT for internet
access<00:02:20.610> but<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.640> can<00:02:21.819> see<00:02:22.060> here<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.569> can

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
access but you can see here that I can

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.660 
access but you can see here that I can
rename<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.650> choose<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.340> something

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
rename it if I choose to something

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.540 
rename it if I choose to something
that's<00:02:24.760> more<00:02:24.970> suitable<00:02:25.360> for<00:02:25.600> me<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.989> remember

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
that's more suitable for me to remember

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.150 
that's more suitable for me to remember
or<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:27.580> can<00:02:27.940> unpair<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.410> forgets<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
or I can unpair it and that forgets the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.510 
or I can unpair it and that forgets the
g2<00:02:30.630> although<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.750> still<00:02:31.959> sees<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.560> on<00:02:32.709> have<00:02:33.370> to

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
g2 although it still sees it on have to

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.190 
g2 although it still sees it on have to
put<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:33.910> passkey<00:02:34.420> again<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.840> be<00:02:34.900> actually
