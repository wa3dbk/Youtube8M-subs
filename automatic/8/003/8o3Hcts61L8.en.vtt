00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.100
 I want to talk about one of the very 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.280
 beautiful group of ornamental plants 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.980
 rather decorative apple trees 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.380
 extremely diverse and not trees 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.779
 Rosaceae family who possess 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.419
 very wide color characteristics 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.310
 and is used not only for getting in 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.189
 beautiful and tasty fruits but also in 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.720
 as unusual and beautiful 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.180
 decorative tree as a rule 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.850
 decorative would not have a color formula 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.420
 anpin or weeping which is grafted 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.489
 on stamped and usually decorative 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.440
 food varieties do not have a bright color 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.920
 to lead 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.079
 always happens 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.440
 for example the most intense beginning 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.980
 summer and spring 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.699
 as well as beautiful decorative fine ones 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.930
 which possess quite pleasant which 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.780
 and home 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.810
 how to say a form that is an apple tree for 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.910
 receiving 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.890
 delicious fruit ornamental apple 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.440
 possesses the same economic 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.820
 Signs and exactly the same complex 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.070
 pests and diseases 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.900
 For example, here it is here on the decorative 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.040
 apple trees we can notice that she also 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.680
 amazed by aphids 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.750
 she may be amazed to start stay dew and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.760
 here we can see the specks 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.480
 who since childhood then defeat big 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.300
 similar lesions are due to 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.910
 cicadas humpback me 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.730
 it is an insect that does not cover the cycle 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.390
 there it is time cover gives the danger of these 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.180
 insects are caused by 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.250
 they suffer a viral disease 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.960
 which is practically unexplored therefore 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.340
 when green spots appear or 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.430
 the number of pages in coma which 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.960
 jumping lights 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.520
 should be carried out additionally 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.640
 insecticide-treated 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.120
 that is, we can say hard 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 decorative apple trees 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.780
 no pomp dome 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.430
 The movie is ringing pretty steady 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.610
 Immediately disappears when the first appears 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.130
 symptoms of damage 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.730
 one of the characteristic unlike the year 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.740
 to feed the apple tree, I would call 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.900
 a problem that arises with a stamp then 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.970
 there is this regrowth of some branches 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.640
 who need just in time 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.540
 delete and after deletion necessarily 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.450
 need to 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.150
 seal the wound with fungicides and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.700
 special mastics and soil conditions 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.800
 which are required for decorative 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.600
 apple trees and enough 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.670
 democratic that is like any 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.020
 the apple tree does not grow better on fertile 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.750
 heights can not stand 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.300
 a bit of heavy that is clay 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.550
 the soil is sufficiently moist 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.970
 dry sandy soil this plant 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.120
 and not that not before 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.540
 and grows better on more nutritious than fresh 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.540
 the soil
