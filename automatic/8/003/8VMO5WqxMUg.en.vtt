nothing much nothing happens to them is

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.600 
nothing much nothing happens to them is
Dan<00:02:28.250> by<00:02:28.370> face<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.650> now<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.950> may<00:02:31.070> face<00:02:31.340> one

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
Dan by face so now it's you may face one

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.550 
Dan by face so now it's you may face one
during<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.330> main<00:02:32.480> phase<00:02:32.720> 1<00:02:32.930> this<00:02:33.350> is<00:02:33.410> where

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
during the main phase 1 this is where

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.680 
during the main phase 1 this is where
you<00:02:33.770> do<00:02:33.950> stuff<00:02:34.250> like<00:02:34.750> summon<00:02:35.750> monsters<00:02:37.690> play

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
you do stuff like summon monsters play

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.070 
you do stuff like summon monsters play
spells<00:02:40.030> set<00:02:41.030> traps<00:02:41.680> things<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:44.080> know

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
spells set traps things like that I know

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.240 
spells set traps things like that I know
let's<00:02:45.500> say<00:02:45.800> it's<00:02:47.500> your<00:02:48.500> done<00:02:48.740> during<00:02:48.980> your<00:02:49.070> may

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
let's say it's your done during your may

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.370 
let's say it's your done during your may
face<00:02:49.460> bond<00:02:49.670> you're<00:02:50.450> out<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.840> too<00:02:50.990> many<00:02:51.140> faces

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
face bond you're out of too many faces

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.780 
face bond you're out of too many faces
but<00:02:51.710> we'll<00:02:51.800> get<00:02:51.950> to<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.070> in<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.460> couple

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
but we'll get to that in a couple

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.140 
but we'll get to that in a couple
minutes

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
minutes

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.900 
minutes
so<00:02:53.780> after<00:02:54.290> main<00:02:54.470> phase<00:02:54.680> one<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.550> battle

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
so after main phase one is the battle

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.570 
so after main phase one is the battle
fix<00:02:56.320> this<00:02:57.320> is<00:02:57.500> where<00:02:57.680> all<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.220> action<00:02:58.550> takes

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
fix this is where all the action takes

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.440 
fix this is where all the action takes
place<00:02:59.710> so<00:03:00.710> let's<00:03:01.400> say<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.610> have<00:03:01.910> by<00:03:02.060> Jeannette

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
place so let's say I have by Jeannette

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.630 
place so let's say I have by Jeannette
sardonyx<00:03:03.050> here<00:03:03.290> on<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.530> field<00:03:03.770> it's<00:03:04.430> my

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
sardonyx here on the field it's my

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.880 
sardonyx here on the field it's my
battle<00:03:04.970> phase<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.780> he's<00:03:05.960> ready<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.200> fight<00:03:06.440> that

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
battle phase so he's ready to fight that

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.890 
battle phase so he's ready to fight that
during<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.220> very<00:03:07.580> first<00:03:07.760> turn<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.720> duel

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
during the very first turn of the duel

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.190 
during the very first turn of the duel
you<00:03:09.800> there<00:03:10.490> is<00:03:10.700> no<00:03:11.030> battle<00:03:11.450> phase<00:03:11.600> because

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
you there is no battle phase because

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.450 
you there is no battle phase because
during<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.500> very<00:03:12.680> first<00:03:12.740> turn<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.190> duel

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
during the very first turn of the duel

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.860 
during the very first turn of the duel
if<00:03:13.940> you're<00:03:14.150> allowed<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.390> attack<00:03:14.720> your

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
if you're allowed to attack your

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.140 
if you're allowed to attack your
opponent<00:03:15.230> on<00:03:15.350> your<00:03:15.740> very<00:03:15.890> first<00:03:15.980> turn<00:03:16.490> that

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
opponent on your very first turn that

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.610 
opponent on your very first turn that
would<00:03:17.270> just<00:03:17.420> be<00:03:17.540> considered<00:03:17.960> really<00:03:18.170> cheap

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
would just be considered really cheap

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.030 
would just be considered really cheap
and<00:03:18.830> get<00:03:19.430> too<00:03:19.670> easy<00:03:19.880> of<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.120> head<00:03:20.270> start<00:03:20.540> so

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
and get too easy of a head start so

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.230 
and get too easy of a head start so
after<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.130> very<00:03:22.310> first<00:03:22.370> turn<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.850> duel

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
after the very first turn of the duel

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.730 
after the very first turn of the duel
that's<00:03:23.510> when<00:03:23.690> battle<00:03:23.960> phases<00:03:24.260> can<00:03:24.410> take<00:03:24.590> place

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
that's when battle phases can take place

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.800 
that's when battle phases can take place
and<00:03:25.240> now<00:03:26.740> so<00:03:27.740> let's<00:03:28.280> say<00:03:28.550> I'm<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:29.240> gen<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.540> start

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
and now so let's say I'm a gen I start

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.390 
and now so let's say I'm a gen I start
my<00:03:29.870> mix<00:03:30.050> on<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.290> field<00:03:30.500> it's<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:31.130> battle

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
my mix on the field it's the battle

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.220 
my mix on the field it's the battle
phase<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:32.090> he<00:03:32.150> said<00:03:32.300> if<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.510> he<00:03:32.660> just<00:03:32.870> declare

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
phase and he said if I he just declare

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.560 
phase and he said if I he just declare
that<00:03:33.620> he's<00:03:33.830> attacking<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.550> who<00:03:35.120> he<00:03:35.540> is

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
that he's attacking and who he is

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.170 
that he's attacking and who he is
attacking<00:03:36.370> after<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.520> is<00:03:37.730> your<00:03:37.850> main<00:03:37.970> phase

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
attacking after that is your main phase

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.120 
attacking after that is your main phase
2<00:03:38.420> this<00:03:38.690> is<00:03:38.870> where<00:03:39.020> you<00:03:39.110> can<00:03:39.290> play<00:03:39.650> spells<00:03:39.950> or

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
2 this is where you can play spells or

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.390 
2 this is where you can play spells or
set<00:03:40.340> traps<00:03:40.640> at<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.940> last<00:03:41.150> minute<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.400> after

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
set traps at the last minute so after

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.130 
set traps at the last minute so after
that<00:03:43.580> is<00:03:43.820> your<00:03:44.060> interface<00:03:44.330> then<00:03:44.930> into<00:03:45.110> your

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
that is your interface then into your

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.720 
that is your interface then into your
opponent's<00:03:45.620> turn<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:45.920> your<00:03:46.280> opponent<00:03:46.580> does

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
opponent's turn and your opponent does

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.860 
opponent's turn and your opponent does
the<00:03:47.150> same<00:03:47.360> thing

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
the same thing

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.070 
the same thing
draw<00:03:48.440> paste<00:03:48.709> phase<00:03:49.670> draws<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.209> card<00:03:50.420> say<00:03:50.930> my
