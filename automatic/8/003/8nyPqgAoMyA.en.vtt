reading the note on the inside of the
flaps<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:21.200> all<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.380> okay

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.390 
flaps I think it was see all right okay
apparently<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.820> number<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.540> let's<00:01:24.750> see<00:01:25.400> it

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
apparently it's number so let's see it

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.980 
apparently it's number so let's see it
is<00:01:26.549> sort<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.790> hard<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> show<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.840> we

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
is sort of hard to show you but we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.350 
is sort of hard to show you but we
actually<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.710> word<00:01:29.549> written<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.119> each

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
actually have a word written on each

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.140 
actually have a word written on each
side<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.680> numbered<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.430> first<00:01:32.790> word<00:01:32.970> is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
side and it's numbered so first word is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.630 
side and it's numbered so first word is
yog<00:01:33.920> which<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.100> Swedish<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.520> me<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.640> second

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
yog which is Swedish for me or I second

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.830 
yog which is Swedish for me or I second
flap<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:41.659> is<00:01:42.710> here<00:01:43.710> which<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.759> number<00:01:45.270> two<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
flap if is here which is number two and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.219 
flap if is here which is number two and
that's<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:47.100> bonus<00:01:47.610> which<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.180> envy<00:01:48.720> so

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
I'm guessing it's I and II and then

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.780 
I'm guessing it's I and II and then
third<00:01:52.200> flap<00:01:52.640> is<00:01:53.640> day<00:01:54.600> which<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.219> then

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
third flap is day which is you and then

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.080 
third flap is day which is you and then
for<00:01:57.090> flap<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.689> Oscar<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.950> basically<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.790> spells
