over<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.680> over<00:04:24.830> again<00:04:25.099> so<00:04:25.460> really<00:04:25.940> this<00:04:26.060> game

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
over and over again so really this game

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.020 
over and over again so really this game
doesn't<00:04:26.539> provide<00:04:27.020> much<00:04:27.250> diversity<00:04:28.250> it's<00:04:28.789> just

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
doesn't provide much diversity it's just

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.460
