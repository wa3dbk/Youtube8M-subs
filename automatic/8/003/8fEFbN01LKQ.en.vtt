which<00:00:37.500> wafers<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:38.070> jammed<00:00:38.340> up

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
which wafers are jammed up

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.880 
which wafers are jammed up
basically<00:00:39.899> I'm<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.140> rebuild<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.680> probably

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
basically I'm a rebuild they probably

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.580 
basically I'm a rebuild they probably
cut<00:00:41.129> another<00:00:41.340> key<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> back<00:00:42.809> within<00:00:43.200> specs

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
cut another key get it back within specs

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.260 
cut another key get it back within specs
and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.370> thing<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.730> when<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:44.969> when

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and then get this thing so when I'm when

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.540 
and then get this thing so when I'm when
I'm<00:00:45.360> done<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.989> should<00:00:46.170> be<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.550> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I'm done with this it should be like you

key should be no some I'll be back
shortly<00:00:53.550> whatever<00:00:54.090> they<00:00:54.210> repair

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.860 

okay<00:01:02.249> we<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.609> ignition<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.659> car

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
okay we have the ignition out the car

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.719 
okay we have the ignition out the car
have<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.259> full<00:01:04.470> second<00:01:04.799> apart<00:01:05.100> got<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
have a full second apart got the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.670 
have a full second apart got the
communicate<00:01:06.240> basically<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.290> looking<00:01:07.380> at<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
communicate basically I'm looking at the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.200 
communicate basically I'm looking at the
cylinder<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> basically<00:01:08.700> look<00:01:09.030> for

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
cylinder now what I basically look for

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.090 
cylinder now what I basically look for
is<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.420> look<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.630> some<00:01:09.960> warrant<00:01:10.439> when<00:01:10.649> we're

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
is I look for some warrant when we're

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.249 
is I look for some warrant when we're
and<00:01:11.310> tearing<00:01:11.640> their<00:01:11.759> wafers<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.509> see<00:01:13.080> these

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
and tearing their wafers you see these

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.830 
and tearing their wafers you see these
stacks<00:01:13.590> over<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.399> bad<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.689> end

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
stacks over here they all bad so I end

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.450 
stacks over here they all bad so I end
up<00:01:15.899> just<00:01:16.080> taking<00:01:16.320> them<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:16.649> out<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.070> put<00:01:17.130> new

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
up just taking them all out and put new

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.789 
up just taking them all out and put new
ones<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> also<00:01:19.020> look<00:01:19.380> at<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.680> these

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
ones in and what I also look at on these

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.550 
ones in and what I also look at on these
cylinders<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.390> holes<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> wafers

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
cylinders is the holes that the wafers

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.590 
cylinders is the holes that the wafers
go<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.070> need<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.570> perfect<00:01:24.570> so

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
go in and they need to be perfect so

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
go in and they need to be perfect so
they<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.960> slide<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.649> so<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.549> look<00:01:26.729> for

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
they can slide up and down so I look for

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.029 
they can slide up and down so I look for
wear<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.240> tear<00:01:27.420> inside<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> holes<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
wear and tear inside the holes I have a

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.770 
wear and tear inside the holes I have a
micrometer<00:01:29.490> I'll<00:01:29.850> measure<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.539> make<00:01:30.750> sure

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
micrometer I'll measure it out make sure

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.620 
micrometer I'll measure it out make sure
it's<00:01:31.049> pecked<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.710> make<00:01:32.700> sure<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.149> know<00:01:33.270> good

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it's pecked to make sure you know good

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.809 
it's pecked to make sure you know good
shape<00:01:33.899> before<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.289> reuse<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.460> basically<00:01:35.700> I'm

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
shape before I reuse it so basically I'm

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.149 
shape before I reuse it so basically I'm
a<00:01:35.909> rebuild<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.450> lock<00:01:36.740> get<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.830> back<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
a rebuild this lock get it back in the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.249 
a rebuild this lock get it back in the
car<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> now<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:38.819> I<00:01:39.060> had<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> cut<00:01:39.750> another<00:01:39.990> key

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
car and now I'm I had to cut another key

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.039 
car and now I'm I had to cut another key
because<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.640> other<00:01:41.640> key<00:01:41.819> uh<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:42.659> one<00:01:42.899> out

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
because the other key uh was one out

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
because the other key uh was one out
some<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.799> I'll<00:01:44.340> come<00:01:44.520> back<00:01:44.640> shortly<00:01:44.850> with
