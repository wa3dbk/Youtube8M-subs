00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.790
 you can use the command ensures 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:09.929
 to fill your forms the order 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.030
 ensures here lies endesa 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.339
 we will be able to initially type 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.109
 of pattern choose the pattern that we 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.710
 interests the trust of the three points 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.230
 you can choose your motive 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.779
 the scale of the pattern being simply 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.720
 the size of this pattern the long of this 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:33.060
 pattern compared to 0 0 and here we go 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.860
 choose the object or contour to fill 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.450
 we have two methods the first is from 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.740
 choose a point of order to click at 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.370
 inside a pattern to get in 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.530
 overview and we see the fall appear 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.280
 in this case it is fast because that 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.090
 must be big i'm going to do 0.1 for 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.490
 see and I see appear here no 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.330
 mobile of the fall the second method 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:05.880
 hatching will consist of selecting 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:08.860
 an object and to have it filled 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.100
 we can edit hatches by passing 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.830
 by modification and we have here modify the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.420
 motive of the swear select an insult 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.960
 and there we will be able to modify for the 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:27.700
 surgery at 05 leave too big if 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.630
 I raise stimulates me reasons 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:36.100
 select an insult i'm going to 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:40.659
 put at 0.05 to see the I'm getting a 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.940
 wall more interesting I resume my 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.830
 nokia swear here we have an order 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.409
 which is called irritated the properties that 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.250
 simply allows you to recover 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:57.070
 properties of an object to be able to the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:00.130
 put inside another object 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.290
 preview you see I got this 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.090
 look there to put it on this object 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.009
 there I enter I validate if I double 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.330
 click on a pace I access precisely to 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.420
 the insults palette 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.940
 and I have here if you notice well by 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.350
 unasured cochet default 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.450
 associative would mean everything 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.570
 simply that if I change its outline 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.570
 the hatching she will follow this outline the 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.140
 ja I double click on measure I also 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.950
 another possibility is that of 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.850
 choose the origin of match on origin 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:46.130
 specified i define my origin is it 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.590
 there I do ok do a simple test I 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.090
 will delete all the drawings we will get 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:58.040
 draw a rectangle 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:59.480
 an example these two senses out 100 to 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.610
 inside this rectangle 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.140
 we will put a more tile by 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.110
 example the choice of the reason 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.550
 I will take tiles so the 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.720
 net hockey pattern be points we go 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.700
 put it inside here preview it's 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.500
 too tight and chaff I'll do a 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.500
 scale a little bigger to see them 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.620
 and I'm doing ok machurat as origin here 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.660
 if I want to change the origin and the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.610
 put here I'm going double click on my 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:37.940
 ensures define the origin and I mean 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:42.019
 that my origin and saw it we saw 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.080
 well there ensures starts here I can 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:49.400
 also give a hand angle ensures so 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:53.890
 the red gn put at 30 Â° overview 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.890
 hand on goes well at 30 degrees
