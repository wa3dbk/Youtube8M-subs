00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.109
 well i'm grateful guys congratulations on 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.180
 Victory believe that the game was on 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.480
 counter courses or dolny for 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.130
 coaches well for probably the audience 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 liked a lot of goals so we are in front 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.690
 assorted team game very boris 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.170
 perfect ampere link they kept us 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.489
 they scored them again four goals 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.629
 so somewhere here is a little 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.300
 a little sediment stayed and so i would 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.750
 thank you guys for a good game 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.390
 survived and survived 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:55.789
 I want to congratulate a colleague with a victory 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:59.670
 I agree the game turned out were dolnye 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:04.470
 saw his new actions lost by 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.260
 bullet attacks on my mind point 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.119
 deservedly earned it somewhere probably 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.960
 if outrage would have earned two so 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.960
 today the game was equal 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.259
 Germany team and plays very well 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.930
 at home but on a visit not bad 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.680
 grant what is connected here when the year 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.509
 answer 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.030
 final can't say this much 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.890
 I donâ€™t know the reasons that after the game 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.579
 Russian team like dad of all 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.720
 only pit 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.990
 undecided it first we were 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.159
 great played with the lower Novgorod 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.409
 horsemen we play in that zone they 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.640
 came for quite a few so how 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.890
 would probably now the clamp protects these 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.770
 debts that can not be points on 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.320
 we are home at the game, we basically gave way 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.899
 only cisco completely give way well 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.500
 score on the board always say look at 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.330
 scoreboard which account 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.540
 to whom I will be one for you guys what are they 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.640
 gathered plays great one more question 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.940
 you second game away but at the same time 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.840
 Today forge at all game very so 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.959
 will be expensive hockey constantly 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.590
 crouch constant pressure constant 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.959
 run away is a good 3 planter spent in 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.850
 principle, only a month passed the championship and 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.980
 I believe that she herself is a young team in 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.040
 league so our success is only in the zone 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.810
 attack and that's how we you show times 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.550
 I went to the area I understand very bad 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.370
 while in our zone we will work on 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.900
 this much work remains to be done. 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.850
 positional defense therefore 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:47.350
 but I always say guys always need 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:50.850
 to seek a chance to miss not soon and that of gold 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.850
 from comment 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.820
