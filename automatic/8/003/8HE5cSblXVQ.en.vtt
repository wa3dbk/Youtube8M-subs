00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:17.700 

dot<00:05:10.360> C<00:05:11.259> sharp

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.240 

again<00:05:18.710> and<00:05:19.550> so<00:05:19.790> then<00:05:20.389> the<00:05:20.720> second<00:05:21.530> I<00:05:21.830> kind<00:05:22.190> of

again and so then the second I kind of

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.680 
again and so then the second I kind of
pre-chorus<00:05:22.669> where<00:05:22.940> we<00:05:23.060> go

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.120 

these<00:05:26.690> just<00:05:26.960> going<00:05:27.080> to<00:05:27.139> take<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.440> up<00:05:27.530> one<00:05:27.710> more

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.100 

he's<00:05:31.130> doing<00:05:31.370> four<00:05:31.640> and<00:05:31.790> four<00:05:32.060> and<00:05:32.300> then<00:05:33.050> six

and five

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.180 
and five
so<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.810> easiest<00:05:36.080> way<00:05:36.290> is<00:05:36.320> probably<00:05:36.470> to<00:05:36.920> do

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
so the easiest way is probably to do

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.510 
so the easiest way is probably to do
four<00:05:37.460> and<00:05:37.550> four<00:05:37.730> like<00:05:37.850> this

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.170 

and<00:05:41.180> then<00:05:41.930> that<00:05:42.169> leads<00:05:42.470> us<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.860> our<00:05:43.310> C<00:05:43.940> sharp

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
and then that leads us to our C sharp

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.640 
and then that leads us to our C sharp
minor<00:05:44.389> bridge<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:45.169> that's<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.740> only<00:05:45.979> chord

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650
