00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
you did a great job I think that I was

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.030 
you did a great job I think that I was
aware<00:03:42.650> of<00:03:43.630> who<00:03:44.630> was<00:03:44.810> better<00:03:45.080> than<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.799> I'm<00:03:45.950> not

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
aware of who was better than not I'm not

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.830 
aware of who was better than not I'm not
gonna<00:03:46.190> point<00:03:46.400> anybody<00:03:46.850> out<00:03:47.030> but<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.360> think<00:03:47.660> in

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
gonna point anybody out but I think in

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.780 
gonna point anybody out but I think in
this<00:03:47.989> kind<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.290> performance<00:03:48.799> I<00:03:48.950> can't<00:03:49.430> see

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
this kind of performance I can't see

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.670 
this kind of performance I can't see
that<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.150> shouldn't<00:03:50.630> see<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.470> think

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
that I shouldn't see that so I think

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.190 
that I shouldn't see that so I think
that<00:03:52.130> that's<00:03:52.370> where<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:52.819> have<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.299> focus<00:03:53.480> that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
that that's where you have to focus that

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.280 
that that's where you have to focus that
