for<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.030> five<00:01:57.240> years<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.869> believe<00:01:58.380> that's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
for what five years I believe that's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.910 
for what five years I believe that's
true<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.100> this<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.210> all<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.569> got<00:02:00.920> pretty

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
true and this is all we got pretty

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.940 
true and this is all we got pretty
disappointing<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.899> mean<00:02:03.899> they<00:02:04.740> would<00:02:04.920> have

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
disappointing I mean they would have

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.550 
disappointing I mean they would have
done<00:02:05.450> they<00:02:06.450> could<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.720> done<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.229> much<00:02:07.259> more

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
done they could have done so much more

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.900

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.279 
actually could work yeah I know
especially<00:06:39.030> when<00:06:39.389> you<00:06:39.449> consider<00:06:39.599> an<00:06:39.960> kirby

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
especially when you consider an kirby

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.409

superstar<00:06:40.680> was<00:06:41.070> like<00:06:41.250> more<00:06:41.490> of<00:06:41.520> a<00:06:41.639> grungy<00:06:42.150> feel

oh<00:06:42.690> yeah<00:06:43.169> but<00:06:43.860> this<00:06:44.039> works<00:06:44.400> and<00:06:44.820> and<00:06:45.360> then<00:06:46.110> I

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
oh yeah but this works and and then I

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.620 
oh yeah but this works and and then I
think<00:06:46.650> the<00:06:46.770> reason<00:06:47.280> why<00:06:47.699> a<00:06:47.729> lot<00:06:48.180> of<00:06:48.210> the<00:06:48.360> music

think the reason why a lot of the music

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.809 
think the reason why a lot of the music
was<00:06:48.990> so<00:06:49.169> awesome<00:06:49.380> was<00:06:49.770> because<00:06:50.130> they<00:06:50.610> had<00:06:50.639> a

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
was so awesome was because they had a

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.149 
was so awesome was because they had a
composer<00:06:51.300> from<00:06:51.599> Final<00:06:51.990> Fantasy<00:06:52.500> 7<00:06:52.710> in<00:06:52.979> there
