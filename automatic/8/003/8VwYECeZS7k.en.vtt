temperature<00:00:28.740> indicator<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.730> example<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
temperature indicator for example the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.870 
temperature indicator for example the
car<00:00:30.660> temp<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.500> can<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.800> now<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.989> 58<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.880> to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
car temp as you can see now is 58 and to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.549 
car temp as you can see now is 58 and to
the<00:00:36.030> overclock<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.899> use<00:00:37.079> two<00:00:37.380> methods

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the overclock you can use two methods

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.940 
the overclock you can use two methods
one<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.460> nvidia<00:00:39.180> normal<00:00:39.629> drives<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.620> Entune

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
one the nvidia normal drives the Entune

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.400 
one the nvidia normal drives the Entune
and<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:42.180> EVGA<00:00:43.170> precision<00:00:44.930> i'm<00:00:45.930> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.289> use

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and a EVGA precision i'm going to use

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.810 
and a EVGA precision i'm going to use
the<00:00:46.590> EVGA<00:00:46.829> precision<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:50.039> you're<00:00:50.550> going

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the EVGA precision so here you're going

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.610 
the EVGA precision so here you're going
to<00:00:50.940> put<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.480> core<00:00:51.840> clock<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:55.010> 555<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:57.079> you<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to put the core clock to 555 and you you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.979 
to put the core clock to 555 and you you
have<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.980> put<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> power<00:01:00.239> clock<00:01:00.539> together

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
have to put the power clock together

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.779 
have to put the power clock together
with<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> shutter<00:01:01.500> clock<00:01:01.800> don't<00:01:02.460> put<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
with the shutter clock don't put the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
with the shutter clock don't put the
shutter<00:01:03.000> clock<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.480> maximum<00:01:03.960> because<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.559> will

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
shutter clock in maximum because it will

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.700 
shutter clock in maximum because it will
burn<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.189> neck<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.750> memory<00:01:07.110> clock<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.560> can

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
burn your neck in memory clock you can

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.609 
burn your neck in memory clock you can
put<00:01:07.950> until<00:01:08.510> 110<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.930> hear<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> phones

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
put until 110 you can hear the phones

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.249 
put until 110 you can hear the phones
now<00:01:13.890> working<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.470> then<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.740> press<00:01:17.100> apply

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
now working and then just press apply

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.990 
now working and then just press apply
now<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> core<00:01:20.490> clock<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> each

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
now you see the core clock and each

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.999 
now you see the core clock and each
other<00:01:21.210> clock<00:01:21.540> low<00:01:21.869> because<00:01:22.170> i'm<00:01:22.619> not<00:01:22.770> running
