00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
hello YouTube and now the machine is now

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.169 
hello YouTube and now the machine is now
draining<00:00:04.830> out<00:00:05.629> from<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:07.280> SEC<00:00:08.280> as<00:00:08.519> fast<00:00:08.820> rinse

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
draining out from the SEC as fast rinse

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.810 
draining out from the SEC as fast rinse
I<00:00:09.480> missed<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.050> first<00:00:10.590> interim<00:00:10.920> spin<00:00:11.280> and

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
I missed the first interim spin and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.350 
I missed the first interim spin and
first<00:00:12.179> rinse<00:00:12.679> was<00:00:13.679> watching<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.040> TV<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.969> right

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
first rinse was watching a TV so right

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.080 
first rinse was watching a TV so right
but<00:00:16.049> it's<00:00:16.230> got<00:00:17.130> three<00:00:17.580> rinses<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:18.000> this

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
but it's got three rinses on this

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.240 
but it's got three rinses on this
program<00:00:18.270> now<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> still<00:00:19.470> look<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.680> bit<00:00:19.830> sad<00:00:20.010> see

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
program now I still look a bit sad see

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.160 
program now I still look a bit sad see
they're<00:00:20.460> actually<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.000> few<00:00:21.420> suds<00:00:21.750> because

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
they're actually a few suds because

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.990 
they're actually a few suds because
there's<00:00:22.769> more<00:00:23.070> subtle<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.609> wash<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
there's more subtle in the wash but I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700 
there's more subtle in the wash but I
think<00:00:24.269> might<00:00:24.930> happen<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.380> powered<00:00:25.619> I

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
think might happen it's a powered I

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.070 
think might happen it's a powered I
might<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:25.980> stuck<00:00:26.390> to<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.449> box<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
might have stuck to the box of it and

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.710 
might have stuck to the box of it and
then<00:00:28.199> rinsed<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> bit<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.800> unfortunately<00:00:29.720> which

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
then rinsed a bit in unfortunately which

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:47.810 
then rinsed a bit in unfortunately which
is<00:00:30.900> annoying

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.930 

alright<00:00:48.450> now<00:00:48.690> we're<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.960> spin<00:00:49.940> don't

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
alright now we're going to spin don't

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.640 
alright now we're going to spin don't
know<00:00:51.060> if<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.210> will<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.450> power<00:00:51.930> balance<00:00:52.470> on

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
know if it will be a power balance on

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.700 
know if it will be a power balance on
this<00:00:52.800> man<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.110> didn't<00:00:55.320> see<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> first

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
this man so as I didn't see the first

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.780 
this man so as I didn't see the first
one<00:00:55.950> I<00:00:58.010> think<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.100> will<00:00:59.190> speed<00:00:59.400> up<00:00:59.550> quite

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
one I think it will speed up quite

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.100 
one I think it will speed up quite
quickly<00:01:00.950> and<00:01:01.950> it's<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.280> got<00:01:02.690> 30<00:01:03.690> minutes<00:01:03.960> left

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
quickly and it's now got 30 minutes left

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:14.560 
quickly and it's now got 30 minutes left
to<00:01:04.350> go

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.110 

not<00:01:15.350> everyone<00:01:15.740> starts<00:01:16.010> look<00:01:16.190> at<00:01:16.340> all

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:29.320 

nah<00:01:20.780> doesn't<00:01:21.110> look<00:01:21.440> it's<00:01:21.590> going<00:01:21.800> to

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.400 

no<00:01:29.960> it's<00:01:30.170> not<00:01:30.230> once<00:01:30.470> does<00:01:30.620> not<00:01:32.080> as<00:01:33.080> you<00:01:33.200> can<00:01:33.260> see

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
no it's not once does not as you can see

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:43.770 
no it's not once does not as you can see
those<00:01:33.620> been<00:01:34.010> up<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.220> lot<00:01:34.370> quicker

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.719 

I<00:01:43.869> don't<00:01:44.530> know<00:01:44.650> if<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.799> first<00:01:45.010> spin<00:01:45.520> with<00:01:45.700> a

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
I don't know if the first spin with a

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.789 
I don't know if the first spin with a
third<00:01:46.030> slot<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.570> it's<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.780> shame<00:01:47.020> would<00:01:47.710> have

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
third slot so it's a shame would have

00:01:47.799 --> 00:02:43.260 
third slot so it's a shame would have
been<00:01:47.890> good<00:01:48.040> to<00:01:48.159> get<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.369> on<00:01:48.640> but<00:01:49.229> never<00:01:50.229> mind

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.120 

yes<00:02:43.930> quite<00:02:44.860> well<00:02:45.130> balanced<00:02:45.610> really<00:02:47.130> nice

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
yes quite well balanced really nice

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.740 
yes quite well balanced really nice
laying<00:02:48.370> down<00:02:48.730> all<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:52.080> second<00:02:53.080> rinse<00:02:54.630> take<00:02:55.630> a

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
laying down all the second rinse take a

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:15.440 
laying down all the second rinse take a
little<00:02:55.900> bit<00:02:56.020> foam<00:02:56.290> online

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.539 

yeah<00:03:16.450> well<00:03:16.690> water<00:03:17.260> will<00:03:17.500> now<00:03:17.620> flowing<00:03:17.980> down

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
yeah well water will now flowing down

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:25.500 
yeah well water will now flowing down
the<00:03:18.730> door<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.690> it's<00:03:19.840> now<00:03:21.989> swapping<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.730> box<00:03:24.730> to

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
the door so it's now swapping the box to

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.420 
the door so it's now swapping the box to
the<00:03:25.840> fill<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:28.090> urgent<00:03:28.900> draw<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.370> I

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
the fill to that is urgent draw so I

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.979 
the fill to that is urgent draw so I
think<00:03:30.549> at<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.760> moment<00:03:30.790> last<00:03:31.329> time<00:03:31.599> it<00:03:31.780> filled

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
think at the moment last time it filled

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.319 
think at the moment last time it filled
up<00:03:32.170> it<00:03:33.159> came<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.900> through<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:34.959> bottom<00:03:36.329> when

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
up it came in through the bottom when

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.410 
up it came in through the bottom when
the<00:03:37.420> water<00:03:37.629> level<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.370> really<00:03:39.370> quite<00:03:39.670> quite

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
the water level is really quite quite

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.630 
the water level is really quite quite
low<00:03:40.659> on<00:03:40.840> cotton<00:03:41.680> rinses<00:03:42.069> especially<00:03:42.459> with<00:03:42.549> the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
low on cotton rinses especially with the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.809 
low on cotton rinses especially with the
reduced<00:03:42.849> time<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:44.079> not<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.290> low<00:03:44.790> with<00:03:45.790> the

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
reduced time it's not that low with the

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.750 
reduced time it's not that low with the
time<00:03:46.090> is<00:03:46.209> reduced<00:03:46.450> but<00:03:46.780> because<00:03:47.670> there's<00:03:48.670> not

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
time is reduced but because there's not

00:03:48.760 --> 00:04:15.580 
time is reduced but because there's not
much<00:03:48.940> in<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.150> will<00:03:49.480> be<00:03:49.510> very<00:03:49.720> low

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.930 

as<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.769> can<00:04:16.829> see<00:04:16.980> very<00:04:17.579> short<00:04:18.030> film<00:04:19.400> very<00:04:20.400> low

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
as you can see very short film very low

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:39.280 
as you can see very short film very low
water<00:04:21.209> level

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.900 

but<00:04:40.290> I'm<00:04:40.500> gonna<00:04:40.650> stop<00:04:40.920> filming<00:04:41.280> now<00:04:41.460> go<00:04:41.790> back
