my<00:00:51.710> reason<00:00:52.190> that<00:00:52.280> I<00:00:52.340> like<00:00:52.580> to<00:00:52.670> think<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:53.000> that

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
my reason that I like to think is that

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
my reason that I like to think is that
in<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:54.290> mid<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.190> late<00:00:55.340> 60s<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.850> 70s<00:00:56.059> people

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
in the mid to late 60s and 70s people

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.869 
in the mid to late 60s and 70s people
really<00:00:57.559> started<00:00:57.830> rebelling<00:00:58.100> against<00:00:58.610> what

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
really started rebelling against what

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.610 
really started rebelling against what
their<00:00:59.059> parents<00:00:59.480> were<00:00:59.629> doing<00:01:00.050> they<00:01:00.379> didn't

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
their parents were doing they didn't

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.649 
their parents were doing they didn't
want<00:01:00.860> to<00:01:01.100> look<00:01:01.339> like<00:01:01.790> their<00:01:02.030> father<00:01:02.269> and<00:01:02.600> the

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
want to look like their father and the

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.390 
want to look like their father and the
normal<00:01:02.930> business<00:01:03.080> attire<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:04.159> I<00:01:04.220> think

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
normal business attire and I think

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.950 
normal business attire and I think
that's<00:01:04.550> finally<00:01:04.879> coming<00:01:05.120> full<00:01:05.180> circle<00:01:05.540> where

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
that's finally coming full circle where

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.469 
that's finally coming full circle where
my<00:01:06.770> generation<00:01:07.340> now<00:01:07.520> is<00:01:07.670> rebelling<00:01:07.970> against

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
my generation now is rebelling against

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.170 
my generation now is rebelling against
the<00:01:08.600> casual<00:01:09.140> look<00:01:09.170> of<00:01:09.710> their<00:01:10.310> parents<00:01:10.880> then

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
the casual look of their parents then

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.790 
the casual look of their parents then
most<00:01:11.630> of<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.870> hats<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:12.229> we<00:01:12.320> see<00:01:12.560> in<00:01:12.680> the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
most of the hats that we see in the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.920 
most of the hats that we see in the
market<00:01:13.190> are<00:01:13.490> an<00:01:13.790> impersonation<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.750> hat

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930
