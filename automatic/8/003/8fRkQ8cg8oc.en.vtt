00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:05.860
 today we will speak only the basic principle of the black inkjet cartridges 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.920
 the cartridge closely resembles the electrical sector 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.689
 however a process 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:14.809
 different or 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.809
 the printer hand on a signal through these points 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.249
 A heating is done. 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.749
 in a certain point these the pine cone 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:25.929
 silver 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.789
 which mirrors ink on paper 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.789
 Wrong and pressure 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.310
 now let's see a cartridge disassembled cover lies 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.970
 Let's take a look at what's inside. 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.540
 removing the cover 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.920
 we want a sponge these poor with saulo by air 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.590
 that lilo of the ink inside the cartridge or 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.800
 if there was no sponge 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.310
 the tim tamai 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.920
 is leaking 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.920
 taking off that sponge 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.080
 there is a kind of a minivan 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.300
 today's function 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.300
 recover pensive rp 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 on the surface of that part 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.460
 beer in the hand of the sign 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.500
 the ink to be 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.740
 in each forum I am waiting for the warming of this pole to then the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.380
 getafe 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.630
 with the botafogo proposal 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.750
 when you regret 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.040
 and you realize that you are risking 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.040
 you immediately have era for repression why 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.180
 because that part starting to grow 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.950
 and in the absence of ink 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950
 class begins to close the choir 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.480
 making the cut in the stages later 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.180
 when it's closed 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.600
 the heating 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 will cause the burning of this feat in a teaser in the cartridge 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.150
 thus improving the recharge 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.810
 it is when it is 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.339
 another very important detail 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.169
 if you look for 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.299
 not working in the way that communicated to school 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.979
 because I force myself 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:21.099
 after that there ink 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.249
 causing the burning of the trinity site are so your body 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:31.879
 later we will see how to recharge these cancers 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:33.349
 see you later
