that<00:00:31.800> shot<00:00:32.040> should<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.399> hit<00:00:32.550> him<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.910> I

realized<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.170> he<00:00:34.260> had<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.410> shotgun<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.130> I

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
realized that he had a shotgun so I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.270 
realized that he had a shotgun so I
stayed<00:00:35.579> away<00:00:35.790> from<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.059> window<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.630> just

stayed away from that window and just
double<00:00:38.280> backed<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.969> building<00:00:39.329> and

double backed out of the building and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.959 
double backed out of the building and
got<00:00:39.840> him<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> c4<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
got him with the c4 and I do that a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.400 
got him with the c4 and I do that a
number<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.300> times<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.410> game<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:45.140> engage<00:00:46.140> in

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
number of times in this game I engage in

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.260 
number of times in this game I engage in
what<00:00:46.559> i<00:00:46.590> like<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.890> call<00:00:46.920> indirect<00:00:47.730> warfare

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
what i like to call indirect warfare

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.180 
what i like to call indirect warfare
which<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.780> where<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.440> know<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.620> can't<00:00:50.010> see

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
which is where you know you can't see

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.360 
which is where you know you can't see
your<00:00:50.340> enemy<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:50.940> can't<00:00:51.180> see<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.629> but

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
your enemy and they can't see you but

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.979 
your enemy and they can't see you but
you<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.579> capable<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.149> taking<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.690> via

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
you are capable of taking them out via

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.459 
you are capable of taking them out via
c4<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:55.949> other<00:00:56.190> means<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.809> good<00:00:58.079> tactic

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
c4 or other means and it's a good tactic

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
c4 or other means and it's a good tactic
just<00:00:58.680> because<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> keeps<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.699> out<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.850> harm's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
just because it keeps you out of harm's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.640 
just because it keeps you out of harm's
way<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:01.199> enemy<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.739> totally<00:01:02.640> screwed

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
way but your enemy is totally screwed

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.840 
way but your enemy is totally screwed
here<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.739> get<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> nice<00:01:05.280> little<00:01:05.700> no<00:01:06.060> scope<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.850> I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
here I get a nice little no scope and I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
here I get a nice little no scope and I
was<00:01:09.450> missing<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.810> number<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.140> shots<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.560> game

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.490 
was missing a number of shots this game
and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.340> realized<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.479> that's<00:01:12.510> important

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and I realized that and that's important

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.270 
and I realized that and that's important
for<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.010> guys<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.610> kind<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:16.130> notice<00:01:17.130> about

yourselves<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:17.970> you're<00:01:18.090> not<00:01:18.240> making<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
yourselves when you're not making the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.929 
yourselves when you're not making the
shots<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.409> usually<00:01:19.560> make<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.670> got<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
shots that you usually make you got to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.310 
shots that you usually make you got to
adjust<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.299> play<00:01:21.509> style<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.930> can't<00:01:22.110> just

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
adjust your play style you can't just

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.230

keep<00:01:22.530> barreling<00:01:23.100> through<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.640> game<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
keep barreling through the game and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
keep barreling through the game and
think<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.680> miraculously<00:01:26.490> you're

you guys know what the c-4 range in this
game<00:03:48.760> is<00:03:48.970> if<00:03:49.180> there<00:03:49.389> is<00:03:49.540> one<00:03:49.810> like<00:03:50.200> a<00:03:50.230> max<00:03:50.530> range

at<00:03:51.190> which<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.489> can<00:03:51.609> detonate<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:52.120> c4<00:03:52.319> let<00:03:53.319> me

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
at which you can detonate the c4 let me

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.870 
at which you can detonate the c4 let me
know<00:03:53.530> in<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.650> comments<00:03:54.099> because<00:03:54.280> I've<00:03:54.730> never

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
know in the comments because I've never

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.140 
know in the comments because I've never
run<00:03:55.060> into<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.419> problem<00:03:55.480> before<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:57.519> it<00:03:58.060> was

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
run into that problem before and it was

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.699 
run into that problem before and it was
pretty<00:03:58.299> frustrating<00:03:58.510> because<00:03:59.079> I<00:03:59.349> knew<00:03:59.530> that

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
pretty frustrating because I knew that

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:00.900 
pretty frustrating because I knew that
the<00:03:59.799> enemies<00:04:00.130> were<00:04:00.340> right<00:04:00.579> at<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:00.849> corner

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
the enemies were right at that corner

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.809 
the enemies were right at that corner
and<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.510> probably<00:04:01.750> could<00:04:02.079> have<00:04:02.109> gotten<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:03.790> of

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
and I probably could have gotten one of

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.449 
and I probably could have gotten one of
them<00:04:04.150> or<00:04:04.419> at<00:04:04.510> least<00:04:04.919> kill<00:04:05.919> assists<00:04:06.280> or

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
them or at least kill assists or

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.309 
them or at least kill assists or
something<00:04:06.819> but<00:04:07.209> yeah<00:04:07.959> anyhoo<00:04:09.959> right<00:04:10.959> after

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
something but yeah anyhoo right after

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.930 
something but yeah anyhoo right after

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
I looked at the scoreboard right when i

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.659 
I looked at the scoreboard right when i

last game but all the other squads were
completely<00:04:35.949> empty<00:04:36.310> it<00:04:36.400> was<00:04:36.490> kind<00:04:36.669> of<00:04:36.699> funny

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
and here I see this guy with my motion

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.249 
and here I see this guy with my motion
sensor<00:04:39.699> and<00:04:39.819> gets<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.120> no<00:04:41.080> scope<00:04:41.580> um<00:04:42.580> I<00:04:43.259> was

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
sensor and gets the no scope um I was

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.170 
sensor and gets the no scope um I was
hoping<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.590> get<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.710> flawless<00:04:44.919> game<00:04:45.370> this<00:04:45.909> game

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
hoping to get a flawless game this game

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.909 
hoping to get a flawless game this game
but<00:04:46.599> it<00:04:46.780> didn't<00:04:47.020> end<00:04:47.110> up<00:04:47.259> happening<00:04:47.289> so<00:04:47.800> that's

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
but it didn't end up happening so that's

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.890 
but it didn't end up happening so that's
unfortunate<00:04:48.280> but<00:04:48.699> hopefully<00:04:49.449> one<00:04:49.599> day<00:04:49.629> I'll

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
unfortunate but hopefully one day I'll

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.040 
unfortunate but hopefully one day I'll
go<00:04:50.050> flawless<00:04:50.819> which<00:04:51.819> i<00:04:52.270> think<00:04:52.449> is<00:04:52.690> kind<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:52.960> a

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
go flawless which i think is kind of a

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.580 
go flawless which i think is kind of a
rarity<00:04:53.500> in<00:04:53.530> this<00:04:53.680> game<00:04:54.039> but<00:04:54.310> anywho<00:04:55.590> somebody

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
rarity in this game but anywho somebody

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.980 
rarity in this game but anywho somebody
was<00:04:56.740> in<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:56.949> tank<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.430> could<00:04:57.610> hear<00:04:57.879> them<00:04:58.090> but

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
was in that tank I could hear them but

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.450 
was in that tank I could hear them but
they<00:04:59.169> weren't<00:04:59.319> really<00:04:59.590> very<00:04:59.889> active<00:05:00.370> they

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
they weren't really very active they

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.950 
they weren't really very active they
weren't<00:05:00.669> firing<00:05:00.909> the<00:05:01.150> guns<00:05:01.330> or<00:05:01.509> anything<00:05:01.539> so<00:05:01.930> I

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
weren't firing the guns or anything so I

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.439 
weren't firing the guns or anything so I
know<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.169> wasn't<00:05:02.469> in<00:05:02.710> too<00:05:03.009> much<00:05:03.190> danger<00:05:03.460> but<00:05:04.419> I

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
know I wasn't in too much danger but I

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.459 
know I wasn't in too much danger but I
still<00:05:04.719> wanted<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:05.020> stay<00:05:05.460> out<00:05:06.460> of<00:05:06.520> sight<00:05:06.849> and

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
still wanted to stay out of sight and

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.219 
still wanted to stay out of sight and
using<00:05:08.469> the<00:05:08.620> technique<00:05:09.250> which<00:05:10.240> i<00:05:10.599> did<00:05:11.020> a<00:05:11.050> video

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
using the technique which i did a video

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.439 
using the technique which i did a video
on<00:05:11.409> it<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:12.009> sea<00:05:12.340> for<00:05:12.550> throwing<00:05:12.849> technique<00:05:13.270> it

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
on it the sea for throwing technique it

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.909 
on it the sea for throwing technique it
actually<00:05:13.750> extends<00:05:14.080> your<00:05:14.169> range<00:05:14.500> pretty

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
actually extends your range pretty

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.800 
actually extends your range pretty
dramatically<00:05:15.520> I<00:05:15.789> was<00:05:16.090> able<00:05:16.210> to<00:05:16.389> take<00:05:16.539> out<00:05:16.659> that

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
dramatically I was able to take out that

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.529 
dramatically I was able to take out that
tank<00:05:17.159> from<00:05:18.159> behind<00:05:18.430> cover<00:05:18.759> and<00:05:19.000> without<00:05:19.180> the

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
tank from behind cover and without the

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.570 
tank from behind cover and without the
guy<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:20.020> tank<00:05:20.229> tank<00:05:20.830> even<00:05:21.009> knowing<00:05:21.400> I<00:05:21.460> was

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
guy in the tank tank even knowing I was

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.869 
guy in the tank tank even knowing I was
there<00:05:21.789> and<00:05:22.830> right<00:05:23.830> there<00:05:23.860> i<00:05:24.039> saw<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.400> ammo

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
there and right there i saw the ammo

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.890 
there and right there i saw the ammo
pack<00:05:25.680> icon<00:05:26.680> showing<00:05:27.250> through<00:05:27.669> the<00:05:27.900> ceiling

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
pack icon showing through the ceiling

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.719 
pack icon showing through the ceiling
and<00:05:29.050> i<00:05:29.590> figured<00:05:29.919> that<00:05:29.949> someone<00:05:30.310> was<00:05:30.460> up<00:05:30.610> on

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
and i figured that someone was up on

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.580 
and i figured that someone was up on
that<00:05:30.849> second<00:05:31.240> floor<00:05:31.419> so<00:05:31.630> I<00:05:31.659> crouched<00:05:31.990> down<00:05:32.169> and

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
that second floor so I crouched down and

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.559 
that second floor so I crouched down and
stayed<00:05:32.860> a<00:05:32.889> little<00:05:33.099> bit<00:05:33.279> quieter<00:05:33.789> than<00:05:34.419> I

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
stayed a little bit quieter than I

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.050 
stayed a little bit quieter than I
otherwise<00:05:34.690> would<00:05:35.289> have<00:05:35.319> and<00:05:36.039> I<00:05:36.669> got<00:05:36.849> the<00:05:36.940> no

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
otherwise would have and I got the no

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.830 
otherwise would have and I got the no
scope<00:05:37.330> there<00:05:37.539> as<00:05:37.630> well<00:05:39.300> but<00:05:40.300> yeah<00:05:40.479> so<00:05:40.719> this

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
scope there as well but yeah so this

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.379 
scope there as well but yeah so this
game<00:05:41.080> I<00:05:41.110> was<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.620> little<00:05:42.610> bit<00:05:42.729> more<00:05:42.849> cautious

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
game I was a little bit more cautious

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.180

for montage clips i play like this but

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.589 
for montage clips i play like this but
once<00:05:51.460> I<00:05:51.580> realized<00:05:51.789> that<00:05:52.090> I<00:05:52.210> was<00:05:52.330> having<00:05:52.539> a

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
once I realized that I was having a

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.149 
once I realized that I was having a
really<00:05:52.719> good<00:05:52.930> game<00:05:53.110> and<00:05:53.169> I<00:05:53.440> was<00:05:53.560> on<00:05:53.620> long<00:05:53.860> kill

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
really good game and I was on long kill

really good game and I was on long kill
streak<00:05:54.460> I<00:05:54.930> really<00:05:55.930> wanted<00:05:56.139> to<00:05:56.229> go<00:05:56.319> flawless

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
streak I really wanted to go flawless

streak I really wanted to go flawless
and<00:05:56.889> so<00:05:57.639> I<00:05:57.669> got<00:05:57.879> a<00:05:57.909> little<00:05:58.029> bit<00:05:58.240> more<00:05:58.360> cautious

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
and so I got a little bit more cautious

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.100
