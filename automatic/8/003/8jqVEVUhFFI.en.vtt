tutorial so we a bit more of modeling
I'm<00:00:12.080> going<00:00:12.410> to<00:00:12.469> show<00:00:12.620> you<00:00:12.680> how<00:00:12.769> I<00:00:12.980> painted<00:00:13.400> up

I'm going to show you how I painted up
these<00:00:13.670> for<00:00:14.630> Tiki<00:00:14.839> craters<00:00:15.759> basically<00:00:16.759> i<00:00:16.790> added

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
these for Tiki craters basically i added

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.929 
these for Tiki craters basically i added
a<00:00:17.210> base<00:00:17.410> texture<00:00:18.410> on<00:00:18.619> here<00:00:18.830> and<00:00:19.009> nothing<00:00:19.490> too

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
a base texture on here and nothing too

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.730 
a base texture on here and nothing too
fancy<00:00:20.480> but<00:00:20.689> just<00:00:21.020> going<00:00:21.169> to<00:00:21.230> show<00:00:21.529> you<00:00:21.619> exactly

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
how i did it so first thing i did was i

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.250 
how i did it so first thing i did was i
lay<00:00:23.930> these<00:00:24.109> out<00:00:24.230> on<00:00:24.439> some<00:00:25.160> MDF<00:00:25.880> here<00:00:26.260> traced

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
lay these out on some MDF here traced

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.660 
lay these out on some MDF here traced
around<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:27.680> outside<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.010> that<00:00:28.160> solid<00:00:28.519> line

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
around the outside and that solid line

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.519 
around the outside and that solid line
and<00:00:28.910> then<00:00:29.060> kind<00:00:29.150> of<00:00:29.240> went<00:00:29.420> around<00:00:29.599> with<00:00:30.500> a

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
and then kind of went around with a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.049 
and then kind of went around with a
permit<00:00:30.859> Marco<00:00:31.099> did<00:00:31.220> a<00:00:31.310> dotted<00:00:31.609> line<00:00:31.640> that's

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
permit Marco did a dotted line that's

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.299 
permit Marco did a dotted line that's
getting<00:00:32.269> my<00:00:32.449> guide<00:00:32.660> for<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.650> cutting<00:00:33.949> the

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
getting my guide for the cutting the

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.560 
getting my guide for the cutting the
ideas<00:00:34.550> i<00:00:34.640> want<00:00:34.850> a<00:00:34.910> little<00:00:35.120> bit<00:00:35.239> of<00:00:35.269> room<00:00:35.480> around

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
ideas i want a little bit of room around

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.639 
ideas i want a little bit of room around
there<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.080> i<00:00:36.110> can<00:00:36.400> do<00:00:37.400> a<00:00:37.870> scenery<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.140> as<00:00:39.500> the

guys go stand on the edge so there's a

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.819 
guys go stand on the edge so there's a
rough<00:00:42.559> cut<00:00:42.770> with<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:42.950> jigsaw<00:00:43.960> rips<00:00:44.960> apart<00:00:45.320> but

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
rough cut with a jigsaw rips apart but

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.119 
rough cut with a jigsaw rips apart but

trying<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.270> get<00:00:59.359> that<00:00:59.510> basically<00:01:00.260> I'm<00:01:00.649> going

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
trying to get that basically I'm going

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.670 
trying to get that basically I'm going
to<00:01:00.920> just<00:01:01.039> get<00:01:01.370> rid<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:01.579> all<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:01.789> jagged<00:01:02.449> edge

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
to just get rid of all that jagged edge

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.229 
to just get rid of all that jagged edge
so<00:01:03.680> here<00:01:03.829> you<00:01:03.949> go<00:01:03.980> that's<00:01:04.309> what<00:01:04.940> I<00:01:04.970> ended<00:01:05.149> up

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
so here you go that's what I ended up

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.660 
so here you go that's what I ended up
with<00:01:05.300> I've<00:01:05.630> simple<00:01:06.110> design<00:01:06.500> exactly<00:01:06.860> but<00:01:07.610> I

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
with I've simple design exactly but I

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.340 
with I've simple design exactly but I
tried<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:07.940> round<00:01:08.149> off<00:01:08.360> these<00:01:08.630> these<00:01:08.930> corners<00:01:09.320> a

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
tried to round off these these corners a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.230 
tried to round off these these corners a
bit<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.710> round<00:01:10.369> everything<00:01:10.700> off<00:01:10.819> so<00:01:11.000> with

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
bit and round everything off so with

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.029 
bit and round everything off so with
that<00:01:11.360> kind<00:01:11.720> of<00:01:11.750> smooths<00:01:12.080> everything<00:01:12.200> out<00:01:12.500> some

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
that kind of smooths everything out some

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.100 
that kind of smooths everything out some
areas<00:01:13.310> are<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.459> bit<00:01:13.580> closer<00:01:13.849> than<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.330> wanted

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.080 

ended<00:01:17.620> up<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:20.110> what<00:01:20.620> I<00:01:20.650> hear<00:01:21.550> it's<00:01:21.700> hard<00:01:22.000> to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
ended up so what I hear it's hard to

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.150 
ended up so what I hear it's hard to
tell<00:01:22.330> is<00:01:22.570> there's<00:01:22.780> actually<00:01:22.930> some<00:01:23.500> gorilla

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
tell is there's actually some gorilla

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.500 
tell is there's actually some gorilla
glue<00:01:24.490> inside<00:01:25.480> there<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:27.490> gorilla<00:01:27.850> glue<00:01:28.150> is

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
glue inside there now gorilla glue is

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.940 
glue inside there now gorilla glue is
kind<00:01:28.750> of<00:01:28.810> like<00:01:28.870> a<00:01:28.930> contact<00:01:29.440> cement<00:01:29.590> but<00:01:29.890> it

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
kind of like a contact cement but it

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.340 
kind of like a contact cement but it
foams<00:01:30.250> up<00:01:30.490> and<00:01:30.880> here<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:31.870> can<00:01:31.930> see<00:01:32.110> a<00:01:32.140> bit<00:01:32.200> of

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
foams up and here you can see a bit of

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.040 
foams up and here you can see a bit of
foaming<00:01:33.070> action<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.240> what<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.420> did<00:01:34.540> is<00:01:34.750> I

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
foaming action and so what I did is I

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.600 
foaming action and so what I did is I
went<00:01:35.080> around<00:01:35.290> with<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.560> stapler<00:01:35.800> and<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.310> pushed

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
went around with a stapler and I pushed

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.340 
went around with a stapler and I pushed
pushed<00:01:37.210> able<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.570> most<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.870> them<00:01:38.050> crumbled

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
pushed able to most of them crumbled

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.110 
pushed able to most of them crumbled
over<00:01:38.530> like<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.860> but<00:01:39.610> what<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.820> ended<00:01:40.000> up

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
over like that but what it ended up

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.480 
over like that but what it ended up
doing<00:01:40.330> was<00:01:40.360> just<00:01:40.570> tacking<00:01:41.080> this<00:01:41.200> down<00:01:41.490> these

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
doing was just tacking this down these

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.610 
doing was just tacking this down these
craters<00:01:42.910> have<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.090> tendency<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.510> stick<00:01:44.290> up<00:01:44.470> in

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
craters have a tendency to stick up in

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.540 
craters have a tendency to stick up in
edges<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.580> this<00:01:45.850> disallowed<00:01:47.100> love<00:01:48.100> need<00:01:48.430> to

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
edges so this disallowed love need to

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.850 
edges so this disallowed love need to
fix<00:01:49.210> these<00:01:49.420> right<00:01:49.600> down<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.619> give<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.680> there's

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860

brown all around the outside and I've

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.770 
brown all around the outside and I've
done<00:02:53.320> some<00:02:53.590> misting<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.430> gray<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.240> what<00:02:55.720> I

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
done some misting of gray and what I

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.860 
done some misting of gray and what I
tried<00:02:55.990> to<00:02:56.020> do<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.410> try<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:57.210> do<00:02:58.210> it<00:02:58.330> on<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> steep

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
tried to do is try to do it on a steep

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.440

angle<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.440> what<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.370> would<00:03:00.520> do<00:03:00.640> is<00:03:00.910> give<00:03:01.390> me

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
angle and what that would do is give me

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.240 
angle and what that would do is give me
some<00:03:01.600> eye<00:03:01.690> shadows<00:03:02.110> not<00:03:02.560> go<00:03:02.740> right<00:03:02.920> into<00:03:03.130> all

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250

some eye shadows not go right into all
these<00:03:03.430> crimes<00:03:03.730> so<00:03:04.330> there's<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.600> bit<00:03:04.750> of

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
these crimes so there's a bit of

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.340 
these crimes so there's a bit of
directionality<00:03:05.770> going<00:03:06.520> on<00:03:06.670> with<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:10.350> recited

directionality going on with the recited

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.720 
directionality going on with the recited
use<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> airbrush<00:03:11.710> to<00:03:12.010> fit<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.310> faster<00:03:12.610> than

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
use the airbrush to fit and faster than

and put some some static grass on there
so<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.440> see<00:03:52.560> how<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.740> texture<00:03:53.040> comes<00:03:53.250> out

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
so you can see how the texture comes out

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.530 
so you can see how the texture comes out
really<00:03:53.550> nice<00:03:53.700> with<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.910> dry<00:03:54.060> brush<00:03:54.120> in<00:03:54.390> there

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
really nice with a dry brush in there

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.260 
really nice with a dry brush in there
and<00:03:54.720> this<00:03:55.680> on<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.310> edge<00:03:56.459> here<00:03:56.490> that's<00:03:56.850> more<00:03:57.090> of

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
and this on the edge here that's more of

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.480 
and this on the edge here that's more of
the<00:03:57.420> air<00:03:57.959> rushing<00:03:58.320> showing<00:03:58.590> up<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:58.860> I<00:03:58.890> kind<00:03:59.430> of

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
the air rushing showing up so I kind of

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.180 
the air rushing showing up so I kind of
airbrush<00:03:59.850> the<00:04:00.150> outside<00:04:00.690> edge<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.890> then<00:04:02.010> dry

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
airbrush the outside edge and then dry

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.400 
airbrush the outside edge and then dry
brush<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.550> whole<00:04:02.670> thing<00:04:02.990> and<00:04:03.990> that<00:04:04.110> just<00:04:04.260> made

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
brush the whole thing and that just made

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.630 
brush the whole thing and that just made
this<00:04:04.530> nice<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:04.920> bright<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.100> this<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.459> bit

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
this nice and bright and this a bit

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.190 
this nice and bright and this a bit
darker<00:04:07.910> see<00:04:08.910> now<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.420> should<00:04:09.750> have<00:04:09.840> taken<00:04:09.959> maybe

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
darker see now I should have taken maybe

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.110 
darker see now I should have taken maybe
a<00:04:10.290> bit<00:04:10.410> more<00:04:10.560> care<00:04:10.770> to<00:04:10.800> hide<00:04:11.100> that<00:04:11.340> little<00:04:11.940> edge

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
a bit more care to hide that little edge

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.659 
a bit more care to hide that little edge
there<00:04:12.420> but<00:04:12.690> that's<00:04:13.320> okay<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:17.280> whenever<00:04:17.579> I

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
there but that's okay and so whenever I

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.640 
there but that's okay and so whenever I
get<00:04:17.880> around<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.329> making<00:04:18.540> my<00:04:18.900> own<00:04:18.930> table<00:04:19.410> this

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
get around to making my own table this

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.939 
get around to making my own table this
would<00:04:19.829> be<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.130> same

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
would be the same

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:27.110 
would be the same
together<00:04:22.949> nicely<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:25.490> these<00:04:26.490> craters<00:04:26.789> yeah

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
together nicely and these craters yeah

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.570 
together nicely and these craters yeah
for<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.509> pricing<00:04:27.930> which<00:04:28.050> nice<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.580> quick

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
for the pricing which nice a quick

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.600 
for the pricing which nice a quick
theory<00:04:30.449> and<00:04:30.740> obviously<00:04:31.740> ain't<00:04:32.129> up<00:04:32.279> pretty

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
theory and obviously ain't up pretty

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.610 
theory and obviously ain't up pretty
fast<00:04:32.789> not<00:04:33.240> too<00:04:33.360> many<00:04:33.419> steps<00:04:33.719> don't<00:04:34.289> have<00:04:34.499> to

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
fast not too many steps don't have to

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.110 
fast not too many steps don't have to
put<00:04:34.740> this<00:04:34.860> base<00:04:35.039> on<00:04:35.279> but<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.610> helps<00:04:35.849> make<00:04:35.999> them

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
put this base on but it helps make them

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.659 
put this base on but it helps make them
a<00:04:36.150> bit<00:04:36.270> more<00:04:36.419> solid<00:04:37.099> and<00:04:38.099> there<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.520> can<00:04:38.550> see

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
a bit more solid and there you can see

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.749 
a bit more solid and there you can see
what<00:04:39.029> they<00:04:39.180> look<00:04:39.509> like<00:04:40.159> they're<00:04:41.159> just<00:04:41.550> giving

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
what they look like they're just giving

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.369 
what they look like they're just giving
a<00:04:41.879> real<00:04:42.060> scale<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.840> it's<00:04:42.960> hope<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.169> enjoyed

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
a real scale and it's hope you enjoyed

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.589 
a real scale and it's hope you enjoyed
