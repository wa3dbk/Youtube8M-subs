00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.279
 no 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.930
 and he's a good man for 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.840
 learn the first song boulevard 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.939
 broken dreams of green day unac a 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.919
 song with super easy chords 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.630
 for a first I think it will be 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.390
 really successful so we need to 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.650
 four chords the minor 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.690
 the only major the D major and the the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.930
 major throughout the song there is 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:48.309
 this loop that continues you will be able 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.260
 to learn to sing about you not even 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.299
 on it like that but on your guitar on 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.040
 your guitar game it's possible that you 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.949
 have wanted to play this song with 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.900
 an accompaniment of the original cd or 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.000
 at least one year end of a video 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.699
 whatever for these it will be necessary to put 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.560
 a hood to the first to the first 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.869
 freight because the original song and 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.220
 a half tone higher but I think 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.080
 for the moment we will learn how to 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.189
 play them an open chord without hood this 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.210
 will be easier for everyone who has 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.240
 want to play they have not yet 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.320
 hood for example there that I propose to you 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.180
 already to analyze a little bit what 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.200
 happens with the right hand so on 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.150
 our four times as we do 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.550
 usually we'll play a shot 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.600
 against down on pond 1 and 3 we're going 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.520
 hit all the strings 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.210
 so that's going to do for example on 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.210
 minors it's done 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.750
 3 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.750
 1 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.210
 you see 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.060
 4 6 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.760
 2 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.950
 4 one of them 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.170
 so win you who has a time on two 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.030
 who hit but times 2 and 4 they 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.230
 are going to be beaten anyway so the idea 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.330
 it's hitting the strings on the 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.710
 count down on pond 1 and 3 and 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.590
 meanwhile keep this hand that 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.150
 will do this move at the bottom so if we 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.450
 do we stay on the minor for 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:12.790
 practice first we will do 1 2 3 4 1 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.740
 2 3 4 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.840
 while striking times 1 and 3 but 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.970
 counting the four tones I'm 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.850
 better understand a little example 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.290
 practice on the minor it will do 1 2 3 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.660
 4 1 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.090
 2 3 4 1 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.790
 twice 4 1 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.010
 twice 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.109
 4 it's as simple as that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.180
 only instead of staying on minor 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.859
 we will change our agreements so we change 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.760
 once agree by measure what I 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.769
 proposes that we do it all 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.879
 gently the two together I count 14 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.609
 in the void and after we do the 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.370
 E minor sequence single ride 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.930
 and there while changing once 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:01.490
 okay not measure also does a two 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.380
 three four minors 1 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.760
 2 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.010
 3 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.160
 because soil a 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.770
 2 3 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.380
 4 1 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.380
 3 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.400
 4 That's it 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.540
 2 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.380
 4 the minors 2 3 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.550
 4 ah yeah 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.390
 3 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.920
 4 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.350
 no 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.630
 you 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.150
 4 you 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.819
 his 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.650
 4 and that's all for this 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.860
 beautiful song I propose to you 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.420
 the result already quietly ago 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.220
 progressive with their needs 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.319
 you really stay at your own pace 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.959
 always watch your right hand beating 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.459
 the measure is a happy help and 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.049
 it's a two three three will tackle 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.760
