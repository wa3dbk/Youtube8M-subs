00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 similar system of the season there and 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.370
 if you also want to open packs then 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.990
 surely the best course of fifa.com 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.639
 in addition it can be five with the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.830

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.540
 ahrensburg alex as always here 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.280
 welcome to a new pack if he 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.929
 because today finally on the consoles 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.750
 version of fifa and no longer in the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.820
 I'll be 20 from the 35 km mega web app 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.500
 sets open 10 on the console and 10 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.789
 on the web app you can currently really like that 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.590
 They do a blatant thing when you look below right 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.740
 with kuki batteries help in form 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.710
 yaya touré in form record baker record 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.989
 baker exactly a record baking radiomann 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.000
 but in the tractor trecker you have then 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.590
 is we are still the team to this then 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.079
 then have the first team of the season 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.620
 we dumbo premium gold silver and bronze 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.079
 sets that are 15 ks premium gold silver 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.120
 So bronze sets so 25 capex I think so 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.020
 and ok here the rest we see here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.260
 no there is not one day 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.340
 but that may be interested now 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.930
 And you have to be honest about this fight 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.820
 I had really bad luck so far 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 I have five taxman so come 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.039
 open and right in the first five 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.899
 packs boom agüero first owner unfortunately 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.100
 not gone but is still minimal 5 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.750
 worth millions then we want 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.210
 I look at least as much 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.939
 happiness in these 35 cars is accordingly backing 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.509
 is it so first 35 car pack will be one 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.119
 go ahead and come on 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.369
 I let it go through this way 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.409
 not good for the first behind dazzle 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.880
 this is a real jackpot but 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.310
 only when unfortunately not so good we come 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.650
 the second pack and normal pack 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.530
 but we do not look and we pull 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.170
 now in incredible kino.to yes 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.460
 man of the match matter so on those 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.450
 I'm not actually drawn to them 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.180
 wanted to see 8000 to 18,000 boy 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.640
 a real jackpot just in Rio 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.259
 jackpot well 10,000 8000 what is here 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.820
 the deal can actually worth it 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.439
 repelling for 10,000 can also be easy 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.600
 I trade so to speak I just buy 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.310
 quite often to 8000 and repel that is 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.570
 a really cool trading death no matter if 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.799
 the transfer list, see if I 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.679
 sold or not 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.270

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.609

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.019
 This is a special card was one 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.090

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.730
 drawn 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.440
 can not recognize something because 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.569
 what orange is the house vienna orange 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.950
 player itself nothing then it was 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.660
 maybe just the reflection is like that 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.819
 Funny , every case was not a good one 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.799
 pack 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.569
 everything brought about 3 ticks but as little 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.040
 hingeguckt we have I think we 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.719
 have pulled the ok on the match 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.469
 now we pull something good times when 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:34.299
 I watch him and I have not 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.280
 as had pat clarke oh my god 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.530
 and the best people I have too 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.650
 not yet if we have pulled them 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.450
 people are drawn to them heiko 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.489
 Westermann in the pack with the in shape 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.060
 cooperation in association with you what is 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.230
 because today, what's going on here? 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.639
 We 've set 285 , too 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.719
 now that too and then the 2 degrees 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.400
 is not in now again 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.379
 copenhagen lucky that the 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.939
 Westphalia pulls or something better and 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.250
 then no, but no, what better than 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.329
 Westermann is similar now 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.449
 He does not look that good 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.159
 so I have something in there for free 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.959
 honestly not expected and im 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.659
 Another degree is also nothing 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.030
 good turn 1000 cologne mühldorf 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.590
 something rare animal had in it 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.340
 is not rare what is that ? 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.349
 so our last 35 I 'm doing something 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.990
 I do what I do what I do quickly 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:28.090
 move in and all over 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.289
 many brilliant game but unfortunately no 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.330
 special card of it 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.150
 At first, there is no special card 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:38.770
 so and i will probably do 225 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:41.710
 cash register and maybe get it 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.710
 we have good luggage has brought nothing 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.639
 except kagawa so 25 cars at the 25th 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.770
 kassel are actually rather the 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.430
 worse somehow always shit like 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.740
 you can see 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.320
 so try it with 1 510 ks at 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.229
 where we do not go 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.840

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.550

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.710
 the 35 cast good luck now 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.270
 brought and I say say watch 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.380
 but maybe something on the web 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.310
 Pull like a we have again 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.470
 10 95 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.430
 and people I cost sega demba ba 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.320
 240,000 but probably will not go away 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.150
 film price yes so then we look 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.070
 but let's see if we are here on the web app 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.780
 just as much luck if I even more 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.770
 I think we have luck 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.120
 have taken everything we have because 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.280
 to be barbarously drawn to this weird 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.020
 material pulled on the match we have 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.370
 really pulled we pulled capable 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.750
 and we pulled out and of course 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.310
 Not to mention Westermann so six 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.480
 good cards and I still have the lord 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.860
 actually forget about my god seven 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.450
 good cards drawn 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.550
 with that come four five good cards 10 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.080
 or more on the web app with that 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.820
 another account here, we just make the 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.440
 35 kaarst on and we let us 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:47.440
 of course go through and expect small 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.490
 on and small team on the reading of the is 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.410
 I think a little bit worth it 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.120
 Such types of course only on the 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.580
 web where I have no use for the eh 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.900
 hammer let's see watch marcelo 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.680

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.470
 cards we coutinho not so good 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.850
 So the luggage will be a no look pass on

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.740
 that here 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.530
 a blockade to somehow over 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.639
 power without end but worth nothing I was 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.680
 again a special card for 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:47.530
 special cards make seven people like that 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:52.449
 we pack a very good pack and wait 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:54.190
 Shit on us so far waiting for us 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:57.570
 the web-app does not want to give us good things like that 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:02.949
 really outside small and now 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:04.590
 talk the most awesome 235 cars now can 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:06.699
 I still open so far it was rather 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.310
 disappointing what we pulled and 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:16.320
 it just does not get better that way 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:16.320
 Just press the right day off 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.580
 kagawa the web app which somehow have 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:22.900
 no idea the peg peg clack and wool 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.139
 somehow disabled or here 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.760
 something like a blue card tomb at 10 35 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:30.910
 I can capex now if I pack that 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.710
 open is there not the most blatant card 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.169
 in there at all 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.940
 no, well, people in the web app was fine 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:38.229
 Nothing is good for it today 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.440
 we on the account we also use 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:42.490
 can pulled some good players 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.120
 Westermann and the rest is actually 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.560
 no matter 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.210
 We can write in which team 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.949
 the donkey he has drawn and 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.150
 how many could already open there
