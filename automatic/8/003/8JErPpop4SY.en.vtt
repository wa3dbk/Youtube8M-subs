00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
players I think he could actually played

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.830 
players I think he could actually played
power-forward<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> wanted<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.210> mean

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
power-forward if you wanted to I mean

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.780 
power-forward if you wanted to I mean
smart<00:01:22.259> board<00:01:22.560> he<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> power<00:01:23.130> board<00:01:23.580> already

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
smart board he is a power board already

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.350 
smart board he is a power board already
I<00:01:24.240> think<00:01:25.020> he<00:01:25.140> hadn't<00:01:25.350> place<00:01:25.530> mar<00:01:26.159> 4<00:01:26.490> because<00:01:27.090> he

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
I think he hadn't place mar 4 because he

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.940 
I think he hadn't place mar 4 because he
can<00:01:27.630> shoot<00:01:27.840> threes<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.850> he<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.210> like

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
can shoot threes and he is really like

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.740 
can shoot threes and he is really like
really<00:01:31.950> athletic<00:01:32.180> that's<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.299> 38-inch

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
really athletic that's a 38-inch

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.230 
really athletic that's a 38-inch
vertical<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:36.000> high

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
vertical and that's really really high

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.890 
vertical and that's really really high
because<00:01:36.659> he<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.350> 610<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.299> usually<00:01:39.299> big<00:01:39.689> men's

next question Doug McDermott

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.510 
next question Doug McDermott
Doug<00:01:47.330> McDermott<00:01:47.720> he<00:01:48.230> reminds<00:01:48.770> me<00:01:48.980> a<00:01:49.190> lot<00:01:49.460> of

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
Doug McDermott he reminds me a lot of

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.760 
Doug McDermott he reminds me a lot of
day<00:01:50.060> Doretta<00:01:50.390> he<00:01:50.660> averaged<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.140> whole<00:01:51.380> lot<00:01:51.650> of

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
day Doretta he averaged a whole lot of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.760 
day Doretta he averaged a whole lot of
points<00:01:52.220> during<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.970> NC<00:01:53.930> double-a<00:01:54.260> playoffs

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
points during the NC double-a playoffs

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.550 
points during the NC double-a playoffs
and<00:01:55.580> during<00:01:55.850> out<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.270> whole<00:01:56.450> season<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:57.260> think

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
and during out the whole season I think

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.170 
and during out the whole season I think
he<00:01:57.650> actually<00:01:57.800> averaged<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.550> little<00:01:58.670> more<00:01:58.820> than

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
he actually averaged a little more than

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.930 
he actually averaged a little more than
Jabari<00:01:59.510> Parker<00:01:59.630> and<00:02:00.310> that's<00:02:01.310> actually<00:02:01.490> crazy

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
Jabari Parker and that's actually crazy

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.580 
Jabari Parker and that's actually crazy
because<00:02:02.150> this<00:02:02.450> guy<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.660> just<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.110> three-point

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
because this guy is just a three-point

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.470 
because this guy is just a three-point
shooter<00:02:03.920> in<00:02:04.310> order<00:02:04.640> for<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.000> be<00:02:05.120> that

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
shooter in order for you to be that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.430 
shooter in order for you to be that
accurate<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:06.560> have<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:06.830> be<00:02:06.950> good<00:02:08.200> but<00:02:09.200> back<00:02:09.410> to

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
accurate you have to be good but back to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.320 
accurate you have to be good but back to
the<00:02:09.680> next<00:02:09.950> person<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.640> if<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:10.880> want<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.150> read

the next person the last but not least

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.670

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
and this is not in water so he's

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.890
