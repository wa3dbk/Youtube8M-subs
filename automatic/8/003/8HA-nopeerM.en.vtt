00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
show I've been really loving is the

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.020 
show I've been really loving is the
voice<00:04:16.570> I've<00:04:17.230> actually<00:04:17.470> never<00:04:18.010> washed<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.790> whole

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
voice I've actually never washed a whole

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.210 
voice I've actually never washed a whole
season<00:04:19.390> of<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.870> voice<00:04:20.019> so<00:04:20.560> this<00:04:20.860> is<00:04:20.890> kind<00:04:21.190> of

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
season of the voice so this is kind of

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.250 
season of the voice so this is kind of
like<00:04:21.340> my<00:04:21.489> first<00:04:21.730> complete<00:04:22.210> season<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:23.140> I'm

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
like my first complete season that I'm

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.750 
like my first complete season that I'm
really<00:04:23.410> following<00:04:23.920> but<00:04:24.160> I'm<00:04:24.280> really<00:04:24.520> enjoying

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
really following but I'm really enjoying

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.670 
really following but I'm really enjoying
it<00:04:25.180> partially<00:04:25.450> because<00:04:25.810> christina<00:04:26.410> Grimmie

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
it partially because christina Grimmie

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.350 
it partially because christina Grimmie
is<00:04:26.890> on<00:04:27.070> there<00:04:27.250> which<00:04:27.460> we<00:04:27.850> haven't<00:04:28.060> seen<00:04:28.300> that

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
is on there which we haven't seen that

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.960 
is on there which we haven't seen that
much<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.900> her<00:04:29.230> yet<00:04:29.710> but<00:04:30.100> I've<00:04:30.310> been<00:04:30.580> watching

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
much of her yet but I've been watching

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.570

her videos here on YouTube for years and

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.010 
her videos here on YouTube for years and
I<00:04:33.640> think<00:04:33.820> it's<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.150> exciting<00:04:34.630> that<00:04:34.660> she's<00:04:34.900> on

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
I think it's so exciting that she's on

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.630 
I think it's so exciting that she's on
the<00:04:35.170> show<00:04:35.350> this<00:04:35.560> season<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.130> can't<00:04:36.370> wait<00:04:36.610> to

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
the show this season and I can't wait to

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.210 
the show this season and I can't wait to
see<00:04:36.970> what<00:04:37.660> she<00:04:37.690> does<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.380> what<00:04:38.560> happens<00:04:38.980> with

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
see what she does and what happens with

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.160 
see what she does and what happens with
her<00:04:39.550> but<00:04:39.820> I've<00:04:39.940> just<00:04:40.060> been<00:04:40.210> really<00:04:40.480> loving<00:04:40.990> the

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
her but I've just been really loving the

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.380 
her but I've just been really loving the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.330 
show I like the chemistry between the
judges<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:43.960> think<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.560> they<00:04:44.710> get<00:04:45.070> along

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
judges I think that they get along

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.320 
judges I think that they get along
really<00:04:45.730> well<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.180> they're<00:04:46.300> very

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
really well and they're very

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.720 
really well and they're very
entertaining<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.200> watch<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:47.770> then<00:04:47.980> another
