00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
60 is better you can adjust this if you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.110 
60 is better you can adjust this if you

this but here it is right here I might

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.160 
this but here it is right here I might
not<00:03:08.120> be<00:03:08.240> able<00:03:08.330> to<00:03:08.450> hear<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.690> too<00:03:08.840> well<00:03:08.990> our

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
not be able to hear it too well our

speakers<00:03:16.420> now<00:03:17.420> for<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.720> song<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.020> is<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.170> little

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
speakers now for the song it is a little

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.350 
speakers now for the song it is a little
bit<00:03:18.560> quieter<00:03:18.860> than<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:19.040> thought<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.180> can

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
bit quieter than I thought but you can

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.450 
bit quieter than I thought but you can
once<00:03:20.570> again<00:03:20.660> put<00:03:21.170> they<00:03:21.320> are<00:03:21.500> level<00:03:22.070> up<00:03:22.190> to

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
once again put they are level up to

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.150 
once again put they are level up to
maybe<00:03:22.790> 65<00:03:23.360> do<00:03:23.990> a<00:03:24.020> little<00:03:24.230> test<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.770> each

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
maybe 65 do a little test of it each

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.120 
maybe 65 do a little test of it each
song<00:03:25.400> is<00:03:25.550> different<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.150> never<00:03:26.450> know<00:03:27.130> but

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
song is different so you never know but

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.070 
song is different so you never know but
uh<00:03:28.190> there<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.120> go<00:03:29.240> there<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.690> have<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:29.870> as

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
uh there you go there you have it as

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.440
