00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.850
 basically it's very simple 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.130
 We preheat our oven to 440 degrees 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.720

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.369

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.529
 these are girls potatoes if they are more 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.040
 big case is that it's going to cut it 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.530
 in small pieces about one inch 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:42.370
 more or less to kilo and gestures to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:48.180
 cut them just to show a little 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.180
 how are we going to this size like this 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.560
 and one of the smallest 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.620
 it does not matter so much 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.720
 Well, here we are going to put the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.320
 destruction to garlic cloves we have 4 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.920
 finely chopped garlic cloves are 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.980
 has once is squeezed from garlic that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.960
 better they are great we have 2 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.960
 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.880
 Y 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.710
 a teaspoon of dried parsley 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.180
 We shred a little bit more about how it comes 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.540
 and we're going to put cayena that chili 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.440
 powder chili powder tree if 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.430
 he wants spicy and if he does not put paprika 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:50.220
 in powder here we have half a teaspoon 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.220
 we're going to make it spicy this time 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:57.030
 pepper is better this one that comes in if 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.400
 he has it in grains for what 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.400
 the cool shade those bushes 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.259
 and salt I prefer to use salt here 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.259
 Marine 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.930
 let's mix this well first and here 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.430
 we already mix it well we have a tray 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.489
 for the oven these are for the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.770
 cookies we put aluminum paper 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.900
 aluminum on top to make it easier 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:33.079
 clean it and a little spray 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.270
 grease the spray that is the one 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.060
 spray oil 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.830
 we already put the spray here and we're going to 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.830
 put the potatoes 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.520
 the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.630
 we distribute well 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.010
 and baked and we're going to put the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.909
 oven 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.480
 for 40 minutes and they should be 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:03.450
 lists if not the tests with a toothpick 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.640
 It has to be easily 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.079
 of the toothpick and if you do not have to leave them 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.099
 little bit more time but with 40 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:13.240
 are 440 minutes is sufficient degrees 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.110
 fahrenheit 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.110
 let's put them 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.690
 in the middle of the oven 40 minutes and they are already 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.280
 you have to be very careful with the oven 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.200
 there are no children to 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.770
 It's very hot of course 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.770
 they know but it's worth mentioning 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.180
 it gets a little bit more golden 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.870
 can leave a little more taking care of those that 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.590
 they are not going to burn and here you can adjust 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.730
 the salt I put it a little bit more 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.010
 parsley 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:56.409
 dry to the last you can put flames 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.879
 You can try putting more pepper or salt 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.879
 cayenne if you like 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.370
 and as a side dish or to accompany 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.000
