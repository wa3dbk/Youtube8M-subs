00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
could be softer and then so next thing

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.209 
could be softer and then so next thing
the<00:00:36.149> leather<00:00:36.450> round<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.380> hu<00:00:37.710> k<00:00:37.950> is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
unbeatable it's a 10 out of 10 because

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.479 
unbeatable it's a 10 out of 10 because
it's<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.899> pro<00:00:43.260> stock<00:00:43.590> select<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.309> they

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it's just it's pro stock select so they

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.760

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
them make their a to cage with it and

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.000 
them make their a to cage with it and
another<00:00:55.649> good<00:00:56.219> thing<00:00:56.280> about<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.640> 2k<00:00:57.059> leather<00:00:57.329> is

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
another good thing about a 2k leather is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:06.410 
another good thing about a 2k leather is
inside<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> palm<00:00:59.430> in<00:01:00.420> there<00:01:03.619> it<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:05.489> double

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
inside the palm in there it is double

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.380 
inside the palm in there it is double
like<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.950> palm<00:01:08.220> has<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:10.430> like<00:01:11.430> sets<00:01:11.820> i<00:01:12.180> should

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
like the palm has to like sets i should

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.410 
like the palm has to like sets i should
say<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.900> leather<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.760> stretches<00:01:15.299> out

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
say of leather so if one stretches out

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.249 
say of leather so if one stretches out
the<00:01:15.720> other<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:17.009> other<00:01:17.220> ones<00:01:18.049> doesn't<00:01:19.049> stretch

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the other the other ones doesn't stretch

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.450 
the other the other ones doesn't stretch
out<00:01:19.439> too<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> fiber<00:01:20.340> stay<00:01:20.700> nice<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.000> stiff

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
out too so the fiber stay nice and stiff

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.810 
out too so the fiber stay nice and stiff
then<00:01:23.600> this<00:01:24.600> glove<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.740> looks<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.549> close

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
then this glove for looks this close

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.520 
then this glove for looks this close
probably<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.210> 10<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.570> 10<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> color

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
