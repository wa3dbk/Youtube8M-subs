00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:17.140
 little moved, hopefully, the 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:18.970
 eat and better armor warmly 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.039
 Welcome to a round heroes 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.090
 my channel and that is a new one 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.650
 game mode I play now and times 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.570
 the whole on I do not have here yet 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.300
 I'll talk about how you like the days 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.700
 you will see for a long time 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.470
 heroes who does not know it is something like 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.180
 games so you do not kill yourself now 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.520
 Can be at the beginning and later no 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.080
 I want you to come and then if you want 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.220
 the surviving one comes to this hall of 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.290
 heroes or whatever you call no 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.210
 I know that's just what I call it 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.640
 and there has to be a deathmatch with a total of 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.400
 12 12 players and who the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.250
 Winning is the belief I call it that 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.760
 yes and at the beginning you get a swords 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.610
 Not 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.360
 I just tried the sword 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.230
 to open the cash register 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.989
 so I have to get used to it 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.939
 and yes, as you see , I take that 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.609
 just with the new feature of 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.359
 youtube on with the so-called 60 fps 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:12.850
 function 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:16.259
 you can with this cogwheel there 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.659
 Set bottom right in the video 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.359
 720p and behind it is somehow 60th 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.520
 That's what you do best then you have 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:28.509
 her the video in perfect so it is 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.329
 really nice and fluid then me 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.979
 always make adjustments even if you 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.899
 not so well paid or internet 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.340
 unfortunately , I think that would be anyway 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.710
 always do it because it's just a lot 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.189
 Nice is also to look gave the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.829
 company action and it 's just a lot 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.300
 much nicer so please do that 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.530
 It then gives this function 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.810
 I would use that synonymous with yours 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.660
 I use it now whenever 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.800
 People upload that with 60 fps 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.020
 I think it's really ingenious 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.440
 function of youtube now finally 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:04.090
 sensibly introduced thing not so 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.680
 blue discs or so in any case 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.710
 a really cool idea of 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.980
 youtube that 's 60 fps 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.720
 Configure a graphic bug of death 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.330
 and yes I am extremely excited about this 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.430
 60 fps and heroes is a mode of mine 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.350
 Really so we just now 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.580
 More on the mode to address is mode 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.870
 I really like it very much 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.280
 I think he is really well thought out 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.990
 possibly the server could do deathmatch 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.270
 you somehow make it different fabi 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.130
 and I talked about that one 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.920
 somehow always fighting ahead 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.470
 So that means if you are a man 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.720
 has won you come to the next and 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.180
 always so on until then four more 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.320
 people or so are left 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.190
 that would be a really good thing though 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.290
 I still think it's really cool that way 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.610
 as it is and I would like too 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.950
 People often bring me here when I'm here 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.780
 what does it show me with a 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.360
 positive evaluation there you already see 60 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.930
 seconds until death match starts and 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.820
 when does not start with 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.690
 yes it's really a relaxed 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.780
 Mode and also good for storing too well 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.530
 for pvp and you will not bother 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.420
 in pvp thing and then you get on like that 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.459
 a hall with a lot of people and 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.560
 Judge that will see everything now 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.190
 so I've never this first as 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.810
 one verkackt that should already mean something 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.870
 as you have to specify I have to record here 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.819
 but usually not like that 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.769
 because the opponents are usually not so good 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.780
 I hope I get together 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.360
 now an opponent with something worse 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.310
 Klub and I are just so excited about it 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.450
 the 60 fps because of the function 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.640
 I think it's really good that 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.739
 youtube that one time leads because looks like that 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.170
 So liquid and makes more fun 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.739
 to see if you can do it right 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.620
 cheers 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.349
 so our opponent therefore nothing 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.569
 was it something said world we will 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.510
 the pimp right now a bit of a 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.230
 bit small interface camp like that 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.190
 hopefully he has a little touch 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.190
 eat and better armor 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.379
 i would not have any special power though 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.840
 We eat very well so now 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.829
 Let's start the so-called 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.829
 the result is double 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.820
 the seems not too bad the pvp 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:33.810
 that was really tight knotted 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.810
 this is the goal 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.800
 that's what this bronze force is for now 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.789
 we come in a deathmatch with all 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.710
 many people and will see there 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.919
 are still begging which will see if 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.169
 we can do it or not 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.280
 must make is not now in 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.289
 seven seconds is the deathmatch and 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.229
 I try somehow of the 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.660
 People try to dust off 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:01.210
 so I 've got this here now 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.650
 whole people in a circle and here's 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.449
 It's always a bit like that 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.200
 confusing sometimes you have to be real 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:18.730
 play scilly 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:18.730
 so beautiful and that's how it should be 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:45.740
 clean as not so the type of am 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.030
 At the beginning we come back to us 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.150
 lure it a bit on the 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.980
 others and I look, of course 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.470
 only gold gold direction it is not that 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:58.790
 strongest should be known 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.560
 That's why I want to get in here 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.170
 bit in and see what 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.840
 others have that way for me but i should 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:09.590
 Sometimes rain but I can not right 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:17.540
 if if if if here are fighting 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:19.990
 that would be nice that was right 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.990
 important 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.300
 can already exist 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.840
 yes one now 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.319
 I think 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.200
 yes, how good 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:17.570
 there it is there is a sword so road 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:26.169
 mature many I live the now still there 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:26.169
 an old games still here 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:42.080
 It is the last one to order 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:44.840
 that his age was yes there was the idea 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.130
 that was really good of them 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.419
 but we have come a long way 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.370
 well well meaning I'm sorry that you 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:49.640
 so single-digit on set 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.960
 was 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.169
 but that's really one 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.669
 Concentration thing and you see that 

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:58.370
 the mode makes me much fun 

00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:00.770
 if you weigh far more easily one 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.110
 positive evaluation and then I want to say 

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:08.479
 my jeans until next time 

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:10.820
 Minecraft SG Heroes have a lot of fun yet 

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:14.200
 in other videos pure skin and enjoys 

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.200
 watch the 60 fps
