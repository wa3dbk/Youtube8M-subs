but<00:00:26.150> it<00:00:26.630> was<00:00:26.900> a<00:00:26.930> downgrade<00:00:27.619> fest<00:00:27.980> at<00:00:28.190> the<00:00:28.280> USGS

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
but it was a downgrade fest at the USGS

yesterday<00:00:29.510> eventually<00:00:30.170> coming<00:00:30.410> down<00:00:30.650> to<00:00:30.800> a

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
then a double event in Japan 6.9 and 6.9

then<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.239> USGS<00:00:44.900> dropped<00:00:45.229> one<00:00:45.470> of<00:00:45.500> them<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:45.800> 6.8

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
then the USGS dropped one of them to 6.8

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.549 
then the USGS dropped one of them to 6.8
and<00:00:46.670> decided<00:00:47.120> it<00:00:47.210> happened<00:00:47.600> slightly<00:00:48.050> west<00:00:48.290> of
