00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
might be the fact that it's building

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.990 
might be the fact that it's building
it's<00:01:00.059> got<00:01:00.329> built-in<00:01:00.660> DVD<00:01:00.960> Drive<00:01:01.850> supposed<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it's got built-in DVD Drive supposed to

its<00:01:03.260> previous<00:01:04.260> systems<00:01:05.630> you<00:01:06.630> couldn't<00:01:07.049> have

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
its previous systems you couldn't have

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.530 
its previous systems you couldn't have
the<00:01:07.290> advantage<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.250> using<00:01:09.049> a<00:01:10.049> DVD<00:01:10.350> drive<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> we

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
the advantage of using a DVD drive so we

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.080 
the advantage of using a DVD drive so we
had<00:01:12.689> had<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> obviously<00:01:13.290> use<00:01:13.799> other<00:01:14.580> ways<00:01:14.909> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
had had to obviously use other ways of

had had to obviously use other ways of
external<00:01:16.610> resources<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.939> overall<00:01:21.360> design<00:01:21.840> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
external resources the overall design is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.920 
external resources the overall design is
obviously<00:01:22.710> very<00:01:22.799> simple<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.810> website

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
obviously very simple and this website

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.380 
obviously very simple and this website
comes<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.350> year<00:01:28.380> speed<00:01:28.829> report<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:30.180> has
