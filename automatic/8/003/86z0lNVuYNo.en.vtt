00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.320
 optimal telecinco 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.750
 and we have to mediafire that is going up 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.840
 the file like here we give in 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.430
 download weighs very little and was downloaded 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.980
 zenteno the videos let us be this 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.080
 winrar file where we explain click 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.080
 right to be here 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.070
 and will leave us an executable one 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.870
 application and a good folder the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.120
 application is called system exists in 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.390
 baku we have to install in our 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.860
 phone 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.860
 the first thing is to be able 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.470
 in rooting our phone we have to 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.750
 the mobile already in evolution usb if 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.520
 we do not have those positions it's not going to 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.820
 serve nothing and we have to have the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.530
 drivers 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.770
 Well now we are going to see if 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.259
 we are going to you 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.950
 We do not go to development zones and 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.740
 we wanted debugging and we get 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.780
 a little window we would give to accept and 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.860
 we already have the mobile 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.220
 well we are going to put the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.310
 application as I said 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.310
 at the start team 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.100
 sd card and if we do not we put the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.820
 card accelerates we put in some 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.280
 internal phone if it does not work 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.280
 keep remembering why yes no 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.240
 good will be vowels 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.020
 well I have to get to the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.020
 application 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.099
 for 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.430
 the truth is that it does not have any 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.430
 complication 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:25.420
 here right click copy 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.300
 and the right to paste 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.930
 let's see the application and we're going to 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.930
 our mobile 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.760
 we go to the menu and look for the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.060
 application that we just put where 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.710
 in power and office is as we said 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.780
 is in the internal memory of the phone 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.360
 not on the sd card 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.590
 my file the one that is the application 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.590
 and we give him to install 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.340
 once the application we give to 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.069
 fact 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.710
 good to the back 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.250
 and what we are going to do now 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.250
 is 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.600
 open the application is going to be a 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.970
 little messenger called hello world without 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.110
 application exit we're going to go 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.110
 good to an application 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.260
 As I said, I do not just need calls 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.270
 of place if it would be application we keep 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.460
 pressed the off button 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.250
 and we give you a restart 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.940
 stable vitals on the phone we take out 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.250
 the usb cable the usb cable and when 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.190
 let's finish it again 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.520
 we connect and we put it in single charge 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.540
 well let's do it initial 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.540
 we will be 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.040
 and as I said we took out the usb cable 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.890
 well once we restart our 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.820
 phone as we can see is installed 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.230
 the application that is very relevant 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.380
 It exists in Baku and good as I said 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.470
 before we put 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.950
 in just load and now we're going to go to 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.950
 Folder 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.700
 I have also left 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.249
 we put this here 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.709
 let's go here rock telecinco 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:37.440
 and we are going to look for this file that puts 

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:40.390
 en route well, we took it twice 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.170
 let's see a little window 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.170
 an electric 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.010
 and if we are going to restart the phone 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.010
 we wait 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.909
 people 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.920
 near nice on the phones like I've 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.210
 saying 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.210
 we connect the usb cable 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.070
 and how do you see there is the application 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.070
 supersur in which there will be no 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.639
 we already know how to use that route 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.870
 Well that's all for today but they 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:49.290
 I ask that you like it 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.890
 to decide any doubt and comment 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.890
 until another
