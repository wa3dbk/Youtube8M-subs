00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.590 
you'll have of course options that you
can<00:02:34.510> add<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.860> fix<00:02:36.250> redeye<00:02:36.550> problems<00:02:37.330> tap

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
can add you can fix redeye problems tap

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.630 
can add you can fix redeye problems tap
to<00:02:37.780> remove<00:02:37.900> redeye<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.980> all<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.220> have<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.400> do

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
to remove redeye so all you have to do

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.270 
to remove redeye so all you have to do
is<00:02:39.760> tap<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.360> if<00:02:41.080> there<00:02:41.380> are<00:02:41.410> red<00:02:41.890> eyes<00:02:42.040> it's

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
is tap and if there are red eyes it's

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.340 
is tap and if there are red eyes it's
going<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.760> fix<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.150> automatically<00:02:43.900> because<00:02:44.200> it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
going to fix it automatically because it

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.650 
going to fix it automatically because it
detects<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.070> eyes<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.670> your<00:02:45.790> face<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.510> don't

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
even have to do anything else and

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.840 
even have to do anything else and
there's<00:02:49.570> of<00:02:50.320> course<00:02:50.410> reduce<00:02:51.190> picture<00:02:51.670> noise

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
there's of course reduce picture noise

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.470 
there's of course reduce picture noise
or<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.870> can<00:02:53.340> play<00:02:54.340> with<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.790> options<00:02:55.270> for

or so you can play with the options for
picture<00:02:55.810> noise<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:57.330> change<00:02:58.330> all<00:02:58.630> of<00:02:58.840> those

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
picture noise and change all of those

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.900 
picture noise and change all of those
options<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:01.740> you<00:03:02.740> have<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.310> auto<00:03:03.520> fix

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
options and you have the auto fix

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.150 
options and you have the auto fix
feature<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.600> if<00:03:04.840> for<00:03:05.050> example<00:03:05.110> you've<00:03:05.650> got<00:03:05.680> a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
feature so if for example you've got a

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.580 
feature so if for example you've got a
picture<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.000> you're<00:03:07.600> not<00:03:07.750> really<00:03:07.930> sure<00:03:08.020> what

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
picture and you're not really sure what

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.100 
picture and you're not really sure what
you<00:03:08.710> should<00:03:08.890> do<00:03:09.100> there's<00:03:09.430> an<00:03:09.580> auto<00:03:09.790> fix

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
you should do there's an auto fix

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.650 
you should do there's an auto fix
feature<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:12.100> is<00:03:12.400> available<00:03:12.430> but<00:03:13.120> you'll

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
feature that is available but you'll

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.380 
feature that is available but you'll
have<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:14.170> buy<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.440> full<00:03:14.950> version<00:03:14.980> for<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.760> so

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
have to buy the full version for that so

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.949 
have to buy the full version for that so
why<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.080> just<00:03:17.380> use<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.010> manual<00:03:18.250> versions<00:03:18.959> I

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
why not just use the manual versions I

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.890 
why not just use the manual versions I
would<00:03:20.410> say<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.739> for<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:22.030> know<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.510> says<00:03:22.780> that

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
would say that for you know it says that

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.690 
would say that for you know it says that
it's<00:03:23.050> $4.99<00:03:23.290> for<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.920> full<00:03:24.130> version<00:03:24.280> which<00:03:24.550> is

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
it's $4.99 for the full version which is

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.850 
it's $4.99 for the full version which is
not<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.060> much<00:03:25.120> actually<00:03:25.570> $4.99<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.470> not<00:03:26.650> that

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
not that much actually $4.99 is not that

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.350 
not that much actually $4.99 is not that

that gives you much more and basically
I'll<00:04:53.340> probably<00:04:54.150> buy<00:04:54.660> that<00:04:54.690> version<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.710> talk

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
I'll probably buy that version and talk

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.620 
I'll probably buy that version and talk
about<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.430> in<00:04:56.610> next<00:04:57.330> week<00:04:57.510> in<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.590> paid<00:04:58.950> apps

about it in next week in the paid apps
will<00:05:00.630> probably<00:05:01.050> look<00:05:01.200> at<00:05:01.350> if<00:05:01.470> Adobe<00:05:02.100> Photoshop

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
paid version but for I think for most
