00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 just one of the consultations 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.089
 most common is that it has to do with 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.770
 the food combination looks today 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.120
 the other day we chatted when 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.950
 you had what more the other day 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.690
 12 months ago but we chatted a 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.310
 little bit in the meeting that I 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.470
 I appreciated both people and Matt and 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.529
 robert as diego as all those who go 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.689
 to there and offer your heart and offer your 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.689
 art of offering more food 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.660
 healthy but good too we have 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.349
 chatted that many times they are also 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.770
 foods 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.330
 they are transitional recipes 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.270
 who is used to a diet 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.260
 hyper fat animal fat 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.660
 and else 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.180
 it is good that one can offer you a 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.010
 dish where there is a great attraction 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.700
 from the view and where they can 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.370
 combine natural flavors 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.560
 so good to make a change and 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.600
 go little by little away from the 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.840
 most harmful foods but also not 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.550
 let's lose sight of the fact that 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.460
 combinations and many times 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.140
 combinations of many products to 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.360
 ten times sometimes recipe they have 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.100
 10-15 combined products was not 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.330
 good and that's a concept that what 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.190
 we have to be clear about why 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.670
 our physiology was not ready 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.310
 to eat and that 15 products at a time or 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.890
 may be able to be able but that 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.479
 that is healthy 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.180
 many times the other day when 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.680
 we watch the program we always have left 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.810
 a lot to talk about but I remember that 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.360
 that day the cook that was not me 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.130
 agreement last Wednesday he commented 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.930
 that not only the important thing was that 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.479
 we ate but how was our 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.360
 digestive system and as we said and 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.149
 how we absorb what we eat because 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.550
 we can eat the best that exists the most 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.619
 organic that exists but if we have a 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.140
 intestine by a synchronous amount 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.000
 we have a gut with a flora 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.720
 inadequate or we have a lot of other 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.790
 issues one 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.290
 or parasites one in quantities and so on 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.650
 obviously we are going to have a bad 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.930
 digestion in the malabsorption then 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.280
 it is important to do all that work of 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.050
 regulate our entire digestive system 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.670
 to promote an adequate flora to make 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.980
 everything that covers all the part of 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.750
 cleaning and deworming and the rest 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.760
 to be able to ensure a good 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.880
 nutrition because you can eat very well 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.100
 but absorb very badly digest very badly 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.959
 now of the things that have to do 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.240
 what are the worst mistakes we make 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.980
 what is this what it means that they are 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.959
 the combinations because the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.970
 combinations generate fermentation is 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.040
 exaggerated by putrefaction is in the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.690
 cases I mention there are products 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:52.310
 exaggerated animals constipation 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.810
 distension gases that is a whole 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.570
 upset and many times I am 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.970
 eating healthy yes but you're eating 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.310
 78 products mixed in one dish 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.470
 that nuance is understood illicitly 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.270
 I thought while you talked 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.730
 the idea also that sometimes it goes 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.690
 installing already as a maximum that is 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.490
 in the five colors on the plate 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.980
 in a salad be in the five 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.670
 colors not the five colors but 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.190
 there are five different colors and maybe 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:29.970
 the simplest dish is more effective and 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.010
 I do not mix so much, that's why I tell you everything 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.720
 we are talking about there is not a 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.060
 absolute truth and all this is a 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.130
 transition I am telling you from the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.780
 physiological point of view the most 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.910
 adequate is when simpler the better 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.640
 good diet a mono diet is not 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.140
 extra coin if you want what you get 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.280
 I want to say is that if you for example 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.680
 in your main meal you eat 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.730
 two or three things you're in a transition 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.260
 good is good is better to eat 78 yesterday 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.060
 the doctor who was speaking 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.760
 of medicine appointment that was being talked about 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.850
 in the faculty of the interactions that 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.940
 yes they had synthetic pharmacology 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.610
 of the laboratories 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.890
 the whistles of medicine is to say with 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.780
 the preparations that had to do 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.370
 with medicinal herbs that also 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.440
 there were interactions and they can do you 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.230
 harm good with doctors food 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.540
 the same thing happens the foods have power 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.970
 healing and nutritional power if you 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.990
 you mix a lot of food the organ 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.880
 in the body that has an effect 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.070
 if we are saying for example that such 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.630
 vegetable has an effect on the heart 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.370
 another tells you that it has an effect on 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.830
 kidney another tells you that diuretic is another 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.990
 He tells you that this is another hepatoprotective 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.960
 it means that it has a chemical effect 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.600
 in your body so when I follow 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.760
 you mix a lot of things that's going to 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.460
 also generate a lot of disorders 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.169
 in your body we will totally see that 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.259
 last week 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.509
 I get a lentil stew 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:04.879
 vegetarians but he had potatoes 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:08.360
 I said this I'm going to eat and I'm going to fall ill 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.310
 not be decreed or but good 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.919
 conjunction for example of the potato with the 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.139
 lentil not only to the beyond that is a 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.259
 let 's say the cooked good generates what 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.800
 generates but I shut up like that as 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:24.349
 a bomb that caused as a 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.240
 acidity a reflux that lasted me until the 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:29.719
 another day more or less I do not know if because 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.159
 decree or what but surely 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:33.620
 obviously has to do with the month 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:36.529
 our mind is to generate creates everything 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.120
 that I want a secret that sometimes does not 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.740
 we realize because it is not so 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.900
 immediate because we are not so effective 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.370
 still sometimes it takes a few days sometimes 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.710
 it takes a few months sometimes a few years later 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.210
 but always what the mind decrees is 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.800
 produce that you do not have the slightest doubt 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.960
 now 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.419
 it is important that we are surely going to 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.879
 keep chatting but this to understand 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.740
 that when we simplify it 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.900
 let's feel that we are not getting better 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.659
 in addition someone are also maxwell are 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.250
 so many people and they have and will feel so much 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.650
 information in the program and first 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.629
 always quality all the guests that 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.909
 I can not remember the names of all 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:15.409
 but there he also commented the other day of 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:16.849
 This is about the importance of choosing a 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.620
 food that does not have to be 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.840
 combined are if you have to search 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.909
 the amino acids of a serial against 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.169
 miners that the legumes provide you with 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.300
 they have to be necessarily in the 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.909
 same plate or the organism is not 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.520
 stupid or you can eat a 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:35.330
 determined food and rotate to 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:37.520
 another day to another and the other to another and if 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.510
 you need a certain nutrient to say 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.040
 that food 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.040
 the body has the capacity to 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.420
 reserve it to save it and be able to 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.340
 use when it is with two when there 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.280
 lack now you do not feed yourself 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.200
 That same morning now that in 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.030
 that is not to say we rely on the 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.220
 afraid to say we put on a plate a 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.680
 lot of substances because we continue in 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:02.390
 we are still afraid that 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.390
 we are missing something clear
