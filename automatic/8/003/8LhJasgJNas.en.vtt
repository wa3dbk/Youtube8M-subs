so<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.159> recently<00:00:02.429> went<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.820> Iceland<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.870> have<00:00:04.350> a

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
so I recently went to Iceland to have a

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.650 
so I recently went to Iceland to have a
quick<00:00:04.650> ride<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.100> GT<00:00:05.400> grade<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.910> wanted<00:00:06.480> to

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
quick ride on the GT grade I wanted to

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.330 
quick ride on the GT grade I wanted to
see<00:00:07.109> what<00:00:07.230> it<00:00:07.319> was<00:00:07.410> really<00:00:07.560> like<00:00:07.680> on<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> on<00:00:08.309> a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
see what it was really like on a on a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.459 
see what it was really like on a on a
mix<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.730> road<00:00:08.910> services<00:00:09.480> it's<00:00:09.750> marketed<00:00:10.320> as<00:00:10.440> a

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
mix of road services it's marketed as a

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.930 
mix of road services it's marketed as a
gravel<00:00:10.800> bike<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.219> thought<00:00:11.460> well<00:00:11.639> let's<00:00:11.790> take

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
gravel bike so I thought well let's take

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.520 
gravel bike so I thought well let's take
it<00:00:12.030> onto<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.269> tarmac<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.809> then<00:00:13.259> let's<00:00:13.380> take

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
it onto the tarmac and then let's take

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.020 
it onto the tarmac and then let's take
it<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:13.740> some<00:00:13.980> gravel<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.370> see<00:00:14.490> how<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.730> really

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
it on some gravel to see how it really

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.820 
it on some gravel to see how it really
sort<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.299> handles<00:00:15.599> out<00:00:15.750> there<00:00:15.960> so<00:00:16.500> what<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
sort of handles out there so what is a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.320 
sort of handles out there so what is a
grabber<00:00:17.070> bike<00:00:17.279> well<00:00:17.520> you're<00:00:18.119> getting

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
grabber bike well you're getting

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.000 
grabber bike well you're getting
geometry<00:00:18.779> which<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.080> slightly<00:00:19.289> slacker<00:00:19.680> to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
geometry which is slightly slacker to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.679 
geometry which is slightly slacker to
make<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> little<00:00:20.369> bit<00:00:20.490> easier<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.760> ride<00:00:21.060> and

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
make it a little bit easier to ride and

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.090 
make it a little bit easier to ride and
you're<00:00:21.869> perhaps<00:00:22.170> getting<00:00:22.439> sort<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.830> flared

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
you're perhaps getting sort of flared

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.779 
little bit more sort of give built into
them<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> little<00:00:29.189> bit<00:00:29.250> comes<00:00:29.490> through<00:00:29.670> on

them so the little bit comes through on

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.939 
them so the little bit comes through on
rougher<00:00:30.090> terrain<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:31.170> that's<00:00:31.380> often<00:00:31.740> backed

or 32 mil wide tires run on slightly
wide<00:00:38.940> rims<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.450> give<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> better<00:00:39.809> tire<00:00:40.110> profile

and<00:00:41.040> allow<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> get<00:00:41.730> away<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.120> lower

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and allow you to get away with lower

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.209 
and allow you to get away with lower
pressures<00:00:42.809> which<00:00:43.020> therefore<00:00:43.829> becomes<00:00:44.160> a

pressures which therefore becomes a

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.100 
pressures which therefore becomes a
little<00:00:44.340> bit<00:00:44.430> more<00:00:44.520> comfortable<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> had<00:00:45.899> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
pretty capable road bike it climbs

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350 
pretty capable road bike it climbs
alright<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.799> descends<00:01:32.400> quite<00:01:32.909> nicely<00:01:33.090> because

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
alright it descends quite nicely because

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.670 
alright it descends quite nicely because
of<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> slack<00:01:33.869> angle<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.500> quite

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
of the slack angle so it's quite

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.859 
of the slack angle so it's quite
confidence<00:01:35.220> inspiring<00:01:35.640> when<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.329> hit<00:01:36.630> the

out and gives you a little extra grip
but<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:52.979> fair<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.119> gravel<00:01:54.420> roads<00:01:54.630> have

that<00:01:58.439> grip<00:01:58.920> at<00:01:59.070> times<00:01:59.340> was<00:01:59.579> an<00:01:59.700> issue<00:01:59.820> there's

that grip at times was an issue there's

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.760 
that grip at times was an issue there's
one<00:02:00.600> climbing<00:02:00.899> particular<00:02:01.110> which<00:02:01.350> took<00:02:01.619> me

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
one climbing particular which took me

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.280 
one climbing particular which took me
over<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.369> small<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:02.969> cold<00:02:03.210> down<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.689> Lake<00:02:04.110> in

the highlands and with the 28c slick
tyres<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:08.250> fair<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.729> say<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.090> there's<00:02:09.270> a

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
tyres it's fair to say that there's a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.029 
tyres it's fair to say that there's a
fair<00:02:09.569> bit<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.899> wheelspin<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:10.830> when<00:02:11.009> I

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
fair bit of wheelspin going up when I

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.340 
fair bit of wheelspin going up when I
was

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
was

was
got<00:02:11.890> really<00:02:12.220> steep<00:02:12.460> so<00:02:12.730> there's<00:02:12.940> quite<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.150> lot

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
got really steep so there's quite a lot

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.970 
got really steep so there's quite a lot
of<00:02:13.360> effort<00:02:13.660> going<00:02:13.840> into<00:02:13.990> it<00:02:14.290> coming<00:02:14.710> down<00:02:14.830> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
of effort going into it coming down the

the sort of relative compliance of the

the sort of relative compliance of the
frame<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.200> was<00:02:20.320> quite<00:02:20.500> happy<00:02:20.680> just<00:02:20.800> sort<00:02:21.130> of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
frame and I was quite happy just sort of

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.500 
frame and I was quite happy just sort of
letting<00:02:21.430> go<00:02:21.460> in<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.700> breaks<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.330> going

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
letting go in the breaks and going

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.780 
letting go in the breaks and going
pretty<00:02:23.260> much<00:02:23.350> full<00:02:23.800> bore<00:02:24.010> down<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.370> hill<00:02:24.520> I

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
pretty much full bore down the hill I

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.850 
pretty much full bore down the hill I
have<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.390> admit<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.720> when<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.930> hit<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.320> 90

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
have to admit that when I hit the 90

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.680 
have to admit that when I hit the 90
degree<00:02:26.950> corner<00:02:27.460> being<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.910> little<00:02:28.240> bit<00:02:28.330> happier

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
degree corner being a little bit happier

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.020 
degree corner being a little bit happier
perhaps<00:02:28.930> if<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.200> had<00:02:29.410> say<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.920> wider<00:02:30.190> tire<00:02:30.550> or

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
perhaps if I had say a wider tire or

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.580 
perhaps if I had say a wider tire or
lower<00:02:31.360> pressures<00:02:31.750> or<00:02:31.900> even<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.170> cyclocross

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
lower pressures or even a cyclocross

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.320 
lower pressures or even a cyclocross
tire<00:02:32.920> because<00:02:33.370> there's<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.030> little<00:02:34.210> bit<00:02:34.300> of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
tire because there's a little bit of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.580 
tire because there's a little bit of
drifting<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:34.990> wasn't<00:02:35.260> quite<00:02:35.380> as

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
drifting and it wasn't quite as

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.260 
drifting and it wasn't quite as
controlled<00:02:35.980> as<00:02:36.130> perhaps<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.700> might<00:02:36.850> liked<00:02:37.090> it

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
controlled as perhaps I might liked it

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.610 
controlled as perhaps I might liked it

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.510 
come around the corner there's probably
going<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.500> be<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.650> new<00:02:41.860> view<00:02:42.100> which<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.310> going<00:02:42.430> to

out<00:03:11.170> there<00:03:11.380> perhaps<00:03:11.650> have<00:03:11.920> had<00:03:12.070> slightly
