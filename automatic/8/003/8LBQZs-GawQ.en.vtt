right<00:01:44.330> big<00:01:45.970> missiles<00:01:46.970> on<00:01:47.179> these<00:01:47.390> are<00:01:47.600> very

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
right big missiles on these are very

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.950 
right big missiles on these are very
very<00:01:49.310> strong<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:55.329> like<00:01:56.329> I<00:01:56.450> said<00:01:56.689> you<00:01:56.840> could

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
very strong and like I said you could

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.380 
very strong and like I said you could
probably<00:01:57.200> wear<00:01:57.500> these<00:01:57.679> but<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.390> wouldn't

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
probably wear these but I wouldn't

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.719 
probably wear these but I wouldn't
recommend<00:02:00.319> it<00:02:01.420> only<00:02:02.420> because<00:02:02.750> sometimes<00:02:03.289> the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
recommend it only because sometimes the

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.990 
recommend it only because sometimes the
glue<00:02:04.729> on<00:02:05.030> these<00:02:05.209> dries<00:02:05.690> out<00:02:05.959> and<00:02:06.679> what<00:02:07.640> happens

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
glue on these dries out and what happens

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.460 
glue on these dries out and what happens
is<00:02:08.149> if<00:02:08.269> you're<00:02:08.420> walking<00:02:08.630> on<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.140> after<00:02:09.259> a

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
is if you're walking on and after a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.640 
is if you're walking on and after a
while<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:10.120> may<00:02:11.120> separate<00:02:11.600> from<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.930> upper<00:02:12.080> or

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
while it may separate from the upper or

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.770 
while it may separate from the upper or
they<00:02:12.890> may<00:02:13.040> get<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.250> hole<00:02:13.580> between<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.450> upper

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
they may get a hole between the upper

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.240 
they may get a hole between the upper
and<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.110> missile<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:15.739> then<00:02:15.830> you<00:02:15.980> may<00:02:16.099> get

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
and the missile and then you may get

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.640 
and the missile and then you may get
some<00:02:16.459> air<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.849> here<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.569> then<00:02:18.290> that's<00:02:18.410> when

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
some air in here and then that's when

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.309 
some air in here and then that's when
you<00:02:18.739> start<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.190> have<00:02:19.280> problems<00:02:19.489> but<00:02:20.319> they

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
you start to have problems but they

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.770 
you start to have problems but they
appear<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.709> be<00:02:21.920> wearable<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.760> I<00:02:22.819> have<00:02:23.510> walked

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
appear to be wearable and I have walked

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.089 
appear to be wearable and I have walked
around<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.200> knees<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.620> didn't<00:02:24.950> have<00:02:25.069> a

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
around the knees and I didn't have a

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.770 
around the knees and I didn't have a
problem<00:02:25.430> but<00:02:27.250> I'm<00:02:28.250> not<00:02:28.730> putting<00:02:29.660> any
