tie<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:35.019> no<00:00:35.170> one<00:00:35.350> noticed<00:00:35.620> it<00:00:35.710> it<00:00:36.039> took<00:00:36.989> six

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
tie and no one noticed it it took six

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.020 
tie and no one noticed it it took six
times<00:00:38.320> before<00:00:38.590> my<00:00:39.070> best<00:00:39.250> friend<00:00:39.579> said<00:00:39.760> I<00:00:39.789> like

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
times before my best friend said I like

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.970 
times before my best friend said I like
that<00:00:40.210> time<00:00:40.449> I<00:00:40.840> don't<00:00:41.379> think<00:00:41.559> anybody<00:00:41.859> was

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
that time I don't think anybody was

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.860 
that time I don't think anybody was
looking<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.879> I<00:00:42.969> think<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.329> if<00:00:43.449> we<00:00:43.570> want<00:00:43.780> to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
looking and I think that if we want to

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.160 
looking and I think that if we want to
develop<00:00:44.170> our<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:44.920> we<00:00:44.980> really<00:00:45.219> want<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.429> have

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
develop our and we really want to have

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.509 
develop our and we really want to have
understanding<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.530> it<00:00:47.649> and<00:00:47.800> especially<00:00:47.890> in

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
understanding of it and especially in

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.310 
understanding of it and especially in
the<00:00:48.609> pictures<00:00:48.940> that<00:00:48.969> we<00:00:49.179> have<00:00:49.359> we<00:00:50.050> need<00:00:50.170> to

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
the pictures that we have we need to

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.380 
the pictures that we have we need to
stop<00:00:50.530> looking<00:00:50.710> at<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.100> names<00:00:51.339> thinking<00:00:52.179> about

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
stop looking at the names thinking about

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.209 
stop looking at the names thinking about
the<00:00:52.510> concepts<00:00:53.019> and<00:00:53.170> start<00:00:53.469> looking<00:00:53.949> at<00:00:54.070> the

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
the concepts and start looking at the

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.700 
the concepts and start looking at the
image<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.789> what<00:00:55.210> exactly<00:00:55.539> was<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.350> concept

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
image and what exactly was the concept

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.860 
image and what exactly was the concept
shows<00:00:56.980> us<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.309> make<00:00:57.460> this<00:00:57.609> hands<00:00:57.999> like<00:00:58.390> that<00:00:58.420> we

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
shows us to make this hands like that we

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.389 
shows us to make this hands like that we
chose<00:00:59.079> to<00:00:59.289> have<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.589> blue<00:00:59.769> each<00:01:00.100> shows

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
chose to have the blue each shows

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.290 
chose to have the blue each shows
instead<00:01:01.149> of<00:01:01.690> that<00:01:02.519> to<00:01:03.519> not<00:01:03.730> paint<00:01:03.999> them<00:01:04.269> like

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
instead of that to not paint them like

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.260 
instead of that to not paint them like
that<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:05.710> he<00:01:05.770> wanted<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.400> always<00:01:06.670> interested

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
that if he wanted to always interested

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.060 
that if he wanted to always interested
or<00:01:07.420> whatever<00:01:07.720> doesn't<00:01:08.110> matter<00:01:08.260> we<00:01:08.830> just

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
or whatever doesn't matter we just

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.770 
or whatever doesn't matter we just
picked<00:01:09.400> them<00:01:09.520> like<00:01:09.730> that<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.180> that's<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:10.540> very

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
picked them like that and that's a very

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.040 
picked them like that and that's a very
different<00:01:11.020> message<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:13.150> then<00:01:13.660> we<00:01:13.780> have<00:01:13.930> our

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
different message and then we have our

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.380 
different message and then we have our
urinals<00:01:14.500> this<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.250> this<00:01:15.550> was<00:01:15.760> actually<00:01:15.940> voted

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
urinals this is this was actually voted

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.270 
urinals this is this was actually voted
the<00:01:16.480> most<00:01:16.510> important<00:01:17.170> work<00:01:17.440> of<00:01:17.620> art<00:01:17.860> into<00:01:18.190> a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
the most important work of art into a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
century by students of England I think

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.270 
century by students of England I think
that<00:01:20.740> says<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.950> lot

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
that says a lot

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.510 
that says a lot
I'm<00:01:21.640> not<00:01:21.940> judging<00:01:22.360> what<00:01:22.810> that<00:01:23.110> means<00:01:23.410> but<00:01:24.370> I'm

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
I'm not judging what that means but I'm

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.000 
I'm not judging what that means but I'm
doing<00:01:24.910> why<00:01:25.090> didn't<00:01:25.390> technically<00:01:25.750> swore<00:01:29.010> I'm

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
doing why didn't technically swore I'm

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.500 
doing why didn't technically swore I'm
taking<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.610> context<00:01:31.030> out<00:01:31.240> we're<00:01:31.480> just

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
taking the context out we're just

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.690 
taking the context out we're just
talking<00:01:31.990> about<00:01:32.050> how<00:01:32.230> things<00:01:32.350> are<00:01:32.650> made<00:01:32.890> I'm

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
talking about how things are made I'm

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.190 
talking about how things are made I'm
not<00:01:33.910> talking<00:01:34.300> about<00:01:34.390> whether<00:01:34.750> they<00:01:34.930> should<00:01:34.960> or

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
not talking about whether they should or

should not be important I'm not making

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.840 
should not be important I'm not making
fun<00:01:37.690> of<00:01:38.230> the<00:01:38.380> urinal<00:01:38.740> necessarily<00:01:39.430> because<00:01:39.730> it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
fun of the urinal necessarily because it

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.750 
fun of the urinal necessarily because it
was<00:01:40.000> very<00:01:40.360> interesting<00:01:40.780> in<00:01:41.110> 1913<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:42.340> make<00:01:42.550> fun

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
was very interesting in 1913 to make fun

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.150 
was very interesting in 1913 to make fun
of<00:01:42.790> pretension<00:01:43.420> but<00:01:43.630> I<00:01:44.170> am<00:01:44.290> talking<00:01:44.500> about<00:01:44.800> the

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
of pretension but I am talking about the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.810 
of pretension but I am talking about the
meaning<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.880> something<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.720> its<00:01:47.820> context

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
meaning of something and its context

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.010 
meaning of something and its context
especially<00:01:48.910> with<00:01:49.450> some<00:01:49.630> year

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
especially with some year

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.520 
especially with some year
like<00:01:50.469> that<00:01:51.000> that's<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.240> different<00:01:52.659> thing<00:01:52.719> and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
like that that's a different thing and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.050 
like that that's a different thing and
that's<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.979> thing<00:01:54.189> we're<00:01:54.490> starting<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.909> talk

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
that's the thing we're starting to talk

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.669 
that's the thing we're starting to talk
about<00:01:55.119> execution<00:01:55.840> because<00:01:56.289> that's<00:01:56.469> not

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
about execution because that's not

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:57.899 
about execution because that's not
