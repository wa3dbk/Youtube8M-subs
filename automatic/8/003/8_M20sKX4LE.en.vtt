rid of rain who likes rain now of course

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.220 
rid of rain who likes rain now of course
waypoints<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.660> want<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.900> go<00:02:00.990> ahead<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
waypoints if you want to go ahead and

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.020 
waypoints if you want to go ahead and
press<00:02:01.320> P<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.010> actually<00:02:02.160> create<00:02:02.460> waypoints

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
press P we can actually create waypoints

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.720 
press P we can actually create waypoints
I<00:02:03.120> don't<00:02:03.300> really<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.690> any<00:02:04.100> created<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.370> it's

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
I don't really have any created so it's

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.920 
I don't really have any created so it's
not<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.210> look<00:02:06.360> at<00:02:06.480> any<00:02:06.660> of<00:02:06.720> those

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
not really going to look at any of those

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.480 
not really going to look at any of those
but<00:02:07.260> of<00:02:07.350> course<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.650> you<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.009> waypoints

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
but of course if you do have waypoints

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.650 
but of course if you do have waypoints
then<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.820> go<00:02:08.910> ahead<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.119> press<00:02:09.300> P<00:02:09.450> and

then you can go ahead and press P and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.230 
then you can go ahead and press P and
get<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.960> waypoint<00:02:10.200> go<00:02:10.560> ahead<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:11.009> set<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.550> now

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
get a waypoint go ahead and set up now

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.400 
get a waypoint go ahead and set up now
of<00:02:12.420> course<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.750> can<00:02:12.900> actually<00:02:13.020> see<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
of course you can actually see the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.960 
of course you can actually see the
coordinates<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.010> which<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.340> are<00:02:14.490> looking<00:02:14.850> on

well as the block in which we are
looking<00:02:21.630> at<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.990> Sheep<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.350> right<00:02:22.530> there

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
looking at it the Sheep is right there

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.790 
looking at it the Sheep is right there
it<00:02:22.800> will<00:02:22.890> show<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.130> exactly<00:02:23.580> what<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.090> um

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
it will show you exactly what it's um

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.110 
it will show you exactly what it's um
directions<00:02:25.800> are<00:02:25.950> if<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.640> want<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.880> go<00:02:26.970> ahead

poured that other ports speaking of the
horses<00:02:32.400> she<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.940> goodness's<00:02:33.600> if<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:34.170> look

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
horses she be goodness's if we look

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.080 
horses she be goodness's if we look
above<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.680> binocular<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.520> will<00:02:35.640> actually<00:02:35.760> be

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
above the binocular we will actually be

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.910 
above the binocular we will actually be
able<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.360> see<00:02:36.600> what<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.080> are<00:02:37.110> looking<00:02:37.470> at<00:02:37.709> them

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
able to see what we are looking at them

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.710 
able to see what we are looking at them
now<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.160> course<00:02:38.310> if<00:02:38.520> we're<00:02:39.060> looking<00:02:39.209> very

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
now of course if we're looking very

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.390 
now of course if we're looking very
often<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.170> distance<00:02:40.590> we<00:02:40.709> may<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.100> even<00:02:41.160> be

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
often to the distance we may not even be

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.949 
often to the distance we may not even be
able<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.670> tell<00:02:41.910> if<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.360> sheep<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.810> mean

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
able to tell if this is a sheep I mean

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.170 
able to tell if this is a sheep I mean
if<00:02:43.080> we<00:02:43.200> go<00:02:43.320> down<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.950> default<00:02:44.489> witches<00:02:44.940> are

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
if we go down to the default witches are

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.050 
if we go down to the default witches are
I<00:02:45.420> mean<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.470> kind<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.160> looks<00:02:47.370> like<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.550> sheep<00:02:47.850> or

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
I mean it kind of looks like a sheep or

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.470 
I mean it kind of looks like a sheep or
it<00:02:48.209> could<00:02:48.360> be<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.570> dreamin<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:49.500> hell<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:51.390> is

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
it could be a dreamin from hell that is

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.510 
it could be a dreamin from hell that is
probably<00:02:51.600> actually<00:02:52.020> just<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.530> sheep<00:02:52.770> but<00:02:53.370> of

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
probably actually just a sheep but of

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.250 
probably actually just a sheep but of
course<00:02:53.700> we<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:54.030> go<00:02:54.390> ahead<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:55.200> know

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
course we can go ahead and you know

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.470 
course we can go ahead and you know
really<00:02:55.560> concrete<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.700> conclusion<00:02:57.180> by

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
really concrete that conclusion by

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.420 
really concrete that conclusion by
looking<00:02:57.840> up<00:02:57.930> above<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.440> seeing<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.070> yes

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
looking up above it and seeing that yes

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.660 
looking up above it and seeing that yes
this<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.150> indeed<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.750> sheep<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:02.190> will<00:03:02.310> even<00:03:02.459> give

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
this is indeed a sheep it will even give

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.520 
this is indeed a sheep it will even give
you<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.790> little<00:03:03.030> picture<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.870> sheet<00:03:04.050> just<00:03:04.410> to

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
you a little picture of a sheet just to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.170 
you a little picture of a sheet just to
prove<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.920> just<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.250> little<00:03:05.280> bit<00:03:05.489> more<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:06.090> will

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
prove it just a little bit more it will

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.699 
prove it just a little bit more it will
also<00:03:06.360> tell<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.690> how<00:03:06.840> much<00:03:06.989> health<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.530> sheep

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
also tell you how much health this sheep

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.729 
also tell you how much health this sheep
has<00:03:07.950> as<00:03:08.220> well<00:03:08.790> as<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.720> direction<00:03:10.019> which<00:03:10.380> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
has as well as the direction which the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.470 
has as well as the direction which the
sheep<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.130> which<00:03:11.430> will<00:03:11.610> actually<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:12.030> located

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
sheep is which will actually be located

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.660 
sheep is which will actually be located
on<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.660> very<00:03:12.870> left<00:03:13.350> of<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.950> binocular<00:03:14.430> that's

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
on the very left of the binocular that's

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.370 
on the very left of the binocular that's
where<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.060> West<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.600> ok<00:03:15.840> if<00:03:16.019> we<00:03:16.080> look<00:03:16.290> over

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
where that West is ok if we look over

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.740 
where that West is ok if we look over
