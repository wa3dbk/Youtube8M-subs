00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.920 
what we're going to do is we're going to
take<00:02:32.680> two<00:02:32.920> cups<00:02:33.129> of<00:02:33.280> walnuts<00:02:33.640> now<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.629> nuts

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
take two cups of walnuts now up the nuts

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.020 
take two cups of walnuts now up the nuts
are<00:02:35.170> usually<00:02:35.590> better<00:02:35.769> soak<00:02:36.129> overnight<00:02:36.640> before

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
are usually better soak overnight before

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.479 
are usually better soak overnight before
you<00:02:37.299> use<00:02:37.510> them<00:02:37.769> they're<00:02:38.769> easier<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.190> digest

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
you use them they're easier to digest

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.970 
you use them they're easier to digest
that<00:02:39.879> release<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.299> enzyme<00:02:40.690> inhibitors<00:02:41.200> so

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
that release the enzyme inhibitors so

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.170 
that release the enzyme inhibitors so
it'd<00:02:42.099> be<00:02:42.129> better<00:02:42.400> if<00:02:42.579> you<00:02:42.670> stop<00:02:42.910> with<00:02:43.060> us

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
it'd be better if you stop with us

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.729 
it'd be better if you stop with us
overnight<00:02:43.450> but<00:02:43.750> be<00:02:43.870> careful<00:02:44.290> because<00:02:44.319> if

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
overnight but be careful because if

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.039 
overnight but be careful because if
you're<00:02:45.220> making<00:02:45.579> a<00:02:45.670> recipe<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.510> are

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
you're making a recipe and you are

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.440 
you're making a recipe and you are
soaking<00:02:47.560> nuts<00:02:47.890> over<00:02:48.069> night<00:02:48.430> when<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.090> have<00:02:49.299> to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
soaking nuts over night when you have to

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.690 
soaking nuts over night when you have to
do<00:02:49.629> is<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:50.109> the<00:02:50.260> recipe<00:02:50.680> calls<00:02:50.920> for<00:02:51.069> liquid<00:02:51.609> in

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
do is if the recipe calls for liquid in

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.699 
do is if the recipe calls for liquid in
a<00:02:51.819> recipe<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.750> have<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.989> cut<00:02:53.230> down<00:02:53.410> on<00:02:53.620> the

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
a recipe you have to cut down on the

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.770 
a recipe you have to cut down on the
liquid<00:02:54.040> for<00:02:54.190> example<00:02:54.700> let's<00:02:54.879> say<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.450> recipe

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
liquid for example let's say the recipe

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.520 
liquid for example let's say the recipe
says<00:02:55.989> use<00:02:56.650> 1<00:02:57.609> cup<00:02:57.639> of<00:02:57.880> nuts<00:02:58.269> with<00:02:58.780> 2<00:02:59.109> cups<00:02:59.319> of

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
says use 1 cup of nuts with 2 cups of

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.349 
says use 1 cup of nuts with 2 cups of
water<00:02:59.769> well<00:03:00.340> if<00:03:00.489> you're<00:03:00.639> so<00:03:00.849> good<00:03:01.060> or<00:03:01.209> nuts

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
water well if you're so good or nuts

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:02.789 
water well if you're so good or nuts
overnight<00:03:01.810> there's<00:03:02.139> already<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.500> lot<00:03:02.620> more

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
overnight there's already a lot more

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.740 
overnight there's already a lot more
water<00:03:03.069> within<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.730> nuts<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.420> you're<00:03:04.569> going<00:03:04.660> to

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
water within the nuts so you're going to

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.870 
water within the nuts so you're going to
use<00:03:04.870> less<00:03:05.079> water<00:03:05.319> in<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.590> recipe<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.579> want

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
use less water in a recipe so you want

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.330 
use less water in a recipe so you want
to<00:03:06.970> start<00:03:07.000> over<00:03:07.239> using<00:03:07.569> let's<00:03:07.840> say<00:03:08.069> one<00:03:09.069> cup<00:03:09.310> of

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
to start over using let's say one cup of

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.309 
to start over using let's say one cup of
nuts<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.819> assault<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.540> one<00:03:10.720> cup<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:10.989> water

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
nuts that assault and one cup of water

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.259 
nuts that assault and one cup of water
and<00:03:11.590> then<00:03:11.919> you<00:03:12.010> can<00:03:12.130> slowly<00:03:12.430> add<00:03:12.760> enough<00:03:13.239> water

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
and then you can slowly add enough water

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.780 
and then you can slowly add enough water
in<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:13.989> get<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.230> consistency<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.919> want<00:03:15.010> but

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
in to get the consistency you want but

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.729 
in to get the consistency you want but
these<00:03:16.239> nuts<00:03:16.599> should<00:03:16.989> have<00:03:17.079> been<00:03:17.169> soaked<00:03:17.470> last
