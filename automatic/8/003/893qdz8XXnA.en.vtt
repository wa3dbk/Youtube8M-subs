of a history we had a bunch of one more
times<00:01:53.090> in<00:01:53.300> palm<00:01:53.480> beach<00:01:53.690> this<00:01:53.930> year<00:01:54.490> where<00:01:55.490> he

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
times in palm beach this year where he

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.360 
times in palm beach this year where he

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
drilled me in the door pretty good and I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.920 
drilled me in the door pretty good and I

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
told him he better keep his foot in here

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.000 
told him he better keep his foot in here
otherwise<00:02:00.170> I'm<00:02:00.410> gonna<00:02:00.500> drill<00:02:00.770> him<00:02:00.830> in<00:02:00.950> the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
otherwise I'm gonna drill him in the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.630 
otherwise I'm gonna drill him in the
door<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.570> sure<00:02:02.570> enough<00:02:02.800> on<00:02:03.800> our<00:02:03.830> very<00:02:04.310> first

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
door and sure enough on our very first

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.880 
door and sure enough on our very first
room<00:02:04.910> when<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.120> followed<00:02:05.600> him<00:02:05.750> coming<00:02:06.740> out<00:02:06.830> of

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
room when I followed him coming out of

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.040 
room when I followed him coming out of
the<00:02:07.010> last<00:02:07.220> turn<00:02:07.610> on<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.210> was<00:02:08.509> really<00:02:08.899> close

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
the last turn on you I was really close

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.050 
the last turn on you I was really close
and<00:02:09.170> started<00:02:09.800> adding<00:02:10.070> a<00:02:10.160> lot

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.229 

from<00:02:13.450> my<00:02:13.690> perspective<00:02:14.099> he<00:02:15.099> has<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:15.640> much<00:02:15.760> angle

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
from my perspective he has so much angle

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.120 
from my perspective he has so much angle
he<00:02:16.510> had<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.720> back<00:02:16.930> out<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.470> gas<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.010> that's

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
he had to back out of the gas and that's

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.410 
he had to back out of the gas and that's
why<00:02:18.280> you're<00:02:18.370> supposed<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.700> be<00:02:18.760> full<00:02:18.970> throttle

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
why you're supposed to be full throttle

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.140 
why you're supposed to be full throttle
and<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:20.020> kept<00:02:20.380> my<00:02:20.470> foot<00:02:20.709> in<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.640> drilled<00:02:22.000> him

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
and I kept my foot in and I drilled him

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.540 
and I kept my foot in and I drilled him
thinking<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.900> judges<00:02:23.290> would<00:02:23.440> see<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.950> he

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
thinking the judges would see that he

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.280 
thinking the judges would see that he
had<00:02:24.700> too<00:02:24.910> much<00:02:24.940> angle<00:02:25.540> we<00:02:25.750> shouldn't<00:02:26.170> have

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
had too much angle we shouldn't have

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.990 
had too much angle we shouldn't have
that<00:02:26.500> much<00:02:26.680> angle<00:02:27.069> trying<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.370> cut<00:02:27.580> me<00:02:27.610> you

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
that much angle trying to cut me you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.910 
that much angle trying to cut me you
know<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.120> chop<00:02:28.540> off<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.989> follow<00:02:29.230> driver<00:02:29.650> which

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
know to chop off the follow driver which

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.350 
know to chop off the follow driver which
which<00:02:30.130> isn't<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.489> way<00:02:30.610> we<00:02:30.640> do<00:02:30.880> stuff<00:02:31.180> out<00:02:31.330> here

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
which isn't the way we do stuff out here

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.199 
which isn't the way we do stuff out here
so<00:02:31.989> then<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.560> my<00:02:32.739> lead<00:02:32.980> run<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.400> went<00:02:33.670> balls<00:02:34.090> to

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
so then on my lead run I went balls to

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.070 
so then on my lead run I went balls to
the<00:02:34.300> wall<00:02:34.540> great<00:02:34.959> run

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
the wall great run

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.850 
the wall great run
ended<00:02:36.530> up<00:02:36.620> doing<00:02:36.860> one<00:02:37.070> more<00:02:37.100> time<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.680> one

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
ended up doing one more time on to one

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.630 
ended up doing one more time on to one
more<00:02:40.070> time<00:02:40.340> whenever<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.240> fall<00:02:41.300> upon

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
more time whenever I fall upon

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.820 
more time whenever I fall upon
I<00:02:42.700> had<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.360> bit<00:02:43.540> of<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.720> shady<00:02:43.990> run<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.710> know

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
I had a bit of a shady run you know

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.400 
I had a bit of a shady run you know
couldn't<00:02:45.130> quite<00:02:45.370> connect<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.910> trip<00:02:46.180> from<00:02:47.170> the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
couldn't quite connect the trip from the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.370 
couldn't quite connect the trip from the
outside<00:02:48.220> zone<00:02:48.550> of<00:02:48.850> turn<00:02:49.120> two<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.050> last

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
outside zone of turn two to the last

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.410 
outside zone of turn two to the last
turn<00:02:50.709> it<00:02:51.430> wasn't<00:02:51.760> clean<00:02:52.030> as<00:02:52.120> he<00:02:52.209> should<00:02:52.390> have

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
turn it wasn't clean as he should have

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.600 
turn it wasn't clean as he should have
been<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.900> think<00:02:53.800> Vaughn<00:02:54.040> might<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.430> had<00:02:54.580> a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
been I think Vaughn might have had a

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.309 
been I think Vaughn might have had a
mistake<00:02:54.970> behind<00:02:55.300> me<00:02:55.480> but<00:02:55.660> apparently<00:02:55.810> my

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
mistake behind me but apparently my

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.320 
mistake behind me but apparently my
mistake<00:02:56.680> was<00:02:56.709> worse<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.490> von<00:02:57.880> ended<00:02:58.209> up

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
mistake was worse so von ended up

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.870 
mistake was worse so von ended up
walking<00:02:58.540> off<00:02:58.930> with<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:59.260> victory<00:02:59.500> a<00:03:00.100> bit<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.820> a
