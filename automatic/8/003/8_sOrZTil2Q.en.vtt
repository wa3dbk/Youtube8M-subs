00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.210
 good morning everyone and it was something and 

00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:05.799
 welcome to a video blog hello that this 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.640
 He has the reasons for his video blog and 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.160
 You are doing 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.480
 pokémon gold random blog but I do not know if I 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.509
 you are seeing good in you because 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.280
 blogger know that I know nothing because the 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.350
 room you are not watching pokemon 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.810
 saving it for something that many people already 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.330
 know about basically twitter and it's 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.790
 this the problem the problem of 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.580
 computer seems to be fucked 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.860
 just exploded inside or that 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.180
 it seems like I 'm sorry for the mess 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.490
 what's here but I 'm going to take it 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.770
 right now to fix so normal 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.420
 that is a little bit of that order to ete 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.760
 percent now I do have this but with 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.740
 this I can not record because for example 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.150
 minecraft series of Saturday 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.310
 starts on Saturday pixel moon I can not 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.630
 record it and that's why I decided to take it 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.880
 now I will tell more or less what has 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.630
 happened for people who are more curious 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.800
 and gossip 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.180
 that's why I can not basically record 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.410
 pokémon gold random or that is not 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.720
 living pokemon saving what 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.310
 obviously, but I could not record it 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.440
 basically because it does not work is to say 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.420
 is that it does not start me and I have all the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.579
 Pokemon gold random series theme 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.440
 what obviously if not then yes that 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.610
 you are watching if I know you are watching 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.770
 this series 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.270
 what happens more or less was recording 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.980
 and rendering was putting him 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.110
 pretty cane and suddenly he did kun and 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.300
 exploded exploded went out 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.280
 it went off it basically went off and when 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.060
 I wanted to understand it here is the button 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.610
 switched on 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.079
 it does not work and it does not go and when it does not go 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.729
 by nova in fact right now is 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.799
 off we 'll try again I'll 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.500
 to hit the typical power button 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.840
 button this on off to this is indeed 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.590
 turn on that little light that wants 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.420
 say that this power supply gives 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.189
 enough light enough for that 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.630
 light is turned on therefore in theory 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.429
 it should not be the power source 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.250
 in theory or yes the truth that I do not know 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.229
 but if we give the power button 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.960
 it does not work I do not know if you listen to a brief 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.039
 beep button problem of the Kuchis 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.090
 because the sound of the mobile is not 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.369
 too good 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.259
 just one beep in plan pi which is a 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.030
 from here and when I do the typical 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.030
 keep the vote of this pulsed 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.670
 it's a beep how it goes off is 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.349
 as I think it's clear to try the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.550
 source although of light I believe that the 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.459
 Fundéu prove the power and for what 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.049
 Carried talking with PC such components 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.510
 what and the problem is that with pc 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.069
 components so I do not have to wear what 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.840
 I have to bring etcetera etcetera so 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.540
 both should be a couple of weeks or 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.489
 a week without this computer thing that 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.870
 basically, it's not cool for me to be 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.010
 like two weeks and néstor giver and two 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.840
 weeks without being able to climb pokemon 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.430
 saving what obviously delay 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.900
 the pixel moon series so what 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.239
 decided to go to a store here 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.299
 down my house that fixes computers 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.769
 and they told me to take it and that I 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.209
 they change the power supply for another 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.129
 and if not the source of food, 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.980
 nothing happens I change to something else and so on 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.360
 etcetera so I'll take it there and if it's 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.910
 the power source changed it from 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.829
 there and therefore should I should not 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.000
 have for tomorrow and if not at the source 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.799
 food because yes it takes it to 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.329
 components and such price so all 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.769
 guys put the comments and pray 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.049
 because it is the power source and 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.549
 let it be a brief problem because as not 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.989
 I know the food source travel throughout 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.180
 the tail and that means I have to 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.680
 delay series as I say pixel money 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.850
 I have to cancel or at least 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.800
 freeze thirst better 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.270
 of gold pokémon saving what the subject 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.710
 of mario carne is not a problem 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.060
 because I was marking here is a 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.410
 capturing that I can connect to this 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.300
 computer without any problem 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.560
 I already have this in mac as in 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.640
 windows so there's no kind of 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.380
 problem is the computer with which 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.670
 I used to work before so there's no code 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.760
 no problem 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.010
 so mark is still at 8 o'clock 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.720
 least I hope to have it by 8 o'clock 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.910
 problem is the webcam that I have it 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.740
 installed here and the webcam can not be 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.330
 install a webcam here in this topic 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.870
 that in this computer but basically 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.750
 has this webcam installed here that does not 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.730
 it looks inclusive or more or better or equal if 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.800
 more or better if clear tail looks the same or 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.660
 better than that other nothing else I hope 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.920
 have liked this video blog I'm sorry 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.750

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.270
 random or but in what there is 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.010
 happens and I shit on the tail queue in 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.570
 this moment should have should have 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.550
 the kit shirt every I shit on the 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.400
 cradle but in what there is now has given me 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.439
 a little bottle and it has taken me 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.700
 but I like this video so leave a 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.769
