still<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:36.780> very<00:01:36.869> solid<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.470> well<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.060> on<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
still very very solid as well so on the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.690 
still very very solid as well so on the
front<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.170> 5-inch<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.920> full<00:01:41.280> 1080p

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700

display<00:01:42.649> on<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.710> inside<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
display on the inside you have a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.219 
display on the inside you have a
Snapdragon<00:01:46.549> 810<00:01:47.549> processor<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.020> most

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
Snapdragon 810 processor so the most

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.440 
Snapdragon 810 processor so the most
advanced<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.100> an<00:01:50.189> octa-core<00:01:50.549> processor

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
advanced what is an octa-core processor

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.530 
advanced what is an octa-core processor
on<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.630> market<00:01:52.399> 3<00:01:53.399> gigabytes<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.909> RAM<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.450> they

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
on the market 3 gigabytes of RAM so they

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.870 
on the market 3 gigabytes of RAM so they
improve<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.219> 32<00:01:56.219> gigabytes<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.729> internal

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.880 
built upon it so we've heard it likened
into<00:02:29.470> like<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.920> porsche<00:02:30.340> BMW<00:02:30.520> where<00:02:31.300> new<00:02:32.290> new

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
into like the porsche BMW where new new

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.500 
into like the porsche BMW where new new
body<00:02:33.100> cells<00:02:33.430> come<00:02:33.700> out<00:02:33.850> but<00:02:34.090> they<00:02:34.209> want<00:02:34.420> to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
body cells come out but they want to

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.410 
body cells come out but they want to
keep<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.590> trimmed<00:02:35.920> its<00:02:36.400> be<00:02:36.519> very<00:02:36.730> familiar<00:02:36.910> so

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
keep it trimmed its be very familiar so

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.670 
keep it trimmed its be very familiar so
consumers<00:02:37.900> know<00:02:38.080> what<00:02:38.200> they're<00:02:38.320> getting<00:02:38.440> and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
consumers know what they're getting and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.479 
consumers know what they're getting and
that's<00:02:38.890> kind<00:02:39.100> of<00:02:39.130> what<00:02:39.220> they've<00:02:39.340> done<00:02:39.430> here

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
that's kind of what they've done here

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.160 
that's kind of what they've done here
with<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.790> one<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.060> nine<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:40.570> i<00:02:40.750> thought<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.110> was

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
with the one of nine so i thought it was

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.479 
with the one of nine so i thought it was
completely<00:02:41.680> identical<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.459> previous

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
completely identical to the previous

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.759 
completely identical to the previous
version<00:02:42.910> but<00:02:43.269> it's<00:02:43.420> not<00:02:43.570> there's<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.320> whole<00:02:44.560> lot

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
version but it's not there's a whole lot

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.500 
version but it's not there's a whole lot
of<00:02:44.800> nice<00:02:45.400> little<00:02:45.760> improvement<00:02:46.269> and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
of nice little improvement and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.710 
of nice little improvement and
differences<00:02:47.200> here<00:02:47.440> so<00:02:47.709> odd<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.510> just<00:02:49.630> a

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
differences here so odd that is just a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.160 
differences here so odd that is just a
very<00:02:49.750> quick<00:02:50.080> look<00:02:50.560> at<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.980> HTC<00:02:51.100> One<00:02:51.580> m9<00:02:52.170> with

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
very quick look at the HTC One m9 with

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.750 
very quick look at the HTC One m9 with
