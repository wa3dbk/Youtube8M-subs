it's all nice and clean
62,000<00:01:31.030> kilometers<00:01:31.390> this<00:01:31.930> is<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.229> sort<00:01:32.470> of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
62,000 kilometers this is the sort of

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.530 
62,000 kilometers this is the sort of
car<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:33.400> you'd<00:01:33.490> expect<00:01:33.610> if<00:01:34.090> it's<00:01:34.270> been<00:01:34.420> in

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
car that you'd expect if it's been in

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.060 
car that you'd expect if it's been in
kept<00:01:34.720> in<00:01:34.869> very<00:01:35.080> good<00:01:35.259> condition<00:01:37.890> I'll<00:01:38.890> just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
kept in very good condition I'll just

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.249 
kept in very good condition I'll just
run<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.369> camera<00:01:39.640> along<00:01:39.790> once<00:01:40.750> again<00:01:40.990> so<00:01:41.170> you

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
run the camera along once again so you

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:55.749 
run the camera along once again so you
can<00:01:41.409> see<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.740> it's<00:01:41.860> all<00:01:41.950> clean

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.550 

so<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.450> interior<00:01:56.780> grade<00:01:56.960> on<00:01:57.079> this<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.350> beat

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
so the interior grade on this is a beat

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.469 
so the interior grade on this is a beat
which<00:01:57.770> means<00:01:58.039> pretty<00:01:58.759> much<00:01:58.880> as<00:01:59.119> clean<00:01:59.299> as<00:01:59.390> you

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
which means pretty much as clean as you

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.840 
which means pretty much as clean as you
can<00:01:59.570> get<00:01:59.689> for<00:01:59.840> this<00:01:59.960> particular<00:02:00.200> age<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.640> see

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
can get for this particular age and see

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.410 
can get for this particular age and see
all<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.149> seats<00:02:02.450> all<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.020> fabric<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:04.070> good

windows work you probably see they're

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.130 
windows work you probably see they're
popping<00:03:37.190> down<00:03:37.460> nicely

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
popping down nicely

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.450

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
they're all OneTouch power windows we've

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.730 
they're all OneTouch power windows we've
got<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.010> mirrors<00:03:46.550> there<00:03:47.380> I'll<00:03:48.380> just<00:03:48.530> show<00:03:48.710> you

that<00:03:48.860> again<00:03:49.160> from<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.520> other<00:03:49.640> side<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:50.030> can

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
that again from the other side you can

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.070 
that again from the other side you can
see<00:03:50.180> they're<00:03:50.450> all<00:03:50.570> working<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.690> we'll<00:03:53.930> give<00:03:54.050> it

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
see they're all working so we'll give it

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.240 
see they're all working so we'll give it
a<00:03:54.170> little<00:03:54.200> Rev<00:03:54.500> hop<00:03:54.710> out<00:03:54.860> and<00:03:54.890> look<00:03:55.070> at<00:03:55.160> the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
a little Rev hop out and look at the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.199 
a little Rev hop out and look at the
engine

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.959 

I<00:04:01.109> think<00:04:02.109> you<00:04:02.200> can<00:04:02.349> probably<00:04:02.530> tell<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.730> is<00:04:03.939> a

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:03.969 
I think you can probably tell that is a

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.860 
I think you can probably tell that is a
beautiful<00:04:04.510> free-flowing<00:04:05.170> engine<00:04:06.569> these<00:04:07.569> cars

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
beautiful free-flowing engine these cars

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.569 
beautiful free-flowing engine these cars
are<00:04:08.049> really<00:04:08.170> light<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.769> nimble<00:04:08.980> they're

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
are really light and nimble they're

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:15.449 
are really light and nimble they're
actually<00:04:10.079> handle<00:04:11.079> wonderfully<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:15.340> we'll

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
actually handle wonderfully so we'll

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.800 
actually handle wonderfully so we'll
have<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.579> good<00:04:15.670> look<00:04:15.939> at<00:04:16.030> this<00:04:16.150> engine<00:04:16.389> you<00:04:16.690> can

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
have a good look at this engine you can

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.840 
have a good look at this engine you can
see<00:04:17.049> that<00:04:17.229> it<00:04:17.410> is<00:04:17.590> absolutely<00:04:17.949> spotlessly

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
see that it is absolutely spotlessly

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.999 
see that it is absolutely spotlessly
clean<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.539> lot<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.169> these<00:04:20.259> get<00:04:20.530> leaking<00:04:20.919> around

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
clean a lot of these get leaking around

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.400 
clean a lot of these get leaking around
here<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:21.820> lot<00:04:22.389> of<00:04:22.419> them<00:04:22.600> leak<00:04:22.840> around<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.289> oil

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
here a lot of them leak around the oil

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.800 
here a lot of them leak around the oil
filter<00:04:23.889> housing<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:25.030> can<00:04:25.120> also<00:04:25.300> get<00:04:25.600> some

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
filter housing you can also get some

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.990 
filter housing you can also get some
leaks<00:04:26.020> up<00:04:26.259> there<00:04:26.500> along<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:27.580> top<00:04:27.789> of<00:04:27.940> the

leaks up there along the the top of the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.570 
leaks up there along the the top of the
valve<00:04:28.240> cover<00:04:28.330> but<00:04:29.080> all<00:04:29.259> of<00:04:29.410> it<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.680> absolutely

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
valve cover but all of it is absolutely
