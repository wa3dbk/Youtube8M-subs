 his years 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.860
 what's up tomorrow welcome to another video 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.710

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.990
 trick so you can get in 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.840
 parties like other friends and although not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.330
 you have a goal more than 750 goals you do not have 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.150
 account for gallant team life and that 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.790
 leave her like other friends 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:36.150
 in the group as you see I do not have to 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.990
 we have less say that with this trick not 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.030
 are you going to be able to play just talk 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.289
 OK 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.289
 the head you can see here 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.470
 is going to try to put a part of 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.470
 model 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.559
 We still find them very useful and only 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.680
 I can talk with the friends of players 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.420
 that if you're good I get the hang of it 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.809
 that precisely I have searched for 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.360
 a friend of mine with a power friend 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.340
 corpse that for example he plays another 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.670
 console play the playstation 4 but you 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.530
 like to be from when good others 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.119
 speaking the particle in this way 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.440
 may be speaking will of the contribution 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.480
 and without paying my work to another with sweat 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.940
 It can also serve because you 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.040
 Thursday always just be but one day 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.510
 wants to be a soccer game with some 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.890
 friends then look so be seeing 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.380
 football and you're talking to your 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.140
 sports friends you can not have 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.020
 utilities video I actually trick 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.760
 he looks for it because we register it and 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.400
 here is from the government 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.880
 the trick is very simple is like 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.680
 visitor has started the game world of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.760
 town and when starting the game handle the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.190
 option to start the game 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.560
 has already left the option of 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.100
 to create a game an email starting 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.100
 of a friend 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.840
 it's that easy 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.840
 if you do not have something, they will be downloaded 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:09.709
 as you can not then player 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.310
 some states remain because he has a 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.310
 discharge 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.670
 but as I say there are utilities 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.080
 how can I be watching a movie 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.490
 can be at a football game and 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.000
 talking with colleagues during the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.150
 Thursday 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.850
 a friend who plays colleagues who has the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:40.000
 pc 434 serves this trick 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.940
 ok now I'm going back I was talking 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.330
 I could not explain but it's very good 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.330
 simple 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.370
 and I'm doing for outside but not 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.430
 It was very simple to simply start 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.040
 the game world of town and only for the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.959
 done having the initial game already 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.700
 handles the option to open you a 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.140
 departure or indicted 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.140
 united to a friend 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.719
 here as you see it does not leave me 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:24.030
 As you can see, you can not play 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.980
 the trick is simply talk embroidery 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.870
 pantheons with colleagues and you talk to 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.820
 colleagues if you want for something else 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.670
 For the moment I can not find anything below 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.900
 of the pears I got it from these 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.300
