start I have to say that this method
here<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.320> works<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.800> me<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.550> done

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

for<00:00:29.220> corners<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.789> maybe<00:00:30.630> will<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:30.990> some<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
for corners I maybe will do some in the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.500 
for corners I maybe will do some in the
future<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.219> not<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.000> video

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
future but not in this video

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.660 
future but not in this video
basically<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.739> aim<00:00:34.920> with<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.280> left<00:00:35.430> stick

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
basically you aim with the left stick

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.610 
basically you aim with the left stick
when<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.000> got<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> corner<00:00:36.540> kick<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.290> cross

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
when you got a corner kick and you cross

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.380 
when you got a corner kick and you cross
the<00:00:37.770> ball<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.370> crossing<00:00:38.969> button<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the ball in with the crossing button I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.020 
the ball in with the crossing button I
think<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.230> clear<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.520> hold<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> left

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
think that's clear if you hold the left

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.880 
think that's clear if you hold the left
stick<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.450> while<00:00:42.660> crossing<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.079> ball<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.469> you

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
stick up while crossing the ball in you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.920 
stick up while crossing the ball in you
can<00:00:44.129> make<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> dipping<00:00:44.700> ball<00:00:45.059> with<00:00:45.300> topspin

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
can make a dipping ball with topspin

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.680 
can make a dipping ball with topspin
also<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> curt<00:00:47.129> corner<00:00:47.489> kick<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.760> possible<00:00:48.239> here

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
also a curt corner kick is possible here

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.330 
also a curt corner kick is possible here
you<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.200> move<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> left<00:00:49.770> stick<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
you have to move the left stick to the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.729 
you have to move the left stick to the
right<00:00:50.550> or<00:00:50.789> left<00:00:50.820> depending<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.260> curl<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
right or left depending on what curl you

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.130 
right or left depending on what curl you
want<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.280> my<00:00:53.969> method<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.600> don't<00:00:54.780> need<00:00:55.050> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
want in my method you don't need to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319 
want in my method you don't need to
topspin<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.710> occur<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.550> will<00:00:56.579> cross<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.180> in

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
topspin and occur we will cross it in

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
topspin and occur we will cross it in
normally<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.530> need<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> cross<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> ball<00:00:59.489> into

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
normally you need to cross the ball into

normally you need to cross the ball into
this<00:01:00.030> area<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:01.500> near<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.429 
this area here in the very near of the

while you see more examples now I will
explain<00:01:41.310> some<00:01:41.369> general<00:01:42.090> things<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.600> course

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
explain some general things of course

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.080 
explain some general things of course
you<00:01:43.560> need<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.740> tall<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.250> strong<00:01:44.579> player<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you need a tall and strong player in the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.240 
you need a tall and strong player in the
middle<00:01:45.390> who<00:01:45.689> should<00:01:45.930> reach<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.259> ball<00:01:46.590> this

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
middle who should reach the ball this

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
middle who should reach the ball this
player<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.790> mostly<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.360> central<00:01:48.810> bank<00:01:48.990> who

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
player is mostly a central bank who

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.929 
player is mostly a central bank who
joined<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> attack<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.159> corner<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
joined the attack for the corner the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.730 
joined the attack for the corner the
fact<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> make<00:01:51.509> space<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.049> also<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> reason

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
fact to make space is also the reason

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.469 
fact to make space is also the reason
for<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> normal<00:01:53.520> corner<00:01:53.790> kick<00:01:53.970> without<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
for the normal corner kick without the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.870 
for the normal corner kick without the
topspin<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.530> top<00:01:55.829> spins<00:01:56.130> are<00:01:56.340> making<00:01:56.790> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
topspin because top spins are making you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
topspin because top spins are making you
short<00:01:57.149> faster<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.140> need<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> time<00:01:58.740> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
short faster but you need the time to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
short faster but you need the time to
make<00:01:59.070> space<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.149> most<00:02:00.420> important

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
make space that's the most important

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
make space that's the most important
thing<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.399> works<00:02:02.640> better<00:02:02.880> with

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
thing if you think it works better with

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.030 
thing if you think it works better with
curling<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> ball<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.530> try<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.860> out

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
curling the ball in you can try it out

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.520 
curling the ball in you can try it out
of<00:02:05.189> course<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:06.149> all<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.320> raise

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
of course so all in all you can raise

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.410 
of course so all in all you can raise
your<00:02:07.560> rate<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:07.979> success<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.729> scoring<00:02:09.090> off<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
corner if you try to get a tall and

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.550 
corner if you try to get a tall and
