00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
as an opportunity to revision this and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.650 
as an opportunity to revision this and
think<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.360> new<00:00:37.320> clinical<00:00:37.829> methods<00:00:38.420> into<00:00:39.420> here

think of new clinical methods into here

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.930 
think of new clinical methods into here
in<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.320> now<00:00:40.500> clinical<00:00:41.100> improvisation<00:00:41.850> in

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
in the now clinical improvisation in

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.369 
in the now clinical improvisation in
ways<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.660> hadn't<00:00:43.020> considered

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
ways that I really hadn't considered

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.060 
ways that I really hadn't considered
before<00:00:43.879> through<00:00:44.930> percussion<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.170> using

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
before through percussion and using

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.869 
before through percussion and using
percussion<00:00:47.250> as<00:00:47.850> melodic<00:00:49.309> which<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.489> found<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
percussion as melodic which I found to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.060 
percussion as melodic which I found to
be<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.660> enlightening<00:00:52.430> as<00:00:53.430> an<00:00:53.730> academic

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
be really enlightening as an academic

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.040

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
that's right and we struggle how can we

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.889 
that's right and we struggle how can we
train<00:01:01.859> students<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> skills<00:01:03.719> that

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
they need and I won't pretend to have an

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.300 
they need and I won't pretend to have an
answer<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.439> what<00:01:07.680> music<00:01:07.979> therapy

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
answer to that but what music therapy

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.830 
answer to that but what music therapy
drumming<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.760> doing<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.240> now<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
drumming is doing right now it is

meeting<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.500> need<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.570> we<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> field

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
meeting a need that we have in the field

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.270 
meeting a need that we have in the field
it's<00:01:14.460> filling<00:01:15.000> those<00:01:15.570> gaps<00:01:15.799> where<00:01:16.799> we<00:01:17.070> can

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it's filling those gaps where we can

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
it's filling those gaps where we can
teach<00:01:17.549> people

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
technique but it's got to go beyond that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700 
technique but it's got to go beyond that
right<00:01:24.390> now<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:24.900> we're<00:01:25.049> getting<00:01:25.200> into<00:01:25.560> a

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
admissions perspective I'll struggle

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.130 
admissions perspective I'll struggle
with<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:01.610> from<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.270> clinic<00:02:02.570> clinicians

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
with that from a clinic clinicians

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.630 
with that from a clinic clinicians
perspective<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:04.160> is<00:02:04.310> it

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
perspective this is it

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.400 
perspective this is it
music<00:02:05.060> therapy<00:02:05.360> drumming<00:02:05.690> right<00:02:05.960> here<00:02:06.140> right

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
music therapy drumming right here right

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.700 
music therapy drumming right here right
now<00:02:06.590> if<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:07.760> haven't<00:02:08.119> had<00:02:08.240> an<00:02:08.360> opportunity<00:02:08.710> to

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
now if you haven't had an opportunity to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.530 
now if you haven't had an opportunity to
experience<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:10.520> training<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:11.180> strongly

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
experience this training I strongly

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.240 
experience this training I strongly
suggest<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.230> do<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.620> it's<00:02:13.070> about

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
suggest that you do it it's about

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.570 
suggest that you do it it's about
developing<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:14.030> new<00:02:14.180> relationship<00:02:14.720> with<00:02:15.580> drum

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
developing a new relationship with drum

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.480 
developing a new relationship with drum
music<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:18.140> ultimately<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.770> think<00:02:18.890> with

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
music and ultimately I think with

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.110 
music and ultimately I think with
clients<00:02:20.150> as<00:02:20.450> what<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:20.960> all<00:02:21.080> about
