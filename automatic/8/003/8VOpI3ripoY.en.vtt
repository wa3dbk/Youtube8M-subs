A lady beard is totally natural but not one of the most desirable things

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.120
Excessive hair growth is caused due to post pregnancy changes, irregular menstrual cycle,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.040
hormonal imbalances and even certain kind of medication.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.660
Basically all the things that make you a chic are going to make you look hairy and there is no escape,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.840
but fortunately there are some amazing home remedies that can actually naturally bleach this hair and reduce it

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.740
The first one is besan and honey, this is my personal favourite

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.440
All you need is 1 to 2 table spoons of besan and a few drops of honey

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.660
The secone one is my moms favourite, this has wheat flour and a pinch of turmeric

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.000
The next one is slightly sly me and sticky but it's really effective

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.280
You need 2 table spoons of yogurt, 1 table spoon of sugar, a few drops of lemon and an egg white

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680
And the last one you can literally eat off your face

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.860
You need 1 slice of banana, and 1/4 cup of oat meal that's it

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.960
Pick which ever one you like, leave it on for 20 minutes and use it thrice a week that will do the trick

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.220
There are some methods that you should totally avoid like waxing

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.980
Waxing your face can lead to open pours and loss of elasticity

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.600
The next one is shaving, you should never use a razor on your face because that will lead to thicker hair growth,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.660
and your hair will just grow faster

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.860
The worst thing you can ever do to your skin is to bleach it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.340
Bleaching has a corrosive effective on your skin, it can darken your skin and even lead to further pigmentation

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.000
Tweezing and threading is fine, but if you have sensitive skin avoid it again

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.980
But if you want to remove your facial hair permanently than the best option would be a laser treatment

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.699
Another way to conceal your facial hair is whenever you apply foundation,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.500
take your flat foundation brush and move it in a downward motion, like this

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.260
This helps in settling the facial hair

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.740
Now that you know the healthy way to remove and cover up your facial hair,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.080
it should not be embarrassing for you anymore!

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.340
