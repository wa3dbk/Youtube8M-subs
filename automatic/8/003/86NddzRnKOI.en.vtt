 little bit of butter we're going to need 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.309
 of sas to accompany the first thing that 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.439
 we are going to make in the mass of the pancakes 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.769
 The first thing we are going to take are the 

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:57.769
 eggs 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.190
 then we will throw the sugar 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:09.650
 butter and milk 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:12.790
 we will beat a little bit and then 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.790
 we will throw the flour 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.550
 let's make the chocolate sauces what 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.260
 first thing we're going to do is throw the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.850
 chocolate then butter 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.850
 and now the milk 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:37.720
 we will not lower the fire to the minimum 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.720
 and we will begin to remove 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.610
 now we will throw the sugar 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.950
 and we will continue stirring when I'm with 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.100
 this liquid texture will be ready 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.020
 we will continue making our pancakes and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.540
 for this we will put a pan on fire 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.780
 strong until it gets hot after 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.750
 we will lower the fire to medium and we will begin 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.360
 to throw the dough in the center and move 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.180
 as you see so that it extends well 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.870
 Once it's golden on the one hand we'll give it 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.870
 the turn 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.950
 and when it is on the other golden side the 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.670
 we will remove and finally we will donate 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.670
 our plate 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.250
 now we will put the three appointments as 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.989
 adornment we are finished so let's go 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.410
 to test them to see how they have 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.410
 left 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.230
