two in this video I'm going to show you
how<00:00:12.970> to<00:00:13.000> upgrade<00:00:13.270> or<00:00:13.780> update<00:00:14.440> the<00:00:14.770> amoun<00:00:15.370> end

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
how to upgrade or update the amoun end

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.460 
how to upgrade or update the amoun end
so<00:00:16.450> that<00:00:16.600> it's<00:00:16.720> at<00:00:16.870> the<00:00:16.900> latest<00:00:17.260> firmware

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
so that it's at the latest firmware

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.930 
so that it's at the latest firmware
which<00:00:17.800> basically<00:00:18.160> means<00:00:18.460> that<00:00:18.670> you'll<00:00:18.820> be

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
which basically means that you'll be

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.490 
which basically means that you'll be
able<00:00:19.030> to<00:00:19.330> play<00:00:19.510> newer<00:00:19.870> roms

able to play newer roms
on<00:00:20.680> your<00:00:21.070> 3ds<00:00:21.430> um<00:00:21.850> that<00:00:22.240> require<00:00:22.630> a<00:00:22.660> higher

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
on your 3ds um that require a higher

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.410 
on your 3ds um that require a higher
firmware<00:00:23.920> without<00:00:24.220> actually<00:00:24.670> updating<00:00:25.180> the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
firmware without actually updating the

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.510 
firmware without actually updating the
firmware<00:00:25.690> on<00:00:26.080> your<00:00:26.110> actual<00:00:26.949> system<00:00:27.280> you're

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
firmware on your actual system you're

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.279 
firmware on your actual system you're
gonna<00:00:27.640> be<00:00:27.820> doing<00:00:28.030> it<00:00:28.150> emulated<00:00:28.690> firmware<00:00:29.140> that

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
gonna be doing it emulated firmware that

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.919 
gonna be doing it emulated firmware that
would<00:00:29.680> be<00:00:29.800> played<00:00:30.100> off<00:00:30.340> of<00:00:30.369> your<00:00:31.060> 3ds<00:00:31.510> cart<00:00:32.760> so

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:33.929 
would be played off of your 3ds cart so

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.509 
would be played off of your 3ds cart so
if<00:00:34.929> you<00:00:35.230> didn't<00:00:35.499> already<00:00:35.589> watch<00:00:35.920> my<00:00:36.190> last

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
if you didn't already watch my last

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.009 
if you didn't already watch my last
video<00:00:36.730> you<00:00:36.879> should<00:00:37.030> watch<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.449> first<00:00:37.659> and

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
video you should watch that first and

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.290 
video you should watch that first and
once<00:00:38.499> you<00:00:38.620> do<00:00:38.769> that<00:00:38.800> come<00:00:39.190> back<00:00:39.309> here<00:00:39.640> and<00:00:39.789> you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
once you do that come back here and you

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.450 
once you do that come back here and you
know<00:00:41.079> start<00:00:41.409> at<00:00:41.499> this<00:00:41.589> point<00:00:41.679> so<00:00:42.159> let's<00:00:42.339> get

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
know start at this point so let's get

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.239 
know start at this point so let's get
started<00:00:42.850> um<00:00:43.289> once<00:00:44.289> again<00:00:44.530> make<00:00:44.710> sure<00:00:44.739> that<00:00:44.889> the

back<00:01:50.049> up<00:01:50.259> your<00:01:50.409> NAND<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:50.950> should<00:01:51.189> do<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.549> I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
back up your NAND you should do that I

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.149 
back up your NAND you should do that I
did<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.020> in<00:01:53.109> the<00:01:53.140> last<00:01:53.200> video<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:53.859> go<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.039> the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
did that in the last video so go to the

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.550 
did that in the last video so go to the
third<00:01:54.369> one<00:01:54.549> that<00:01:54.789> says<00:01:54.939> backup<00:01:55.509> system<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:56.079> if

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
third one that says backup system and if

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.169 
third one that says backup system and if
you<00:01:56.710> didn't<00:01:56.950> do<00:01:57.009> that<00:01:57.159> you<00:01:57.310> should<00:01:57.850> do<00:01:57.999> that

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
you didn't do that you should do that

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.899 
you didn't do that you should do that
and<00:01:58.420> then<00:01:59.079> take<00:01:59.619> that<00:01:59.799> and<00:01:59.859> put<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.429> on<00:02:00.579> to<00:02:00.789> your

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
and then take that and put it on to your

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.809 
and then take that and put it on to your
computer<00:02:01.439> get<00:02:02.439> it<00:02:02.530> off<00:02:02.679> your<00:02:02.799> or<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.429> can<00:02:03.640> stay

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
computer get it off your or it can stay

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.039 
computer get it off your or it can stay
on<00:02:03.939> your<00:02:04.090> SD<00:02:04.210> card<00:02:04.450> but<00:02:04.569> make<00:02:04.719> sure<00:02:04.749> that<00:02:04.960> you

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
on your SD card but make sure that you

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.450 
on your SD card but make sure that you
have<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.200> copy<00:02:05.499> of<00:02:05.619> it<00:02:05.770> on<00:02:05.829> your<00:02:06.100> computer

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
have a copy of it on your computer

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.850 
have a copy of it on your computer
because<00:02:06.850> we're<00:02:07.179> about<00:02:07.359> a<00:02:07.390> format<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.170> NAND<00:02:08.410> so

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
because we're about a format the NAND so

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.250 
because we're about a format the NAND so
it<00:02:09.190> will<00:02:09.340> be<00:02:09.430> gone<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:10.180> make<00:02:10.479> sure<00:02:10.510> that<00:02:10.960> you

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
it will be gone so make sure that you

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.170 
it will be gone so make sure that you
have<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.680> backed<00:02:11.920> up<00:02:12.160> on<00:02:12.310> your

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
have it backed up on your

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.960 
have it backed up on your
so<00:02:13.980> I'm<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.099> gonna<00:02:15.220> say<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.519> one<00:02:15.640> more<00:02:15.790> time

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
so I'm just gonna say it one more time

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.910 
so I'm just gonna say it one more time
you're<00:02:16.569> gonna<00:02:16.689> want<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:16.989> back<00:02:17.170> up<00:02:17.349> system<00:02:17.709> and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
you're gonna want to back up system and

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.830 
you're gonna want to back up system and
it'll<00:02:18.310> be<00:02:18.489> on<00:02:18.670> your<00:02:18.849> SD<00:02:19.000> card<00:02:19.390> you're<00:02:19.720> gonna

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
it'll be on your SD card you're gonna

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.509 
it'll be on your SD card you're gonna
take<00:02:20.049> that<00:02:20.230> put<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.530> onto<00:02:20.739> your<00:02:20.890> computer<00:02:21.069> and

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
take that put it onto your computer and

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.690 
take that put it onto your computer and
then<00:02:21.879> you're<00:02:22.000> gonna<00:02:22.120> do<00:02:22.299> this<00:02:22.450> step<00:02:22.689> okay<00:02:23.700> move

they're all there then press Yes to
start<00:02:49.150> formatting<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:51.190> then<00:02:51.760> it'll<00:02:52.030> be<00:02:52.090> blank

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
start formatting and then it'll be blank

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.349 
start formatting and then it'll be blank
for<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.629> while<00:02:52.859> it'll<00:02:53.859> take<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.040> little<00:02:54.220> bit<00:02:54.489> to

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
for a while it'll take a little bit to

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:55.890 
for a while it'll take a little bit to
format<00:02:55.720> it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
format it

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.020 
format it
let's<00:02:56.319> see<00:02:56.470> now<00:02:56.620> it'll<00:02:56.950> come<00:02:57.639> up<00:02:57.670> with<00:02:57.909> this

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
let's see now it'll come up with this

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.670 
let's see now it'll come up with this
bar<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:58.599> once<00:02:58.780> that<00:02:58.900> gets<00:02:59.019> all<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.230> way<00:02:59.409> to<00:02:59.439> the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
bar so once that gets all the way to the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.099 
bar so once that gets all the way to the
end<00:02:59.859> you're<00:03:00.819> good<00:03:01.060> it'll<00:03:01.510> take<00:03:01.689> a<00:03:01.720> little<00:03:01.870> bit

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
end you're good it'll take a little bit

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.520 
end you're good it'll take a little bit
of<00:03:02.200> time<00:03:02.349> so<00:03:02.530> I'm<00:03:02.620> gonna<00:03:02.769> skip<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.189> video<00:03:04.530> okay

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
of time so I'm gonna skip the video okay

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.259 
of time so I'm gonna skip the video okay
so<00:03:05.560> when<00:03:05.829> that's<00:03:05.980> done<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.489> should<00:03:07.150> just

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
so when that's done you should just

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.160 
so when that's done you should just
press<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.629> to<00:03:07.689> exit<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:09.150> then<00:03:10.150> scroll<00:03:10.599> over<00:03:10.840> all

did last time and let's see what happens

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:38.220 
did last time and let's see what happens
from<00:03:29.139> here<00:03:35.519> okay<00:03:36.519> um<00:03:36.849> so<00:03:37.540> let's<00:03:37.750> go<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:37.989> this

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
from here okay um so let's go to this

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.729 
from here okay um so let's go to this
it's<00:03:39.069> updating<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.519> home<00:03:39.639> menu<00:03:40.560> it'll<00:03:41.560> do

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739
