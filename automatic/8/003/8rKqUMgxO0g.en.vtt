00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.069
 No 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.769
 Molle the guest guide canvas comes in the basement and this time it's about 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.160
 Franck to see reward, respectively we the fast and 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:22.279
 easy to set up 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.769
 But his first must be you yourself is horrified with many thanks 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.359
 has crafted this awesome watermark 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.990
 it's just easy 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.010
 that the lame ones sell me as if by themselves and then he is 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.630
 that's a bit of an epic fail, and thanks for that job, great copy 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.110
 easy to forget about you Les gets linked to a video circuit so be many 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.840
 thanks 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.390
 yes as I said it is about refrain reward and we do this quickly and 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.380
 easy to build 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.830
 and I think that's great tactic 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.050
 patrol and that 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.520
 you choose a specific area 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.660
 the other simply upset and defended by opponents 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.730
 «I've got men to-day that 5-seeks out so that's them 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.460
 this corner a lot of noise 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.260
 the forum also from this great sal 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.120
 On the contrary I think it is a good choice because you can use this one page 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.660
 Thiemo cover and the other side came or quite easy to protect 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.500
 and I will do it ourselves too now and again 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.710
 but it was on the surface of Switzerland leave I saw it right now 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.430
 profit backwards 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.180
 and prompt to see if there 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.770
 maybe an opponent can come 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.180
 how the white patch team-able that because he had entered too early 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.039
 yes, I think that's okay 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.020
 protect and I four world little emphasis on now and then countries 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.430
 I have chosen this area for this game 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.880
 and the great thing about it is even if the revenue is the issue of their location Kate 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.530
 had come over again and again if they want 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.140
 Verivox means that the customers want to take right who knows 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.390
 but we can not do that I do not want either from the Teachers Council 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.720
 Claymore or myself not over 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.950
 and questions from the same time still percent from series on 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.440
 yes then which vehicles e10 is what weapon to reduce 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.329
 Should one take to patrolling like that? 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.629
 So now I've seen 21 with silencer taken 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.969
 So in principle it does not matter which BaFin takes it should be a weapon very well 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.579
 clearly comes 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.669
 a summit is the most important essay on this 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.429
 he divorce case simply deserves that 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.969
 none other than he wrote she runs he can 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.579
 looks wet on a map 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.559
 Red and around 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.819
 "That would just be quite convenient and could simply shoot against without 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.659
 others the sea 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.339
 so freedom should be yours 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:48.309
 Hardliner might take back strong enough for the Nikkei today 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.729
 to get away quickly 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:52.029
 that has hardliners 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:56.400
 As a first day I do not know because I have to be so exact the customer only with the ban 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.299
 clearly comes 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.539
 Clack clack could 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.459
 I took Marton here now, which was a bit unnecessary 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.530
 but I take that class a part for other things 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.579
 but then it has clear 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.739
 Reduce marathons 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.159
 and prince may want to continue to use may often own 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.640
 Dream is and if he comes two times three opponents is recommended 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.339
 at the same time, very good 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.520
 Fürstenfeld should be here 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.229
 definitely take next year 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.889
 because Fini uses a headset which is actually mandatory and you but before 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.669
 two or more generally son connectivity 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:34.759
 is 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:39.479
 That's what the line March opponents at the Institute endurance test of 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:42.669
 practically over the whole map 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:43.790
 if you do not stop 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.770
 Zeller Cornelia Throne have but 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.770
 most take command or white light 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.369
 that's just a very good guy 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.999
 with growing skepticism against Aarau 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:57.759
 not heard before 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.139
 the vacated do not yet set deadline 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.359
 I'll do the job again a country you see what I mean 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:13.639
 he just heard I heard the opponent I just turned around and just 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.119
 grilled 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:18.439
 and so I continued to build my intention 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:22.279
 Of course, nothing should spoil it in there or well 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.229
 Subject areas he 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.830
 and you should have her 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.370
 The movie will also be running around the back crowd last summer 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.969
 not earlier 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:36.159
 So I'm going to find out more quickly than I do right now 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:41.129
 For example, squat that corner and wait until the opponent comes Smart 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.499
 some Cham and now all surfaces little pleasing but barred 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:46.349
 patrolled it was said 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.059
 not quite so full 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:51.919
 if you are only fighting Circle is urgent that's no problem 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.219
 more 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.340
 that has little control is no secret that a fan 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.389
 there percent 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.669
 to refrain from a good antenna said to build 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.610
 and as I can it tough the yellow he already comes to an end I hope you as a danger 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.170
 to help a crime bit 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.500
 we will then agree on his flight
