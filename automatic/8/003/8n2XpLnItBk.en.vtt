00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
could happen so we're just very

made<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> great<00:00:58.620> run<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:59.340> probably<00:01:00.059> got<00:01:00.210> behind

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
made a great run it probably got behind

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.460

but<00:01:01.680> i<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:01.980> thought<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:03.420> 44<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.260> just

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
but i just thought and then 44 we just

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.440 
but i just thought and then 44 we just
really<00:01:04.680> slowed<00:01:04.920> down<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.400> last<00:01:05.670> six<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.119> seven

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
really slowed down the last six or seven

typically<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.420> execution<00:01:38.930> down<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.200> stretch

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
typically to execution down the stretch

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.190 
typically to execution down the stretch
I<00:01:39.770> mean<00:01:40.250> that's<00:01:40.430> something<00:01:40.580> that<00:01:40.820> a<00:01:41.540> great<00:01:41.990> for

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
I mean that's something that a great for

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.500 
I mean that's something that a great for
us<00:01:42.229> in<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.530> series<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.250> my<00:01:43.729> problem<00:01:44.060> steadily

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
us in the series and my problem steadily

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.030 
us in the series and my problem steadily
better<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:44.900> mean<00:01:45.050> that<00:01:45.170> seems<00:01:45.440> for<00:01:45.680> us<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:45.950> then

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
better I mean that seems for us and then

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.500 
better I mean that seems for us and then
we<00:01:46.100> have<00:01:46.220> met<00:01:46.430> great<00:01:46.640> rebound<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.150> seemed<00:01:47.330> all

we have met great rebound it seemed all
day<00:01:47.660> long<00:01:47.870> but<00:01:48.680> when<00:01:48.830> we<00:01:48.920> do<00:01:49.070> rebound<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:50.390> we

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
day long but when we do rebound and we

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.969 
day long but when we do rebound and we
play<00:01:50.690> deep<00:01:50.870> in<00:01:51.080> is<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.260> way<00:01:51.380> we<00:01:51.560> playing<00:01:51.800> works

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979
