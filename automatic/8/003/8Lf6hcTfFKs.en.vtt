00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.430

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.180
 So not only on humans but also 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.070
 on animals because they do not know each other 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.200
 Traffic rules keep you know the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.270

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.660
 It may be that something always tips over 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.330
 the eyes on the road year so 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.370
