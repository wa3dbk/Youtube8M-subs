at approximately 1.5 pounds and that is

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.749 
at approximately 1.5 pounds and that is
me<00:00:18.070> being<00:00:18.339> generous<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.710> scale<00:00:21.039> I<00:00:21.070> usually

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
me being generous the scale I usually

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.749

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:31.149 
little bit light so I average those two

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.389 
little bit light so I average those two
out<00:00:31.300> and<00:00:31.689> it<00:00:32.110> came<00:00:32.290> out<00:00:32.470> to<00:00:32.500> a<00:00:32.680> grand<00:00:33.010> total<00:00:33.160> of

times<00:00:43.539> and<00:00:43.989> my<00:00:44.800> diet<00:00:45.100> remain<00:00:45.609> the<00:00:45.789> same<00:00:46.059> I<00:00:46.390> did

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
times and my diet remain the same I did

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.889 
times and my diet remain the same I did
have<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:48.160> cheat<00:00:48.550> meal<00:00:48.969> but<00:00:49.210> that<00:00:49.420> cheap<00:00:49.690> meal

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899

was<00:00:50.109> followed<00:00:50.500> by<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.649> 24<00:00:51.219> hour<00:00:51.370> fast<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.710> I'd

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
was followed by a 24 hour fast so I'd

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.669 
was followed by a 24 hour fast so I'd
like<00:00:54.129> to<00:00:54.280> think<00:00:54.550> that<00:00:54.609> those<00:00:54.910> two<00:00:55.559> cancel<00:00:56.559> each

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
like to think that those two cancel each

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.509 
like to think that those two cancel each
other<00:00:56.859> out<00:00:57.010> um<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.780> did<00:00:59.710> do<00:00:59.859> my<00:01:00.010> measurements

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519

this morning first thing out of bed and

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.480 
this morning first thing out of bed and
there<00:01:03.309> are<00:01:03.429> some<00:01:03.640> significant<00:01:04.480> losses<00:01:04.780> there

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.490 
there are some significant losses there

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.980 
there are some significant losses there
I'm<00:01:06.490> just<00:01:06.700> leaving<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:07.150> gym<00:01:07.300> now<00:01:07.360> so<00:01:07.840> I<00:01:07.870> don't

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
yeah three weeks in I think it's

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.450 
yeah three weeks in I think it's
approximately<00:01:17.950> sixteen<00:01:18.460> pounds<00:01:18.790> lost<00:01:19.270> now

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
approximately sixteen pounds lost now

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
are going to have to be made I think

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.070 
are going to have to be made I think
what<00:01:31.030> I'm<00:01:31.120> going<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.300> do<00:01:31.450> this<00:01:31.600> week<00:01:31.840> is

weight<00:01:40.060> loss<00:01:40.300> rate<00:01:40.600> i<00:01:41.070> may<00:01:42.070> or<00:01:42.100> may<00:01:42.310> not
