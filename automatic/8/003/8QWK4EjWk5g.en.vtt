 cuckoo mechas today I show you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.069
 makeup I love to do for 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.379
 summer evenings 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.900
 these bright fees and it stays pretty 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.969
 natural to start my complexion I opt 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.370
 for a baby cream that remain light 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.260
 for the summer and that unifies very welcome 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.539
 face without spoiling the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.240
 tan that we managed to have well at 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.609
 otherwise it sublimates it so I find 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.710
 there I used the German from elf 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.660
 but as she is a bit too dark j 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.750
 I mix a little hair complexion 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.640
 the loser ester intensity which is light 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.860
 like a bb cream product testing I 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.110
 love them 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.570
 for concealer I use is the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.980
 finishers in elf as light as 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.260
 I like a lot because they cover 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.280
 super good and that's not a click and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.440
