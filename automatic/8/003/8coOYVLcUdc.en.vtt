good<00:03:31.590> in<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.860> deck<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.580> don't<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:32.910> run

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
good in this deck you don't have to run

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.790 
good in this deck you don't have to run
it<00:03:33.209> it's<00:03:33.450> up<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:34.080> just<00:03:34.500> helps<00:03:34.620> you

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
it it's up to you this just helps you

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.610 
it it's up to you this just helps you
load<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.100> graveyard<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:36.290> negate<00:03:37.290> effects

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
load the graveyard and negate effects

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.920 
load the graveyard and negate effects
and<00:03:37.920> destroy<00:03:38.190> monsters<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.970> find<00:03:39.630> it's<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
and destroy monsters so I find it's a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.420 
and destroy monsters so I find it's a
very<00:03:39.959> very<00:03:40.320> good<00:03:40.470> card<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:40.950> fits<00:03:41.280> in

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
very very good card and just fits in

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.880 
very very good card and just fits in
well<00:03:41.580> with<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.820> deck<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.500> extra<00:03:43.739> deck

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
well with the deck so the extra deck

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.180 
well with the deck so the extra deck
really<00:03:44.280> isn't<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.550> much<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.360> say<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:47.010> can

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
really isn't that much to say you can

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.740 
really isn't that much to say you can
run<00:03:47.340> this<00:03:47.430> deck<00:03:47.610> without<00:03:47.730> an<00:03:48.150> extra<00:03:48.450> deck<00:03:48.600> and

run this deck without an extra deck and
you'll<00:03:48.840> be<00:03:48.989> fine<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.980> shouldn't<00:03:50.280> be<00:03:50.400> going

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
you'll be fine it you shouldn't be going
