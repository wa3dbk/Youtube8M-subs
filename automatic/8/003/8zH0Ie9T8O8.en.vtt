00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
now this we can do this the same way on

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.670 
now this we can do this the same way on
a<00:00:48.450> tablet<00:00:49.370> we'll<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.489> ahead<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.030> draw<00:00:51.750> now<00:00:52.500> I'm

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
a tablet we'll go ahead and draw now I'm

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
a tablet we'll go ahead and draw now I'm
using<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.309> program<00:00:53.520> that's<00:00:53.910> called<00:00:54.000> Corel

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
using a program that's called Corel

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.700 
using a program that's called Corel
Painter<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.210> will<00:00:57.480> need<00:00:57.629> software<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> be

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
Painter so you will need software to be

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.220 
Painter so you will need software to be
able<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.600> but<00:01:00.600> there's<00:01:00.809> lots<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
able to do this but there's lots of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.569 
able to do this but there's lots of
software<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:01.949> there's<00:01:02.129> even<00:01:02.340> free

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
software out there there's even free

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
pressure so I can press down lightly and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.830 
pressure so I can press down lightly and
get<00:01:13.049> thin<00:01:13.320> lines<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.640> press<00:01:14.909> down<00:01:15.119> firm<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
get thin lines I can press down firm and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.480 
get thin lines I can press down firm and
I<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.259> thick<00:01:16.500> lines<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.630> can<00:01:18.630> even<00:01:18.840> erase

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
I can get thick lines I can even erase

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.039 
I can get thick lines I can even erase
using<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> eraser<00:01:21.119> that's<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> end<00:01:21.659> here

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
using the eraser that's on the end here

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.289 
using the eraser that's on the end here
to<00:01:23.150> erase<00:01:24.500> anything<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.799> don't<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.299> so

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
to erase anything that I don't want so

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.300 
to erase anything that I don't want so
let's<00:01:27.479> add<00:01:27.659> color<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.380> cartoon<00:01:28.920> here

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
let's add color to this cartoon here

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
let's add color to this cartoon here
we'll<00:01:29.579> create<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.909> new<00:01:30.180> layer<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.990> layer

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
we'll create a new layer and a layer

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.170 
we'll create a new layer and a layer
just<00:01:31.470> allows<00:01:31.770> us<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.159> put<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> color<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.700> top

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
just allows us to put the color on top

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.690 
just allows us to put the color on top
of<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> black<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.619> we'll<00:01:34.740> set<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> composite

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
of the black and we'll set the composite

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760 
of the black and we'll set the composite
method<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.060> multiply<00:01:36.229> I'll<00:01:37.229> pick<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> green

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
method to multiply I'll pick a green

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.710 
method to multiply I'll pick a green
color<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.400> want<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.670> use<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.090> our<00:01:39.119> cactus

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
color that we want to use for our cactus

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260 
color that we want to use for our cactus
here<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.259> we'll<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.340> start<00:01:41.520> coloring<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.150> in

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
here and we'll just start coloring it in

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.960 
here and we'll just start coloring it in
and<00:01:42.990> you'll<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.649> I'm<00:01:44.070> trying<00:01:44.549> very<00:01:44.640> hard

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
and you'll see that I'm trying very hard

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.120 
and you'll see that I'm trying very hard
to<00:01:45.240> stay<00:01:45.390> within<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.780> lines<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.070> don't

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
to stay within the lines but if I don't

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.850 
to stay within the lines but if I don't
that's<00:01:48.119> okay<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.320> always<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
that's okay because we can always go and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
that's okay because we can always go and
we<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.189> erase<00:01:50.430> some<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.820> color<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.509> can

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
we can erase some of that color you can

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.499 
we can erase some of that color you can
just<00:01:52.500> fill<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:52.979> real<00:01:53.250> quick<00:01:53.930> nice<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.229> easy

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
just fill it in real quick nice and easy

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.520 
just fill it in real quick nice and easy
don't<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> worry<00:01:57.869> about<00:01:57.990> covering<00:01:58.290> up

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
don't have to worry about covering up

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.859 
don't have to worry about covering up
the<00:01:58.710> black<00:01:58.920> because<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.270> green<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.840> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
the black because the green is on a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.020 
the black because the green is on a
separate<00:02:01.259> layer<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:02.670> tinting<00:02:03.000> the
