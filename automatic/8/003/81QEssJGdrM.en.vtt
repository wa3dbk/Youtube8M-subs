 of returning from travel did not feel like playing 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.220
 little bit of love z because I think they are my 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.779
 sung and the truth is that I have more 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.300
 way to keep playing this game because 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.699
 I see that it is one of the best budokai 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.859
 because I remember playing in love in 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.169
 lawsuits the third thing I know as 13 years 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.510

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.950
 Tenkaichi 2 I believe and did not have so many 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.600
 characters and I was reading your 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.950
 comments and I as always as I am 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.079
 so silly and when I'm recording the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.270
 mind about the things I have girlfriend play 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.040
 just because I want to do a fight 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.420
 as special in this case you have me 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.969
 said that by giving it down and there was 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.739
 side of stop was logical there was more 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.170
 characters in this case is from goku 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.270

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.489
 brother this the chaos is truncated trick 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.820
 the head and the time machine 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:08.110
 teeny status 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:12.040

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.850
 ashtawan definitive one go beatles to tan 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.070
 a typical idiom is this man is 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.479
 bread is a record of me is the master 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.640

 vernazza freezer my mother soldier of 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.430
 prince was and a lot of characters and 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.780
 how they see this wine around here is because 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.850
 the pieces were to unlock 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.350
 different characters I also guess that 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.020
 each his transformations that is 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.000

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.860
 WTA rate then jumps is what 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.350
 is of this type agreement 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.330

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.310
 metal cooler 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.660
 here is even the little figurine of 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.130
 understanding the first one that I was the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.290
 simpsons ron who is the monster 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.490
 definitive the dragon of all the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.450
 spheres and all that but in the end we're going to 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.450
 see but after 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.430
 I'm going to catch Paul in his fish tank 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.200
 legendary and apart I'm going to money and what 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.190
 I'm going to face against baby vegeta that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.970
 It has an incredible look of freedom and 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.540
 yes really much 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.540
 of God 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.860
 how ethical I was and vegetated please 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.510
 is that I love the memory of 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.770
 damn people when Pullman is 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.660
 come back as bad try to help 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.099
 relieve people and vegetables like I'm going to 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.410
 put it the second formation that cool a 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.610
 I love this vegetable, I know it is 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.650
 a bit strange and a lot of people caught him 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.670
 disgusting indeed to me when you see the series 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.780
 how it looks I was disgusted but then 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 It is generally cool person has 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.440
 a very strong personality and the truth 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.330
 that I liked pretty good the beginning 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.380
 is if you support this video very much 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.030
 I will surely make a small 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.860
 final series only combat but that 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.440
 I will continue with the series of 'dragon 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.290
 ball 'I was impressed with the support 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.290
 of the approval 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.350
 yes 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.800
 that's a little crazy, I also have 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.700
 to tell you that it is directly the 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.830
 trip and nothing to act with the character 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.040
 as it does not get out of balance and that's how 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.040
 is 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.520
 first one moment the list of 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.520
 skills where our is passive 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.060
 how was this like this 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.160
 or designed worth l 2 up 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.750
 omega blaster this looks very 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.940
 ethics and the truth is that it was not very 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.940
 difficult to make the different combos to see 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.000
 and wales 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:28.600
 giant with that wind and apart has 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.420
 that having incredible strength is one of 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.420
 the characters that I like the most 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.370
 better if you're never going to burst 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.370
 eyes how the school worked 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.530

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.830
 love this game that reminded you 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.830

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.360
 of cataracts that has a pint of 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:24.009
 cardona explosive cannon eraser and 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.929

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.129
 but there it is 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.759
 if the dresser now laments 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.930
