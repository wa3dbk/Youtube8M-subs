 and enjoying this wonder because 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.879
 I must admit that my weakness is the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.309
 visits and if the truth is healthy 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.170
 What addicted person gives me the best is how 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.059
 it works and what it is about, look at this 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.589

 the real looks super easy and practical 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.650
 because we are usually 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.850

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.460

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.460
 hot in the oven 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.979
 The grace we can also do is 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.570
 standing with pears with blueberries with 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.700
 fruits dances that at this time of year 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.610
 inhabitants the truth that endless 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.590
 alternatives and best of all is that 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.360

 say that the machine tells you I'm ready 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.670
 We are going to need more appointments if you 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.259

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.520
 presentation I said that effectively we 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.250
