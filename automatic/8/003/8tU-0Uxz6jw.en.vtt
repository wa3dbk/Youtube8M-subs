first<00:01:35.610> time<00:01:35.970> taking<00:01:36.329> pictures<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
first time taking pictures with the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.990 
first time taking pictures with the
minimized<00:01:37.320> camera<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.520> maps<00:01:38.820> in

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
minimized camera but you have maps in

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.280 
minimized camera but you have maps in
the<00:01:39.060> background<00:01:39.450> open<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.840> keep<00:01:39.960> track<00:01:40.170> of

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the background open to keep track of

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.870 
the background open to keep track of
where<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> are<00:01:40.710> need<00:01:41.250> stuff<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
where you are need stuff like that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.359 
where you are need stuff like that
another<00:01:42.659> software<00:01:43.020> trick<00:01:43.350> from<00:01:43.740> being<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.130> note

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
another software trick from being a note

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.550 
another software trick from being a note
is<00:01:44.579> working<00:01:45.119> well<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> improved<00:01:46.079> stylus

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
is working well with the improved stylus

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590 
is working well with the improved stylus
so<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.399> s-pen<00:01:47.850> has<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> slightly<00:01:48.420> updated

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so the s-pen has a slightly updated

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.389 
so the s-pen has a slightly updated
design<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:49.649> actually<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> little<00:01:50.250> bit

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
design it's now actually a little bit

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.490 
design it's now actually a little bit
thinner<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.450> has<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.810> tip<00:01:52.110> that's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
thinner and it has this tip that's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.160 
thinner and it has this tip that's
sensitive<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.189> many<00:01:54.000> more<00:01:54.299> pressure<00:01:54.720> levels

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
sensitive to many more pressure levels

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.959 
sensitive to many more pressure levels
so<00:01:55.350> when<00:01:55.500> you're<00:01:55.619> writing<00:01:55.860> text<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.549> their

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
so when you're writing text and their

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.789 
so when you're writing text and their
Notes<00:01:57.210> app<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.869> pressure<00:01:58.170> levels<00:01:58.590> will

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
Notes app the pressure levels will

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.010 
Notes app the pressure levels will
create<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.130> different<00:01:59.460> type<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.640> script<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.750> of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
create a different type of script and of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.209 
create a different type of script and of
course<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.290> works<00:02:01.439> perfectly<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> note

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
course it works perfectly with the note

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.679 
course it works perfectly with the note
as<00:02:02.340> you'd<00:02:02.460> expect<00:02:02.820> I'm<00:02:02.939> personally<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
as you'd expect I'm personally not the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.480 
as you'd expect I'm personally not the
biggest<00:02:04.049> stylus<00:02:04.409> user<00:02:04.649> ever<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.340> comes

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
biggest stylus user ever when it comes

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.399 
biggest stylus user ever when it comes
to<00:02:05.579> using<00:02:05.790> my<00:02:05.880> Galaxy<00:02:06.270> Note<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.259> keep

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
to using my Galaxy Note but they keep

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.529 
to using my Galaxy Note but they keep
adding<00:02:07.740> awesome<00:02:08.039> features<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.420> use

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
adding awesome features so you can use

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.999 
adding awesome features so you can use
it<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.929> you'd<00:02:10.170> use<00:02:10.200> your<00:02:10.500> finger<00:02:10.830> on

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
it just like you'd use your finger on

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.339 
it just like you'd use your finger on
the<00:02:11.129> touch<00:02:11.250> screen<00:02:11.580> on<00:02:11.760> side<00:02:12.450> note<00:02:12.660> if<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.110> go

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
the touch screen on side note if you go

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.910 
the touch screen on side note if you go
with

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
with

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.220 
with
an<00:02:13.950> off-color<00:02:14.490> Galaxy<00:02:15.000> Note<00:02:15.150> 4<00:02:15.360> like<00:02:15.630> pink<00:02:16.020> or

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
an off-color Galaxy Note 4 like pink or

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.880 
an off-color Galaxy Note 4 like pink or
something<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:17.520> stylus<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.180> also<00:02:19.050> pink<00:02:19.440> so

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
something the stylus is also pink so

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.620 
something the stylus is also pink so
that's<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.099> nice<00:02:20.250> touch<00:02:20.459> but<00:02:20.760> outside<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.510> that

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
that's a nice touch but outside of that

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.559 
that's a nice touch but outside of that
I<00:02:21.989> said<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.069> almost<00:02:23.310> galaxy<00:02:23.760> s5<00:02:24.000> software

it's<00:03:05.850> much<00:03:06.269> more<00:03:06.480> solid<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.200> makes<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.470> huge

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
it's much more solid and it makes a huge

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
softer touch faux leather look again but

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.280 
softer touch faux leather look again but
they<00:03:14.280> got<00:03:14.430> rid<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.850> tacky<00:03:15.090> fake<00:03:15.630> stitching

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
they got rid of the tacky fake stitching

smartphone<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.579> think<00:03:20.880> Samsung<00:03:21.090> has<00:03:21.359> ever<00:03:21.540> made

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
smartphone I think Samsung has ever made

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.539 
smartphone I think Samsung has ever made
and<00:03:22.019> I'm<00:03:22.380> super<00:03:22.769> impressed<00:03:23.040> by<00:03:23.310> that

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
and I'm super impressed by that

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.849 
and I'm super impressed by that
it<00:03:24.209> still<00:03:24.420> has<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> removable<00:03:24.900> back<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.590> can

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
it still has a removable back so you can

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.949 
it still has a removable back so you can
add<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.579> 32<00:03:27.000> gigs<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.359> internal<00:03:27.480> storage

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
add to the 32 gigs of internal storage

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.680 
add to the 32 gigs of internal storage

with a micro SD card and you can swap

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.220 
with a micro SD card and you can swap
out<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.519> 3220<00:03:32.519> million<00:03:32.820> power<00:03:33.000> battery

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
out that 3220 million power battery

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.729 
out that 3220 million power battery

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
also this battery now supports a rapid

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.000 
also this battery now supports a rapid
charging<00:03:37.019> technology<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.650> will<00:03:37.769> get<00:03:37.920> you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
charging technology that will get you

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.699 
charging technology that will get you

from 0% to 50% charge in half an hour

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.400 
from 0% to 50% charge in half an hour
and<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.640> got<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.850> say<00:03:41.970> even<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.660> buttons<00:03:42.989> are

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
and I got to say even the buttons are

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.440 
and I got to say even the buttons are
miles<00:03:43.920> better<00:03:44.250> than<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.549> Galaxy<00:03:44.940> s5<00:03:45.209> the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
miles better than the Galaxy s5 the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.599 
miles better than the Galaxy s5 the
power<00:03:45.660> button<00:03:46.049> on<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.200> side<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.769> clicky<00:03:47.579> and

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
power button on the side is clicky and

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.910 
power button on the side is clicky and
tactile<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.510> oddly<00:03:48.780> very<00:03:49.230> satisfying<00:03:49.769> to

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
tactile and oddly very satisfying to

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.039 
tactile and oddly very satisfying to
press<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.910> volume<00:03:51.180> buttons<00:03:51.510> have<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.810> nice

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
press and the volume buttons have a nice

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.890 
press and the volume buttons have a nice
feeling<00:03:52.290> too<00:03:52.590> also<00:03:52.859> made<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.640> metal<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.480> the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
feeling too also made of metal and the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.720 
feeling too also made of metal and the
home<00:03:55.079> button<00:03:55.380> is<00:03:55.560> also<00:03:55.859> now<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.100> fingerprint

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
home button is also now a fingerprint

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.880 
home button is also now a fingerprint
scanner<00:03:56.970> like<00:03:57.239> on<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.450> galaxy<00:03:57.840> s5<00:03:58.109> but<00:03:58.799> it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
scanner like on the galaxy s5 but it

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.400 
scanner like on the galaxy s5 but it
also<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.430> still<00:03:59.700> really<00:04:00.030> tactile<00:04:00.269> unlike<00:04:01.260> the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
also is still really tactile unlike the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.349 
also is still really tactile unlike the
galaxy<00:04:01.799> s5<00:04:02.069> so<00:04:02.400> that's<00:04:02.579> another<00:04:02.760> improvement

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
galaxy s5 so that's another improvement

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.569 
galaxy s5 so that's another improvement
there<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.690> just<00:04:04.260> wish<00:04:04.410> Samsung's<00:04:04.859> fingerprint

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
there I just wish Samsung's fingerprint

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.759 
there I just wish Samsung's fingerprint
reading<00:04:05.760> technology<00:04:06.120> was<00:04:06.630> better<00:04:07.019> and<00:04:07.410> less

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
reading technology was better and less

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.380 
reading technology was better and less
finicky<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.579> you<00:04:08.730> know<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:08.850> guess<00:04:09.060> that's<00:04:09.180> part

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
finicky but you know I guess that's part

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.240 
finicky but you know I guess that's part
of<00:04:09.510> software<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.230> it's<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:10.920> work<00:04:11.069> in<00:04:11.190> progress

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
of software so it's a work in progress
