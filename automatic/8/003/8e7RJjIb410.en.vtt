00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
or ten point seven kilograms I setup the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.610 
or ten point seven kilograms I setup the
gimbal<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.390> follow<00:00:36.660> mode<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> camera

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
gimbal for follow mode so the camera

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.590 
gimbal for follow mode so the camera
will<00:00:37.770> follow<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.219> octocopter<00:00:38.670> all<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.450> other

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
will follow the octocopter all the other

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
will follow the octocopter all the other
accesses<00:00:40.200> remain<00:00:40.530> level<00:00:46.550> once<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> air<00:00:47.969> it

the<00:00:53.550> flight<00:00:53.760> characteristics<00:00:54.180> very<00:00:54.719> docile

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.160 

ideally<00:03:10.850> with<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> setup<00:03:11.450> like<00:03:11.540> this<00:03:11.720> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
ideally with a setup like this the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.720 
ideally with a setup like this the
gimbal<00:03:12.530> would<00:03:12.680> be<00:03:12.800> connected<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.340> separate

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
gimbal would be connected to a separate

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.280 
gimbal would be connected to a separate
radio<00:03:14.060> and<00:03:14.300> controlled<00:03:14.690> by<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.840> camera

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
radio and controlled by a camera

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.230 
radio and controlled by a camera
operator<00:03:15.410> it<00:03:16.160> would<00:03:16.310> also<00:03:16.430> have<00:03:16.670> retractable

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
operator it would also have retractable

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.880 
operator it would also have retractable
landing<00:03:17.420> gear<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.990> camera<00:03:18.290> can<00:03:18.440> pan<00:03:18.650> all

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
landing gear so the camera can pan all

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.040 
landing gear so the camera can pan all
around<00:03:19.220> this<00:03:19.670> setup<00:03:19.880> would<00:03:20.090> be<00:03:20.240> way<00:03:20.420> cool<00:03:20.690> but

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
around this setup would be way cool but

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.020 
around this setup would be way cool but
it's<00:03:21.200> really<00:03:21.350> all<00:03:21.560> over<00:03:21.950> filled<00:03:22.190> with<00:03:22.820> new

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
it's really all over filled with new

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.580 
it's really all over filled with new
camera<00:03:23.330> technology<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:24.020> can<00:03:24.230> get<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.440> same

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
camera technology I can get the same

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.800
