00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
flash that might be a problem for most

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.580 
flash that might be a problem for most
people<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.729> additionally<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.590> installation

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
people and additionally the installation

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.690 
people and additionally the installation
of<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:51.049> metallic<00:01:52.049> grommet<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.890> probably

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
of this metallic grommet is probably

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.429 
of this metallic grommet is probably
going<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.030> interfere<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.600> mostly<00:01:54.899> any<00:01:55.140> case

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
going to interfere with mostly any case

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.649 
going to interfere with mostly any case
including<00:01:56.280> bumpers<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.790> don't<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.360> backs

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
including bumpers that don't have backs

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.649 
including bumpers that don't have backs
because<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.670> where<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> top<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> grommet

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
because of where the top of the grommet

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.429 
because of where the top of the grommet
falls<00:02:00.930> compared<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.340> bezel<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> phone

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
falls compared to the bezel of the phone

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.469 
falls compared to the bezel of the phone
so<00:02:04.439> that's<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.130> basic<00:02:05.520> installation<00:02:05.880> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
so that's the basic installation and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.630 
so that's the basic installation and
which<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.489> take<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:09.950> lens<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
which do is you take the lens and you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.730 
which do is you take the lens and you
just<00:02:11.910> stick<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.989> so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
just stick it like so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.010 
just stick it like so
and<00:02:13.860> that's<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.090> you're<00:02:15.510> able<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.780> take

photos of it so with the two and one

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.670 
photos of it so with the two and one
ones<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.300> was<00:02:24.420> installed<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.380> back<00:02:25.650> of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
ones that was installed on the back of

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.620 
ones that was installed on the back of
the<00:02:25.890> camera<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:27.690> can<00:02:28.200> actually<00:02:31.160> remove<00:02:32.630> part

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
the camera you can actually remove part

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.990 
the camera you can actually remove part
of<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:35.780> you'll<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.260> mac<00:02:38.070> or<00:02:38.370> micro

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
of it and you'll have a mac or micro

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.130 
of it and you'll have a mac or micro
lens<00:02:39.680> which<00:02:40.680> will<00:02:40.860> enable<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:44.810> close<00:02:45.810> in

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
lens which will enable you to close in

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.070 
lens which will enable you to close in
or<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:49.160> get<00:02:50.160> finer<00:02:50.460> detail<00:02:51.060> out<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.960> your

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
or you know get finer detail out of your

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.640 
or you know get finer detail out of your
pictures<00:02:52.590> when<00:02:53.280> they're<00:02:53.400> closed<00:02:53.700> up<00:02:54.650> whereas

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
pictures when they're closed up whereas

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:05.540 
pictures when they're closed up whereas
if<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.770> macro<00:02:58.770> lens<00:02:59.010> installed<00:03:04.550> the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
if you have the macro lens installed the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:15.340 
if you have the macro lens installed the
difference<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:07.860> pretty<00:03:08.550> significant

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.910 

and<00:03:16.060> that's<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.300> more<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.990> faraway<00:03:18.650> view<00:03:20.920> this

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
and that's a more of a faraway view this

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.100 
and that's a more of a faraway view this
is<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:23.380> 180<00:03:24.380> degree<00:03:24.760> fisheye<00:03:25.760> lens<00:03:26.110> which

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
is the 180 degree fisheye lens which

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.540 
is the 180 degree fisheye lens which
also<00:03:27.350> comes<00:03:27.680> with<00:03:27.920> a<00:03:29.350> traveling<00:03:30.550> carrying

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
also comes with a traveling carrying

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.060 
also comes with a traveling carrying
connector<00:03:32.710> also<00:03:33.710> comes<00:03:33.950> with<00:03:34.070> two<00:03:35.000> grommets

fisheye lens once installed makes a
significant<00:03:56.090> difference<00:03:56.920> as<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.160> can<00:03:58.370> see

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.870 

you<00:04:02.210> can<00:04:02.390> see<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.720> more<00:04:02.960> towards<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.890> center

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
you can see it more towards the center

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.480 
you can see it more towards the center
or<00:04:05.630> actually<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.350> further<00:04:06.710> edges<00:04:07.310> and

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
or actually the further edges and

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.390 
or actually the further edges and
corners<00:04:07.550> of<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.150> screen<00:04:08.920> whereas<00:04:10.000> without<00:04:11.000> it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
corners of the screen whereas without it

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.620 
corners of the screen whereas without it
there<00:04:13.400> there<00:04:13.640> is<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.790> big<00:04:14.030> difference<00:04:14.180> there's

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
there there is a big difference there's

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.789 
there there is a big difference there's
a<00:04:14.690> notable<00:04:15.050> difference<00:04:18.430> so<00:04:19.430> ultimately<00:04:20.799> while

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
a notable difference so ultimately while

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.320 
a notable difference so ultimately while
I<00:04:21.830> think<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:23.090> lens<00:04:23.570> products<00:04:24.260> are<00:04:25.330> very

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
I think the lens products are very

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.810 
I think the lens products are very
interesting<00:04:26.930> I<00:04:27.080> think<00:04:27.380> they're<00:04:27.860> there

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
interesting I think they're there

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.240 
interesting I think they're there
they're<00:04:29.690> good<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.200> they<00:04:30.410> do<00:04:30.770> what<00:04:31.100> they're

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
they're good and they do what they're

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.360 
they're good and they do what they're
supposed<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.730> do<00:04:31.910> I<00:04:32.150> think<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.920> negatives

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
supposed to do I think the the negatives

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.010 
supposed to do I think the the negatives
the<00:04:34.640> fact<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:35.060> you<00:04:35.600> have<00:04:35.780> this

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
the fact that you have this

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.020 
the fact that you have this
semi-permanent<00:04:36.920> grommet<00:04:37.370> installed<00:04:37.550> on<00:04:38.000> your

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
semi-permanent grommet installed on your

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.690 
semi-permanent grommet installed on your
phone<00:04:38.560> which<00:04:39.560> obstructs<00:04:41.980> significantly<00:04:42.980> the

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
phone which obstructs significantly the

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.910 
phone which obstructs significantly the
camera<00:04:44.330> flash<00:04:45.460> outweighs<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.820> benefits

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
camera flash outweighs the benefits

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.170 
camera flash outweighs the benefits
obviously<00:04:48.920> everybody<00:04:49.130> was<00:04:49.460> happy<00:04:49.670> with<00:04:50.000> the

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
obviously everybody was happy with the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.840 
obviously everybody was happy with the
iphone<00:04:50.510> 4<00:04:50.810> because<00:04:51.170> it<00:04:51.350> had<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.560> flash<00:04:51.890> and<00:04:52.250> now

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
iphone 4 because it had a flash and now

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.790 
iphone 4 because it had a flash and now
to<00:04:52.910> install<00:04:53.360> an<00:04:53.540> accessory<00:04:54.140> which<00:04:54.380> defeats

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
to install an accessory which defeats

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.690 
to install an accessory which defeats
that<00:04:55.070> purpose<00:04:55.550> is<00:04:56.420> kind<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.870> pointless<00:04:57.670> what<00:04:58.670> I

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
that purpose is kind of pointless what I

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.360 
that purpose is kind of pointless what I
recommend<00:04:59.090> it<00:04:59.450> yeah<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.350> probably<00:05:01.040> would

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
recommend it yeah I probably would

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.280 
recommend it yeah I probably would
recommend<00:05:01.820> both<00:05:02.030> these<00:05:02.270> lenses<00:05:02.600> there<00:05:03.020> twenty

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
recommend both these lenses there twenty

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.790 
recommend both these lenses there twenty
dollars<00:05:03.560> each<00:05:03.770> through<00:05:04.100> photojojo<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:06.080> if

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
dollars each through photojojo and if

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.860 
dollars each through photojojo and if
you<00:05:06.920> plan<00:05:07.220> on<00:05:07.490> taking<00:05:08.860> photos<00:05:10.600> that<00:05:11.600> the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
you plan on taking photos that the

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.190 
you plan on taking photos that the
iphone<00:05:12.530> will<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.970> know<00:05:14.090> ordinarily<00:05:14.390> take

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
iphone will you know ordinarily take

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.220 
iphone will you know ordinarily take
then<00:05:15.800> i<00:05:15.830> think<00:05:16.010> it's<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.370> good<00:05:16.490> product

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
then i think it's a good product

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.220 
then i think it's a good product
