about the decision about the corp the
confederate<00:01:08.189> flags<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:09.090> probably<00:01:09.360> had<00:01:09.720> no

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
confederate flags they probably had no

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.850 
confederate flags they probably had no
idea<00:01:10.409> even<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.580> ISIS<00:01:12.030> cake<00:01:12.360> was<00:01:12.930> because

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
idea even what the ISIS cake was because

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.740 
idea even what the ISIS cake was because
I<00:01:13.890> assume<00:01:14.310> no<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.640> even<00:01:14.760> came<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.390> before

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
I assume no one even came in before

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.070 
I assume no one even came in before
asking<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.350> an<00:01:16.590> Isis<00:01:16.950> cake<00:01:17.540> yeah<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.750> seems

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
asking for an Isis cake yeah it seems

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
asking for an Isis cake yeah it seems
that<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> employee<00:01:19.860> did<00:01:20.369> not<00:01:20.400> recognize<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that the employee did not recognize the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.230 
that the employee did not recognize the
ISIS<00:01:21.900> flag<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.619> that's<00:01:23.130> fine<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.060> was

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
ISIS flag and that's fine and it was

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.660 
ISIS flag and that's fine and it was
company<00:01:24.930> policy<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.770> they<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.100> no<00:01:26.280> longer

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
company policy that they are no longer

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.969 
company policy that they are no longer
selling<00:01:27.080> Confederate<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.500> whatever

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
selling Confederate or whatever

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.980 
selling Confederate or whatever
merchandise<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.270> makes<00:01:30.450> sense<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
merchandise and so it makes sense that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.690 
merchandise and so it makes sense that
they<00:01:31.079> would<00:01:31.110> not<00:01:31.439> make<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> cake<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.280> don't<00:01:32.340> think

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
they would not make a cake I don't think

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.600 
they would not make a cake I don't think
that<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.110> company<00:01:34.740> policy<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.400> is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that you know company policy that is

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.080 
that you know company policy that is
what<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
what it is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.730 
what it is
it's<00:01:36.240> interesting<00:01:36.600> how<00:01:36.840> often<00:01:37.380> modern

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it's interesting how often modern

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.560 
it's interesting how often modern
politics<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.490> intersecting<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.270> cake

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
politics is intersecting with cake

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.109 
politics is intersecting with cake
baking<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.700> really<00:01:41.850> interesting

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
baking it that is really interesting

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.859 
baking it that is really interesting
yeah<00:01:43.009> not<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.159> much<00:01:44.220> cupcakes<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.390> only<00:01:45.659> big

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
yeah not so much cupcakes but only big

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.109 
yeah not so much cupcakes but only big
cakes<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:46.350> yeah<00:01:47.070> cupcake<00:01:47.460> manufacturers

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
have avoided this somehow cupcake the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
have avoided this somehow cupcake the
cupcake<00:01:50.549> industry<00:01:51.090> has<00:01:51.240> avoided<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
cupcake industry has avoided the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
controversy of the cake industry I guess

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.450 
controversy of the cake industry I guess
it's<00:01:54.299> because<00:01:54.420> cakes<00:01:54.899> give<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.380> much<00:01:56.040> more<00:01:56.070> of
