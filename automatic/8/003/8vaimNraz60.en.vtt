00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.880 
do is obviously have an actual
microphone<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.870> am<00:03:10.080> speaking<00:03:10.350> into

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
microphone that I am speaking into

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.820 
microphone that I am speaking into
wirelessly<00:03:11.730> going<00:03:12.540> into<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.260> camera<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:13.739> I'm

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
wirelessly going into the camera so I'm

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.620 
wirelessly going into the camera so I'm
not<00:03:14.010> relying<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.209> camera

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
not relying on just the camera

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.750 
not relying on just the camera
microphone<00:03:16.230> what<00:03:16.769> that's<00:03:16.920> going<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.190> allow<00:03:17.519> me

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
microphone what that's going to allow me

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.990 
microphone what that's going to allow me
to<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.239> use<00:03:18.420> longer<00:03:18.840> lenses<00:03:19.560> for<00:03:20.310> instance

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
to do is use longer lenses for instance

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
will sound perfect like I was right next

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.070 
will sound perfect like I was right next
to<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.280> camera<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.239> opens<00:03:33.600> up<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.810> whole

audio<00:03:37.100> recording<00:03:38.100> this<00:03:39.030> is<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:40.590> transmitter

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
audio recording this is the transmitter

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.090 
audio recording this is the transmitter
it<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:42.390> transmitting<00:03:43.170> back<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.620> receiver

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
it is transmitting back to the receiver

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.370 
it is transmitting back to the receiver
which<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.820> now<00:03:45.150> on<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.570> hot<00:03:45.780> shoe<00:03:45.810> because<00:03:46.260> it

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
which is now on the hot shoe because it

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.530 
which is now on the hot shoe because it
has<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> hot<00:03:46.860> shoe<00:03:47.160> holder<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.299> then

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
has a hot shoe holder that is then

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.509 
has a hot shoe holder that is then
plugged<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:49.019> through<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.350> 1/8<00:03:49.830> inch<00:03:50.070> cable

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
plugged in through the 1/8 inch cable

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.900 
plugged in through the 1/8 inch cable
into<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.400> d3s<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.790> also<00:03:54.540> comes<00:03:55.109> with<00:03:55.230> a

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
into the d3s it also comes with a

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.020 
into the d3s it also comes with a
XLR<00:03:57.870> input<00:03:58.410> so<00:03:59.040> if<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.280> want<00:03:59.460> to<00:03:59.490> plug<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.850> into

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
XLR input so if I want to plug it into

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.820

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
my cannon yes Canon XH a1 HD Video
camcorder<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:06.330> plug<00:04:06.600> it<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:06.900> using<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.890> so

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
camcorder I can plug it in using this so

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.060 
camcorder I can plug it in using this so
I<00:04:08.880> had<00:04:09.210> to<00:04:09.300> do<00:04:09.420> some<00:04:09.660> setup<00:04:09.990> some<00:04:10.290> minor<00:04:10.560> set<00:04:10.920> up

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
I had to do some setup some minor set up

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.590 
I had to do some setup some minor set up
actually<00:04:11.490> I<00:04:11.700> plugged<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.570> just

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
actually I plugged it in and it just

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.650 
actually I plugged it in and it just
worked<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.650> decibel<00:04:14.010> level<00:04:14.250> was<00:04:14.340> set<00:04:14.520> to<00:04:14.640> zero

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
worked the decibel level was set to zero

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.350 
worked the decibel level was set to zero
I<00:04:15.690> think<00:04:16.200> they<00:04:16.260> caught<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.530> attenuation<00:04:17.370> was

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
I think they caught the attenuation was

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.880 
I think they caught the attenuation was
set<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.720> zero<00:04:19.050> and<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.380> goes<00:04:19.500> all<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.680> way<00:04:19.770> up

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
set to zero and it goes all the way up

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.460 
set to zero and it goes all the way up
to<00:04:19.980> 21<00:04:20.489> in<00:04:20.700> steps<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.150> three<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.810> right<00:04:22.230> now<00:04:22.440> I

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
to 21 in steps of three and right now I

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.280 
to 21 in steps of three and right now I
have<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.890> set<00:04:23.250> on<00:04:23.430> twelve<00:04:24.030> what<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.810> means<00:04:25.110> is

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
have it set on twelve what that means is

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.980 
have it set on twelve what that means is
that<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.530> lower<00:04:25.830> numbers<00:04:26.460> if<00:04:26.670> I<00:04:27.300> speak<00:04:27.600> louder

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
that the lower numbers if I speak louder

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.320 
that the lower numbers if I speak louder
I<00:04:28.410> could<00:04:28.770> peak<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.280> microphone<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.210> could

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
I could peak the microphone and it could

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.200 
I could peak the microphone and it could
pop<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:30.840> could<00:04:31.050> stop<00:04:31.260> recording<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:32.880> could<00:04:33.120> be

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
pop it could stop recording it could be

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.060 
pop it could stop recording it could be
hot<00:04:33.420> so<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.080> don't<00:04:34.230> want<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.590> do<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:34.860> when

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
hot so you don't want to do that when

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.200 
hot so you don't want to do that when
doing<00:04:35.310> audio<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.670> don't<00:04:35.850> want<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.060> blow

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
doing audio you don't want to blow

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.270 
doing audio you don't want to blow
anything<00:04:36.570> out<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.530> it's<00:04:37.770> just<00:04:37.890> like<00:04:38.100> when

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
anything out so it's just like when

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.710 
anything out so it's just like when
you're<00:04:38.400> shooting<00:04:38.520> photos<00:04:38.910> if<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.420> blow<00:04:39.690> it

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
you're shooting photos if you blow it

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.660 
you're shooting photos if you blow it
out<00:04:39.990> it's<00:04:40.230> harder<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.620> bring<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.920> back<00:04:41.070> but<00:04:41.580> if

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
out it's harder to bring it back but if

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.700 
out it's harder to bring it back but if
you<00:04:41.700> have<00:04:41.910> detail<00:04:42.480> you<00:04:42.690> can<00:04:42.870> then<00:04:43.080> bring<00:04:43.500> it

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
you have detail you can then bring it

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.040 
you have detail you can then bring it
back<00:04:43.740> later<00:04:44.190> same<00:04:44.580> thing<00:04:44.790> here<00:04:45.090> if<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.750> are<00:04:46.020> a

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
back later same thing here if you are a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.460 
back later same thing here if you are a
loud<00:04:46.440> speaker<00:04:47.180> not<00:04:48.180> like<00:04:48.390> a<00:04:48.420> microphone<00:04:48.960> or<00:04:49.200> a

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
loud speaker not like a microphone or a

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.720 
loud speaker not like a microphone or a
speaker<00:04:50.160> system<00:04:50.460> if<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:51.120> speak<00:04:51.390> loud<00:04:51.810> then

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
speaker system if you speak loud then

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.670 
speaker system if you speak loud then
you<00:04:53.730> can<00:04:53.940> put<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.240> number<00:04:54.480> up<00:04:54.600> higher<00:04:54.930> which

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
you can put the number up higher which

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.960 
you can put the number up higher which
then<00:04:55.920> means<00:04:56.130> that<00:04:56.310> it's<00:04:56.490> you're<00:04:56.670> not<00:04:56.790> going<00:04:56.910> to

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
then means that it's you're not going to

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.300 
then means that it's you're not going to
peak<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.690> microphone<00:04:58.260> so<00:04:58.800> we'll<00:04:59.100> see<00:04:59.220> how

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
peak the microphone so we'll see how
