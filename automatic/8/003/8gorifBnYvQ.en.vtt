00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.210
 and what characterizes let's say the designs 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.180
 that you have good I tell you that 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.769
 Luna was born 13 years ago yes with an idea 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.199
 innovative that was the subject of the 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.390
 reflective pajamas in fact we went the 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.200
 first in Medellin 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.329
 let's say with this idea of ​​giving it a value 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.530
 added to our product is not of 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.690

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.760
 shining a good flame for direct 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.909

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.619
 initially I started with an adult and already 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.330
 as time went on and the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.860
 need to create a line for girls 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.979
 the moms of the games because I know that 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.570
 I was thinking and the idea is that in the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.729
 girl and mom sometimes have their same 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.250

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.610
 it's now important it's not like in 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.140
 other past times we thought that 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.700

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.740

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.710
 open the door without going to hide 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.450
 let's talk about the materials in Medellin 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.610
 we are used to an early climate 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.900
 tempered but also very variable so 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.030
 as one night may be falling the 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.390
 storm the other night one is past 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.000
 the heat what is the material we work 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.490
 in what is cotton 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.440
 we work some or we have 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.680
 we have a very rich climate where you 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.370
 you can put long sleeve pajamas 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.020

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.030
 who wants or how you want to feel if you 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.620
 you want to feel a little sexier I get 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.210
 the little one put the bandages on me but if 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.190
 I want to be warmer plus cap and 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.840
 it is therefore I also put the material on 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.490
 cotton to use cotton that does not 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.260
 have synthetic or nothing has the 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.910
 particularity and property that yes 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.290
 is making fried entertains you if 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.190
 Making you warm refreshes you 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.230
 material that is 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.060
 pleasant with the others clear and in this 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.490
 collection we have something in particular is 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.770
 that we are using bases that 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.140
 are my things that is a base that is 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.600
 Adheres to the skin and when you put on 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.640
 that basis is as if he had clothes the 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.550
 nationalization is delicious because you 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.770
 you see pretty well dressed and out of that is 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.570
 a second skin, so it does not come out 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.260
 new a period task this is called 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.260
 the lifters 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.110
 it will be called the lifters for 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.880
 some people and it's for moms and 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.980
 some people are now departures 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.690
 they are simply very diverse and if 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.180
 also what you said came the visit 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.080
 I put my pneumatics on and I go out 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.030
 quiet and the neighborhood came and I take off 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.700
 I love children and it looks divine 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.490
 it has a design that is super 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.930
 comfortable look at the colors so we are 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.090
 using also that it is a light color 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.900
 and a dark color so for that brand 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.900
 as an accent 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:51.210
 and the scatter mommy daughter this version 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.150
 You can not have this design and mom 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.340
 can place in very much like they are 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.140
 they feel very identified when the two 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.970
 the same garment is placed I do not know if 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.890
 some of you have girls 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.620
 incredible because new they always 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.460
 They want to look like one, so if one 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.460
 It looks like mom 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:20.580
 the daughter but then a mom of things 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.280
 but suppose forgetting what 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.230
 that you started or follow includes one 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.790
 to set him apart is to say inside a 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.100
 special feature that has 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.530
 no associate the flames always go 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.960
 to light up in the dark if many 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.630
 people talk about moons the pajamas that 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.460
 they illuminate in the dark, that is, 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.340
 something that stayed there but beyond 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.080
 talk about brand and here as we give 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.240
 a stop along the way what good to highlight 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.220
 to this woman because she already has several 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.569
 years with his pajama brand and that 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.149
 He has also done something that 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.460
 it is quite difficult that it is to start and 

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:55.649
 maintain companies in a country like the 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.209
 what are these bases suddenly? 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:59.309
 that has led you to keep the company 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:01.229
 for so long it is difficult is 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:04.610
 difficult but I think what helps me 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:07.610
 enough is to innovate or not to stay 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.259
 investigate there is a particular 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.709
 particularity here in Medellin there is 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.509
 many designers and many let's say 

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:18.300
 in quotes that we do not design but that 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:20.099
 we copy if I work a lot as well as 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.369
 so that my characteristic or my 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.409
 products in bonds or bone I 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:27.330
 commission from the first detail of 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:29.129
 doll the youngest until now 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.589
 end the penalty I am passionate about 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:33.719
 what I do although I think that the 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.249
 success is there in the invasion and as a girl 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.930
 was is the typical girl he knew with the 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:39.149
 mom or with grandma and that the city 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.279
 the dresses to his dolls and then 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.169
 that comes to you from here today 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.909
 to face a world of work can 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.800
 that is ignited the spark and there would be 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.600
 I was empirical many years I started 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.300
 very young to work 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.880
 in fact I studied design but after 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:57.360
 to have companies as to certify what 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.980
 what I already knew but I was a 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.560
 rags lover as we say the 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.940
 designers is pushing typical that 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.110
 when he was going to dress he fixed well 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.370
 that this combined with that not 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.230
 pulling up to the small form and I 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.820
 I left as I was dressed in this one as 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.770
 this is the other one that I liked what 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.020
 colors came or was always 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.210
 pending that when the idea of 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.580
 create a brand because I take them 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.040
 many years then as with the subject 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.860
 as if circling around and look at the 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.440
 result is a beautiful address well 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.900
 worked also thought in the 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.890
 needs of women to feel

 comfortable and beautiful at bedtime and 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.180
