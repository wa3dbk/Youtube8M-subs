 It should be noted that we realize cost roll 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.070
 I see ourselves immersed in this social dynamic of disney 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.070
 to think 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.190
 to activate it as an answer 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.100
 the stores we would do the latin actors no no in the begoña facts 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.930

 they wrap them blue in this vortex 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.010
 ambient 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.860
 we made these last peace 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.070
 6 so all these things 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.070
 the feet 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.110
 the disciplined people 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.760
 by reflex 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.730
 people suddenly 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.350

 we are not so 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.399
 two 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.709
 the matter is that 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.709
 the matter is faithful simply 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.809
 ccoo insists 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.929
 let's not forget yes the system assets 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.249

 I think you have to start with an apartment 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:57.989
 we have to start 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.379
 to feel peace 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.249
 ourselves 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:02.569
 to 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.369
 despite being tall 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.909
 I see a lot of crater 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.549
 the studies are expected eros gunmen 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.329
 that the mother lies 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.779
 the traffic or people 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.209
 6 yes 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.120
 after so many things 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.929
 6- 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:30.429
 eighth yellow oaks threw the sector complained then 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.089
 with Pakistan 2 non-profit 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:37.949
 and really 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.799
 we change our way of thinking 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.580
 the accident are experts pricked 21 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.939
 but 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:48.609
 the 16 bits 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.039
 I just want there 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.079
 for the psoe 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.019
 p that everyone is saying taxation 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.019
 there is really no social or personal change 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.279
 ee 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.229
 a teacher we did things 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.019
 two 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.790
 there is no real metamorphosis interned mexico that clarifies physical peace 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.169
 but I'm not going to do anything else that is 14 days or and it is that China turn 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.800
 what if you think it's inspired little by little, I think this is the dilemma 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.439
 with all of them it is not relevant 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.840
 we are sunk real but good 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.720
 sometimes 12 smartstax by then he definitely writes this 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.870
 pretext for parta repltas kazajistán is carlos paz is fine 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.990
 but the prices are still not there 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.949
 but also if it does not exist 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.389
 if really johnson sitel distance 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.379
 is why we want 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.210
 heart 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.499
 be short and we carry corcontas with their relatives 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.839
 just like in social security let's activate it again yes 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:07.879
 all right 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.240
 I feel good 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.199
 I think it's going to be all the people 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.949
 is autistic 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.039
 the reason of this forest 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.559
 simply 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:20.559
 I think when a change or field like that 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.849
 7 2 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:25.900
 the Argentinian 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.169
 what this 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.309
 6 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:30.620
 change feel peace 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.439
 we 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.930
 to be able to transmit it 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.930

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.449
 the new then 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.330
 let's reflect a bit on all this all 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.650
 On these 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.400
 we must really change possibly a lot of bad management things that decide 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.120
 because we do not really know the personal problems and expenses for the 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.099
 That the others 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.099
 that is 2 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.569
 Nonetheless 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.300
 have a great time 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.190
 I want you to highlight the case it is handled that also that your feet the tracks the 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.020
 villages 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.759
 the passion
