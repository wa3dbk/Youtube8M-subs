00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.540
 all the keyboardists or pianists of the 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.099
 church 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.380
 possibly you have a keyboard or a 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.360
 synthesizer a very old digital piano 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.619
 and you want to renew their sounds and the 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.199
 quality of them 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.970

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.939
 midi out and connect it to the device like this 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.200
