00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
the trick is easy but the most important

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.319 
the trick is easy but the most important

part is just act it out and actually

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.569 
part is just act it out and actually
think<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:03.930> you<00:04:04.319> completely<00:04:04.950> messed<00:04:05.250> up<00:04:05.430> on

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
think that you completely messed up on

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.410 
think that you completely messed up on
this<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:06.030> you're<00:04:06.180> like<00:04:06.269> oh<00:04:07.340> okay<00:04:08.340> all<00:04:08.579> right<00:04:08.790> so

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
this so you're like oh okay all right so

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.690 
this so you're like oh okay all right so
so<00:04:10.170> then<00:04:10.260> you're<00:04:10.530> gonna<00:04:10.620> put<00:04:10.859> the<00:04:11.010> bottom<00:04:11.519> cut

so then you're gonna put the bottom cut

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.610 
so then you're gonna put the bottom cut
down<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:11.970> eight<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.359> say<00:04:12.629> all<00:04:12.840> right<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.500> can
