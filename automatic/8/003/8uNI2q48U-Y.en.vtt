you're actually combining some

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.030 
you're actually combining some
freeze-dried<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.450> some<00:01:48.659> candy<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.799> we'll

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
freeze-dried with some candy so we'll

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.889 
freeze-dried with some candy so we'll
see<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.369> minute<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:50.820> two<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.450> ready

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
see it I minute or two and this is ready

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.109 
see it I minute or two and this is ready
