00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

and here just got pretty lucky because

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.789 
and here just got pretty lucky because
most<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> time<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> don't<00:01:52.439> learn<00:01:52.619> out

really useful

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.300 
really useful
because<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.600> does<00:02:07.140> test<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.680> other<00:02:07.890> attackers

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
tell I sped up the attack because we

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.500 
tell I sped up the attack because we
already<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.420> two<00:02:12.629> stars<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.140> that's<00:02:13.200> all

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
already have two stars and that's all

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.720 
already have two stars and that's all
that<00:02:13.629> matters<00:02:13.959> for<00:02:13.989> this<00:02:14.319> attack<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.519> let

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
that matters for this attack and I let

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.819 
that matters for this attack and I let
it<00:02:15.760> go<00:02:15.849> on<00:02:16.180> maybe<00:02:16.480> go<00:02:17.110> towards<00:02:17.409> three<00:02:17.590> stars

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
it go on maybe go towards three stars

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.500 
it go on maybe go towards three stars
but<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.129> didn't<00:02:18.370> happen<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:18.849> ended<00:02:19.299> that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
but that didn't happen so I ended that

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.960 
but that didn't happen so I ended that

the<00:03:03.940> same<00:03:04.120> trouble<00:03:04.540> but<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.720> didn't<00:03:05.049> want<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.260> go

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
the same trouble but I didn't want to go

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.559 
the same trouble but I didn't want to go
through<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.799> side<00:03:06.159> I<00:03:06.940> thought<00:03:07.299> to<00:03:07.450> go

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
through that side I thought to go

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.800 
through that side I thought to go
through<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.870> clan<00:03:08.109> castle<00:03:08.349> side<00:03:08.769> because<00:03:09.159> and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
through the clan castle side because and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.569 
through the clan castle side because and
in<00:03:10.810> my<00:03:10.959> opinion<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.650> want<00:03:11.859> to<00:03:11.920> color<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.400> clan

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
in my opinion I want to color the clan

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.520 
in my opinion I want to color the clan
castle<00:03:12.790> out<00:03:13.060> as<00:03:13.299> fast<00:03:13.599> as<00:03:13.780> possible<00:03:13.870> on<00:03:14.349> this

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
castle out as fast as possible on this

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.259 
castle out as fast as possible on this
one<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.549> don't<00:03:15.609> want<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:15.909> go<00:03:16.000> through<00:03:16.150> the

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
one and I don't want to go through the

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.500 
one and I don't want to go through the
side<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.599> somebody<00:03:16.959> has<00:03:17.230> not<00:03:17.769> had<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.040> good

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
side that somebody has not had a good

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.539 
side that somebody has not had a good
success<00:03:19.510> going<00:03:19.750> through<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.650> did<00:03:21.220> notice

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
success going through so you did notice

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.430 
success going through so you did notice
that<00:03:21.579> I<00:03:21.730> deployed<00:03:22.090> most<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.989> remaining

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
that I deployed most of the remaining

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.020 
that I deployed most of the remaining
wizards<00:03:23.829> down<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.160> center<00:03:24.430> one<00:03:24.639> mistake<00:03:24.879> I

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
wizards down the center one mistake I

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.550

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.069 
made look I have five wall breakers and
I<00:03:27.040> did<00:03:27.280> not<00:03:27.489> realize<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.180> troops<00:03:28.480> right<00:03:28.780> there

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.360 
look at them they do not have an opening
in<00:03:31.449> the<00:03:31.569> center<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.049> this<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.530> where<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:32.799> lost

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
in the center and this is where I lost

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.509 
in the center and this is where I lost
my<00:03:33.730> attack<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:35.410> is<00:03:35.590> where<00:03:35.799> I<00:03:35.829> messed<00:03:36.310> up

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
my attack this is where I messed up

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.970 
my attack this is where I messed up
really<00:03:37.060> really<00:03:37.269> bad<00:03:37.599> because<00:03:38.349> of<00:03:38.680> this<00:03:38.739> you'll

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
down there getting distracted by the

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.960 
down there getting distracted by the
lava<00:03:48.730> mini<00:03:49.660> lava<00:03:49.900> hounds<00:03:50.379> but<00:03:51.280> at<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.579> top<00:03:51.790> I

around<00:03:53.949> the<00:03:54.099> base<00:03:54.280> exactly<00:03:54.970> what<00:03:55.090> pretty<00:03:55.269> much

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
around the base exactly what pretty much

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.780 
around the base exactly what pretty much
happened<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:55.870> Nick's<00:03:56.109> attack<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:56.739> that<00:03:57.370> jump

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
happened to Nick's attack and that jump

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.789 
happened to Nick's attack and that jump
spell<00:03:58.000> wasn't<00:03:58.209> even<00:03:58.540> used<00:03:58.780> really<00:03:59.019> at<00:03:59.590> this

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
spell wasn't even used really at this

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.490 
spell wasn't even used really at this
point<00:04:00.150> 36%<00:04:01.150> were<00:04:01.209> not<00:04:01.449> doing<00:04:01.690> well<00:04:01.840> at<00:04:02.049> all<00:04:02.230> and

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
point 36% were not doing well at all and

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.020 
point 36% were not doing well at all and
I<00:04:02.560> finally<00:04:02.889> noticed<00:04:03.159> that<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.459> have<00:04:03.639> those<00:04:03.819> five

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
I finally noticed that I have those five

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.210 
I finally noticed that I have those five
wall<00:04:04.269> breakers<00:04:04.629> good<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:05.409> believe<00:04:05.889> it<00:04:06.010> or<00:04:06.099> not

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
wall breakers good so believe it or not

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.759 
wall breakers good so believe it or not
this<00:04:06.819> was<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.090> very<00:04:07.480> small<00:04:07.870> mistake<00:04:08.260> of<00:04:08.440> me<00:04:08.620> not

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
this was a very small mistake of me not

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.199 
this was a very small mistake of me not
deploying<00:04:09.159> the<00:04:09.280> rest<00:04:09.459> of<00:04:09.579> my<00:04:09.669> wall<00:04:09.849> breakers

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
deploying the rest of my wall breakers

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.089 
deploying the rest of my wall breakers
down<00:04:10.389> the<00:04:10.540> center<00:04:10.870> but<00:04:11.290> it<00:04:11.379> has<00:04:11.470> cost<00:04:11.739> us<00:04:11.949> the

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
down the center but it has cost us the

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.059 
down the center but it has cost us the
entire<00:04:12.239> attack<00:04:13.239> because<00:04:14.109> I'm<00:04:14.379> pretty<00:04:14.560> sure<00:04:14.680> as

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
entire attack because I'm pretty sure as

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.860 
entire attack because I'm pretty sure as
you<00:04:15.159> guys<00:04:15.310> saw<00:04:15.519> that<00:04:15.729> whole<00:04:16.060> bunch<00:04:16.479> of<00:04:16.690> the

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
you guys saw that whole bunch of the

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.259 
you guys saw that whole bunch of the
king<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.320> Queen<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.680> Pekka<00:04:18.159> all<00:04:18.579> my<00:04:18.880> wizards

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
king the Queen the Pekka all my wizards

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.879 
king the Queen the Pekka all my wizards
were<00:04:19.449> going<00:04:19.810> right<00:04:20.019> towards<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.440> center<00:04:20.769> and

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
were going right towards the center and

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.500 
were going right towards the center and
I'm<00:04:21.370> pretty<00:04:21.609> sure<00:04:21.849> I<00:04:21.880> what<00:04:22.090> I've<00:04:22.210> had<00:04:22.330> at<00:04:22.479> least

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
I'm pretty sure I what I've had at least

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.800 
I'm pretty sure I what I've had at least
one<00:04:22.990> star<00:04:23.229> possibly<00:04:23.979> two<00:04:24.210> but<00:04:25.210> because<00:04:25.599> that

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
one star possibly two but because that

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.520 
one star possibly two but because that
did<00:04:25.960> not

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
did not

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.129 
did not
and<00:04:26.830> we're<00:04:27.070> at<00:04:27.160> 43%<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:28.180> do<00:04:28.450> not<00:04:28.630> have<00:04:28.840> enough

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
and we're at 43% I do not have enough

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.310 
and we're at 43% I do not have enough
troops<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.470> even<00:04:29.830> try<00:04:30.120> for<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.150> 50%<00:04:31.660> it<00:04:32.139> won't

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
troops to even try for a 50% it won't

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.930 
troops to even try for a 50% it won't
really<00:04:32.470> matter<00:04:32.740> so<00:04:33.130> I'm<00:04:33.310> going<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.700> go<00:04:33.820> ahead

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
really matter so I'm going to go ahead

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.180 
really matter so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.510> quit<00:04:34.780> that<00:04:35.050> one<00:04:35.350> now<00:04:35.800> that's<00:04:35.980> gonna<00:04:36.100> be

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
and to quit that one now that's gonna be

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.550 
and to quit that one now that's gonna be
a<00:04:36.280> defeat<00:04:36.580> for<00:04:36.610> me<00:04:36.820> but<00:04:37.060> lessons<00:04:37.450> learned<00:04:37.750> make

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
a defeat for me but lessons learned make

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.790 
a defeat for me but lessons learned make
sure<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.100> pay<00:04:39.340> attention<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.930> wall

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
sure you pay attention to the wall

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.379 
sure you pay attention to the wall
openings<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.340> make<00:04:42.580> because<00:04:42.880> right<00:04:43.120> there

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
openings you make because right there

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.360 
openings you make because right there
that<00:04:43.780> cost<00:04:43.990> is<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.350> raid<00:04:44.560> now<00:04:44.980> let's<00:04:45.160> go<00:04:45.280> ahead

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
that cost is the raid now let's go ahead

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.920 
that cost is the raid now let's go ahead
and<00:04:45.550> take<00:04:45.669> a<00:04:45.700> look<00:04:45.940> at<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.150> defense<00:04:46.540> of<00:04:46.780> my

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
and take a look at the defense of my

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.110 
and take a look at the defense of my
base<00:04:47.139> on<00:04:47.350> this<00:04:47.470> war<00:04:47.710> now<00:04:48.669> most<00:04:48.880> of<00:04:49.030> you

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
base on this war now most of you

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.730 
base on this war now most of you
probably<00:04:49.150> recognize<00:04:49.630> this<00:04:50.200> base<00:04:50.410> it<00:04:50.650> was

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
probably recognize this base it was

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.530 
probably recognize this base it was

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
lot of you have seen this base and I

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.020 
lot of you have seen this base and I
decided<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.500> give<00:04:59.710> it<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.919> shot<00:05:00.100> in<00:05:00.310> war<00:05:00.640> and<00:05:00.880> as

decided to give it a shot in war and as

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.110 
decided to give it a shot in war and as
well<00:05:01.240> as<00:05:01.450> in<00:05:01.840> my<00:05:02.620> actual<00:05:02.980> base<00:05:03.250> design<00:05:03.610> so<00:05:03.820> far

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
well as in my actual base design so far

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.970 
well as in my actual base design so far
I've<00:05:04.270> been<00:05:04.300> losing<00:05:05.110> but<00:05:05.440> I've<00:05:05.530> only<00:05:05.620> been

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
I've been losing but I've only been

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.700 
I've been losing but I've only been
losing<00:05:06.460> 1<00:05:06.730> star<00:05:07.000> attacks<00:05:07.419> so<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:08.080> have<00:05:08.320> not<00:05:08.500> been

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
losing 1 star attacks so I have not been

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.100 
losing 1 star attacks so I have not been
too<00:05:08.950> started<00:05:09.340> with<00:05:09.430> this<00:05:09.600> so<00:05:10.600> far<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:10.990> let's

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
too started with this so far and let's

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.600 
too started with this so far and let's
go<00:05:11.230> ahead<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.620> see<00:05:11.770> what<00:05:11.890> happens<00:05:12.190> in<00:05:12.370> war

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
go ahead and see what happens in war

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.190 
go ahead and see what happens in war
because<00:05:12.730> the<00:05:13.000> more<00:05:13.150> people<00:05:13.330> get<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.840> better

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
because the more people get a better

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.050 
because the more people get a better
opportunity<00:05:14.890> to<00:05:14.950> scout<00:05:15.250> the<00:05:15.400> base<00:05:15.580> out<00:05:15.820> and

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
opportunity to scout the base out and

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.290 
opportunity to scout the base out and
see<00:05:16.240> where<00:05:16.419> they<00:05:16.510> want<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.750> go<00:05:16.930> with<00:05:17.110> it<00:05:17.290> so

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
see where they want to go with it so

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.330 
see where they want to go with it so
this<00:05:19.300> attacker<00:05:19.660> sitting<00:05:20.140> in<00:05:20.260> very<00:05:20.530> slow<00:05:20.830> so<00:05:21.310> I

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
this attacker sitting in very slow so I

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.180 
this attacker sitting in very slow so I
know<00:05:21.610> he's<00:05:22.150> doing<00:05:22.710> some<00:05:23.710> kind<00:05:23.860> of<00:05:23.919> plant

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
know he's doing some kind of plant

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.710 
know he's doing some kind of plant
attack<00:05:24.550> because<00:05:25.030> he<00:05:25.150> hasn't<00:05:25.300> deployed<00:05:25.510> his

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
attack because he hasn't deployed his

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.960 
attack because he hasn't deployed his
Queen<00:05:26.020> yet<00:05:26.290> and<00:05:26.590> he<00:05:27.310> hasn't<00:05:27.460> deployed<00:05:27.669> to

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
Queen yet and he hasn't deployed to

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.240 
Queen yet and he hasn't deployed to
pekka's<00:05:28.389> and<00:05:28.600> there<00:05:28.690> goes<00:05:28.870> the<00:05:29.020> Queen<00:05:29.290> so<00:05:29.889> he

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
pekka's and there goes the Queen so he

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.980 
pekka's and there goes the Queen so he
decided<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.640> clear<00:05:30.910> all<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.210> defenses<00:05:31.750> on<00:05:31.900> the

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
decided to clear all the defenses on the

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.780 
decided to clear all the defenses on the
outside<00:05:32.350> very<00:05:32.620> smart<00:05:33.040> so<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.310> golems<00:05:33.700> are

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
outside very smart so the golems are

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.040 
outside very smart so the golems are
going<00:05:34.030> towards<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.390> center<00:05:34.630> he's<00:05:34.810> doing

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
going towards the center he's doing

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.170 
going towards the center he's doing
everything<00:05:35.410> correctly<00:05:36.070> pretty<00:05:36.790> much<00:05:36.970> just

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
everything correctly pretty much just

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.820 
everything correctly pretty much just
like<00:05:37.300> Patrick<00:05:37.690> mention<00:05:37.990> in<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.229> video<00:05:38.380> got<00:05:38.740> to

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
like Patrick mention in the video got to

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.650 
like Patrick mention in the video got to
clear<00:05:39.010> all<00:05:39.100> the<00:05:39.220> defenses<00:05:39.700> around<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:40.240> have

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
clear all the defenses around and have

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.630 
clear all the defenses around and have
the<00:05:40.840> golems<00:05:41.169> go<00:05:41.260> down<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.590> center<00:05:41.800> at<00:05:42.340> this

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
the golems go down the center at this

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.440 
the golems go down the center at this
point<00:05:43.000> my<00:05:43.870> single<00:05:44.350> target<00:05:45.210> inferno<00:05:46.210> is

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
point my single target inferno is

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.390 
point my single target inferno is
killing<00:05:47.289> his<00:05:47.440> King<00:05:47.740> it's<00:05:47.919> killing<00:05:48.250> his

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
killing his King it's killing his

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.630 
killing his King it's killing his
pekka's<00:05:48.880> so<00:05:49.419> I<00:05:50.320> guess<00:05:50.830> that's<00:05:51.100> that's<00:05:51.310> a<00:05:51.490> good

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
pekka's so I guess that's that's a good

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.920 
pekka's so I guess that's that's a good
thing<00:05:51.850> that<00:05:51.880> I've<00:05:52.090> said<00:05:52.300> that<00:05:52.330> to<00:05:52.479> single

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
thing that I've said that to single

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.469 
thing that I've said that to single
target<00:05:53.289> if<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:53.860> was<00:05:53.979> multi<00:05:54.310> target<00:05:54.490> attacker

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
target if that was multi target attacker

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.250 
target if that was multi target attacker
would<00:05:55.720> have<00:05:55.870> probably<00:05:56.169> had<00:05:56.590> a<00:05:57.100> lot<00:05:57.669> more

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
would have probably had a lot more

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.600 
would have probably had a lot more
success<00:05:59.260> attacking<00:05:59.770> the<00:05:59.860> base<00:06:00.039> now<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.280> Queen

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
success attacking the base now the Queen

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.400 
success attacking the base now the Queen
is<00:06:00.729> out<00:06:00.910> of<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:01.090> range<00:06:01.270> of<00:06:01.390> the<00:06:01.510> inferno<00:06:01.870> so

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
is out of the range of the inferno so

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.230 
is out of the range of the inferno so
she's<00:06:02.620> gonna<00:06:02.800> have<00:06:03.100> a<00:06:03.130> free<00:06:03.460> kill<00:06:03.700> on<00:06:03.880> that

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
she's gonna have a free kill on that

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.700 
she's gonna have a free kill on that
Town<00:06:04.539> Hall<00:06:04.780> she<00:06:04.960> only<00:06:05.140> had<00:06:05.289> the<00:06:05.380> Tesla

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
Town Hall she only had the Tesla

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.370 
Town Hall she only had the Tesla

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
shooting at her and at this point 1

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.480 
shooting at her and at this point 1
stars<00:06:08.620> already<00:06:08.800> achieved<00:06:09.130> by<00:06:09.250> this<00:06:09.310> attack

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.980

yay<00:06:09.820> let's<00:06:10.000> go<00:06:10.090> ahead<00:06:10.300> and<00:06:10.419> see<00:06:10.539> if<00:06:10.570> he<00:06:10.750> can<00:06:10.870> get

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
yay let's go ahead and see if he can get

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.409 
yay let's go ahead and see if he can get

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
so far from my personal testing in war

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.910 
so far from my personal testing in war
and<00:06:34.210> an

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
and an

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.030 
and an
actual<00:06:35.280> defense<00:06:35.670> on<00:06:35.910> my<00:06:36.030> personal<00:06:36.540> base<00:06:37.040> the

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
actual defense on my personal base the

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.100 
actual defense on my personal base the
base<00:06:38.250> has<00:06:38.430> not<00:06:38.580> been<00:06:38.820> attacked<00:06:39.090> for<00:06:39.780> more<00:06:39.960> than

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
base has not been attacked for more than

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.930 
base has not been attacked for more than
to<00:06:40.350> start<00:06:40.740> or<00:06:40.950> for<00:06:41.160> more<00:06:41.340> than<00:06:41.490> one<00:06:41.670> star<00:06:41.910> I

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
to start or for more than one star I

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.450 
to start or for more than one star I
guess<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:42.810> war<00:06:42.960> right<00:06:43.080> now<00:06:43.230> is<00:06:43.350> at<00:06:43.470> 36<00:06:43.920> to<00:06:44.100> 33

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
guess the war right now is at 36 to 33

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.820 
guess the war right now is at 36 to 33
they<00:06:45.030> have<00:06:45.240> two<00:06:45.480> more<00:06:45.990> attacks<00:06:46.260> than<00:06:46.470> we<00:06:46.620> do

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
they have two more attacks than we do

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.160 
they have two more attacks than we do
and<00:06:47.070> I<00:06:47.520> think<00:06:47.790> we<00:06:47.970> got<00:06:48.120> this<00:06:48.330> war<00:06:48.570> pretty<00:06:48.930> much

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
and I think we got this war pretty much

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.410 
and I think we got this war pretty much
