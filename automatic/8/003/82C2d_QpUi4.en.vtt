00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.630 
camera and stuff like that well there's
a<00:02:54.300> 50-50<00:02:54.900> chance<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.440> doing<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.460> may

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
a 50-50 chance of it doing that and may

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.480 
a 50-50 chance of it doing that and may
not<00:02:56.670> do<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.720> don't<00:02:57.960> think<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.290> will

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
not do that but I don't think it will

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.530 
not do that but I don't think it will
unless<00:02:59.490> it<00:02:59.730> really<00:02:59.910> hits<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.150> ground<00:03:00.300> but

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
unless it really hits the ground but

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.450 
unless it really hits the ground but
even<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.020> does<00:03:01.290> hit<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> ground<00:03:01.830> this

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
even if this does hit the ground this

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.730 
even if this does hit the ground this
does<00:03:02.670> have<00:03:02.910> some<00:03:03.180> extra<00:03:03.540> thickness<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.320> so

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
does have some extra thickness to it so

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.400 
does have some extra thickness to it so
I<00:03:05.040> think<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:05.760> hit<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.180> case<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.990> say

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
I think you just hit the case in and say

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.590 
I think you just hit the case in and say
hitting<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.800> camera<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.310> all<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.760> your
