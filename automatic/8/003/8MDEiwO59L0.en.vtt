00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
 I have a big problem is that the 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.570
 paperwork a game I do not know I have to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.009
 make a particular reaction in 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.150
 paper plus I am part of people 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.360
 who think that if you do not see the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:16.170
 problem there is no problem anymore 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:18.359
 today is that I send it is 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.830
 good and I know why I find myself 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.029
 with dozens of papers sent to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.350
 it's because I never have 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.430
 stamps i can tell you that the day that 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.500
 I thought about buying stamps 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.680
 remember it's good I buy the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.680
 stamps 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.970
 envelopes and sea ​​fault of the English 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.960
 no but seriously i'm the only one to see 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.610
 galley with my first record 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.140
 taxation I add wages 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.430
 of each month I find a result I 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.940
 check in doubt I fall on a 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.160
 other result 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.090
 I recheck it's good I discover it 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.460
 had to add the net taxable 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.140
 what I'm doing again I've done a 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.970
 lack of calculation I finished 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.989
 I'm proud of myself I discover that the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.540
 result I'm looking for is listed on 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.710
 the pay slip of December 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.780
 I lost the pay slip of December 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.489
 the worst is that of my entourage I 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.720

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.100
 tax return is extremely 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.870
