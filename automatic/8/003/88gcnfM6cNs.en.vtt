00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.370 

now<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.870> foam<00:01:40.650> reduction<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.990> wasn't

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
now here is the foam reduction it wasn't

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.560 
now here is the foam reduction it wasn't
3d<00:01:45.410> with<00:01:46.410> resin<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.220> milled<00:01:47.760> and<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.270> foam

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.260 
3d with resin it was milled and I foam
which<00:01:48.900> I<00:01:49.140> really<00:01:49.620> didn't<00:01:49.980> think<00:01:50.280> they<00:01:51.120> would

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

which I really didn't think they would
do<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.480> thought<00:01:51.780> they're<00:01:51.900> going<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:52.110> give<00:01:52.200> me<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
do I thought they're going to give me a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.800 
do I thought they're going to give me a
perfect<00:01:52.920> wreath<00:01:53.570> reproduction<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.780> resin<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
perfect wreath reproduction in resin and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.660 
perfect wreath reproduction in resin and
instead<00:01:57.810> they<00:01:58.010> sent<00:01:59.010> me<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.250> thing<00:01:59.520> with

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
instead they sent me this thing with

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
instead they sent me this thing with
very<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.540> detail<00:02:01.700> anywhere<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:03.300> I'm
