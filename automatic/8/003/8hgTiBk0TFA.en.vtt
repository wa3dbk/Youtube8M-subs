upper<00:02:42.310> bodies<00:02:42.640> too<00:02:43.030> quickly<00:02:43.540> I'm<00:02:43.900> going<00:02:43.959> to

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
upper bodies too quickly I'm going to

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.370 
upper bodies too quickly I'm going to
keep<00:02:44.680> my<00:02:44.980> right<00:02:45.280> side<00:02:45.730> forward<00:02:46.510> diagonally

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
keep my right side forward diagonally

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.309 
keep my right side forward diagonally
forward<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.610> her<00:02:48.849> as<00:02:49.060> long<00:02:49.090> as<00:02:49.420> possible<00:02:49.840> it's

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
forward to her as long as possible it's

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.589 
forward to her as long as possible it's
very<00:02:50.410> important<00:02:51.220> if<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.730> turn<00:02:52.030> towards<00:02:52.239> the

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
very important if I turn towards the

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.100 
very important if I turn towards the
camera<00:02:52.900> not<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:54.069> be<00:02:54.239> overactive<00:02:55.239> in<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.780> torso

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
camera not to be overactive in the torso

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.100 
camera not to be overactive in the torso
turn<00:02:56.760> relative<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.060> base<00:02:58.239> so<00:02:58.569> if<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.780> face

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
turn relative to the base so if I face

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.920 
turn relative to the base so if I face
the<00:02:59.380> camera<00:02:59.829> and<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.400> rotate<00:03:00.940> through<00:03:01.450> my<00:03:01.660> range

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
the camera and I rotate through my range

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.590 
the camera and I rotate through my range
of<00:03:02.139> motion<00:03:02.310> through<00:03:03.310> those<00:03:03.519> next<00:03:04.030> two<00:03:04.269> steps

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
of motion through those next two steps

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.740 
of motion through those next two steps
I'm<00:03:04.930> keeping<00:03:05.380> my<00:03:05.530> right<00:03:05.829> side<00:03:06.269> forward<00:03:07.269> so

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
I'm keeping my right side forward so

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.150 
I'm keeping my right side forward so
that<00:03:07.900> when<00:03:08.049> I<00:03:08.079> go<00:03:08.350> into<00:03:08.530> my<00:03:08.739> fall<00:03:09.010> away

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
that when I go into my fall away

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.580 
that when I go into my fall away
position<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.760> can<00:03:09.970> then<00:03:10.150> make<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.600> transition

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
position I can then make the transition

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.960 
position I can then make the transition
of<00:03:11.709> my<00:03:11.859> upper<00:03:12.130> body<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:12.670> I'll<00:03:12.760> demonstrate

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
of my upper body so I'll demonstrate

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.750 
of my upper body so I'll demonstrate
that<00:03:13.239> with<00:03:13.510> Heather<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.980> think<00:03:14.980> will<00:03:15.130> back<00:03:15.519> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
that with Heather I think will back the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.039 
that with Heather I think will back the
camera<00:03:16.030> for<00:03:16.329> this<00:03:16.420> so<00:03:16.569> you<00:03:16.630> have<00:03:16.720> a<00:03:16.840> better

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
camera for this so you have a better

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.370 
camera for this so you have a better
view<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.760> rotate<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.540> inside<00:03:19.989> of<00:03:20.170> turn

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
view so I rotate to the inside of turn

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.370 
view so I rotate to the inside of turn
curving<00:03:21.329> allowing<00:03:22.329> her<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.540> come<00:03:22.810> around<00:03:22.959> me

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
curving allowing her to come around me

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.520 
curving allowing her to come around me
and<00:03:23.590> then<00:03:23.889> I'm<00:03:24.010> still<00:03:24.310> maintaining<00:03:24.850> my<00:03:25.090> shape

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
and then I'm still maintaining my shape

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.319 
and then I'm still maintaining my shape
okay<00:03:26.530> now<00:03:26.680> from<00:03:26.980> this<00:03:27.250> position<00:03:27.519> we're<00:03:28.299> going

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
okay now from this position we're going

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.629 
okay now from this position we're going
into<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.840> fall<00:03:29.200> away<00:03:29.380> position<00:03:30.010> so<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.220> want<00:03:30.519> you

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
into a fall away position so I want you

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.690 
into a fall away position so I want you
to<00:03:30.670> think<00:03:31.000> again<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.780> these<00:03:32.139> three<00:03:32.560> points<00:03:32.799> the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
to think again of these three points the

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.720 
to think again of these three points the
feet<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:35.139> low<00:03:35.380> center<00:03:35.889> slightly<00:03:36.310> turned<00:03:36.579> to

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
feet the low center slightly turned to

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.430 
feet the low center slightly turned to
the<00:03:36.850> right<00:03:37.000> of<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.269> feet<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.690> then<00:03:38.109> the<00:03:38.260> high

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
the right of the feet and then the high

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.470 
the right of the feet and then the high
Center<00:03:38.799> turned<00:03:39.250> even<00:03:39.730> further<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.299> right

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
Center turned even further to the right

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.629 
Center turned even further to the right
than<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.810> low<00:03:41.019> Center<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.489> the

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
than the low Center and that is the

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.940 
than the low Center and that is the
position<00:03:43.120> we're<00:03:43.389> going<00:03:43.599> to<00:03:43.690> achieve<00:03:43.810> as<00:03:44.410> we

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
position we're going to achieve as we

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.039 
position we're going to achieve as we
cross<00:03:45.280> behind<00:03:45.670> we're<00:03:46.660> going<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.870> have<00:03:47.019> a

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
cross behind we're going to have a

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.199 
cross behind we're going to have a
strong<00:03:47.500> sense<00:03:47.829> of<00:03:48.010> pulling<00:03:48.280> across<00:03:48.549> through

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
strong sense of pulling across through

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.890 
strong sense of pulling across through
our<00:03:49.329> thighs<00:03:49.630> our<00:03:50.109> hips<00:03:50.799> our<00:03:51.040> ribcage<00:03:51.900> even

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
our thighs our hips our ribcage even

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.659 
our thighs our hips our ribcage even
though<00:03:53.019> we're<00:03:53.200> stepping<00:03:53.620> toe<00:03:54.010> heel<00:03:54.340> toe<00:03:54.639> heel

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
though we're stepping toe heel toe heel

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.750 
though we're stepping toe heel toe heel
there's<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.569> strong<00:03:56.079> diagonal<00:03:56.919> shape<00:03:57.400> there

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
there's a strong diagonal shape there

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.449 
there's a strong diagonal shape there
now<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.510> reason<00:03:58.930> we<00:03:59.049> need<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.799> because

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
now the reason we need that is because

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.460 
now the reason we need that is because
if<00:04:00.609> we<00:04:00.760> maintain<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.269> sway<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.989> right<00:04:02.200> to

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
if we maintain that sway to the right to

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.620 
if we maintain that sway to the right to
long<00:04:02.739> there's<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.549> strong<00:04:03.880> possibility<00:04:04.150> that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
long there's a strong possibility that

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.539 
long there's a strong possibility that
we'll<00:04:04.870> continue<00:04:05.079> moving<00:04:05.530> backwards<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.459> of

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
we'll continue moving backwards and of

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.059 
we'll continue moving backwards and of
course<00:04:06.819> once<00:04:07.120> we<00:04:07.209> finish<00:04:07.659> this<00:04:07.950> follow<00:04:08.950> a

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
course once we finish this follow a

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.320 
course once we finish this follow a
whisk<00:04:09.430> we<00:04:09.760> want<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.150> of<00:04:10.239> course<00:04:10.269> come

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
whisk we want to of course come

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.300 
whisk we want to of course come
forward<00:04:11.540> in<00:04:11.690> our<00:04:11.810> promenade<00:04:12.290> position<00:04:12.500> okay

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
forward in our promenade position okay

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.229 
forward in our promenade position okay
so<00:04:13.460> I'll<00:04:13.850> back<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.480> camera<00:04:14.720> for<00:04:15.020> this<00:04:15.170> we<00:04:15.500> have

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
so I'll back the camera for this we have

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.100 
so I'll back the camera for this we have
one<00:04:17.260> two<00:04:18.260> three<00:04:19.209> now<00:04:20.209> I'll<00:04:20.360> just<00:04:20.390> finish<00:04:20.780> off

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
one two three now I'll just finish off

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.280 
one two three now I'll just finish off
by<00:04:21.320> saying<00:04:21.650> that<00:04:21.950> as<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.640> dance<00:04:22.910> from<00:04:23.810> my<00:04:23.960> right

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
by saying that as I dance from my right

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.400 
by saying that as I dance from my right
side<00:04:24.740> being<00:04:25.520> forward<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.450> I<00:04:26.630> create<00:04:27.170> those

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
side being forward and I create those

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.230 
side being forward and I create those
diagonal<00:04:28.040> shapes<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.490> we've<00:04:28.610> talked<00:04:28.910> about

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
diagonal shapes that we've talked about

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.650 
diagonal shapes that we've talked about
I<00:04:29.480> want<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.080> feel<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:31.070> my<00:04:31.310> upper<00:04:31.880> body<00:04:32.030> then

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
I want to feel that my upper body then

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.280 
I want to feel that my upper body then
can<00:04:33.500> my<00:04:34.070> elbows<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:34.850> arms<00:04:35.150> may<00:04:35.390> dance<00:04:35.660> across

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
can my elbows and arms may dance across

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.280 
can my elbows and arms may dance across
my<00:04:36.650> body<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.610> allow<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:38.420> portion<00:04:38.960> if<00:04:39.020> I<00:04:39.080> just
