textile<00:00:34.430> artist<00:00:34.940> I<00:00:35.210> think<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:36.190> we<00:00:37.840> really

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
textile artist I think and we really

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.780 
textile artist I think and we really
just<00:00:39.020> sort<00:00:39.260> of<00:00:39.320> met<00:00:39.530> up<00:00:39.770> didn't<00:00:40.220> we<00:00:40.310> and<00:00:40.520> talked

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
just sort of met up didn't we and talked

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.910 
just sort of met up didn't we and talked
about<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:41.660> should<00:00:41.960> have<00:00:42.110> showed<00:00:42.350> each<00:00:42.590> other

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
about and should have showed each other

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.060 
about and should have showed each other
different<00:00:43.579> work<00:00:44.270> that<00:00:44.540> we<00:00:44.630> did<00:00:44.870> and<00:00:44.930> I<00:00:45.560> gave

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
different work that we did and I gave

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.010 
different work that we did and I gave
some<00:00:46.100> pieces<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.880> Alice<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:47.450> they<00:00:47.600> would<00:00:47.750> come

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
some pieces to Alice and they would come

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.740 
some pieces to Alice and they would come
back<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:48.260> me<00:00:48.620> differently<00:00:49.489> or<00:00:49.910> stitched<00:00:50.300> into

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
back to me differently or stitched into

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.410 
back to me differently or stitched into
fabric<00:00:51.260> or<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:51.770> on<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.250> we<00:00:52.820> just<00:00:53.030> started<00:00:53.329> I

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
fabric or so on and we just started I

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.900 
fabric or so on and we just started I
think<00:00:53.600> appreciate<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.500> sort<00:00:54.739> of<00:00:54.910> crossovers

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
think appreciate the sort of crossovers

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.680 
think appreciate the sort of crossovers
between<00:00:56.120> our<00:00:57.100> different<00:00:58.100> practices<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.180> and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
between our different practices and and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.280 
between our different practices and and
I<00:01:00.320> suppose<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.860> textures<00:01:01.340> of<00:01:01.520> that<00:01:02.110> Helen<00:01:03.110> had

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
I suppose the textures of that Helen had

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.950 
I suppose the textures of that Helen had
been<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.950> China<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:04.939> a<00:01:04.969> lot<00:01:05.180> of<00:01:05.329> her<00:01:05.479> work<00:01:05.509> had

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
been to China so a lot of her work had

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.310 
been to China so a lot of her work had
landscape<00:01:06.560> really<00:01:06.829> delicate<00:01:08.049> paintings<00:01:09.049> on

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
landscape really delicate paintings on

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.800 
landscape really delicate paintings on
the<00:01:09.439> porcelain<00:01:09.729> ceramics<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:11.210> wanted

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
the porcelain ceramics and so I wanted

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.010 
the porcelain ceramics and so I wanted
to<00:01:12.110> give<00:01:13.010> her<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.250> background<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.450> cloth<00:01:14.750> to

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
to give her a background a cloth to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.920 
to give her a background a cloth to
respond<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.740> in<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:16.070> in<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.820> landscape<00:01:17.510> manner

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
respond to in a in a landscape manner

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.289 
respond to in a in a landscape manner
and<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.890> made<00:01:19.100> me<00:01:19.340> think<00:01:19.640> very<00:01:19.909> differently

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
and it made me think very differently

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.530 
and it made me think very differently
about<00:01:20.479> how<00:01:20.990> my<00:01:21.650> kind<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.729> subtlety<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.270> mime

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
about how my kind of subtlety of mime

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.440 
about how my kind of subtlety of mime
art<00:01:23.810> making<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.590> how<00:01:25.520> its<00:01:25.790> had<00:01:26.420> a

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
art making and how its had a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.990 
art making and how its had a
conversation<00:01:26.810> with<00:01:27.260> Helens<00:01:27.760> ceramics<00:01:28.760> I

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
conversation with Helens ceramics I

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.719 
conversation with Helens ceramics I
think<00:01:29.390> is<00:01:29.600> also<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:29.990> make<00:01:30.740> quite<00:01:30.950> small<00:01:31.400> pieces

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
think is also I make quite small pieces

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.399 
think is also I make quite small pieces
that<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.210> really<00:01:32.510> wonderful<00:01:32.659> opportunity

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
that is a really wonderful opportunity

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.980 
that is a really wonderful opportunity
for<00:01:33.680> me<00:01:34.010> to<00:01:34.159> be<00:01:34.640> able<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:35.000> through<00:01:35.540> sort<00:01:35.930> of

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
for me to be able to through sort of

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.990 
for me to be able to through sort of
this<00:01:36.200> landscape<00:01:36.680> table-cloth

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
this landscape table-cloth

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.200 
this landscape table-cloth
creator<00:01:38.869> will<00:01:39.470> create<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.770> picture<00:01:40.010> and<00:01:40.610> crater

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
creator will create a picture and crater

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.690 
creator will create a picture and crater
sort<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.960> larger<00:01:42.530> scale<00:01:42.740> piece<00:01:43.220> which<00:01:43.430> still

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
sort of a larger scale piece which still

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.690 
sort of a larger scale piece which still
had<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.180> sort<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.470> suppose<00:01:45.799> that<00:01:46.580> it's

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
had the sort of the I suppose that it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.460 
had the sort of the I suppose that it's
a<00:01:46.790> table<00:01:47.060> setting<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.960> it's<00:01:48.080> still<00:01:48.260> where

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
a table setting and it's still where

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.679 
a table setting and it's still where
ceramics<00:01:48.979> should<00:01:49.220> be<00:01:49.400> but<00:01:49.670> actually<00:01:50.119> it<00:01:50.270> it

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
ceramics should be but actually it it

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.690 
ceramics should be but actually it it
was<00:01:50.869> sort<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.229> becoming<00:01:51.710> something<00:01:52.189> different

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
was sort of becoming something different

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.789 
was sort of becoming something different
so<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.509> think<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.810> collaborations<00:01:54.619> would

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
so and I think the collaborations would

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.679 
so and I think the collaborations would
allow<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:55.520> allows<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.060> happen<00:01:56.180> doesn't

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
allow it allows that to happen doesn't

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.289 
allow it allows that to happen doesn't
it<00:01:56.960> Helen<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.009> I<00:01:58.070> both<00:01:58.340> work<00:01:58.580> at<00:01:58.759> Manchester

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
it Helen and I both work at Manchester

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.870 
it Helen and I both work at Manchester
Metropolitan<00:01:59.630> University<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:01.009> we'd<00:02:01.189> we<00:02:01.790> had

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
Metropolitan University and we'd we had

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.550 
Metropolitan University and we'd we had
been<00:02:02.090> working<00:02:02.390> alongside<00:02:02.659> each<00:02:03.079> other<00:02:03.350> and

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
been working alongside each other and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.100 
been working alongside each other and
asked<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.189> do<00:02:04.280> an<00:02:04.369> exhibition<00:02:04.700> together<00:02:05.150> and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
asked to do an exhibition together and

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.399 
asked to do an exhibition together and
that<00:02:06.350> was<00:02:06.590> really<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:07.840> opportunity<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:09.170> start

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
that was really the opportunity to start

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.350 
that was really the opportunity to start
thinking<00:02:09.920> how<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.670> work<00:02:10.939> could<00:02:11.150> come

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
thinking how the work could come

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.539 
thinking how the work could come
together<00:02:11.920> because<00:02:12.920> they<00:02:13.189> were<00:02:13.280> quite

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
together because they were quite

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.670 
together because they were quite
distinct<00:02:14.269> and<00:02:14.480> very<00:02:14.750> different<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.650> that

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
distinct and very different and that

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.070 
distinct and very different and that
initiated<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.819> process<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.660> us

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
initiated the process of us

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.560 
initiated the process of us
conversing<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.010> discussing<00:02:20.580> how<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:21.030> could

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
conversing and discussing how we could

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.170 
conversing and discussing how we could
physically<00:02:21.930> bring<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:23.250> know<00:02:23.400> completely

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
physically bring you know completely

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.720 
physically bring you know completely
different<00:02:24.330> materials<00:02:25.050> together<00:02:25.700> yeah<00:02:26.700> I

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
different materials together yeah I

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.060 
different materials together yeah I
think<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.300> think<00:02:27.540> because<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.140> project<00:02:28.770> we

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
think I think because the the project we

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.160 
think I think because the the project we
were<00:02:29.520> exhibiting<00:02:29.820> our<00:02:30.210> assets<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.020> show

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
were exhibiting our assets in the show

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.070 
were exhibiting our assets in the show
were<00:02:31.470> quite<00:02:31.830> different<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:33.000> we<00:02:33.150> felt<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.540> it

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
were quite different so we felt that it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.110 
were quite different so we felt that it
was<00:02:34.260> yeah<00:02:34.740> just<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.070> good<00:02:35.220> opportunity<00:02:35.490> for<00:02:35.880> us

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
was yeah just a good opportunity for us

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.240 
was yeah just a good opportunity for us
to<00:02:36.150> come<00:02:36.570> together<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.680> bring<00:02:37.920> those

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
to come together and and to bring those

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.060 
to come together and and to bring those
different<00:02:39.090> areas<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.660> work<00:02:39.810> together<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.890> we

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
different areas of work together so we

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.640 
different areas of work together so we
William<00:02:41.490> we<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.420> we<00:02:42.630> met<00:02:42.840> up<00:02:43.020> really<00:02:43.410> didn't

excited about the prospect of working
with<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.800> we<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:52.830> we<00:02:53.310> met<00:02:53.520> on<00:02:53.730> probably

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
with you and we just we met on probably

with you and we just we met on probably
about<00:02:54.330> four<00:02:54.900> or<00:02:54.930> five<00:02:55.260> occasions<00:02:55.620> over<00:02:56.460> the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
about four or five occasions over the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.300 
about four or five occasions over the
course<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.480> don't<00:02:58.080> know<00:02:58.170> three<00:02:58.530> months<00:02:59.010> or

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
course of I don't know three months or

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.950 
course of I don't know three months or
something<00:02:59.670> like<00:02:59.820> that<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.360> was<00:03:00.450> quite<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.660> fast

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
something like that it was quite a fast

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.990 
something like that it was quite a fast
moving<00:03:01.320> process<00:03:01.770> actually<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.670> and

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
moving process actually and we just and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.370 
moving process actually and we just and
I<00:03:03.060> think<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.300> first<00:03:03.450> thing<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.840> bought<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.260> me

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
I think the first thing you bought to me

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.460 
I think the first thing you bought to me
was<00:03:04.620> after<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.100> sort<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:06.390> discussed<00:03:06.870> some<00:03:07.440> of

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
was after I sort of we discussed some of

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.830 
was after I sort of we discussed some of
the<00:03:07.740> plates<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.970> I'd<00:03:09.120> been<00:03:09.300> doing<00:03:09.480> which

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
the plates that I'd been doing which

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.810 
the plates that I'd been doing which
were<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.380> landscape<00:03:10.980> qualities<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.670> was

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
were of landscape qualities and that was

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.250 
were of landscape qualities and that was
quite<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.030> new<00:03:12.300> step<00:03:12.690> for<00:03:12.870> me<00:03:12.960> at<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.110> time

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
quite a new step for me at the time

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.170 
quite a new step for me at the time
which<00:03:13.470> had<00:03:13.620> come<00:03:13.770> from<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.040> residency<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:14.820> China

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
which had come from a residency in China

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.520 
which had come from a residency in China
and<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:17.400> did<00:03:17.640> some<00:03:17.850> place<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.570> maps<00:03:19.140> first

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
and you did some place and maps first

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.590 
and you did some place and maps first
which<00:03:20.190> were<00:03:20.370> quite<00:03:20.550> small<00:03:20.910> scale<00:03:21.240> and<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.570> think

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
which were quite small scale and I think

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.300 
which were quite small scale and I think
from<00:03:21.900> those<00:03:22.110> we<00:03:22.380> thought<00:03:22.530> oh<00:03:22.560> god<00:03:22.860> this<00:03:23.100> could

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
from those we thought oh god this could

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.870 
from those we thought oh god this could
be<00:03:23.550> done<00:03:24.209> on<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.360> much<00:03:24.570> larger<00:03:24.780> scale<00:03:25.340> so<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
be done on a much larger scale so the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.360 
be done on a much larger scale so the
whole<00:03:27.030> piece<00:03:27.630> evolved<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.590> shifted<00:03:29.040> through

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
whole piece evolved and shifted through

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.640 
whole piece evolved and shifted through
us<00:03:29.540> exchanging<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.930> sometimes<00:03:31.380> we<00:03:31.530> were

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
us exchanging and sometimes we were

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.320 
us exchanging and sometimes we were
together<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:32.489> know<00:03:32.610> discussing<00:03:33.180> things

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
together you know discussing things

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.650 
together you know discussing things
quite<00:03:33.660> spontaneously<00:03:35.330> gallery<00:03:36.330> floor<00:03:36.540> I

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
quite spontaneously gallery floor I

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.270 
quite spontaneously gallery floor I
think<00:03:36.870> when<00:03:37.200> we<00:03:37.350> when<00:03:37.590> we'd<00:03:37.739> got<00:03:37.920> mostly

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
think when we when we'd got mostly

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.979 
think when we when we'd got mostly
exhibition<00:03:38.910> pretty<00:03:39.209> much<00:03:39.420> together

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
exhibition pretty much together

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.040 
exhibition pretty much together
we<00:03:40.410> had<00:03:40.620> one<00:03:41.370> cabinet<00:03:41.910> which<00:03:42.150> was<00:03:42.420> sorted<00:03:42.840> we

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
we had one cabinet which was sorted we

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.750 
we had one cabinet which was sorted we
decided<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.590> dedicate<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.250> kind<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.700> just

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
decided to dedicate it to kind of just

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.540 
decided to dedicate it to kind of just
work-in-progress<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:46.050> show<00:03:46.260> some<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.860> the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
work-in-progress to show some of the the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.580 
work-in-progress to show some of the the
enjoyment<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.420> process<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.140> actually

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
enjoyment of that process and actually

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.170 
enjoyment of that process and actually
we<00:03:49.770> were<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.370> were<00:03:50.489> sort<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.730> there<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.090> the

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
we were we were sort of there on the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.699 
we were we were sort of there on the
gallery<00:03:51.480> floor<00:03:51.690> work<00:03:52.080> we<00:03:52.200> were<00:03:52.320> bits<00:03:52.530> of

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
gallery floor work we were bits of

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.380 
gallery floor work we were bits of
fabric<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.280> just<00:03:53.310> sort<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.790> piecing<00:03:54.239> together

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
fabric and just sort of piecing together

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.020 
fabric and just sort of piecing together
sort<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.260> converse<00:03:55.680> conversations<00:03:56.580> between

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
sort of converse conversations between

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.850 
sort of converse conversations between
the<00:03:57.270> fabric<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.900> objects<00:03:58.320> there<00:03:58.680> and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
the fabric and the objects there and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.010 
the fabric and the objects there and
then<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.310> think<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.730> showed<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.810> think

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
then and I think that showed and I think
