00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
that I think everybody is kind of

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.640 
that I think everybody is kind of
different<00:03:08.390> on<00:03:08.690> those<00:03:08.810> days<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:09.290> can't<00:03:09.530> really

it's<00:03:14.360> different<00:03:14.690> realisable<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:16.010> then<00:03:16.370> we

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
it's different realisable and then we

home with the entire core went saw
transformers<00:03:43.090> which<00:03:44.080> is<00:03:44.230> completely

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
transformers which is completely

transformers which is completely
ridiculously<00:03:45.489> awesome<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:46.510> I'm<00:03:46.599> not<00:03:46.780> getting

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
ridiculously awesome and I'm not getting

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.740 
ridiculously awesome and I'm not getting
a<00:03:47.049> percentage<00:03:47.200> from<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.790> now<00:03:49.269> I<00:03:49.569> think

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
a percentage from that and now I think

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.420 
a percentage from that and now I think
people<00:03:49.989> are<00:03:50.080> kind<00:03:50.260> of<00:03:50.319> back<00:03:50.530> going<00:03:50.980> up<00:03:51.129> again

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
people are kind of back going up again

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.039 
people are kind of back going up again

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
because every night we're getting better

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
and people can tell that as far as the

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.050

you have to find ways to make it better
because<00:04:18.039> i<00:04:18.280> know<00:04:18.340> for<00:04:18.850> me<00:04:18.940> when<00:04:19.090> i<00:04:19.120> was<00:04:19.209> in<00:04:19.329> new

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
because i know for me when i was in new

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.360 
because i know for me when i was in new
guy<00:04:19.630> I<00:04:19.750> was<00:04:19.900> so<00:04:19.989> overwhelmed<00:04:20.160> almost<00:04:21.160> every

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
guy I was so overwhelmed almost every

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.279 
guy I was so overwhelmed almost every
show<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:21.789> didn't<00:04:22.750> know<00:04:22.840> what<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:22.960> was<00:04:23.020> didn't

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
show I didn't know what I was didn't

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.779 
show I didn't know what I was didn't
write<00:04:23.800> it<00:04:23.830> was<00:04:24.100> so<00:04:24.250> hard<00:04:24.460> for<00:04:24.490> me<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.699> figure

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
write it was so hard for me to figure

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.730 
write it was so hard for me to figure
out<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:25.270> would<00:04:25.990> think<00:04:26.020> that<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.380> court<00:04:26.530> have<00:04:26.710> a

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
out I would think that the court have a

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.490 
out I would think that the court have a
great<00:04:27.449> performance<00:04:28.449> and<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:29.050> was<00:04:29.169> a<00:04:29.199> terrible

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
great performance and it was a terrible

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.080 
great performance and it was a terrible
and<00:04:29.949> i<00:04:30.039> would<00:04:30.190> think<00:04:30.280> we<00:04:30.430> had<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> terrible<00:04:30.910> one

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
and i would think we had a terrible one

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.409 
and i would think we had a terrible one
and<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.389> was<00:04:31.539> great<00:04:31.889> so<00:04:32.889> it's<00:04:33.070> you<00:04:33.940> try<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.180> just

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
and it was great so it's you try to just

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.150 
and it was great so it's you try to just
judge<00:04:34.690> what<00:04:35.229> you<00:04:35.260> do<00:04:35.500> wrong<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:35.949> make<00:04:36.039> it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
judge what you do wrong and make it

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.040 
judge what you do wrong and make it
better<00:04:36.250> every<00:04:36.550> night<00:04:36.729> but<00:04:37.389> that<00:04:37.630> drive<00:04:38.020> and

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
better every night but that drive and

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.170 
better every night but that drive and
that<00:04:38.289> energy<00:04:38.860> yeah<00:04:39.430> especially<00:04:39.639> with<00:04:40.060> this

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
that energy yeah especially with this

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.420 
that energy yeah especially with this
show<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.539> show<00:04:40.720> is<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:40.900> much<00:04:41.350> energy<00:04:41.530> you

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
show that show is so much energy you

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.690 
show that show is so much energy you
can't<00:04:42.699> be<00:04:43.360> calm<00:04:43.960> cool<00:04:44.320> collected<00:04:44.919> during<00:04:45.460> that

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
can't be calm cool collected during that

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.300 
can't be calm cool collected during that
opener<00:04:46.090> you<00:04:46.780> can't<00:04:47.020> do<00:04:47.139> that<00:04:47.289> because<00:04:47.500> we're

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
opener you can't do that because we're

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.460 
opener you can't do that because we're
pointing<00:04:48.760> after<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.180> crowd<00:04:49.419> we're<00:04:49.870> doing

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
pointing after the crowd we're doing

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.379 
pointing after the crowd we're doing
things<00:04:50.680> and<00:04:51.039> we're<00:04:51.190> supposed<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.550> be<00:04:51.669> hanging

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
things and we're supposed to be hanging

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.650 
things and we're supposed to be hanging
out<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:52.930> projecting<00:04:53.800> almost<00:04:54.099> like<00:04:54.250> this

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
out and projecting almost like this

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.420 
out and projecting almost like this
overconfidence<00:04:55.660> and<00:04:55.870> just<00:04:56.560> growing<00:04:57.250> energy

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
overconfidence and just growing energy

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.909 
overconfidence and just growing energy
at<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.789> crowd<00:04:58.090> so<00:04:58.750> it's<00:04:59.050> really<00:04:59.680> different

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
at the crowd so it's really different

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.279 
at the crowd so it's really different
and<00:05:00.130> doing<00:05:00.430> that<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:01.180> same<00:05:01.479> every<00:05:02.110> night

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
and doing that the same every night

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.140 
and doing that the same every night
whether<00:05:02.919> you<00:05:03.099> feel<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.550> you<00:05:03.700> want<00:05:03.880> to<00:05:03.940> put

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
whether you feel like you want to put

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.610 
whether you feel like you want to put
out<00:05:04.300> at<00:05:04.450> energy<00:05:04.720> to<00:05:04.780> protect<00:05:05.110> energy<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:05.590> have

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
out at energy to protect energy you have

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.519 
out at energy to protect energy you have
to

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:06.529 
to

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.489

not like any of us don't like performing

we<00:05:30.019> all<00:05:30.139> love<00:05:30.319> performing<00:05:30.799> I<00:05:31.009> love<00:05:31.579> this<00:05:31.759> show

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
we all love performing I love this show

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.409 
we all love performing I love this show
Oh<00:05:32.179> whether<00:05:33.139> or<00:05:33.289> not<00:05:33.409> it's<00:05:33.709> seeing<00:05:34.669> it<00:05:34.909> is<00:05:35.149> cool

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
Oh whether or not it's seeing it is cool

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.269 
Oh whether or not it's seeing it is cool
I<00:05:35.659> think<00:05:36.379> it<00:05:36.469> is<00:05:36.499> because<00:05:36.679> we<00:05:36.799> get<00:05:37.039> seeing

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:37.279 
I think it is because we get seeing

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.579 
I think it is because we get seeing
ovations<00:05:37.729> before<00:05:38.119> movements<00:05:38.749> are<00:05:38.839> done<00:05:39.019> so

00:05:39.579 --> 00:05:39.589 
ovations before movements are done so

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.069 
ovations before movements are done so
i'm<00:05:39.679> guessing<00:05:39.859> the<00:05:40.039> crowd<00:05:40.279> likes<00:05:40.489> it<00:05:40.719> but<00:05:41.719> just

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:42.079 
i'm guessing the crowd likes it but just

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:44.499 
i'm guessing the crowd likes it but just
performing<00:05:42.709> it<00:05:42.859> is<00:05:43.039> really<00:05:43.429> fun<00:05:43.609> it's<00:05:44.299> the
