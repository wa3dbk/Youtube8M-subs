this support guy I mean this is the best
one<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.290> fakes<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:13.950> still<00:01:14.330> no<00:01:15.330> comparison

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
one of fakes but still no comparison

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.469 
one of fakes but still no comparison
look<00:01:16.290> at<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> inside<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.040> guy<00:01:17.479> just

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
look at the inside of this guy just

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.039 
look at the inside of this guy just
straight<00:01:18.780> decaying<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:21.360> support<00:01:21.810> look<00:01:21.990> at

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
straight decaying the support look at

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
straight decaying the support look at
that<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.619> mean<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.549> authentic<00:01:23.850> it'd<00:01:24.150> be

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that I mean if it was authentic it'd be

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.109 
that I mean if it was authentic it'd be
like<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.799> stiff<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.939> know

the<00:01:34.979> biggest<00:01:35.189> thing<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.579> don't<00:01:35.729> get<00:01:35.850> into<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
the biggest thing I don't get into the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120 
the biggest thing I don't get into the
whole<00:01:36.329> sort<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.780> mountains<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.920> these

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
whole sort of mountains like these

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.420 
whole sort of mountains like these
things<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.000> fakes<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:40.829> fakes<00:01:41.130> got

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
things because the fakes the fakes got

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.020 
things because the fakes the fakes got
that<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.970> point<00:01:42.329> got<00:01:43.079> all<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> holes<00:01:44.030> the

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that on point got all the holes the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.249 
that on point got all the holes the
mountains<00:01:45.540> look<00:01:45.720> legit<00:01:47.689> but<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.930> look<00:01:49.079> for

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
mountains look legit but just look for

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.740 
mountains look legit but just look for
your<00:01:49.350> quality<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.299> mean<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.509> look<00:01:51.630> at

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
your quality I mean just look at

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.170 
your quality I mean just look at
stitching<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.979> back<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.549> sure<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.939> heel

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
stitching in the back for sure the heel

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.719 
stitching in the back for sure the heel
tab<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.920> doesn't<00:01:56.100> line<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
tab and that if it doesn't line up and

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.649 
tab and that if it doesn't line up and
the<00:01:56.790> stitching<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.329> like<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.750> they're<00:01:58.740> fake

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
the stitching is like that they're fake

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.389 
the stitching is like that they're fake
and<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.840> tongues<00:02:01.110> too<00:02:01.409> tongues<00:02:01.979> are<00:02:02.189> way

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and the tongues too tongues are way

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.950 
and the tongues too tongues are way
smaller<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.299> fakes<00:02:04.250> way<00:02:05.250> smaller

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
smaller on all the fakes way smaller

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.979 
smaller on all the fakes way smaller
yeah<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.200> thinks<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.920> higher

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
yeah that thinks it's higher

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.479 
yeah that thinks it's higher
if<00:02:10.109> it<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.500> out<00:02:12.170> like<00:02:13.170> these<00:02:13.439> ones<00:02:13.680> it's

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
if it was out like these ones it's

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.569 
if it was out like these ones it's
higher<00:02:14.760> than<00:02:14.790> them<00:02:15.829> on<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:17.040> face<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.549> just

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
higher than them on the face it just

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.759 
higher than them on the face it just
kind<00:02:17.969> of<00:02:18.030> hides<00:02:20.840> but<00:02:21.840> that's<00:02:22.049> sevens<00:02:22.650> are

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
kind of hides but that's sevens are

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.830 
kind of hides but that's sevens are
