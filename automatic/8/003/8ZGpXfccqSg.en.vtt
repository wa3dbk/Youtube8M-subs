from Fox tech fpv calm here is a ruler
to<00:00:09.330> show<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.900> dimensions<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> camera

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
to show you the dimensions of the camera

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.440 
to show you the dimensions of the camera
it<00:00:12.809> has<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.990> 20<00:00:13.469> centimeter<00:00:14.009> long<00:00:14.250> hdmi<00:00:14.880> cable

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
it has a 20 centimeter long hdmi cable

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.820 
it has a 20 centimeter long hdmi cable
linking<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> camera<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.379> main<00:00:16.619> board

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
linking the camera to the main board

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.010 
linking the camera to the main board
however<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.730> only<00:00:17.850> measured<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.539> 13

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
however I only measured it to 13

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.250 
however I only measured it to 13
centimeters<00:00:20.119> the<00:00:21.119> reason<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.930> there

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
centimeters the reason for this is there

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.700 
centimeters the reason for this is there
is<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> fold<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> wire<00:00:24.109> this<00:00:25.109> adds<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.439> stress

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
is a fold in the wire this adds a stress

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.040 
is a fold in the wire this adds a stress
release<00:00:26.070> point<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> camera<00:00:27.930> gets

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
release point so that if the camera gets

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.919 
release point so that if the camera gets
pulled<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.710> does<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.160> break<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> wire<00:00:29.929> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
pulled it does not break the wire is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.560 
pulled it does not break the wire is
very<00:00:31.710> strong<00:00:32.040> however<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
very strong however so that's not a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
very strong however so that's not a
problem<00:00:33.809> with<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.290> was<00:00:35.130> thinking<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.460> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
problem with this I was thinking that it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.910 
problem with this I was thinking that it
might<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.969> quite<00:00:36.149> weak<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.600> break<00:00:37.260> easily<00:00:37.500> but

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
might be quite weak and break easily but

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.540 
might be quite weak and break easily but
it<00:00:38.129> seems<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.430> hold<00:00:38.579> up

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.090 
for fpv use simply plug this into the
main<00:02:27.790> board<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.270> then<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.140> has<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.320> connector

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
main board and then it has a connector

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.290 
main board and then it has a connector
that<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.490> used<00:02:30.730> by<00:02:30.940> most<00:02:31.780> fpv<00:02:32.470> transmitters

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
that is used by most fpv transmitters

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:47.620 
that is used by most fpv transmitters
like<00:02:34.300> I'm<00:02:34.510> showing<00:02:34.780> here

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.020 

one<00:02:48.260> downside<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.740> would<00:02:49.010> say<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:49.580> camera

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
one downside I would say to this camera

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.750 
one downside I would say to this camera
is<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.230> buttons<00:02:51.590> are<00:02:51.800> fairly<00:02:52.310> hard<00:02:52.580> to

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
is that the buttons are fairly hard to

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.480 
is that the buttons are fairly hard to
press<00:02:53.000> they<00:02:53.720> are<00:02:53.960> really<00:02:54.530> small<00:02:54.830> buttons<00:02:55.220> and

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
press they are really small buttons and

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.120 
press they are really small buttons and
underneath<00:02:56.090> where<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> letters<00:02:57.020> are<00:02:57.170> where

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
underneath where the letters are where

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.530 
underneath where the letters are where
it<00:02:58.220> says<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.550> press<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.820> buttons<00:02:59.150> they're<00:02:59.390> not

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
it says to press the buttons they're not

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.930 
it says to press the buttons they're not
completely<00:03:00.320> lined<00:03:00.800> up<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.340> can't<00:03:01.610> have<00:03:01.760> to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
completely lined up so you can't have to

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.240 
completely lined up so you can't have to
feel<00:03:02.720> around<00:03:02.870> for<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.320> buttons<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.920> press<00:03:04.100> it

with<00:03:04.340> your<00:03:04.370> nail<00:03:05.320> another<00:03:06.320> downside<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.980> when

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
with your nail another downside is when

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.100 
with your nail another downside is when
you<00:03:07.310> put<00:03:07.550> pressure<00:03:07.730> on<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.060> buttons<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.930> also

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
it's similar to a laptop screen whereas

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.950

tell<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:37.940> much<00:03:38.150> wider<00:03:38.390> viewing<00:03:39.110> angle

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
tell it's a much wider viewing angle

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.060 
tell it's a much wider viewing angle
here's<00:03:41.330> a<00:03:41.420> comparison<00:03:41.660> of<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.200> both<00:03:42.470> I<00:03:45.070> also

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
here's a comparison of the both I also

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.030 
here's a comparison of the both I also
compared<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.820> GoPro<00:03:47.240> and<00:03:47.510> this<00:03:48.050> is<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.200> 720p

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
compared to the GoPro and this is a 720p

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.420 
compared to the GoPro and this is a 720p
at<00:03:49.340> 60<00:03:49.910> frames<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.270> second<00:03:51.070> as<00:03:52.070> you<00:03:52.310> can

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
at 60 frames a second as you can

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.340 
at 60 frames a second as you can
probably<00:03:52.640> see<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.240> colors<00:03:53.660> are<00:03:53.810> slightly

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
probably see the colors are slightly

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.010 
probably see the colors are slightly
more<00:03:54.590> natural<00:03:55.040> on<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.280> GoPro<00:03:55.540> but<00:03:56.540> the

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
more natural on the GoPro but the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.900 
more natural on the GoPro but the
horizon<00:03:57.380> HD<00:03:57.800> does<00:03:57.980> pretty<00:03:58.220> well<00:03:58.310> considering

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
horizon HD does pretty well considering

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.580 
horizon HD does pretty well considering
you<00:03:59.090> can't<00:03:59.300> just<00:03:59.480> do<00:03:59.660> color<00:03:59.900> correction<00:04:00.380> and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
you can't just do color correction and

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.760 
you can't just do color correction and
video<00:04:00.890> editing<00:04:00.920> afterwards<00:04:01.960> the<00:04:02.960> horizon<00:04:03.410> HD
