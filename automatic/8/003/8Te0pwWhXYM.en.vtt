00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.589
 he would see you again on another Friday 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.170
 in the whistle the goods in the whistle are 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.830
 days of true celebration and so 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.830
 we will see 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.650
 best 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.869
 two 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 I said that nonsense let's get 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 Serious 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.480
 today I come to talk about video games 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.940
 but what do I have to say today? 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.629
 many of the people who are watching 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.870
 this video does not like them in the top but 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.449
 is what happens the truths hurts and the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.440
 better since videogames exist 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.719
 there has been such a subtle evolutionary process 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.320
 so subtle that we have not counted count 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.810
 that we've gone from great games 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.810
 fucking deals the companies are 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.509
 they are taking the left-handed and leave in mind 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.750
 that among bigger graphics I have a 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.060
 I bet it's better when it's not like that but 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.210
 we have passed that the companies 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.270
 creating them with competing games 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.479
 a lot of creativity and gameplay and the one 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.819
 better graphs have is the one that wins at 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.399
 me this seems like a good shit if 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.530
 we all like to see a cinematic in a 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.360
 game that you say ostia what good is 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.759
 done but because he has to lose 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.830
 time to edit a character that we're going 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.880
 to see from an upper chamber so 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.000
 perfectly, whoever it is 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.119
 the designers who have been slow to make 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.460
 that your character has morosan this 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.680
 no skin color and we will face 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.110
 that aside from how he played a role of this 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.710
 decline of the games is that the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.350
 youth that is coming under 17 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.530
 they have the problem that they have not lived 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.750
 in epic games so to speak 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.330
 I give an example a long time ago on my channel 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.130
 of gameplay I climbed a series of chrono 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.250
 trailers right now the people that 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.950
 know the series and say golazo that 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.750
 epicity of moments that great that 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.930
 happened in the comments of this video 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.720
 so many children or children say 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.540
 equal uncultivated of life were put to 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.030
 criticize does not inform me of playing not me 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.340
 way to comment or how it was being 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.549
 what was being the video if there was no 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.459
 crossed the game of shit only by the 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:46.370
 graphics that had guys to take for ass 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:49.380
 this will be a bit old decrepit 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.290
 Well, the most games 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.170
 more every month every month when a 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.050
 game did not come out a game came out no 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.230
 it came out a piece of the game were with their 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.170
 children 20 hours to finish madness 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.180
 epic gameplay and that people doubted 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.590
 I fuck I buy this better soon and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.440
 that the two are good have a great 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.800
 story that more now than 10 games 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.290
 leaving only two or at most three are 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.750
 creative and original the rest are not 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.180
 more than animation movies with a 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.220
 little bit of gameplay and now it's coming 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.150
 when the public throws themselves at my neck 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.180
 a final fantasy 1 2 or 3 are fucked 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.970
 any fantasy page 12 13 or 14 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.430
 that is so if a game persists is good 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.350
 because it has graphics vila-real 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.260
 you are wrong I prefer to play a 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.830
 game in 24 bits with a gameplay to 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.870
 one to a playstation 5 game of 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.060
 virtual reality that the characters 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.970
 I seem to be myself and a shit of 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.010
 playability because the character 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.710
 the vein in my neck is getting 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.150
 so we've left the video here 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.940
 but you have to leave me is a 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.830
 comment saying what do you think of the 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.200
 old games compared to the 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.930
 classics do not tell me they outweigh the forsur 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.180
 jesus to shit and super mario 64 was 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.820
 much better because if you come to me I had 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.070
 that logic in super Mario theory 64 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.960
 it should be worse than super mario 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.780
 galaxy and it's not like that 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.269
 before getting hoarse and keep hitting 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.620
 challenges I say goodbye until next week 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.620
 or before if I want to bye
