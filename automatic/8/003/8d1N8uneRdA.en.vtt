the cool things about them is that
they're<00:01:11.590> dynamic<00:01:11.890> objects<00:01:12.729> which<00:01:12.909> means<00:01:13.560> even

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
they're dynamic objects which means even

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.370 
they're dynamic objects which means even
in<00:01:15.100> alpha<00:01:15.819> modders<00:01:16.420> will<00:01:16.659> be<00:01:16.780> able<00:01:16.899> to<00:01:17.110> change

in alpha modders will be able to change

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.169 
in alpha modders will be able to change
them<00:01:17.710> right<00:01:18.009> so<00:01:18.190> if<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.490> don't<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:19.030> can

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
built into the mount questing alright so

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.710 
built into the mount questing alright so
what's<00:01:30.310> going<00:01:30.459> on<00:01:30.549> here<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.209> elbow<00:01:31.479> are<00:01:31.569> some

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
what's going on here the elbow are some

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.680 
what's going on here the elbow are some
LD<00:01:32.110> or<00:01:32.200> cemetery<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.310> we<00:01:33.520> have<00:01:33.729> kind<00:01:34.479> of<00:01:34.539> the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
LD or cemetery so we have kind of the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.740 
LD or cemetery so we have kind of the
early<00:01:35.319> bits<00:01:35.679> of<00:01:35.890> what<00:01:36.340> will<00:01:36.640> eventually<00:01:36.789> be

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
early bits of what will eventually be

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.130 
early bits of what will eventually be
the<00:01:39.000> story<00:01:40.000> editor<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:42.310> progress<00:01:42.940> and<00:01:43.179> so<00:01:43.720> we

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
the story editor in progress and so we

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.660 
the story editor in progress and so we
have<00:01:44.349> some<00:01:44.619> we've<00:01:45.039> been<00:01:45.160> using<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.520> dynamic

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
have some we've been using the dynamic

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.279 
have some we've been using the dynamic
window<00:01:46.090> system<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.599> create<00:01:46.780> some<00:01:47.050> kind<00:01:47.170> of

100% focused on getting 3 alpha 2 into

you guys hands we will be allowing you
guys<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.410> run<00:02:59.410> your<00:02:59.680> own<00:02:59.920> servers<00:03:00.580> on<00:03:00.730> your<00:03:01.180> own

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
guys to run your own servers on your own

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.650 
guys to run your own servers on your own
computers<00:03:01.780> during<00:03:02.290> alpha<00:03:03.030> pre<00:03:04.030> alpha<00:03:04.180> 2<00:03:04.390> and

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
computers during alpha pre alpha 2 and

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.840 
computers during alpha pre alpha 2 and
so<00:03:05.410> that's<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.740> pretty<00:03:05.950> big<00:03:06.160> change<00:03:06.520> from<00:03:06.670> the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
so that's a pretty big change from the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.440 
so that's a pretty big change from the
original<00:03:06.880> plan<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:08.230> reason<00:03:08.590> for<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.800> is

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
original plan the reason for that is

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.020 
original plan the reason for that is
kind<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.690> one<00:03:11.590> reason<00:03:11.980> which<00:03:12.460> is<00:03:12.490> the<00:03:12.910> most

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
kind of to one reason which is the most

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.390 
kind of to one reason which is the most
obvious<00:03:13.570> is<00:03:13.750> it'll<00:03:14.380> be<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.530> lot<00:03:14.740> easier<00:03:14.800> for<00:03:15.310> you

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
obvious is it'll be a lot easier for you

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.310 
obvious is it'll be a lot easier for you
guys<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.820> play<00:03:16.360> with<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.600> modding<00:03:16.960> system

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
guys to play with the modding system

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.260 
guys to play with the modding system
because<00:03:17.980> you<00:03:18.100> can<00:03:18.220> just<00:03:18.400> fire<00:03:18.610> server<00:03:18.880> up<00:03:19.090> on

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
because you can just fire server up on

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.060 
because you can just fire server up on
your<00:03:19.390> own<00:03:19.450> box<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.930> can<00:03:20.050> see<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.470> logs<00:03:20.710> you

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
your own box you can see the logs you

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.670 
your own box you can see the logs you
can<00:03:21.220> easily<00:03:21.580> edit<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.910> files<00:03:22.410> it's<00:03:23.410> just

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
can easily edit the files it's just

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.530 
can easily edit the files it's just
going<00:03:23.800> to<00:03:23.830> be<00:03:23.920> way<00:03:24.310> easier<00:03:24.790> for<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.090> guys<00:03:25.300> to

reason for us was there was a lot of

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.580 
reason for us was there was a lot of
