against the best and I think that we've

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.550 
against the best and I think that we've
proven<00:01:32.280> capable<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.939> doing<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:34.530> other

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
proven capable of doing that the other

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.929 
proven capable of doing that the other
thing<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.280> goes<00:01:35.430> into<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.759> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
thing I think that goes into it is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.179 
thing I think that goes into it is
consistency<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.500> two<00:01:37.650> guys<00:01:37.829> that

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
consistency here you see two guys that

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.940 
consistency here you see two guys that
have<00:01:38.670> been<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:38.970> us<00:01:39.030> since<00:01:39.950> Nick<00:01:40.950> since<00:01:41.720> 2007

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
have been with us since Nick since 2007

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.490 
have been with us since Nick since 2007
right<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.189> Kyle<00:01:44.640> since<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> middle<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.509> 2007

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
right and Kyle since the middle of 2007

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.249 
right and Kyle since the middle of 2007
so<00:01:47.250> we've<00:01:47.430> been<00:01:47.579> together<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.909> long<00:01:48.060> time<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.810> I

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
so we've been together a long time and I

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.080 
so we've been together a long time and I
think<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.649> consistency<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.700> our<00:01:50.850> league<00:01:51.060> is

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
think that consistency in our league is

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.139 
think that consistency in our league is
one<00:01:51.509> way<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> success<00:01:53.369> as<00:01:53.909> I've

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
one way to to get to success as I've

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.310 
one way to to get to success as I've
seen<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> history<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> league<00:01:54.930> since

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
seen the history of the league since

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.889 
seen the history of the league since
1996<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.280> me<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> best<00:01:56.640> teams<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.149> always

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
1996 for me the best teams have always

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:58.969 
1996 for me the best teams have always
been<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> ones<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.649> stayed<00:01:58.829> together

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
been the ones that have stayed together

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.270 
been the ones that have stayed together
for<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.430> longest<00:01:59.759> now<00:02:00.090> some<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.680> born

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
for the longest now some of that is born

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.219 
for the longest now some of that is born
about<00:02:02.549> my<00:02:02.729> success<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.930> if<00:02:04.049> you're<00:02:04.200> not

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
about my success because if you're not

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.719 
about my success because if you're not
good<00:02:04.530> enough<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.009> won't<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.310> staying

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
good enough you won't be staying

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.889 
good enough you won't be staying
together<00:02:05.969> very<00:02:06.390> long<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.320> think<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
together very long so I think it's a

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.699 
together very long so I think it's a
circle<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:12.360> know<00:02:12.450> again<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:13.379> me<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.620> all

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
circle but you know again for me it all

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.250 
circle but you know again for me it all
just<00:02:13.920> comes

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
just comes

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.789 
just comes
down<00:02:14.349> to<00:02:14.530> teamwork<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.780> consistency<00:02:17.590> and

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
down to teamwork and consistency and

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.569 
down to teamwork and consistency and
leadership<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:19.049> think<00:02:20.099> there's<00:02:21.099> just<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.370> lot<00:02:21.519> of

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
leadership I think there's just a lot of

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.910 
leadership I think there's just a lot of
people<00:02:21.970> back<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.329> Utah<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.110> are<00:02:23.230> rooting<00:02:23.739> for

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
people back in Utah that are rooting for

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.539 
people back in Utah that are rooting for
us<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:25.709> they're<00:02:26.709> expecting<00:02:27.159> us<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.400> come

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
us and so they're expecting us to come

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.970 
us and so they're expecting us to come
home<00:02:27.670> with<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.879> win<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:29.319> that<00:02:29.590> pressure<00:02:29.860> I

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
home with the win is that pressure I

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.369 
home with the win is that pressure I
don't<00:02:30.220> know<00:02:30.310> if<00:02:30.629> if<00:02:31.629> it<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.200> good

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
don't know if if it is it's a good

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.440 
don't know if if it is it's a good
pressure<00:02:32.620> we<00:02:33.069> we<00:02:33.519> want<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.849> be<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.090> these<00:02:34.239> big

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
pressure we we want to be in these big

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.640 
pressure we we want to be in these big
games<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.959> bring<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:35.890> type<00:02:36.069> of<00:02:36.099> pressure

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
games that bring that type of pressure

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.740 
games that bring that type of pressure
but<00:02:38.650> we<00:02:38.980> really<00:02:39.519> can't<00:02:39.909> have<00:02:40.030> any<00:02:40.150> fear<00:02:40.450> we<00:02:40.629> got

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
but we really can't have any fear we got

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.330 
but we really can't have any fear we got
to<00:02:40.840> go<00:02:40.930> out<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.200> just<00:02:41.290> do<00:02:41.530> what<00:02:41.680> we've<00:02:41.829> done<00:02:42.129> to

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
to go out and just do what we've done to

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.780 
to go out and just do what we've done to
get<00:02:42.459> here<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.849> put<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:43.780> all<00:02:43.870> on<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.019> line<00:02:44.109> and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
get here and put it all on the line and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.710 
get here and put it all on the line and
you<00:02:45.790> know<00:02:45.879> if<00:02:46.060> we<00:02:46.180> go<00:02:46.329> out<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.480> give

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
you know if we go out and give

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.449 
you know if we go out and give
everything<00:02:46.930> we<00:02:47.049> got<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.590> that's<00:02:48.250> good<00:02:48.430> enough

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
everything we got and that's good enough

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.979 
everything we got and that's good enough
and<00:02:48.879> if<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.060> comes<00:02:49.180> with<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.390> trophy<00:02:49.599> that's

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
and if it comes with the trophy that's

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.630 
and if it comes with the trophy that's
great<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.739> if<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.010> doesn't<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:51.310> we'll<00:02:51.400> keep

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
great and if it doesn't then we'll keep

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.420 
great and if it doesn't then we'll keep
our<00:02:51.760> heads<00:02:51.940> high<00:02:52.090> but<00:02:52.420> um<00:02:52.720> it's<00:02:53.709> it's<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.280> mean

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
our heads high but um it's it's I mean

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.129 
our heads high but um it's it's I mean
it's<00:02:54.489> not<00:02:54.579> a<00:02:54.700> ton<00:02:54.909> of<00:02:54.940> pressure<00:02:55.180> really<00:02:55.569> we're

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
it's not a ton of pressure really we're

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.379 
it's not a ton of pressure really we're
having<00:02:56.470> fun<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.920> we're<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:57.879> doing<00:02:58.209> what<00:02:58.269> we

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
having fun and we're just doing what we

having fun and we're just doing what we
we've<00:02:58.989> been<00:02:59.170> taught<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.409> do<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.920> what<00:03:00.069> we<00:03:00.099> what

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
we've been taught to do and what we what

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.399 
we've been taught to do and what we what
we<00:03:00.609> enjoy<00:03:00.819> doing<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:01.659> that's<00:03:01.870> what<00:03:02.049> we'll<00:03:02.170> do

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
we enjoy doing so that's what we'll do

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.089 
we enjoy doing so that's what we'll do
and<00:03:02.650> lay<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.489> on<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.849> line<00:03:04.530> could<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.650> speak<00:03:05.980> a

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
and lay it on the line could you speak a

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.920 
and lay it on the line could you speak a
little<00:03:06.129> bit<00:03:06.340> about<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.909> conditions<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:07.840> are

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
little bit about the conditions that are

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.869 
little bit about the conditions that are
expected<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:08.650> Saturday<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:09.579> supposed<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.790> be

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
expected on Saturday it's supposed to be

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.759 
expected on Saturday it's supposed to be
really<00:03:10.030> cold<00:03:10.389> and<00:03:10.720> I'm<00:03:11.260> sure<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> temperature

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
really cold and I'm sure the temperature

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.170 
really cold and I'm sure the temperature
isn't<00:03:12.099> that<00:03:12.250> big<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.430> factor<00:03:12.639> but<00:03:12.790> you're<00:03:13.060> going

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
isn't that big a factor but you're going

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.640 
isn't that big a factor but you're going
to<00:03:13.239> know<00:03:13.420> until<00:03:13.599> you<00:03:13.840> know<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:13.989> condition<00:03:14.530> of

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
to know until you know the condition of

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.710 
to know until you know the condition of
the<00:03:14.769> pitch<00:03:15.099> itself<00:03:15.519> well<00:03:16.359> I'll<00:03:16.480> let<00:03:16.599> the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
the pitch itself well I'll let the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.910 
the pitch itself well I'll let the
players<00:03:16.930> talk<00:03:17.170> about<00:03:17.440> what<00:03:17.560> it's<00:03:17.680> like<00:03:17.769> to

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
players talk about what it's like to

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.259 
players talk about what it's like to
play<00:03:18.010> in<00:03:18.129> that<00:03:18.220> environment<00:03:18.489> but<00:03:18.849> we<00:03:18.970> just<00:03:19.150> did

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
play in that environment but we just did

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.670 
play in that environment but we just did
it<00:03:19.389> two<00:03:19.510> weeks<00:03:19.629> ago<00:03:19.810> it's<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.379> similar

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
it two weeks ago it's a similar

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.860 
it two weeks ago it's a similar
atmosphere<00:03:20.889> I<00:03:21.400> think<00:03:21.879> the<00:03:21.940> only<00:03:22.090> difficulty

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
atmosphere I think the only difficulty

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.960 
atmosphere I think the only difficulty
was<00:03:23.049> in<00:03:23.560> our<00:03:23.709> last<00:03:23.889> game<00:03:24.160> at<00:03:24.430> least<00:03:24.760> from<00:03:24.910> my

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
was in our last game at least from my

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.309 
was in our last game at least from my
perspective<00:03:25.120> was<00:03:25.599> there<00:03:25.989> was<00:03:26.079> a<00:03:26.109> little

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
perspective was there was a little

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.409 
perspective was there was a little
miscommunication<00:03:26.530> we<00:03:27.129> normally<00:03:27.519> put<00:03:28.209> water

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
miscommunication we normally put water

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.390 
miscommunication we normally put water
on<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.720> field<00:03:28.930> before<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.319> game<00:03:29.349> they<00:03:29.739> kind

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
on the field before the game they kind

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.619 
on the field before the game they kind
of<00:03:30.459> make<00:03:30.579> sure<00:03:30.669> that<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.879> ball<00:03:31.060> can<00:03:31.239> move<00:03:31.449> a

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
of make sure that the ball can move a

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.009 
of make sure that the ball can move a
little<00:03:31.750> more<00:03:31.959> quick<00:03:32.169> quickly<00:03:32.859> but<00:03:33.160> I<00:03:34.019> didn't

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
little more quick quickly but I didn't

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.089 
little more quick quickly but I didn't
want<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.169> to<00:03:35.260> be<00:03:35.410> put<00:03:35.590> on<00:03:35.680> there<00:03:35.829> as<00:03:35.919> well<00:03:36.040> as

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
communication someone put a little bit

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.720 
communication someone put a little bit
on<00:03:37.840> there<00:03:38.019> in<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.859> second<00:03:39.190> half<00:03:39.340> because<00:03:39.519> the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
on there in the second half because the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.009 
on there in the second half because the
temperature<00:03:40.120> dropped<00:03:40.359> a<00:03:40.480> little<00:03:40.629> bit<00:03:40.780> was<00:03:40.930> at

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
temperature dropped a little bit was at

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.479 
temperature dropped a little bit was at
nighttime<00:03:41.379> there<00:03:41.919> was<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.069> little<00:03:42.220> bit<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.430> a

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
nighttime there was a little bit of a

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.830 
nighttime there was a little bit of a
frost<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.940> started<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.299> come<00:03:43.480> on<00:03:43.599> to<00:03:43.750> the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
frost that started to come on to the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.900 
frost that started to come on to the
field<00:03:44.160> that's<00:03:45.160> not<00:03:45.340> going<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.519> happen<00:03:45.609> this

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
field that's not going to happen this

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.360 
field that's not going to happen this
time<00:03:45.970> around<00:03:46.269> we<00:03:47.260> do<00:03:47.349> have<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.530> sub<00:03:47.769> air<00:03:47.980> system

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
time around we do have a sub air system

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.280 
time around we do have a sub air system
under<00:03:48.699> the<00:03:48.790> field<00:03:49.060> which<00:03:49.389> will<00:03:49.419> continue<00:03:50.199> to

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
under the field which will continue to

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.619 
under the field which will continue to
sort<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.590> blow<00:03:50.739> hot<00:03:51.010> air<00:03:51.040> underneath<00:03:51.669> so<00:03:52.329> I

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
sort of blow hot air underneath so I

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.150 
sort of blow hot air underneath so I
think<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.139> more<00:03:53.290> dangerous<00:03:53.680> thing<00:03:53.889> for<00:03:53.919> the

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
think the more dangerous thing for the

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.860 
think the more dangerous thing for the
players<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.579> when<00:03:54.699> the<00:03:54.819> field<00:03:55.030> freezes<00:03:55.660> I

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
players is when the field freezes I

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.069 
players is when the field freezes I
don't<00:03:56.620> don't<00:03:56.919> see<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:57.400> happening<00:03:57.609> so<00:03:58.150> from

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
don't don't see that happening so from

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.390 
don't don't see that happening so from
that<00:03:59.109> point<00:03:59.379> of<00:03:59.500> view<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.680> don't<00:04:00.129> think<00:04:00.280> there's

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
that point of view I don't think there's

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.009 
that point of view I don't think there's
going<00:04:00.489> to<00:04:00.579> be<00:04:00.639> any<00:04:00.730> problems<00:04:01.540> there<00:04:01.720> but<00:04:01.930> i'll

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
going to be any problems there but i'll

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.869 
going to be any problems there but i'll
let<00:04:02.139> them<00:04:02.230> talk<00:04:02.470> about<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.859> cold<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:03.340> turn
