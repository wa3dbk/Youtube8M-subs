to<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> little<00:01:47.640> bit<00:01:47.790> more<00:01:47.909> heavy<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.750> it's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to be a little bit more heavy but it's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.499

out on the cameras I'll try later but

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.470 
out on the cameras I'll try later but
you<00:02:27.890> can<00:02:28.040> slightly<00:02:28.460> see<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.000> grain<00:02:29.240> of<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
you can slightly see the grain of the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.360 
you can slightly see the grain of the
wood<00:02:29.510> coming<00:02:29.900> through<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.800> it's<00:02:31.190> not

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
wood coming through so it's not

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.390 
wood coming through so it's not
absolutely<00:02:32.180> caked<00:02:32.600> in<00:02:32.780> lacquer<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.710> color

absolutely caked in lacquer and color
which<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.180> really<00:02:35.300> good<00:02:35.570> other<00:02:35.930> than<00:02:36.050> that<00:02:36.320> I

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
which is really good other than that I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.750 
which is really good other than that I
don't<00:02:36.650> think<00:02:36.770> there's<00:02:36.920> really<00:02:37.070> much<00:02:37.190> else<00:02:37.670> to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
don't think there's really much else to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.910 
don't think there's really much else to
say<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.030> will<00:02:38.450> give<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.440> taste<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.770> some<00:02:39.890> of

with a little bit more flexibility a bit

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.210 
with a little bit more flexibility a bit
more<00:02:57.200> oomph<00:02:57.470> than<00:02:58.010> your<00:02:58.160> standard<00:02:58.340> P<00:02:58.670> bass
