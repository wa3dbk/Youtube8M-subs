I have students who were traumatized

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.000 
I have students who were traumatized
because<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.960> parent<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> throes<00:00:55.980> of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
because the parent was in the throes of

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.389

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it some kind of a let's just call it a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.630 
it some kind of a let's just call it a
score<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:07.229> their<00:01:07.380> addiction<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.340> there's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
score for their addiction so there's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.850 
score for their addiction so there's
lots<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.360> different<00:01:09.420> kinds<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.619> things

underneath this it's about the child's
perceptional<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:15.119> might<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.659> something<00:01:16.470> that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
perceptional it might be something that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
perceptional it might be something that
struck<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.880> child<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.780> certain<00:01:19.020> way<00:01:19.140> at

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
that moment that they could not resolve

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
in their own minds with the mom who's

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
in their own minds with the mom who's
driving<00:01:26.130> across<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.520> mountain<00:01:26.970> pass<00:01:27.210> for

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
driving across a mountain pass for

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.289 
driving across a mountain pass for
example<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.259> says<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.490> kids<00:01:29.790> can't<00:01:30.119> get

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
example and says if you kids can't get

example and says if you kids can't get
yourself<00:01:30.630> under<00:01:30.780> control<00:01:30.900> I'm<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
yourself under control I'm going to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
yourself under control I'm going to
drive<00:01:31.950> off<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.130> cliff<00:01:32.280> for<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.450> mom<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:34.110> was

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
drive off the cliff for that mom it was

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
drive off the cliff for that mom it was
probably<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.979> momentary<00:01:35.579> thing<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
probably just a momentary thing and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.590 
probably just a momentary thing and
maybe<00:01:36.570> she<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:37.020> screaming<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.570> for<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
maybe she was screaming it but for a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.960 
maybe she was screaming it but for a
child<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.439> an<00:01:40.590> impressionable<00:01:40.920> age<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
child at an impressionable age and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.429 
child at an impressionable age and
moment<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.829> turn<00:01:44.070> into<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.610> long-term

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
moment that can turn into a long-term

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.679 
moment that can turn into a long-term
unhealed<00:01:46.439> wound<00:01:46.799> who<00:01:47.729> knows<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.329> else<00:01:48.450> was

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
unhealed wound who knows what else was

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.359 
unhealed wound who knows what else was
going<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> child's<00:01:49.740> life<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
going on in the child's life at that

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.700 
going on in the child's life at that
moment<00:01:50.430> maybe<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.509> parents<00:01:52.290> were<00:01:52.530> going

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
moment maybe the parents were going

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.480 
moment maybe the parents were going
through<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.130> divorce<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:55.560> mom<00:01:55.799> was<00:01:56.100> not

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
through a divorce and the mom was not

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.300 
through a divorce and the mom was not
exactly<00:01:56.939> herself<00:01:57.570> at<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.960> time<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.920> how<00:01:59.250> we

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
exactly herself at that time it's how we

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.850 
exactly herself at that time it's how we
as<00:02:00.030> children<00:02:00.170> or<00:02:01.820> adolescents<00:02:03.860> perceived

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
as children or adolescents perceived

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.119 
as children or adolescents perceived
that<00:02:05.189> moment<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.780> took<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.950> into

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that moment and then took it into

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.940 
that moment and then took it into
ourselves<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:09.000> could<00:02:09.239> not<00:02:09.420> resolve<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.590> sure

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
ourselves and could not resolve it sure

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.730 
ourselves and could not resolve it sure
I<00:02:10.979> have<00:02:11.400> students<00:02:11.940> whose<00:02:12.090> parents

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
I have students whose parents

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.670 
I have students whose parents
were<00:02:12.940> not<00:02:13.940> necessarily<00:02:14.120> very<00:02:14.870> responsible

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
were not necessarily very responsible

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.500 
were not necessarily very responsible
sometimes<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.370> was<00:02:16.460> trauma<00:02:16.760> sometimes<00:02:17.300> there

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
sometimes it was trauma sometimes there

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.530 
sometimes it was trauma sometimes there
was<00:02:17.630> abuse<00:02:17.930> because<00:02:18.350> of<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.740> but<00:02:19.430> also<00:02:19.700> there

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
was abuse because of that but also there

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.050 
was abuse because of that but also there
