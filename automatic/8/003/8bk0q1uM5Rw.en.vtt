00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.280
 his own video here on the channel 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.290
 and to a new team of the year 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.150
 market crash squad pictures the last one 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.530
 Little was missing because one did not succeed 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.439
 chemistry i kinda had the 4-3-3 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.819
 in the head so the left of it then have 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.640
 somehow did not notice that it was a 4 3 

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:24.319
 2 not so works fine but so what 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 happens so what can happen is 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.319
 I do not think so bad 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.789
 That's why I have another scott 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.630
 built and that is also very much 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.729
 well, I think so 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.590
 and of course I will do that for you too 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:35.780
 Now imagine how he might be as good 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.850
 have against one of the description and 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.170
 headphone sennheiser until the answer 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.220
 if we want to protect us yet 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.870
 back up again I am myself 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.460
 We are happy to start at the gate around Tor 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.660
 Do we have a player? I think so 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.430
 the most expensive player in the team 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.380
 it is also the highest for samir handanovic 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.890
 worth players in this team with an 83 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.030
 because you can do everything depends on which 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.520
 But the case I assume, unfortunately, 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.390
 Keeper Yann Danis took one of the 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.920
 best but differing yes 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.010
 Not so much if you put chestnuts 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.180
 yes, so you can take roland ries 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.250
 You can take pakistan into the gate 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.590
 present here also can high foot 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.579
 make or keep morgan de sanctis though 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.920
 I have now decided madrid 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.380
 because additional nations and yes me 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.060
 do not talk fast saying good steve 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.829
 antin good physics values ​​relatively large 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.850
 contribute with loire what more could you want 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.889
 the other defender is 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.149
 Also the support is very much me 

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:22.729
 do not like to use it because I like it 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.539
 I do not like but it will be natural for the 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.420
 passers-by will be 670 rating 80 tempo 48 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.969
 74 46 extremely good body strength low 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.889
 medium work 394 big what do you want 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.060
 All I can say is that we are coming 

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.709
 to defend one over from this one 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.049
 also relatively good on the left 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:40.759
 side we have dennis aogo he is not 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.350
 so unbelievable mega-star no in shape 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.779
 you may have used or if you have 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.909
 absolutely would like to have 

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:49.490
 otherwise take the normal level 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.509
 work pace is enough and very 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.770
 good values ​​can be in any case 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.939
 but deal right side have if 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.380
 one of the best right-backs in the 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.289
 play in my opinion and indeed 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.229
 abdulai kongo with 86 tempo with 770 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.909
 dribbling occurred with 82 56 medium work 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.740
 he too is a real bank of the rear 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.299
 You can definitely play like that 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.740
 Sixer is one of the really too 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.450
 for the six there I am somehow 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.100
 should play forward but only in the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.830
 defensive work is supposed to work 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.569
 the lucas leiva plays liverpool 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.879
 and 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.140
 his straight looks a relative 960 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.239
 tempo only but otherwise he is one 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.379
 pretty good player 179 bigger than 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.060
 headphones can also win the 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.889
 the biggest but I need stop for 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.019
 the player who stands in front there is well 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.609
 and right side by the way you can here 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.030
 but still vary to the same 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.099
 more 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.989
 and on the right side is one 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.329
 midfield somebody named ancestor 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.650
 he plays at olympique lyon is the 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.760
 perfect link to our striker me 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.230
 guess you can you then we think 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.120
 of course you can come too 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.590
 chilled or green here to stand 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.879
 but then the French managers 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.989
 they have full chemistry even as tens 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.489
 that means no extra money 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.590
 spend if you have a French 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.700
 manager has fine in the year and then 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.290
 somehow, before it has the money 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.939
 or one received so far offensively 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.219
 can do because the midfield the 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.689
 is relatively defensive but otherwise stop 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.219
 ancestors from the actually relatively 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.840
 has proven well and now pretty much 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.109
 could be selfish because occupy on 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.659
 the other side a light ibm wants the 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.379
 Belgian midfielder from the 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.150
 spurs the 79 pace with 68 83 40 40 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.760
 this of course applies branch office refood 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.109
 is completely clear if this 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.579
 Year very very good 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.590
 each case uses all values ​​of 270 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.879
 except the pending home sales is whether the 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.409
 Over 70 so definitely 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.150
 the tens is recommended then the 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.739
 favorite player again from the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.389
 commercial and that is the philippe 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.400
 coutinho 1 has become the bbu 780 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.659
 dribbling an 80 example completely in 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.650
 order the example feels better 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.299
 to the can already say also 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.680
 The shot is not the strongest 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.879
 but he can definitely beautiful goals 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.799
 shoot really nice weather 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.930
 with him to perfect skills 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.239
 training what more do you want the other 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.759
 Striker on loan is the first striker 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.159
 alexandre lacazette I think you can 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:46.540
 of course you could now too 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.009
 for example, one of the three 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.269
 ask midfielder of some 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:52.629
 and in the form of china or the normal 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.120
 Ingenious cabaret artist Herbert 83 still too 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.040
 780 the b 72 46 we all know how 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.509
 Strong is the money and with funds 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.040
 equipped is then right him 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.269
 as another striker is a bit of the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.169
 physical striker with it also a per 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.900
 header duels can win when it 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.819
 always my personal preference 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.560
 put down ankara soldado or any 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.759
 others someday the couple here from 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.680
 I do not have the spurs now 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:13.810
 can revive somehow, too 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.870
 take a chance depending on how you like 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.310
 has carmen b free boni company going 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.719
 everything I have decided so much because I 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.949
 a very cool find a lecture 

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:22.720
 is valid and, despite its size, relative 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.930
 good with 76 with 11 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.130
 I think it's the good 90 is all 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.440
 perfectly clear that was once favorite 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.240
 striker and that's why we have in this 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.290
 let team in it costs about 15 km 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.670
 were so claim 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.410
 and I guess that can definitely 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.510
 fall during this team at the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.770
 eat while the brand crash at that time no 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.940
 loss with and you can do it 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.110
 probably most games too 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.130
 still win as well as the video weather 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.050
 please thumb up there 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.300
 The last word yesterday is that me 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.500
 again bonus video again bite this time 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.500
 then go in and look
