00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello people i am the laura and i 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.280
 have been around for about one and a half weeks now 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.960
 and I will tell you what 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 I experienced my first week like this 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.590
 with the dirt are very thin what me 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.539
 but also very good to find 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.550
 but I hope that with time 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.410
 Become a bit thicker than crocheting 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.000
 I have been in the first week 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.529
 actually not very special 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.710
 a lot of crocheting but with individual 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.739
 It was then necessary to stare there 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.550
 partly whole strands up again 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.040
 but I can crochet out now 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.300
 unfortunately not anymore or is a bit 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.399
 have become more complicated my 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.489
 broken crochet hook is monkeys I found the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.730
 first two three four days very much 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.809
 uncomfortable because the scalp still 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.149
 a bit hurt by the Serbs in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.160
 make and that is still a few 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.320
 Days away what a little something 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.010
 it's a bit annoying that the jets are still up 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.280
 So a little bit off here 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.659
 especially on the sides 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.240
 after one and a half weeks they have 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.430
 always not completely laid back I realize 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.159
 but also feel that hall 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.100
 put a lot closer to the head and that is 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.820
 since a lot has done but just that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.560
 not yet 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 how was that with you up with the up 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.390
 were the hair after a few days 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.820
 okay or 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.500
 how long did it take you to get it? 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.960
 you may have liked to put in the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.570
 Write comments before the jets were 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:47.149
 My hair is about as long and individual 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.329
 strands are almost always so long 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.590
 almost always as long though 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.299
 basically you can say that 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.299
 lost a few inches 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.880
 I also decorated them a bit 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.880
 already with flags 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:20.710
 here you can gladly your experiences 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.380
 or further questions for the first week 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.520
 put dirt and in the comments 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.350
 write 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.160
 I would be very happy 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.160
 for watching
