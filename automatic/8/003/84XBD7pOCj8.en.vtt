camera the height width the distance to
the<00:02:02.369> shutter<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.479> knew<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.259> would

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the shutter well I knew that I would

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.620 
the shutter well I knew that I would
mess<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> big<00:02:05.430> time<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.939> was<00:02:06.060> relying<00:02:06.450> on

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
mess this a big time if I was relying on

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.199 
mess this a big time if I was relying on
some<00:02:06.899> measurements<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.649> basically

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
some measurements so I basically

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.520 
some measurements so I basically
eyeballed<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.330> location<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.989> where<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
eyeballed the location of where the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.230 
eyeballed the location of where the
servo<00:02:10.950> would<00:02:11.099> go<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.550> relation<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
servo would go in relation to the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.660 
servo would go in relation to the
digital<00:02:13.600> camera<00:02:14.080> shutter<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.710> dug<00:02:15.340> through<00:02:15.550> my

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
digital camera shutter I dug through my

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.060 
digital camera shutter I dug through my
wood<00:02:15.880> screws<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.570> found<00:02:17.080> two<00:02:17.470> screws<00:02:17.830> that

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
wood screws and found two screws that

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.010 
wood screws and found two screws that
would<00:02:18.190> be<00:02:18.340> perfect<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.330> would<00:02:19.480> mount<00:02:19.690> the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.100 
would be perfect that would mount the
servo<00:02:20.530> right<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.520> one<00:02:21.790> end<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.450> our<00:02:22.870> top

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
servo right to the one end of our top

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.920 
servo right to the one end of our top
mast<00:02:23.610> after<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> bunch<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.090> adjustments<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.810> get

mast after a bunch of adjustments to get
it<00:02:26.050> just<00:02:26.260> right<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.950> worked<00:02:27.280> great<00:02:27.580> the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
it just right it worked great the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.360 
it just right it worked great the
transmitter<00:02:28.630> was<00:02:28.870> able<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.230> trigger<00:02:30.100> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
transmitter was able to trigger the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.760 
transmitter was able to trigger the
servo<00:02:30.760> which<00:02:31.210> triggered<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.780> shutter<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.440> our

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
servo which triggered the shutter on our

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.890 
servo which triggered the shutter on our
camera<00:02:33.190> now<00:02:33.760> it's<00:02:33.940> time<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.150> position<00:02:34.720> the

bottom frame or our mast attachment and
we'll<00:02:37.630> be<00:02:37.720> using<00:02:38.020> another<00:02:38.140> servo<00:02:38.980> which<00:02:39.430> is

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
we'll be using another servo which is

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.370 
we'll be using another servo which is
actually<00:02:39.940> going<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.180> be<00:02:40.300> tilting<00:02:40.810> our<00:02:41.050> top

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
actually going to be tilting our top

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.950 
actually going to be tilting our top
