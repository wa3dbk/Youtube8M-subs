00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:11.090
 hi i am andre and this is the new one 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.820
 sony reader namely the prs t3 and will 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.289
 this t3 has the good reputation of the t2 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.630
 continue with the t3 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.250
 a usb cable for synchronization and 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.660
 charger included 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.519
 In addition, we also find a handy one 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.439
 suitcase which is the front of the screen 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.449
 protected and also has 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.160
 a magnet closure that makes the kiri the 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.740
 automatically turns on and off when you turn on the 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.750
 the sony reader opens or closes the case 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.059
 is made of fine-feeling plastic 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.430
 what a good grip offers is a must 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.320
 long and comfortable to read 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.000
 the case is finished with a leather 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.989
 look and has one on the inside 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.420
 soft finish 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.510
 Furthermore, the drove has one more 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.680
 micro usb port and reset button and one on 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.210
 and off button 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.190
 if we have the suitcase and are behind flap 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.269
 remove then we still see the micro sd 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.280
 card slot 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.559
 compared to its predecessor stands out 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.129
 that the d2 is slightly lighter and even more compact 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.260
 is of format with the prst3 wants sony one 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.940
 worthy successor to the prs t2 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.280
 drop with here and there small ones 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.020
 modifications to the design in the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.030
 dimensions, the screen is still 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.070
 Stayed 6-inch by the newest river 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.060
 the screen is from sony real 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.310
 resolution increased to 1024 at 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.229
 768 pixels also the quality of it 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.840
 screen has been further improved we see that 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.180
 the contrast ratio is better and that the led 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.950
 is also sharper 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.570
 the only thing that is really missing is a good one 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.770
 backlight which also makes you in the dark 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.240
 can read 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.670
 This can really be overcome by one 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.649
 extra suitcase to purchase with the lamp 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.450
 the software is basically not very bad 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.399
 much changed there are some small ones 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.540
 adjustments and the yellow job just a little 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.009
 slightly faster 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.469
 reading a book is therefore the 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.810
 no problems with the tutskrien can 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.549
 you can easily navigate everywhere 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.810
 the built-in WiFi also ensures it 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.820
 before you can book directly 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.500
 download and possibly also a bit fast 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.090
 can look up on the internet 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.369
 only the latter works anyway 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.590
 not fast enough the built-in battery 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.930
 offers reading pleasure in two months 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.729
 has a special quick charge mode 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.590
 this means that you get the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.540
 ereader can charge to one 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.400
 to be able to read the entire book 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.450
 however, this only works with one 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.490
 extra adapter 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.260
 In addition, the case has that standard 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.450
 included is a so-called 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.129
 auto sleep function this week and keep in 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.689
 that through the magnet you like you 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.209
 the case closes the i3 the 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.069
 automatically goes into standby mode and 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.930
 the moment you open it, it goes 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.849
 turn on automatically and you can immediately 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.700
 continue reading on many points is the t3 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.750
 reader remained the same as the t2 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.579
 predecessor 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.530
 on a number of crucial points 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.970
 there are improvements here 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.829
 a better screen 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.859
 the reduced screen flicker and 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.989
 the lower weight is also correct 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.609
 because the t3 is not extremely much 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.819
 has changed it is worthy 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.909
 successor of the t2 you want the sony 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.760
