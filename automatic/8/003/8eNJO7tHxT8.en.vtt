 Jegan 2:00 AM January 20, 10:10 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.650
 We have received an urgent fire report from a residential area in Mapo. 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.840
 It was a fire in a house where a 70s grandmother lived alone. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 I'll report it in a second, and there are two blabla bumpers. 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.980

 I only see three feet . 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:53.200
 The priest was trembling, but unfortunately, she was dead. 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.340
 However, the house of the grandmother who saw firefighting was quite different from that of the general public 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.790
 I will 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:03.640
 Where was the deceased? 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:06.400
 It is here in front of the entrance door of the inner door and it is germinated here. 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.430

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.630

 A fire accident usually starts with a fire that deals with fire. 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:23.050
 This incident is unusual, but I hope it is not a mess. 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:28.660
 What was worse than anything was the appearance of my deceased grandmother. 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.770
 Even though I think that the general appearance of the fire at the scene of the fire 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.690
 It was not 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:39.700
 From the facial side, we found traces of beating, 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:42.460

 Why would someone love grandma? 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.550
 When the witness who first reported the fire goes up to the house, the door opens. 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.470
 It was in a state 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:25.070
 If you were a burglar, you could open the door forcibly 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.070
 He 'll stay . 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.500
 But I could not find any trace of it anywhere. 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.040
 I wonder if the scope was a person who knew her normally 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.600

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:47.130
