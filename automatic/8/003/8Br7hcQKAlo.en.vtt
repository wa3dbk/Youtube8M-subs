i<00:01:38.340> know<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:39.049> San<00:01:40.049> Diego's<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.860> shambles

week<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.430> probably<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.820> only<00:01:50.939> one

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
week I think I was probably the only one

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.420 
week I think I was probably the only one
entire<00:01:51.780> world<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.290> unseen<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.950> could<00:01:53.220> beat

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
entire world of unseen you could beat

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.230 
entire world of unseen you could beat
Chicago<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.899> paid<00:01:55.560> dearly<00:01:55.829> for<00:01:56.009> ya<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:57.149> know

Chicago I paid dearly for ya you know

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.179 
Chicago I paid dearly for ya you know
however<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> San<00:01:58.079> Diego<00:01:58.320> defense<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.979> thought

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
however the San Diego defense I thought

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.389 
however the San Diego defense I thought
played<00:01:59.549> very<00:02:00.000> well<00:02:00.270> um<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.799> know<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.009> bad<00:02:02.219> as

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
played very well um you know as bad as

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.520 
played very well um you know as bad as
the<00:02:02.549> offense<00:02:02.939> was<00:02:03.119> executing<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.020> Philip

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the offense was executing and Philip

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.080 
the offense was executing and Philip
Rivers<00:02:04.680> must<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.189> been<00:02:05.280> seeing<00:02:05.549> double<00:02:06.000> or

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
Rivers must have been seeing double or

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.760 
Rivers must have been seeing double or
triple<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:06.630> something<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.110> don't<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.469> what<00:02:07.710> he

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
triple or something I don't know what he

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.619 
triple or something I don't know what he
was<00:02:07.890> even<00:02:08.129> throwing<00:02:08.429> at<00:02:08.670> sometimes<00:02:09.209> maybe

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
was even throwing at sometimes maybe

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.040 
was even throwing at sometimes maybe
he's<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:10.050> drugs<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:11.270> don't<00:02:12.270> know<00:02:12.450> some<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
he's on drugs I don't know some of the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.320 
he's on drugs I don't know some of the
Rose<00:02:13.290> were<00:02:13.530> bizarre<00:02:13.920> yeah<00:02:14.310> even<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.180> a

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
Rose were bizarre yeah even for a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.730 
Rose were bizarre yeah even for a
quarterback<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:16.050> struggling<00:02:16.560> when

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
quarterback that's struggling when

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.810 
quarterback that's struggling when
you're<00:02:16.830> struggling<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.370> would<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:17.640> throw

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
you're struggling you would just throw

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.150 
you're struggling you would just throw
the<00:02:17.970> ball<00:02:18.120> away<00:02:18.240> mm-hmm<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.740> why<00:02:19.920> they're<00:02:20.130> a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
the ball away mm-hmm so why they're a

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.010 
the ball away mm-hmm so why they're a
six<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.580> half<00:02:20.610> point<00:02:20.970> favorite<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.600> guess

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
six and a half point favorite I guess

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.330 
six and a half point favorite I guess
has<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> lot<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.620> do<00:02:22.770> with<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.010> fact<00:02:23.040> that

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
has a lot to do with the fact that

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.760 
has a lot to do with the fact that
nobody<00:02:23.760> trusts<00:02:24.060> tebowie<00:02:24.510> right<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.080> think<00:02:25.560> San

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
nobody trusts tebowie right I think San

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.320 
nobody trusts tebowie right I think San
Diego<00:02:26.100> might<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.520> defense<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.240> it

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
Diego might have the defense to do it

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.690 
Diego might have the defense to do it
the<00:02:27.420> whole<00:02:27.600> key<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.350> read<00:02:28.710> option<00:02:29.010> as<00:02:29.490> we

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
the whole key to that read option as we

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.910 
the whole key to that read option as we
know<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.360> defensive<00:02:30.990> ends<00:02:31.320> have<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.770> be

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
know is the defensive ends have to be

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.770 
know is the defensive ends have to be
responsible<00:02:32.280> for<00:02:32.670> containment<00:02:33.060> they<00:02:33.480> can't

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
responsible for containment they can't

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.360 
responsible for containment they can't
be<00:02:33.930> rushing<00:02:34.320> up<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.560> field<00:02:34.830> thinking<00:02:35.070> that

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
be rushing up the field thinking that

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.300

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
know Vince Young actually ran that a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.020 
know Vince Young actually ran that a
couple<00:02:39.990> times<00:02:40.140> last<00:02:40.530> night<00:02:41.010> although<00:02:41.730> he<00:02:41.880> did

couple times last night although he did

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.880 
couple times last night although he did
not<00:02:42.210> keep<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.600> ball<00:02:42.810> because<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> defensive

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
not keep the ball because the defensive

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.690 
not keep the ball because the defensive

forced<00:02:47.750> Vince<00:02:48.750> Young<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.110> hand<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.410> off<00:02:49.560> now

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
forced Vince Young to hand it off now

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.920 
forced Vince Young to hand it off now
with<00:02:50.610> Denver's<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.120> lot<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.360> times<00:02:51.570> where<00:02:51.810> those

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
with Denver's a lot of times where those

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
with Denver's a lot of times where those
defensive<00:02:52.350> ends<00:02:52.560> are<00:02:52.650> not<00:02:52.890> making<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> right

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
defensive ends are not making the right

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.450 
defensive ends are not making the right
of<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.600> right<00:02:55.440> move<00:02:55.710> they're<00:02:55.980> getting<00:02:56.280> too

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
of the right move they're getting too

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.120 
of the right move they're getting too
far<00:02:56.670> upfield<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:58.080> gives<00:02:58.290> Tebow<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.800> big

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
far upfield and that gives Tebow a big

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.390 
far upfield and that gives Tebow a big
lane<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.520> run<00:02:59.730> through<00:03:00.710> so<00:03:01.710> there<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.100> really<00:03:02.130> a

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
lane to run through so there is really a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.240 
lane to run through so there is really a
defensive<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.840> know<00:03:03.930> kind<00:03:04.260> of<00:03:04.410> slow<00:03:04.740> down<00:03:04.980> to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
defensive you know kind of slow down to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.610 
defensive you know kind of slow down to
the<00:03:05.400> Tebow<00:03:05.760> effect<00:03:06.240> it<00:03:06.420> might<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:06.900> San<00:03:07.200> Diego

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
the Tebow effect it might be San Diego

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.110 
the Tebow effect it might be San Diego
