a map up and running basically all you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.800 
a map up and running basically all you
need<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.570> well<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> need<00:01:16.800> two<00:01:17.009> things<00:01:17.810> first

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
need is well you need two things first

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.190 
need is well you need two things first
you<00:01:18.960> need<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.500> couple<00:01:19.860> basis<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.690> that<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
you need a couple basis to do that you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.840 
you need a couple basis to do that you
hit<00:01:22.530> P<00:01:22.800> or<00:01:23.130> manually<00:01:23.970> go<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.149> layer<00:01:24.420> n<00:01:24.720> points

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
hit P or manually go to layer n points

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.900 
hit P or manually go to layer n points
this<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:28.130> described<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.280> button<00:01:29.580> right<00:01:29.700> there

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
this I described that button right there

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.540 
this I described that button right there
so<00:01:30.149> start<00:01:30.479> location<00:01:30.899> button<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:34.250> all<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.399> do

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
so start location button and all you do

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.120 
so start location button and all you do
is<00:01:36.290> make<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.350> few<00:01:37.590> or<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.130> couple<00:01:38.310> starts<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.530> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
is make a few or a couple starts and you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.530 
is make a few or a couple starts and you
know<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:41.399> where<00:01:41.580> you<00:01:41.670> spawn<00:01:41.910> when<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.360> map

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
know that's where you spawn when the map

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.990 
know that's where you spawn when the map
starts<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.890> guess<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.460> also<00:01:44.580> be<00:01:44.790> necessary

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
starts and I guess it also be necessary

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.110 
starts and I guess it also be necessary
to<00:01:45.299> add<00:01:46.049> some<00:01:46.260> resources<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.460> hit<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
to add some resources so hit you

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.060 
to add some resources so hit you
that's<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.049> UNIX<00:01:49.500> layer<00:01:49.830> and<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.600> up<00:01:51.600> to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
that's the UNIX layer and go up to

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.930 
that's the UNIX layer and go up to
resource<00:01:54.260> had<00:01:55.260> some<00:01:55.530> rich<00:01:55.890> ones<00:01:56.190> just<00:01:56.640> because

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
resource had some rich ones just because

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:10.850 
resource had some rich ones just because
they're<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.600> much<00:01:57.750> cooler<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.450> ever<00:02:09.929> try

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
they're so much cooler if you ever try

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.070 
they're so much cooler if you ever try
to<00:02:10.890> place<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.160> resource<00:02:11.640> yeah<00:02:12.600> next<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
to place a resource yeah next to the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.830 
to place a resource yeah next to the
started<00:02:13.380> location<00:02:13.799> and<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.190> says<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.840> that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
started location and it says that that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.900 
started location and it says that that
means<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.410> resource<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.860> too<00:02:17.070> close<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
means the resource is too close and the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.520 
means the resource is too close and the
start<00:02:18.150> location<00:02:18.269> will<00:02:18.750> be<00:02:18.840> pushed<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.350> won't

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
start location will be pushed and won't

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.180 
start location will be pushed and won't
spawn<00:02:19.769> there<00:02:23.060> whatever<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.900> worked<00:02:25.110> fine<00:02:25.290> and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
spawn there whatever so worked fine and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.430 
spawn there whatever so worked fine and
then<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.549> test<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.000> document<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:27.690> ctrl<00:02:28.049> f9

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
then to test the document you do ctrl f9

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.699 
then to test the document you do ctrl f9
or<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.250> manual<00:02:29.549> way<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:30.180> up<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.540> oh<00:02:30.810> wait<00:02:31.560> no

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
or the manual way go up to oh wait no

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.960 
or the manual way go up to oh wait no
there's<00:02:31.980> one<00:02:32.130> more<00:02:32.220> thing<00:02:32.459> one<00:02:32.790> more<00:02:32.820> thing

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
there's one more thing one more thing

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.090 
there's one more thing one more thing
first<00:02:33.440> go<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.500> map<00:02:34.860> player<00:02:35.370> properties<00:02:35.940> and

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
first go to map player properties and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.530 
first go to map player properties and
just<00:02:38.100> for<00:02:39.049> testing<00:02:40.049> purposes<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:42.060> need<00:02:42.239> a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
just for testing purposes you need a

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.410 
just for testing purposes you need a
player<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.500> computer<00:02:43.980> otherwise<00:02:44.730> when

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
