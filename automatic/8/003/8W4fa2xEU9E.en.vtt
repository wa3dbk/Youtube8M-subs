00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.889 
first but I'm going to skip this step
and<00:01:55.429> it's<00:01:55.819> in<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.030> description<00:01:56.450> bar<00:01:56.630> as<00:01:56.720> well

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
and it's in the description bar as well

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.109 
and it's in the description bar as well
so<00:01:57.709> you'll<00:01:57.890> take<00:01:58.099> a<00:01:58.130> mineral<00:01:58.550> foundation<00:01:58.819> one

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
sake of this tutorial I'm just going to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.350 
sake of this tutorial I'm just going to
stuff<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:21.790> all<00:02:22.790> over<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.690> face<00:02:24.940> now<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.150> will

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
stuff it all over the face now this will

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.600 
stuff it all over the face now this will
add<00:02:26.570> coverage<00:02:28.780> but<00:02:29.780> what<00:02:29.960> you<00:02:30.050> want<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.610> is

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
add coverage but what you want that is

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.730 
add coverage but what you want that is
texture<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.630> you'll<00:02:32.750> see<00:02:33.050> in<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.260> second

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
texture and you'll see in a second

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.980 
texture and you'll see in a second
because<00:02:34.490> texture<00:02:35.060> happens<00:02:35.450> when<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.750> layer

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
because texture happens when you layer

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.490 
because texture happens when you layer
products<00:02:36.850> so<00:02:37.850> already<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.960> this<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.260> why<00:02:39.470> I

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
products so already and this is why I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.250 
products so already and this is why I
love<00:02:39.920> mineral<00:02:40.280> makeup<00:02:40.640> because<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:40.970> just<00:02:41.420> that
