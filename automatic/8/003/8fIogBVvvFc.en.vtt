00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:09.970
 of tapas and let's try them saucony 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.970
 king for 5 we go 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.340
 the auc or nicki for 5 are one of the 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.099
 most anticipated sneakers for lovers 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.539
 of the natural organism and that is also 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.939
 designed for runners who care 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.699
 for his career technique he continues 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.649
 keeping his drop of 4 millimeters but 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.809
 in this new edition they have worried 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.500
 a little bit more to reinforce the theme of 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.500
 the cushioning 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.910
 as for the midsole we have a 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.080
 composed of ba plus and as for the 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.270
 damping technology is commissioned 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.800
 power grid that what helps us is to 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.800
 absorb the impact on the landing 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.610
 one of the aspects that has improved 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.040
 respect to 4 is that they have a greater 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.600
 durability for example in terms of 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.090
 theme of the lose that has about 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.820
 much more reinforced materials than its 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.009
 previous edition but still maintaining 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.270
 the flexibility the lightness and the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.270
 breathability of the shoe 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.960
 in conclusion light neutral sneakers 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.850
 of just 218 grams of weight very 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.740
 suitable for those runners who 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.990
 they are in the process of going overboard 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.640
 running or who already practice it and thanks 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.219

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.110

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.920
