00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.440
The Northland community

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.600
is reeling from the tragedy
of a 17-year-old who died

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.400
after playing a game of rugby
in Whangarei.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.640
Talented hooker Jordan Kemp
collapsed during a game

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.360
between his Otamatea Hawks side
and Old Boys Marist

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.320
in Whangarei on Saturday.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.360
It's believed he suffered
a brain bleed

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.440
after he was kneed in the head.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.440
He was then taken
to Auckland hospital where he died.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.400
The police and Northland Rugby Union
are still investigating his death.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.920
Jordan Kemp's body will be taken
back to Otamatea Marae

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.520
in Maungaturoto.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.560
The township is an hour away
from Whangarei.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.560
Our reporter Raniera Harrison
is standing by

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.960
at the Otamatea Rugby Club,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.840
where the teen played rugby.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.520
Raniera, what are the details?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.840
That's right, Scotty.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.640
As the saying goes,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.240
you can escape from the chill

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.120
of an unexpected downpour of rain

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.400
but not from a sudden,
unexpected death.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.800
I'm currently at Otamatea Hawks
Rugby Club in Maungaturoto.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.240
Members here are waiting
for Jordan Kemp

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.160
to be brought back home
to Otamatea

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.680
so they and his family have
a chance to say their last goodbyes

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.520
and farewells to him.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Has any new information

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.280
come to light

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.600
surrounding this tragedy?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.720
Well, Scotty,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.320
we've been informed he hasn't
been returned to the whanau yet

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.400
as he is still with the coroner
in Auckland.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.080
It looks like Jordan and his family

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.960
may make his final return journey
to the marae tonight.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.040
Jordy, as he is known
in these parts,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.120
will be greatly missed.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.320
Do you have any details
on the tangihanga?

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.480
As he hasn't come home yet
to Otamatea

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.920
kaumatua have not made
any concrete plans yet.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.760
Some of the people I spoke to
at Otamatea Marae today

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.160
have told me that he will likely
be laid to rest on Thursday

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.960
in his family's urupa here
in Otamatea in Ngapuhi.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.640
Thank you for the update,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.640
that was Raniera Harrison live
from Otamatea Hawks Rugby Club.
