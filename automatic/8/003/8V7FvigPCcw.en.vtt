it that way as Venus the planet of love
and<00:00:58.920> pleasure<00:00:59.129> form<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> most<00:01:00.180> harmonious

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and pleasure form the most harmonious

and pleasure form the most harmonious
aspect<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.710> beautiful<00:01:02.399> 120<00:01:03.300> degree<00:01:03.600> trying

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
aspect a beautiful 120 degree trying

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.670 
aspect a beautiful 120 degree trying
with<00:01:04.920> expansive<00:01:06.020> optimistic<00:01:07.020> Jupiter<00:01:07.439> it's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
with expansive optimistic Jupiter it's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.520 
with expansive optimistic Jupiter it's
almost<00:01:08.100> as<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.450> this<00:01:09.450> might<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> day<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
almost as if this might be a day of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
almost as if this might be a day of
difficult<00:01:11.189> conditions<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:11.909> there's<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.240> gift

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
difficult conditions but there's a gift

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.600 
difficult conditions but there's a gift
in<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.439> middle<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.950> yeah<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> think<00:01:14.280> you're

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
in the middle of it yeah I think you're

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.010 
in the middle of it yeah I think you're
right<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.060> think<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.450> gift<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
right and I think that that gift is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.280 
right and I think that that gift is
actually<00:01:16.850> encouraged<00:01:17.850> by<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> cluster<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
actually encouraged by a cluster of

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.520 
actually encouraged by a cluster of
planets<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.100> imaginative<00:01:20.670> Pisces<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:22.320> have

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
planets and imaginative Pisces we have

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.280 
planets and imaginative Pisces we have
neptune<00:01:23.070> mercury<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.970> Mars<00:01:24.270> mercury<00:01:24.930> coming

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
neptune mercury and Mars mercury coming

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.289 
neptune mercury and Mars mercury coming
to<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> conjunction<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.070> Mars<00:01:26.400> Mercury's<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
to a conjunction with Mars Mercury's the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.420 
to a conjunction with Mars Mercury's the
communicator<00:01:27.900> planet<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.500> mental<00:01:28.920> Mars

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
communicator planet it's mental Mars

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
communicator planet it's mental Mars
gives<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.970> energy<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:31.079> angry<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.979> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
gives it energy it can be angry but it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.730 
gives it energy it can be angry but it
can<00:01:32.280> also<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.939> directive<00:01:33.689> especially<00:01:34.560> so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
can also just be directive especially so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.859 
can also just be directive especially so
close<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.250> spiritual<00:01:35.820> Neptune<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
close to spiritual Neptune and so I

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.319 
close to spiritual Neptune and so I
think<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.530> what<00:01:37.710> happens<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
think that what happens here is that the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.560 
think that what happens here is that the
moon<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.900> Capricorn<00:01:40.740> keeps<00:01:41.340> our<00:01:41.610> feet<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
moon in Capricorn keeps our feet on the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.469 
moon in Capricorn keeps our feet on the
ground<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.380> keeps<00:01:43.860> us<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:45.090> where<00:01:45.299> we're

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
ground it keeps us we know where we're

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.510

going<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.409> where<00:01:46.590> we're<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:47.130> we've

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
going we know where we're going we've

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.069 
going we know where we're going we've
