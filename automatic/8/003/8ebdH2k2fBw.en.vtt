00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
even resources on the screen you'll see

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.539 
even resources on the screen you'll see
that<00:01:06.780> there's<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.290> no<00:01:07.560> actual<00:01:07.920> resource<00:01:08.369> on

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the screen but it's more about seeing

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.600 
the screen but it's more about seeing
the<00:01:12.930> battleground<00:01:13.380> isn't<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.189> key

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the battleground isn't it the key

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.340 
the battleground isn't it the key
mechanics<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.450> don't<00:01:15.840> really<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.320> I

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
mechanics I don't really know I

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.660 
mechanics I don't really know I
understand<00:01:17.009> you're<00:01:17.220> probably<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
understand you're probably going to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
understand you're probably going to
capture<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> three<00:01:18.390> mines<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.930> guess<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.290> kind

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
capture the three mines I guess it kind

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.580 
capture the three mines I guess it kind
of<00:01:19.560> works<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:21.080> based<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.470> I've<00:01:22.560> seen

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
of works like based on what I've seen

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.160 
of works like based on what I've seen
anyway<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.520> way<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.880> describes<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.810> me<00:01:24.960> is

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
anyway the way it describes it to me is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
anyway the way it describes it to me is
that<00:01:25.409> there's<00:01:26.070> three<00:01:26.400> nodes<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.119> got<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
that there's three nodes that you got to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.740 
that there's three nodes that you got to
capture<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.930> similar<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.970> bo<00:01:29.970> Rathi<00:01:30.390> basin

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
capture so similar to a bo Rathi basin

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.460 
capture so similar to a bo Rathi basin
or<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.530> likely<00:01:32.240> Isle<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.540> Gilneas<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.200> battle

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
or more likely Isle of Gilneas or battle

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.520 
or more likely Isle of Gilneas or battle
for<00:01:34.619> gilneas<00:01:35.040> rich<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.520> called<00:01:36.049> that<00:01:37.049> that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
for gilneas rich it's called that that

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.109 
for gilneas rich it's called that that
one<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> three<00:01:38.189> nodes<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.790> probably

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
one with the three nodes it's probably

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.280 
one with the three nodes it's probably
the<00:01:39.240> way<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.479> one's<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> work<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
the way this one's going to work and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.319 
the way this one's going to work and
then<00:01:40.890> there's<00:01:41.400> also<00:01:41.640> something<00:01:42.000> i'll<00:01:42.210> show

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
then there's also something i'll show

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
then there's also something i'll show
you<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> cart<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.860> could<00:01:44.040> steal<00:01:44.430> each

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
you the cart you could steal each

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.850 
you the cart you could steal each
other's<00:01:45.030> resources<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.960> don't<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.560> how<00:01:46.829> many

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
other's resources I don't know how many

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.219 
other's resources I don't know how many
resources<00:01:47.369> each<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:48.060> these<00:01:48.240> things<00:01:48.509> give<00:01:48.869> as

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
resources each of these things give as

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.469 
resources each of these things give as
like<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.189> said<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.579> literally<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.270> the

like I said you literally see the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.010 
like I said you literally see the
countdown<00:01:52.380> has<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:53.659> here<00:01:54.659> there's<00:01:54.869> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
countdown has just here there's the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.830 
countdown has just here there's the
countdown<00:01:55.470> now<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.180> finishing<00:01:57.540> now

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
countdown now it is just finishing now

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
countdown now it is just finishing now
and<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.290> we're<00:01:58.439> obviously<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.219> quarter

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and that we're obviously like a quarter

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.679 
and that we're obviously like a quarter
of<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> way<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.090> battleground<00:02:00.479> already

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
of the way to the battleground already

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.429 
of the way to the battleground already
so<00:02:01.250> yeah<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.460> pretty<00:02:02.640> buggy<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.119> PTR<00:02:03.439> now

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
so yeah it's pretty buggy on the PTR now

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.709 
so yeah it's pretty buggy on the PTR now
in<00:02:04.560> order<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.610> can't<00:02:06.540> actually

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
in order to do this you can't actually

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.260 
in order to do this you can't actually
queue<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.409> yet<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.829> got<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.310> by<00:02:08.970> getting

battlegrounds<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.300> arenas<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.870> Pandaria<00:02:34.470> like

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
battlegrounds in arenas in Pandaria like

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.250 
battlegrounds in arenas in Pandaria like
Pandaria<00:02:35.730> itself<00:02:36.210> looks<00:02:36.570> amazing<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
Pandaria itself looks amazing and the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.650 
Pandaria itself looks amazing and the
fact<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.500> they're<00:02:37.680> now<00:02:37.800> implementing

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
fact that they're now implementing

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.940 
fact that they're now implementing
typically<00:02:39.660> rhetorical<00:02:40.410> things<00:02:40.680> like

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
typically rhetorical things like

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.980 
typically rhetorical things like
battleground<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:42.270> here<00:02:42.420> we<00:02:42.480> go<00:02:42.540> here<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> pick

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
battleground so here we go here I pick

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.230 
battleground so here we go here I pick
up<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.200> cart<00:02:43.610> you'll<00:02:44.610> see<00:02:44.760> how<00:02:44.820> this<00:02:44.940> works

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
up the cart you'll see how this works

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.660 
up the cart you'll see how this works
now<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.600> blue<00:02:45.930> line<00:02:46.170> over<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.830> car<00:02:47.070> over

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
now I have a blue line over the car over

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.180 
now I have a blue line over the car over
my<00:02:47.790> head<00:02:47.970> type<00:02:48.210> thing<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:49.590> think<00:02:49.860> everybody

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
my head type thing so I think everybody

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.500 
my head type thing so I think everybody
in<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> battleground<00:02:50.820> could<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.300> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
in the battleground could see that and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.760 
in the battleground could see that and
you<00:02:51.600> see<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.840> gate<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.230> can<00:02:52.410> close<00:02:52.740> that

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
you see that gate you can close that

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.220 
you see that gate you can close that
gate<00:02:53.220> i'm<00:02:53.430> pretty<00:02:53.910> sure<00:02:54.150> that's<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.690> bug<00:02:54.930> or

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
gate i'm pretty sure that's a bug or

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.680 
gate i'm pretty sure that's a bug or
just<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:55.920> could<00:02:56.070> do<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.220> error<00:02:56.580> because<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.300> was

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
just I could do that error because I was

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.850 
just I could do that error because I was
able<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.930> close<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.380> gate<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.770> people

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
able to close that gate and people

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.170 
able to close that gate and people

after<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.510> record<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.050> feel<00:03:28.290> free<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.620> let<00:03:28.709> me

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
after I record this feel free to let me

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.860 
after I record this feel free to let me
know<00:03:28.860> how<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.220> actually<00:03:29.459> works<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:30.120> have<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
know how this actually works I have a

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.210 
know how this actually works I have a
pretty<00:03:31.170> good<00:03:31.290> feeling<00:03:31.410> it's<00:03:31.860> going<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.100> be

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
pretty good feeling it's going to be

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.820 
pretty good feeling it's going to be
like<00:03:32.400> three<00:03:32.850> node<00:03:33.090> basis<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:34.230> capture<00:03:34.680> them

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
like three node basis you capture them

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.310 
like three node basis you capture them
each<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:36.180> then<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.480> carts<00:03:36.840> are<00:03:36.959> kind<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.200> like

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
each and then the carts are kind of like

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.740 
each and then the carts are kind of like
the<00:03:37.470> flags<00:03:37.830> in<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.030> storm<00:03:39.300> perhaps

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
the flags in a I of the storm perhaps

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.290 
the flags in a I of the storm perhaps
some<00:03:39.959> more<00:03:40.580> you<00:03:41.580> know<00:03:41.670> you'll<00:03:41.850> steal<00:03:42.120> their

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
some more you know you'll steal their

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.699 
some more you know you'll steal their
resources<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:42.930> you'll<00:03:43.170> get<00:03:43.290> something<00:03:43.530> from

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
resources and you'll get something from

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.509 
resources and you'll get something from
a<00:03:43.830> kind<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.100> thing<00:03:44.900> but<00:03:45.900> overall<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:47.190> mean<00:03:47.370> this

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
a kind of thing but overall I mean this

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.880 
a kind of thing but overall I mean this
battleground<00:03:47.910> looks<00:03:48.330> amazing<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.140> feels

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
battleground looks amazing it feels

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.550 
battleground looks amazing it feels
amazing<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:51.390> don't<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.900> can't<00:03:52.110> say<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.290> plays

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
amazing I don't I can't say it plays

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.050 
amazing I don't I can't say it plays
amazing<00:03:53.040> because<00:03:53.280> obviously<00:03:53.459> it<00:03:53.760> didn't<00:03:53.940> have

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
amazing because obviously it didn't have

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.570 
amazing because obviously it didn't have
a<00:03:54.090> real<00:03:54.269> game<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:54.780> but<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.170> really<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:56.220> can't

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
a real game of it but I really I can't

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.310 
a real game of it but I really I can't
stress<00:03:56.820> this<00:03:56.970> enough<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.450> am<00:03:57.600> in<00:03:57.750> love<00:03:58.050> with

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
stress this enough I am in love with

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.680 
stress this enough I am in love with
mists<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.040> pandaria<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.030> stuff<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:00.330> you

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
mists of pandaria and the stuff that you

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.350 
mists of pandaria and the stuff that you
know<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.800> way<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.190> game<00:04:02.220> looks<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.000> way<00:04:03.120> that

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
know the way the game looks the way that

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.440 
know the way the game looks the way that
the<00:04:03.540> terrain<00:04:04.019> looks<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:05.010> landscape<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:05.850> if

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
the terrain looks the landscape and if

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.270 
the terrain looks the landscape and if
you<00:04:06.540> haven't<00:04:06.780> seen<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.080> shado-pan<00:04:07.470> arena

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
you haven't seen the shado-pan arena

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.729 
you haven't seen the shado-pan arena
video<00:04:08.610> I'd<00:04:09.510> recommend<00:04:09.930> checking<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.470> out<00:04:10.500> as

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
video I'd recommend checking that out as

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.280 
video I'd recommend checking that out as
well<00:04:10.890> because<00:04:11.340> between<00:04:12.209> this<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.930> these

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
well because between this and that these

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.550 
well because between this and that these
two<00:04:13.890> new<00:04:14.100> PvP<00:04:14.730> instances<00:04:15.420> are<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:16.080> really

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
two new PvP instances are just really

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.680 
two new PvP instances are just really
really<00:04:16.769> cool<00:04:17.040> looking<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.609> think<00:04:18.330> so<00:04:18.480> at<00:04:18.600> this

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
really cool looking I think so at this

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.380 
really cool looking I think so at this
point<00:04:18.840> now<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.049> kind<00:04:19.320> of<00:04:19.350> go<00:04:20.180> take<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> little

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
point now I kind of go take a little

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.460 
point now I kind of go take a little
jaunt<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:22.070> little<00:04:23.070> jaunt<00:04:23.310> around<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.700> world

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
jaunt a little jaunt around the world

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.740 
jaunt a little jaunt around the world
I<00:04:25.670> don't<00:04:26.670> know<00:04:26.760> why<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:26.970> bridge<00:04:27.420> would<00:04:27.600> be

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
I don't know why this bridge would be

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.890 
I don't know why this bridge would be
here<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:27.960> guess<00:04:28.230> that's<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:29.750> honestly<00:04:30.750> don't

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
here I guess that's I honestly don't

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.630 
here I guess that's I honestly don't
know<00:04:31.050> why<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.290> bridge<00:04:31.680> would<00:04:31.830> be<00:04:31.980> there<00:04:32.190> that

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
know why that bridge would be there that

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.480 
know why that bridge would be there that
didn't<00:04:32.910> really<00:04:33.060> make<00:04:33.240> any<00:04:33.360> sense<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.840> me<00:04:33.930> I

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
didn't really make any sense to me I

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.350 
didn't really make any sense to me I
examined<00:04:35.490> another<00:04:35.700> one<00:04:35.850> on<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.000> other<00:04:36.060> side

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
examined another one on the other side

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.400 
examined another one on the other side
of<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.480> map<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.900> kind<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.080> feels<00:04:37.200> like

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
of the map and it kind of feels like

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.130 
of the map and it kind of feels like
they're<00:04:38.010> just<00:04:38.190> there<00:04:38.310> for<00:04:38.340> flavor<00:04:39.050> but<00:04:40.050> this

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
they're just there for flavor but this

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.720 
they're just there for flavor but this
is<00:04:40.320> one<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.620> nodes<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.070> as<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.310> said<00:04:41.370> like

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
is one of the nodes and as I said like

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.270 
is one of the nodes and as I said like
we<00:04:41.940> control<00:04:42.480> this<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:43.110> it<00:04:43.710> wasn't<00:04:44.070> us<00:04:44.130> who

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
we control this but it wasn't us who

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.280 
we control this but it wasn't us who
captured<00:04:44.730> it<00:04:44.790> so<00:04:44.940> I<00:04:44.970> don't<00:04:45.240> really<00:04:45.300> there's<00:04:46.170> no

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
captured it so I don't really there's no

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.230 
captured it so I don't really there's no
resources<00:04:46.890> on<00:04:47.130> its<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:47.940> think<00:04:48.090> it's<00:04:48.210> just

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
resources on its I think it's just

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.760 
resources on its I think it's just
 on<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.780> PTR<00:04:49.080> because<00:04:49.440> we're<00:04:49.620> both

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
 on the PTR because we're both

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.980 
 on the PTR because we're both
horde<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.880> we<00:04:51.000> queued<00:04:51.240> in<00:04:51.330> his<00:04:51.480> war<00:04:51.690> games

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
horde and we queued in his war games

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.780 
horde and we queued in his war games
it's<00:04:52.230> treating<00:04:52.590> us<00:04:52.710> both<00:04:53.010> on<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.400> same<00:04:53.430> team

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
it's treating us both on the same team

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.090 
it's treating us both on the same team
essentially<00:04:54.350> but<00:04:55.350> yeah<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.530> see<00:04:55.740> this<00:04:55.920> you

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
essentially but yeah you see this you

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.590 
essentially but yeah you see this you
see<00:04:56.130> what<00:04:56.430> what<00:04:56.730> is<00:04:56.820> this<00:04:57.000> why<00:04:57.240> would<00:04:57.480> that

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
see what what is this why would that

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.750 
see what what is this why would that
bridge<00:04:57.810> be<00:04:58.020> like<00:04:58.170> that<00:04:58.410> look<00:04:59.220> at<00:04:59.370> again<00:04:59.580> once

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
bridge be like that look at again once

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.420 
bridge be like that look at again once
around<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.090> other<00:05:00.180> side<00:05:00.270> but<00:05:01.280> there's<00:05:02.280> not

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
around the other side but there's not

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.220 
around the other side but there's not
much<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.640> much<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.390> do<00:05:03.540> in<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.780> battleground

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
much that much to do in the battleground

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.660 
much that much to do in the battleground
essentially<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.710> kind<00:05:04.890> of<00:05:04.920> just<00:05:05.100> go<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.460> the

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
essentially you kind of just go to the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.360 
essentially you kind of just go to the
nodes<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.120> that's<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:06.540> there's<00:05:07.220> some<00:05:08.220> good

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
nodes and that's it there's some good

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.590 
nodes and that's it there's some good
looking<00:05:08.670> terrain<00:05:08.940> though<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.300> I<00:05:09.420> said

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
looking terrain though like I said

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.970 
looking terrain though like I said
that's<00:05:09.750> what<00:05:09.930> it's<00:05:10.110> all<00:05:10.230> about<00:05:10.260> it<00:05:10.620> really<00:05:10.860> is

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
that's what it's all about it really is

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.500 
that's what it's all about it really is
I<00:05:11.130> mean<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.310> when<00:05:11.580> I<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.760> storm<00:05:12.120> came<00:05:12.330> out<00:05:12.480> I

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
I mean I when I the storm came out I

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.600 
I mean I when I the storm came out I
loved<00:05:12.930> it<00:05:13.050> because<00:05:13.200> all<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:14.280> like<00:05:14.520> the

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
loved it because all that like the

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.070 
loved it because all that like the
purple<00:05:15.000> Rock<00:05:15.180> it<00:05:15.510> felt<00:05:15.750> very<00:05:15.900> bc<00:05:16.500> ish<00:05:17.600> cot<00:05:18.600> mogu

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
purple Rock it felt very bc ish cot mogu

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.890 
purple Rock it felt very bc ish cot mogu
tap<00:05:19.800> that<00:05:20.190> feels<00:05:20.520> so<00:05:20.669> good<00:05:20.850> so<00:05:21.360> good<00:05:21.390> so<00:05:21.630> we're

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
tap that feels so good so good so we're

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.560 
tap that feels so good so good so we're
shard<00:05:22.110> mine<00:05:22.520> now<00:05:23.520> there's<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:24.090> don't<00:05:24.180> even<00:05:24.419> know

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
shard mine now there's I don't even know

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.030 
shard mine now there's I don't even know
what<00:05:24.720> they're<00:05:24.840> after<00:05:25.050> it's<00:05:25.410> over<00:05:25.500> short<00:05:25.830> but

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
what they're after it's over short but

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.790 
what they're after it's over short but
yeah<00:05:26.550> cap<00:05:26.820> mogu<00:05:27.210> in<00:05:27.360> this<00:05:27.540> one<00:05:27.750> these<00:05:28.320> look<00:05:28.560> and

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
yeah cap mogu in this one these look and

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.440 
yeah cap mogu in this one these look and
feel<00:05:29.130> really<00:05:29.490> good<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:29.730> I'm<00:05:29.820> really<00:05:30.090> looking

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
feel really good and I'm really looking

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.600 
feel really good and I'm really looking
forward<00:05:30.480> to<00:05:30.780> getting<00:05:30.930> these<00:05:31.169> I<00:05:31.470> guess<00:05:32.400> there's

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
forward to getting these I guess there's

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.280 
forward to getting these I guess there's
my<00:05:32.730> this<00:05:33.150> mighty<00:05:33.330> think<00:05:33.840> it's<00:05:34.020> just<00:05:34.140> going<00:05:34.260> to

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
my this mighty think it's just going to

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.890 
my this mighty think it's just going to
fit<00:05:34.500> into<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:34.770> rbg<00:05:35.070> circuit<00:05:35.580> because<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:36.090> bee

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
fit into the rbg circuit because a bee

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.260 
fit into the rbg circuit because a bee
is<00:05:37.169> a<00:05:37.200> 15-man<00:05:37.890> one<00:05:38.130> as<00:05:38.250> well<00:05:38.400> this<00:05:38.520> is<00:05:38.580> a<00:05:38.700> 15-man

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
is a 15-man one as well this is a 15-man

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.659 
is a 15-man one as well this is a 15-man
one<00:05:39.480> I<00:05:39.510> guess<00:05:39.780> this<00:05:39.960> is<00:05:40.310> something<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.430> could

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
one I guess this is something that could

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.520 
one I guess this is something that could
happen<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.300> could<00:05:42.510> get<00:05:42.720> them<00:05:42.900> drop<00:05:43.229> down<00:05:43.410> to

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
happen you could get them drop down to

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.320 
happen you could get them drop down to
10<00:05:43.740> men<00:05:44.240> guess<00:05:45.240> that<00:05:45.479> that<00:05:45.510> and<00:05:47.120> the<00:05:48.120> one<00:05:48.240> with

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
10 men guess that that and the one with

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.090 
10 men guess that that and the one with
the<00:05:48.390> doors<00:05:48.660> or<00:05:48.960> whatever<00:05:49.169> that<00:05:49.229> that<00:05:49.919> one

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
the doors or whatever that that one

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.300 
the doors or whatever that that one
sucks<00:05:50.630> that's<00:05:51.630> another<00:05:51.870> 15<00:05:52.260> minutes<00:05:52.470> not<00:05:53.100> in

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
sucks that's another 15 minutes not in

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.640 
sucks that's another 15 minutes not in
the<00:05:53.400> rbg<00:05:53.669> circuit<00:05:54.240> yeah<00:05:54.900> so<00:05:55.050> here's<00:05:55.229> that<00:05:55.290> is

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
the rbg circuit yeah so here's that is

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.990 
the rbg circuit yeah so here's that is
another<00:05:55.950> bridge<00:05:56.250> on<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.490> other<00:05:56.610> side<00:05:56.820> row

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
another bridge on the other side row

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.610 
another bridge on the other side row
right<00:05:57.270> what<00:05:57.510> is<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.750> point<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:58.020> that<00:05:58.080> that

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
right what is the point of that that

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.730 
right what is the point of that that
stone<00:05:58.890> is<00:05:58.950> the<00:05:59.250> graveyard<00:05:59.960> but<00:06:00.960> like<00:06:01.169> what<00:06:01.200> is

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
stone is the graveyard but like what is

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.230 
stone is the graveyard but like what is
the<00:06:01.890> point<00:06:02.040> of<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.310> bridge<00:06:02.550> doesn't<00:06:02.970> do

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
the point of the bridge doesn't do

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.909 
the point of the bridge doesn't do
anything<00:06:03.630> I<00:06:03.870> don't<00:06:04.229> know<00:06:04.320> I<00:06:04.530> have<00:06:04.710> no<00:06:04.890> idea

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
anything I don't know I have no idea

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.600 
anything I don't know I have no idea
might<00:06:05.550> just<00:06:05.669> be<00:06:05.790> cosmetic<00:06:06.860> but<00:06:07.860> that's<00:06:08.340> about

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
might just be cosmetic but that's about

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.040 
might just be cosmetic but that's about
it<00:06:08.669> I<00:06:08.880> don't<00:06:08.910> you<00:06:09.330> know<00:06:09.390> that's<00:06:09.630> that's<00:06:09.870> really

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
it I don't you know that's that's really

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.290 
it I don't you know that's that's really
the<00:06:10.560> end<00:06:10.650> of<00:06:10.800> it<00:06:10.919> so<00:06:11.160> I<00:06:12.710> don't<00:06:13.710> know<00:06:14.300> there's

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
the end of it so I don't know there's

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.640 
the end of it so I don't know there's
the<00:06:15.419> base<00:06:15.600> don't<00:06:16.080> know<00:06:16.140> where<00:06:16.260> the<00:06:16.350> buffs<00:06:16.530> are

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
the base don't know where the buffs are

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.890 
the base don't know where the buffs are
going<00:06:16.800> to<00:06:16.860> be<00:06:16.950> didn't<00:06:17.640> really<00:06:17.970> didn't<00:06:18.600> see<00:06:18.750> any

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
going to be didn't really didn't see any

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.330 
going to be didn't really didn't see any
buffs<00:06:19.080> I<00:06:19.229> bet<00:06:19.380> the<00:06:19.470> bus<00:06:19.620> would<00:06:19.740> probably<00:06:20.070> there

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
buffs I bet the bus would probably there

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.800 
buffs I bet the bus would probably there
might<00:06:20.460> be<00:06:20.490> like<00:06:20.669> a<00:06:20.700> main<00:06:20.910> buff<00:06:21.180> in<00:06:21.360> each<00:06:21.540> of<00:06:21.720> the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
might be like a main buff in each of the

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.690 
might be like a main buff in each of the
bases<00:06:22.200> and<00:06:22.530> then<00:06:22.620> maybe<00:06:22.919> one<00:06:23.190> of<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.340> bases

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
bases and then maybe one of the bases

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.480 
bases and then maybe one of the bases
are<00:06:24.030> one<00:06:24.540> of<00:06:24.630> the<00:06:24.720> mines<00:06:25.020> have<00:06:25.919> the<00:06:26.100> buffs<00:06:26.280> like

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
are one of the mines have the buffs like

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.250 
are one of the mines have the buffs like
two<00:06:26.700> of<00:06:26.790> the<00:06:26.880> mines<00:06:27.090> on<00:06:27.419> each<00:06:27.660> of<00:06:27.930> the<00:06:28.080> polar

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
two of the mines on each of the polar

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.770 
two of the mines on each of the polar
ends<00:06:28.470> or<00:06:28.620> whatever<00:06:28.830> might<00:06:29.040> have<00:06:29.160> the<00:06:29.280> buffs

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
ends or whatever might have the buffs

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.390 
ends or whatever might have the buffs
the<00:06:30.780> leaf<00:06:31.020> gotta<00:06:31.350> get<00:06:31.470> the<00:06:31.950> leaf<00:06:32.160> you

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
the leaf gotta get the leaf you

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.180 
the leaf gotta get the leaf you
know<00:06:33.349> but<00:06:34.349> the<00:06:34.500> rest<00:06:34.680> of<00:06:34.770> this<00:06:34.860> footage<00:06:35.099> is

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
know but the rest of this footage is

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.380 
know but the rest of this footage is
just<00:06:35.520> me<00:06:35.669> kind<00:06:35.910> of<00:06:35.970> John<00:06:36.240> ting<00:06:36.419> around

so if you have any questions maybe about

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.680 
so if you have any questions maybe about
the<00:06:40.150> PTR<00:06:40.570> maybe<00:06:40.810> about<00:06:40.990> 5.3<00:06:41.680> maybe<00:06:41.950> about<00:06:42.690> how

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
the PTR maybe about 5.3 maybe about how
