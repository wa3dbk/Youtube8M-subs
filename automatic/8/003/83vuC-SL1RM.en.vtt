00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
tutorial knitting on two circular

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.890 
tutorial knitting on two circular
needles<00:00:05.790> our<00:00:06.470> supplies<00:00:07.639> yarn<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.849> two<00:00:09.599> sets

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
needles our supplies yarn and two sets

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.540 
needles our supplies yarn and two sets
of<00:00:10.110> circular<00:00:11.099> needles

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:14.550 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.550 

so<00:00:15.550> we're<00:00:15.730> going<00:00:15.880> to<00:00:15.970> start<00:00:16.360> out<00:00:16.570> by<00:00:17.020> casting

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
so we're going to start out by casting

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.330 
so we're going to start out by casting
on<00:00:17.680> and<00:00:18.040> I've<00:00:18.280> cast<00:00:18.670> on<00:00:18.940> about<00:00:19.450> 30<00:00:19.750> stitches

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
on and I've cast on about 30 stitches

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.060 
on and I've cast on about 30 stitches
which<00:00:21.340> would<00:00:21.610> normally<00:00:21.820> be<00:00:22.150> way<00:00:23.110> too<00:00:23.170> many<00:00:23.560> or

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
which would normally be way too many or

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.089 
which would normally be way too many or
too<00:00:24.100> few<00:00:24.340> stitches<00:00:25.300> to<00:00:25.330> actually<00:00:25.840> get<00:00:26.110> around

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
too few stitches to actually get around

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.260 
too few stitches to actually get around
to<00:00:27.550> knit<00:00:27.820> on<00:00:28.090> a<00:00:28.200> singular<00:00:29.200> circular<00:00:29.800> needle<00:00:30.369> so

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
to knit on a singular circular needle so

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.900 
to knit on a singular circular needle so
this<00:00:31.930> is<00:00:32.140> why<00:00:32.590> witting<00:00:33.220> on<00:00:33.340> to<00:00:33.520> circular

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
this is why witting on to circular

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.930 
this is why witting on to circular
needles<00:00:34.180> is<00:00:34.329> so<00:00:34.510> great<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.980> first<00:00:36.520> we're<00:00:36.760> going

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
needles is so great so first we're going

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.180 
needles is so great so first we're going
to<00:00:37.890> move<00:00:38.890> half<00:00:39.370> of<00:00:39.550> our<00:00:39.700> stitches<00:00:41.190> without

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
to move half of our stitches without

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.740 
to move half of our stitches without
twisting<00:00:43.000> them<00:00:43.149> we're<00:00:43.329> just<00:00:43.360> going<00:00:43.600> to<00:00:43.630> move

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
twisting them we're just going to move

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.290 
twisting them we're just going to move
half<00:00:44.020> of<00:00:44.140> our<00:00:44.290> stitches<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:45.430> our<00:00:45.640> second

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
half of our stitches to our second

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.720 
half of our stitches to our second
circular<00:00:47.019> needle<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.800> if<00:00:51.250> you're<00:00:51.399> used<00:00:51.640> to

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
circular needle and if you're used to

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.310 
circular needle and if you're used to
knitting<00:00:52.059> in<00:00:52.179> the<00:00:52.210> round<00:00:52.300> on<00:00:52.660> double<00:00:52.960> pointed

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
knitting in the round on double pointed

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.880 
knitting in the round on double pointed
needles

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
needles

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.369 
needles
you<00:00:54.309> know<00:00:54.489> we<00:00:54.699> normally<00:00:54.879> cast<00:00:55.359> on<00:00:55.600> all<00:00:55.870> on<00:00:56.140> one

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
you know we normally cast on all on one

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.610 
you know we normally cast on all on one
needle<00:00:56.739> and<00:00:56.949> then<00:00:58.050> divide<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.260> stitches

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
needle and then divide the stitches

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.349 
needle and then divide the stitches
around<00:00:59.739> the<00:01:00.010> needles<00:01:00.370> we're<00:01:00.760> doing<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.120> same

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
around the needles we're doing the same

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.500 
around the needles we're doing the same
thing<00:01:01.600> here<00:01:01.960> or<00:01:03.000> attempting<00:01:04.000> tail

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
thing here or attempting tail

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.130 
thing here or attempting tail
we're<00:01:05.230> just<00:01:05.440> slipping<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.520> stitches<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.990> the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
we're just slipping the stitches to the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.490 
we're just slipping the stitches to the
second<00:01:08.530> circular<00:01:09.400> needle<00:01:10.050> it<00:01:11.050> doesn't<00:01:11.350> matter

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
second circular needle it doesn't matter

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.050 
second circular needle it doesn't matter
if<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:11.770> go<00:01:11.890> through<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.159> front<00:01:12.400> or<00:01:12.520> back<00:01:12.700> just

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
if you go through the front or back just

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.780 
if you go through the front or back just
so<00:01:13.150> that<00:01:13.300> you're<00:01:13.420> not<00:01:13.540> twisting<00:01:14.050> and<00:01:14.290> then<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
so that you're not twisting and then the

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.100 
so that you're not twisting and then the
easiest<00:01:16.150> way<00:01:16.300> to<00:01:16.360> make<00:01:16.570> sure<00:01:16.750> you're<00:01:16.930> not

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
easiest way to make sure you're not

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.010 
easiest way to make sure you're not
twisting<00:01:17.890> up<00:01:18.010> your<00:01:18.220> knitting<00:01:18.520> is<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.810> just

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
twisting up your knitting is to just

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.130 
twisting up your knitting is to just
turn<00:01:20.530> all<00:01:20.890> of<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.250> little<00:01:21.580> cast<00:01:22.390> on<00:01:22.600> bumps<00:01:22.990> to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
turn all of the little cast on bumps to

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.630 
turn all of the little cast on bumps to
the<00:01:23.230> inside<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:29.380> is<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.980> part<00:01:30.220> that<00:01:30.280> you

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
the inside so this is the part that you

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.100 
the inside so this is the part that you
really<00:01:30.670> just<00:01:31.060> don't<00:01:31.180> think<00:01:31.480> about<00:01:31.750> because

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
really just don't think about because

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.960 
really just don't think about because
it's<00:01:32.320> kind<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:33.100> shouldn't<00:01:33.490> work<00:01:33.670> but<00:01:33.700> it

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
it's kind of it shouldn't work but it

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.750 
it's kind of it shouldn't work but it
does<00:01:34.410> so<00:01:35.410> we<00:01:35.740> want<00:01:35.980> to<00:01:36.220> push<00:01:36.880> all<00:01:37.120> the<00:01:37.300> stitches

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
does so we want to push all the stitches

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.470 
does so we want to push all the stitches
so<00:01:39.760> that<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.300> working<00:01:40.840> yarn<00:01:41.080> end<00:01:42.270> from<00:01:43.270> that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
so that the working yarn end from that

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.680 
so that the working yarn end from that
last<00:01:43.720> cast<00:01:44.110> on<00:01:44.700> will<00:01:45.700> be<00:01:45.730> in<00:01:45.850> your<00:01:46.060> right<00:01:46.300> hand

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
last cast on will be in your right hand

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.530 
last cast on will be in your right hand
at<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.530> top<00:01:47.860> stitch<00:01:48.580> right<00:01:49.240> because<00:01:49.390> you're

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
at the top stitch right because you're

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.700 
at the top stitch right because you're
just<00:01:49.660> going<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:49.840> continue<00:01:50.050> you're<00:01:50.470> going<00:01:50.650> to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
just going to continue you're going to

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.320 
just going to continue you're going to
work<00:01:50.920> in<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.160> circle<00:01:51.490> just<00:01:51.640> like<00:01:51.760> you<00:01:52.000> would<00:01:52.180> if

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
work in a circle just like you would if

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.020 
work in a circle just like you would if
you<00:01:52.450> were<00:01:52.570> doing<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.900> all<00:01:53.080> on<00:01:53.320> one<00:01:53.530> needle<00:01:57.030> with

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
you were doing it all on one needle with

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.120 
you were doing it all on one needle with
the<00:01:58.150> exception<00:01:58.630> if<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:58.840> can<00:01:59.050> you<00:01:59.650> can<00:01:59.830> start

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
the exception if you can you can start

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.850 
the exception if you can you can start
with<00:02:01.500> four<00:02:02.500> stitches<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:04.380> actually<00:02:05.380> work<00:02:05.650> in

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
with four stitches and actually work in

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.590 
with four stitches and actually work in
the<00:02:06.130> round<00:02:06.370> without<00:02:06.730> using<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.360> double

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
the round without using the double

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.529 
the round without using the double
pointed<00:02:07.870> needles<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.970> we're<00:02:10.149> going<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.360> just

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
pointed needles so we're going to just

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.990 
pointed needles so we're going to just
slide<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.050> stitches<00:02:11.260> up<00:02:12.090> onto<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.209> needle

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
slide the stitches up onto the needle

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.750 
slide the stitches up onto the needle
and<00:02:15.740> there's<00:02:16.740> our<00:02:16.860> working<00:02:17.070> yarn<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
and there's our working yarn it's in the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.370 
and there's our working yarn it's in the
right<00:02:17.940> hand<00:02:18.240> we're<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.050> knit<00:02:19.200> that

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
right hand we're going to knit that

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.130 
right hand we're going to knit that
first<00:02:19.710> stitch<00:02:20.040> off<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.760> second<00:02:21.750> pair<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
first stitch off the second pair the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.610 
first stitch off the second pair the
bamboo<00:02:22.620> needles<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.720> here's<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.470> is

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
bamboo needles and here's the this is

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.950 
bamboo needles and here's the this is
the<00:02:25.740> trick<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.340> always<00:02:26.760> use<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.120> bamboo<00:02:27.510> with

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
the trick you always use the bamboo with

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.870 
the trick you always use the bamboo with
the<00:02:28.170> bamboo<00:02:28.590> well<00:02:29.280> I'm<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.520> refer<00:02:29.850> to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
the bamboo well I'm going to refer to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.520 
the bamboo well I'm going to refer to
them<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.360> set<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> needle<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.140> needle<00:02:31.350> two

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
them and set a needle one and needle two

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.950 
them and set a needle one and needle two
I<00:02:31.770> use<00:02:32.610> two<00:02:32.820> different<00:02:32.940> kinds<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.600> can

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
I use two different kinds so I can

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.960 
I use two different kinds so I can
always<00:02:34.140> keep<00:02:34.800> track<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.310> what<00:02:35.640> I'm<00:02:35.760> knitting

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
always keep track of what I'm knitting

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.170 
always keep track of what I'm knitting
with<00:02:36.300> but<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.380> will<00:02:37.530> always<00:02:38.100> knit<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.730> bamboo

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
with but you will always knit the bamboo

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.110 
with but you will always knit the bamboo
tip<00:02:40.020> with<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.740> bamboo<00:02:41.070> tip<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.700> plastic

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
tip with the bamboo tip and the plastic

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.450 
tip with the bamboo tip and the plastic
tip<00:02:42.330> with<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.660> plastic<00:02:43.080> tip<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.040> once<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.340> get

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
tip with the plastic tip so once you get

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.400 
tip with the plastic tip so once you get
that<00:02:44.580> first<00:02:44.880> stitch<00:02:45.060> done<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.540> just<00:02:45.720> pull<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
that first stitch done you just pull the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.750 
that first stitch done you just pull the
needle<00:02:46.680> out<00:02:46.800> of<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.980> way<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.430> let<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
needle out of the way and let the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.720 
needle out of the way and let the
stitches<00:02:48.150> sit<00:02:48.360> there<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:50.430> they're<00:02:50.610> just

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
stitches sit there and they're just

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.100 
stitches sit there and they're just
going<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.940> hang<00:02:51.180> out<00:02:51.330> there<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.750> cable

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
going to hang out there on the cable

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.780 
going to hang out there on the cable
until<00:02:52.530> you're<00:02:52.710> ready<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.980> knit<00:02:53.280> them<00:02:55.790> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
until you're ready to knit them of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.190 
until you're ready to knit them of
course<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.120> helps<00:02:57.210> if<00:02:57.420> your<00:02:57.570> cables<00:02:58.050> are

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
course it helps if your cables are

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.540 
course it helps if your cables are
sitting<00:02:58.650> flat<00:02:58.860> which<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.250> why<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.490> don't

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
sitting flat which is why I don't

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.390 
sitting flat which is why I don't
usually<00:02:59.790> use<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.240> kind<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.600> needle<00:03:00.870> but<00:03:01.740> so

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
usually use this kind of needle but so

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.540 
usually use this kind of needle but so
now<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.120> we<00:03:03.420> have<00:03:03.570> our<00:03:03.810> first<00:03:04.650> stitch<00:03:05.190> done

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
now that we have our first stitch done

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.390 
now that we have our first stitch done
we're<00:03:05.820> just<00:03:05.850> going<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.240> continue<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:07.020> work<00:03:07.400> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
we're just going to continue to work the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.830 
we're just going to continue to work the
rest<00:03:08.670> of<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.910> stitches<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.630> bamboo

needle<00:03:13.940> just<00:03:14.940> as<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.240> we<00:03:15.450> were<00:03:15.630> working<00:03:15.870> on<00:03:16.170> a

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
needle just as if we were working on a

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.170 
needle just as if we were working on a
straight<00:03:16.620> needle<00:03:16.980> double<00:03:17.250> pointed<00:03:17.760> needles

or circular a single circular needle so

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.300 
or circular a single circular needle so
we<00:03:21.660> get<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.200> end<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.770> now<00:03:24.290> we're<00:03:25.290> ready<00:03:25.530> to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
we get to the end and now we're ready to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.949 
we get to the end and now we're ready to
work<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.520> rest<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.300> stitches<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.810> our

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.090 
work the rest of the stitches of our
circle<00:03:28.670> so<00:03:29.989> we<00:03:30.989> are<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.650> push<00:03:31.920> our

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
circle so we are going to push our

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
circle so we are going to push our
stitches<00:03:32.520> back<00:03:32.850> up<00:03:33.209> by<00:03:33.900> pulling<00:03:34.850> because<00:03:35.850> then

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
stitches back up by pulling because then

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.520 
stitches back up by pulling because then
we're<00:03:36.239> going<00:03:36.360> to<00:03:36.390> work<00:03:36.570> on<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.930> gray<00:03:37.140> needle

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
we're going to work on that gray needle

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.979 
we're going to work on that gray needle
the<00:03:37.830> plastic<00:03:38.370> needle<00:03:38.790> we're<00:03:39.600> going<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.810> pull

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
the plastic needle we're going to pull

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.070 
the plastic needle we're going to pull
the<00:03:40.170> stitches<00:03:40.380> up<00:03:40.970> which<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.180> much<00:03:42.510> easier<00:03:42.900> if

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
the stitches up which is much easier if

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.990 
the stitches up which is much easier if
you're<00:03:43.230> not<00:03:43.260> working<00:03:43.769> on<00:03:43.860> such<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> huge<00:03:44.580> needle

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
you're not working on such a huge needle

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.070 
you're not working on such a huge needle
or<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.900> skinny<00:03:46.230> cable<00:03:46.739> but<00:03:47.930> we're<00:03:48.930> going<00:03:49.019> to

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
or the skinny cable but we're going to

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.430 
or the skinny cable but we're going to
work<00:03:49.320> this<00:03:49.560> first<00:03:49.830> stitch<00:03:51.260> we're<00:03:52.260> going<00:03:52.380> to

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
work this first stitch we're going to

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.580 
work this first stitch we're going to
use<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.820> gray<00:03:54.120> needle<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.959> work<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.380> stitches

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
use the gray needle to work the stitches

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.850 
use the gray needle to work the stitches
on<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.280> gray<00:03:56.459> needle<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.260> I'll<00:03:58.380> just<00:03:58.560> use<00:03:58.709> the

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
on the gray needle so I'll just use the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.640 
on the gray needle so I'll just use the
other<00:03:59.010> end<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.930> just<00:04:00.930> like<00:04:01.050> we<00:04:01.200> did<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.530> first

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
other end and just like we did the first

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.140 
other end and just like we did the first
time<00:04:01.920> we're<00:04:02.220> going<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.370> go<00:04:02.550> into<00:04:02.760> the<00:04:02.970> first

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
time we're going to go into the first

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.820 
time we're going to go into the first
stitch<00:04:03.920> we're<00:04:04.920> going<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.130> pull<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.590> yarn

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
stitch we're going to pull the yarn

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.100 
stitch we're going to pull the yarn
around<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.640> as<00:04:08.790> if<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:08.940> were<00:04:09.239> normally

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
around just as if we were normally

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.490 
around just as if we were normally
knitting<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.860> then<00:04:11.660> we're<00:04:12.660> going<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:12.989> knit<00:04:13.290> in

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
knitting and then we're going to knit in

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.159 
knitting and then we're going to knit in
and<00:04:13.830> you<00:04:14.670> can<00:04:14.820> pull<00:04:15.060> that<00:04:15.090> other<00:04:15.480> needle<00:04:16.049> out

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
and you can pull that other needle out

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.270 
and you can pull that other needle out
at<00:04:16.410> any<00:04:16.590> point<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.190> get<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.549> out<00:04:17.730> of<00:04:17.880> your<00:04:18.030> way

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
at any point and get it out of your way

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.130 
at any point and get it out of your way
which<00:04:20.280> I<00:04:20.430> think<00:04:20.640> I'll<00:04:20.790> probably<00:04:21.150> do<00:04:21.660> shortly

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
which I think I'll probably do shortly

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.950 
which I think I'll probably do shortly
when<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.500> just<00:04:22.830> realize<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.700> it's<00:04:23.850> stuck<00:04:24.780> up

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
when I just realize that it's stuck up

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.529 
when I just realize that it's stuck up
there<00:04:25.729> and<00:04:26.729> we're<00:04:26.880> just<00:04:26.940> going<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.180> knit<00:04:27.419> the

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
there and we're just going to knit the

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:28.790 
there and we're just going to knit the
stitches<00:04:27.810> on<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.470> green

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
stitches on the green

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:45.230 
stitches on the green
you<00:04:28.860> know<00:04:43.220> right<00:04:44.220> there<00:04:44.520> we'll<00:04:44.699> just<00:04:44.879> pull

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
you know right there we'll just pull

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.559 
you know right there we'll just pull
that<00:04:45.270> out<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.780> just<00:04:45.840> let<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.319> stitches<00:04:46.680> hang

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.210 

all<00:04:51.569> right<00:04:51.690> so<00:04:51.930> here<00:04:52.110> we<00:04:52.229> come<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.680> end<00:04:52.830> now

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
all right so here we come to the end now

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.469 
all right so here we come to the end now
this<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.520> going<00:04:53.639> to<00:04:53.729> be<00:04:53.819> the<00:04:53.909> end<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.180> our<00:04:54.330> first

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
this is going to be the end of our first

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.629 
this is going to be the end of our first
round<00:04:54.690> right<00:04:55.500> we've<00:04:55.680> worked<00:04:55.949> we<00:04:56.370> will<00:04:56.520> have

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
round right we've worked we will have

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:02.300 
round right we've worked we will have
worked<00:04:56.849> both<00:04:57.120> needles<00:04:57.539> now<00:04:59.300> our<00:05:01.159> working<00:05:02.159> yarn

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
worked both needles now our working yarn

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.459 
worked both needles now our working yarn
is<00:05:02.789> at<00:05:02.969> the<00:05:03.060> top<00:05:03.330> of<00:05:03.569> the<00:05:03.719> right<00:05:03.900> hand<00:05:03.930> needle

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:04.469 
is at the top of the right hand needle

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:07.339 
is at the top of the right hand needle
so<00:05:04.740> we<00:05:04.770> need<00:05:05.099> to<00:05:05.280> work<00:05:05.659> the<00:05:06.659> stitches<00:05:06.900> on<00:05:07.199> the

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
so we need to work the stitches on the

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.260 
so we need to work the stitches on the
left<00:05:07.680> which<00:05:08.159> will<00:05:08.280> be<00:05:08.430> on<00:05:08.729> this<00:05:08.969> one<00:05:09.150> the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
left which will be on this one the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.469 
left which will be on this one the
bamboo<00:05:09.690> needle<00:05:10.879> so<00:05:11.879> we're<00:05:11.969> going<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.150> slide

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
bamboo needle so we're going to slide

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.990 
bamboo needle so we're going to slide
the<00:05:12.719> stitches<00:05:12.930> up<00:05:13.460> being<00:05:14.460> careful<00:05:14.639> not<00:05:14.819> to

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
the stitches up being careful not to

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.240 
the stitches up being careful not to
twist<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:16.560> work<00:05:16.919> I<00:05:18.500> find<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.620> easier<00:05:19.949> just<00:05:19.979> to

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
twist the work I find it easier just to

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.950 
twist the work I find it easier just to
keep<00:05:20.430> all<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.789> the<00:05:20.909> bumps<00:05:21.090> at<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.389> bottom<00:05:21.750> and

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
keep all of the bumps at the bottom and

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.260 
keep all of the bumps at the bottom and
once<00:05:22.830> you<00:05:22.979> get<00:05:23.129> a<00:05:23.159> little<00:05:23.219> more<00:05:23.729> fabric<00:05:24.000> on

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
once you get a little more fabric on

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.939 
once you get a little more fabric on
here<00:05:24.509> it's<00:05:24.690> easier<00:05:25.139> to<00:05:25.469> make<00:05:25.620> sure<00:05:25.770> that

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
here it's easier to make sure that

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.219 
here it's easier to make sure that
you're<00:05:26.099> not<00:05:26.190> twisting<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:26.969> then<00:05:27.080> since<00:05:28.080> we're

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
you're not twisting and then since we're

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.050 
you're not twisting and then since we're
working<00:05:28.259> on<00:05:28.710> the<00:05:28.860> bamboo<00:05:29.069> needle<00:05:29.520> we<00:05:29.699> use<00:05:29.879> the

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
working on the bamboo needle we use the

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.800 
working on the bamboo needle we use the
other<00:05:30.210> bamboo<00:05:30.780> tip<00:05:34.219> fold<00:05:35.219> in<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:36.150> plastic

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
other bamboo tip fold in the plastic

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.870 
other bamboo tip fold in the plastic
needle<00:05:37.080> out<00:05:37.169> of<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.349> way<00:05:38.779> and<00:05:40.819> we'll<00:05:41.819> just

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
needle out of the way and we'll just

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.760 
needle out of the way and we'll just
knit<00:05:42.240> all<00:05:42.270> the<00:05:42.449> stitches<00:05:42.599> on<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.409> bamboo

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
knit all the stitches on the bamboo

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.110 
knit all the stitches on the bamboo
needle<00:05:44.219> with<00:05:44.729> the<00:05:44.759> other<00:05:45.180> bamboo<00:05:45.659> tip<00:05:46.639> so<00:05:47.639> just

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
needle with the other bamboo tip so just

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.430 
needle with the other bamboo tip so just
like<00:05:48.240> magic<00:05:48.479> here's<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.229> end<00:05:49.349> of<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.529> row<00:05:49.710> you

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.019 

can<00:05:55.440> see<00:05:55.620> we're<00:05:55.800> creating<00:05:56.310> our<00:05:56.400> little<00:05:56.759> tube

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:57.029 
can see we're creating our little tube

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:03.529 
can see we're creating our little tube
of<00:05:57.180> fabric<00:05:57.419> here

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.450 

so<00:06:04.539> now<00:06:04.720> it's<00:06:04.900> time<00:06:05.139> to<00:06:05.289> work<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.979> plastic

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
so now it's time to work the plastic

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:33.059 
so now it's time to work the plastic
needle<00:06:16.770> with<00:06:17.770> of<00:06:18.039> course<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.909> plastic<00:06:19.389> tip<00:06:32.069> so

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:33.069 
needle with of course the plastic tip so

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:34.110 
needle with of course the plastic tip so
we're<00:06:33.190> just<00:06:33.340> going<00:06:33.520> to<00:06:33.550> knit<00:06:33.729> that<00:06:33.879> first

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
we're just going to knit that first

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.010 
we're just going to knit that first
stitch<00:06:35.849> and<00:06:36.849> pull<00:06:37.180> the<00:06:37.389> needle<00:06:37.659> out<00:06:37.810> of<00:06:37.870> the

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
stitch and pull the needle out of the

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.240 
stitch and pull the needle out of the
way<00:06:39.120> let<00:06:40.120> the<00:06:40.270> stitches<00:06:40.740> dangle<00:06:41.740> there<00:06:41.919> for<00:06:42.219> a

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
way let the stitches dangle there for a

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.999 
way let the stitches dangle there for a
bit<00:06:45.810> and<00:06:46.810> here<00:06:47.110> we<00:06:47.229> are<00:06:47.259> at<00:06:47.500> the<00:06:47.650> end<00:06:47.770> of<00:06:47.889> this

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
bit and here we are at the end of this

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:54.809 
bit and here we are at the end of this
row<00:06:48.280> so<00:06:52.979> just<00:06:53.979> like<00:06:54.099> when<00:06:54.250> you're<00:06:54.370> normally

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:54.819

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
knitting in the round you do have that

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.409 
knitting in the round you do have that
kind<00:06:56.349> of<00:06:56.469> one<00:06:57.340> stitch<00:06:57.669> at<00:06:57.789> the<00:06:57.849> bottom<00:06:58.240> it

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
kind of one stitch at the bottom it

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:00.600 
kind of one stitch at the bottom it
where<00:06:58.960> they<00:06:59.110> come<00:06:59.379> together<00:06:59.530> where<00:06:59.979> it<00:07:00.250> you

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
where they come together where it you

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.490 
where they come together where it you
need<00:07:00.789> to<00:07:00.909> go<00:07:01.000> back<00:07:01.180> when<00:07:01.449> you<00:07:01.599> finish<00:07:02.110> up<00:07:02.259> and

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
need to go back when you finish up and

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.879 
need to go back when you finish up and
join<00:07:02.740> it<00:07:03.300> but<00:07:04.300> here<00:07:04.509> I<00:07:04.539> here<00:07:05.409> we<00:07:05.530> are<00:07:05.560> we're<00:07:05.860> a

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:05.889 
join it but here I here we are we're a

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:08.100 
join it but here I here we are we're a
few<00:07:06.129> rows<00:07:06.340> in<00:07:06.610> so<00:07:06.909> you<00:07:06.969> can<00:07:07.210> see<00:07:07.449> now<00:07:07.659> how<00:07:07.900> it's

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
few rows in so you can see now how it's

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.950 
few rows in so you can see now how it's
easy<00:07:08.409> to<00:07:08.650> tell<00:07:09.180> whether<00:07:10.180> you're<00:07:10.419> twisting

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
easy to tell whether you're twisting

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.540 
easy to tell whether you're twisting
your<00:07:10.990> fabric<00:07:11.469> or<00:07:11.590> not<00:07:11.770> and<00:07:13.800> we're<00:07:14.800> working<00:07:15.250> a

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
your fabric or not and we're working a

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.749 
your fabric or not and we're working a
tiny<00:07:15.969> tube<00:07:16.300> on<00:07:16.659> two<00:07:16.930> circular<00:07:17.440> needles<00:07:20.759> poor

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 
tiny tube on two circular needles poor

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.430 
tiny tube on two circular needles poor
Chelsey<00:07:22.150> looks<00:07:22.360> like<00:07:22.539> someone<00:07:22.900> cut<00:07:23.110> her<00:07:23.229> hair

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440
