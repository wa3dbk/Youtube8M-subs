hours<00:03:58.590> but<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:59.040> think<00:03:59.459> it's<00:03:59.549> going<00:03:59.609> to<00:03:59.699> be<00:03:59.819> worth

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
hours but I think it's going to be worth

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.819 
hours but I think it's going to be worth
it<00:04:00.090> they<00:04:00.660> do<00:04:00.720> have<00:04:00.930> extra<00:04:01.319> laces<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.739> is

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
it they do have extra laces this is

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.349 
it they do have extra laces this is
something<00:04:02.129> I<00:04:02.190> really<00:04:02.220> like<00:04:02.430> about<00:04:02.549> SBS<00:04:03.150> they

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
something I really like about SBS they

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.089 
something I really like about SBS they
always<00:04:03.540> pay<00:04:03.750> attention<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:04.109> details<00:04:04.500> they

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
always pay attention to details they

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.500 
always pay attention to details they
always<00:04:05.220> have<00:04:05.459> like<00:04:05.730> things<00:04:05.970> like<00:04:06.090> this<00:04:06.239> like
