00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the fifth fret the fourth string D

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.910 
the fifth fret the fourth string D
string<00:00:29.420> it<00:00:30.420> hammers<00:00:30.810> onto<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> sixth<00:00:31.590> fret<00:00:31.710> of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.860 
of the string under that which is the B
string<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.390> sounds<00:00:36.690> something<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:38.870> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
string so it sounds something like and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.510 
string so it sounds something like and
you<00:00:40.170> play<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.500> measure<00:00:40.770> three<00:00:41.129> times

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.060

but you don't play the fifth fret on the
beach<00:00:46.280> for<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.700> third<00:00:46.910> one

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
beach for the third one

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.390 
beach for the third one
instead<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:48.350> play<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.620> fifth<00:00:48.830> fret<00:00:48.980> on<00:00:49.040> the

instead you play the fifth fret on the
last<00:00:50.120> string<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:51.020> it's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.910 

that's<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.809> fifth<00:00:56.019> fret<00:00:56.199> on<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.379> high<00:00:56.739> E

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.050 

five<00:01:10.260> seven<00:01:10.620> five<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.490> hit<00:01:11.730> again

five hammer ons to six on the g5 to be

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.830 
five hammer ons to six on the g5 to be
so<00:01:16.530> all<00:01:17.070> together<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.910 

and<00:01:23.540> regular<00:01:24.540> speed<00:01:24.780> it'd<00:01:24.899> be

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.950

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
and that's well 12 on the high E and 10

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.270 
and that's well 12 on the high E and 10
on<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.580> high<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.120> mean<00:02:40.720> on<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.990> B<00:02:41.230> string<00:02:41.290> so

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:03:04.239 

altogether<00:02:45.280> it's

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:04.249 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.879 

after<00:03:05.249> that<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:05.579> some<00:03:05.760> feedback<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.889> on

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
after that it's some feedback on the on

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.229 
after that it's some feedback on the on
the<00:03:08.189> amp<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.670> then<00:03:08.819> it's<00:03:10.609> 14<00:03:11.609> on<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:11.969> B<00:03:12.180> string

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
the amp and then it's 14 on the B string

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.209 
the amp and then it's 14 on the B string
and<00:03:12.900> 12<00:03:13.319> on<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.859> g<00:03:14.099> string<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:15.620> then<00:03:16.620> 12<00:03:17.040> on

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.219 
and 12 on the g string and then 12 on

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:23.270 
and 12 on the g string and then 12 on
both<00:03:17.269> G<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.299> V<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:20.269> then<00:03:21.269> 10<00:03:22.049> on<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.379> B<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.829> 12

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
both G and V and then 10 on the B and 12

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.809 
both G and V and then 10 on the B and 12
mg<00:03:24.379> so<00:03:25.379> you<00:03:25.469> play<00:03:25.620> those<00:03:25.799> three<00:03:26.129> chords<00:03:27.500> and

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
mg so you play those three chords and

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.149 
mg so you play those three chords and
then<00:03:29.819> you<00:03:29.939> do<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.109> on<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.590> g<00:03:32.280> string<00:03:34.159> 10th

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
then you do on the on the g string 10th

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.369 
then you do on the on the g string 10th
fret<00:03:35.489> hammer<00:03:36.150> on<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.659> the<00:03:36.780> 11<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:39.290> then<00:03:40.290> you

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
fret hammer on to the 11 and then you

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.869 
fret hammer on to the 11 and then you
hit<00:03:40.469> the<00:03:40.620> 10th<00:03:40.889> on<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.069> B<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.579> it's<00:03:41.699> kind<00:03:41.849> of

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
hit the 10th on the B so it's kind of

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.539 
hit the 10th on the B so it's kind of
like<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.120> beginning<00:03:43.099> well<00:03:44.099> you<00:03:44.219> do<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.430> down

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
like the beginning well you do it down

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.470 
like the beginning well you do it down
here

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
here

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.070 
here
three<00:03:47.480> measures<00:03:47.810> again

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.280 

and<00:03:55.080> then<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.380> do<00:03:56.660> that's<00:03:58.580> two<00:03:59.580> to<00:04:00.120> two<00:04:00.870> strums

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
and then you do that's two to two strums

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.960 
and then you do that's two to two strums
at<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.680> tenth<00:04:01.950> fret<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.310> B<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:02.760> then<00:04:02.880> a

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.529 

so<00:04:16.660> most<00:04:17.530> b2b

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:26.420
