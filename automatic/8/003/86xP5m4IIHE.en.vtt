the<00:01:34.349> whole<00:01:34.499> collection<00:01:35.009> was<00:01:35.159> kind<00:01:35.219> of<00:01:35.520> ample<00:01:36.359> I

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
the whole collection was kind of ample I

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.179 
the whole collection was kind of ample I
liked<00:01:36.840> everything<00:01:37.139> feeling<00:01:37.709> like<00:01:37.859> you<00:01:38.069> were

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
liked everything feeling like you were

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.699 
liked everything feeling like you were
being<00:01:38.549> cocooned<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.359> wrapped<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:40.289> things<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
being cocooned and wrapped in things I

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.620 
being cocooned and wrapped in things I
like<00:01:40.889> that<00:01:41.039> the<00:01:41.459> attitude<00:01:41.999> of<00:01:42.149> taking<00:01:42.569> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
like that the attitude of taking a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.479 
like that the attitude of taking a
blanket<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.229> wrapping<00:01:43.649> yourself<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:44.489 
blanket and wrapping yourself in it I

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:45.949 
blanket and wrapping yourself in it I
think<00:01:44.819> there's<00:01:44.969> something<00:01:45.209> very<00:01:45.450> sensual

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
think there's something very sensual

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.289 
think there's something very sensual
about<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.590> also<00:01:46.739> you're<00:01:47.520> often<00:01:47.700> naked

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
about that but also you're often naked

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.940 
about that but also you're often naked
when<00:01:48.479> you're<00:01:48.719> wrapping<00:01:49.079> yourself<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
when you're wrapping yourself like that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.469 
when you're wrapping yourself like that
and<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.249> liked<00:01:50.489> that<00:01:50.579> kind<00:01:50.999> of<00:01:51.149> play<00:01:51.450> with

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and I liked that kind of play with

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.149 
and I liked that kind of play with
things<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.169> very<00:01:52.289> transparent<00:01:52.739> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
things that are very transparent and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.620 
things that are very transparent and
then<00:01:53.520> something<00:01:53.789> that<00:01:54.090> you're<00:01:54.209> completely

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
then something that you're completely

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.229 
then something that you're completely
safe<00:01:54.959> inside<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.789> did<00:01:56.789> think<00:01:56.999> it<00:01:57.059> was<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.239 
safe inside I did think it was a

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.269 
safe inside I did think it was a
collection<00:01:57.599> for<00:01:57.899> people<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.349> Biggers<00:01:58.770> yeah

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.479 
that's true they're like a celebration
of<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.349> female<00:02:01.679> form<00:02:01.889> and<00:02:02.099> you<00:02:02.189> allow<00:02:02.429> the

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
of the female form and you allow the

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.850 
of the female form and you allow the
female<00:02:02.969> form<00:02:03.179> to<00:02:03.419> speak

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
female form to speak

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.740 
female form to speak
through<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.580> blades<00:02:04.790> they're<00:02:05.300> not<00:02:05.420> just<00:02:05.540> made

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
through the blades they're not just made

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.499 
through the blades they're not just made
a<00:02:05.780> stick<00:02:06.080> thing<00:02:06.260> people<00:02:06.880> where<00:02:07.880> was<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.210> thorn

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
a stick thing people where was the thorn

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.110 
a stick thing people where was the thorn
in<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.810> road<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.619> girls<00:02:09.890> were<00:02:10.460> strong<00:02:10.820> girls

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
in the road the girls were strong girls

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.970 
in the road the girls were strong girls
you<00:02:11.360> know<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.510> didn't<00:02:11.900> want<00:02:12.050> kind<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.350> ephemeral

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
you know I didn't want kind of ephemeral

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.610 
you know I didn't want kind of ephemeral
kind<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:13.550> wavy<00:02:13.910> girls<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.600> wanted<00:02:14.960> strong<00:02:15.350> girls

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
kind of wavy girls I wanted strong girls

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.560 
kind of wavy girls I wanted strong girls
and<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.310> think<00:02:16.550> actually<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.090> character

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
and so I think actually the character

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.050 
and so I think actually the character
was<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.750> thorn
