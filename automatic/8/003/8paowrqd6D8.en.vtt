00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.030 
very nice I'm a bit confused though
because<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.589> keep<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.860> about

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
because I know we keep going about

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.399 
because I know we keep going about
French<00:01:05.400> flair<00:01:05.670> always<00:01:06.119> come<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.479> know<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.750> know

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
French flair always come I know I know

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.350 
French flair always come I know I know
normally<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> girls<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.460> are<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
normally it's the girls that are but the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.690 
normally it's the girls that are but the
last<00:01:09.570> thing<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.960> guess<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.590> actually<00:01:11.400> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
last thing I guess is that actually you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.280 
last thing I guess is that actually you
know<00:01:11.820> what<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.000> come<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> me<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.200> I

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
know what it's come to me and I

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.990 
know what it's come to me and I
understand<00:01:13.680> why<00:01:13.890> they're<00:01:14.130> using<00:01:14.310> Picasso<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
understand why they're using Picasso the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.300 
understand why they're using Picasso the
whole<00:01:15.119> time<00:01:15.360> why<00:01:15.720> because<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.619> less<00:01:16.950> it's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
whole time why because it's less it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.210 
whole time why because it's less it's
less<00:01:17.400> French<00:01:17.939> flair<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:19.220> French

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
less French flair and more French

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.100 
less French flair and more French
abstract<00:01:20.820> which<00:01:21.180> kind<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.659> what<00:01:21.780> Picasso

but<00:03:05.090> I'm<00:03:05.330> thinking<00:03:05.780> if<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.930> look<00:03:06.080> at<00:03:06.170> some<00:03:06.320> of

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
but I'm thinking if I look at some of

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.539 
but I'm thinking if I look at some of
the<00:03:06.470> features<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.920> car<00:03:07.100> it<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.250> geared

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
the features of the car it is geared

the features of the car it is geared
towards<00:03:07.880> moms<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.329> kids<00:03:08.480> they've<00:03:09.260> got<00:03:09.500> an

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
towards moms and kids they've got an

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.020 
towards moms and kids they've got an
amazing<00:03:10.040> feature<00:03:10.250> sure<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.670> doors<00:03:10.880> all

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
amazing feature sure the doors all

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.699 
amazing feature sure the doors all
unlock<00:03:11.269> essentially<00:03:12.079> when<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.290> drive<00:03:12.530> off

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
unlock essentially when you drive off

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.170 
unlock essentially when you drive off
but<00:03:12.739> there's<00:03:13.010> actually<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.340> child<00:03:13.610> lock<00:03:13.850> button

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
but there's actually a child lock button

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.640 
but there's actually a child lock button
as<00:03:14.299> well<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:14.660> your<00:03:14.780> kids<00:03:14.989> cannot<00:03:15.260> open<00:03:15.560> the

I'm<00:03:16.370> thinking<00:03:16.910> maybe<00:03:17.060> that's<00:03:17.360> why<00:03:17.510> they've

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
I'm thinking maybe that's why they've

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.360 
I'm thinking maybe that's why they've
gone<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:17.989> route<00:03:18.110> with<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.380> winery's<00:03:18.799> use<00:03:19.250> of

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
gone that route with the winery's use of

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.740 
gone that route with the winery's use of
kids<00:03:19.549> only<00:03:19.730> it's<00:03:19.940> going<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.120> be<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.209> bit<00:03:20.390> harder

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
kids only it's going to be a bit harder

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.870 
kids only it's going to be a bit harder
for<00:03:20.780> them<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.290> wander<00:03:21.920> win<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.310> up<00:03:22.400> maybe

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
for them to wander win it up maybe

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.819 
for them to wander win it up maybe

thought what a cute looking car and then

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.980

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.529 
the test car arrived in this silver and
it<00:06:04.229> just<00:06:04.440> does<00:06:04.770> not<00:06:05.070> do<00:06:05.430> it<00:06:05.550> justice<00:06:06.030> so<00:06:06.360> maybe

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
it just does not do it justice so maybe

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.240
