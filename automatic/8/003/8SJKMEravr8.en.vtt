00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
been cranked in probably six months but

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.510 
been cranked in probably six months but
I'd<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.200> willing<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.530> bet<00:01:34.590> my<00:01:34.860> house<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.369> if

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
I'd be willing to bet my house that if

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.039 
I'd be willing to bet my house that if
you<00:01:35.579> put<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> battery<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.240> turn<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.540> gas<00:01:36.840> on

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
you put a battery in it turn the gas on

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.289 
you put a battery in it turn the gas on
choked<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.799> bet<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.670> wouldn't<00:01:38.820> turn<00:01:39.000> two

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
choked it I bet it wouldn't turn two

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.539 
choked it I bet it wouldn't turn two
times<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> crunch<00:01:40.110> here's<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> ideal<00:01:41.520> I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
times to the crunch here's the ideal I

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.460 
times to the crunch here's the ideal I
have<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> building<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.420> tracks<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.869> know<00:01:42.930> look

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
have a building the tracks I know look

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.080 
have a building the tracks I know look
like<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.070> course<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.790> tracks

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
like this of course but the tracks

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.789 
like this of course but the tracks
itself<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> pretty<00:01:46.290> close<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.740> do

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
itself I can get that pretty close I do

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.850 
itself I can get that pretty close I do
believe<00:01:47.869> I'm<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> put<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> smaller<00:01:49.530> cog

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
believe I'm going to put a smaller cog

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.679 
believe I'm going to put a smaller cog
up<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> top<00:01:50.549> which<00:01:50.790> will<00:01:50.820> further<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
up on the top which will further the

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.319 
up on the top which will further the
power<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.380> slow<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.430> down<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.909> got<00:01:54.060> three

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
power of it slow it down it's got three

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.910 
power of it slow it down it's got three
speeds<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:55.079> got<00:01:55.259> three<00:01:55.590> regular

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
speeds it's got three regular

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.410 
speeds it's got three regular
transmission<00:01:56.579> speeds<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:57.990> reverse

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
transmission speeds in one reverse

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.520 
transmission speeds in one reverse
steering<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.960> all<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.439> be

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
steering will be going all there be

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.800 
steering will be going all there be
sticking<00:02:01.860> ups<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.189> handles<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:03.060> control<00:02:03.659> it

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
sticking ups to handles to control it

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
sticking ups to handles to control it
with<00:02:03.840> listen<00:02:04.200> amount<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.530> time<00:02:04.740> hope<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.490> like

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
with listen amount of time hope you like

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.370 
with listen amount of time hope you like
my<00:02:05.820> ideal<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.570> gonna<00:02:06.719> get<00:02:06.840> started<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.229> it

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
my ideal and I'm gonna get started on it

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.080 
my ideal and I'm gonna get started on it
pretty<00:02:07.500> quick<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.009> got<00:02:08.550> some<00:02:08.759> supplies

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
pretty quick I got some supplies

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.840 
pretty quick I got some supplies
