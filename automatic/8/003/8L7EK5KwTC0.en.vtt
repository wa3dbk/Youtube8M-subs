for<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:06.980> fun<00:03:07.280> fact<00:03:07.640> about<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.940> game<00:03:08.209> no<00:03:08.390> fun

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
for the fun fact about a game no fun

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.270 
for the fun fact about a game no fun
factor<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.180> had<00:03:11.420> to<00:03:11.450> say<00:03:11.690> like<00:03:11.959> that

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
factor so I had to say like that

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.100 
factor so I had to say like that
honestly<00:03:13.280> like<00:03:13.580> I<00:03:13.880> actually<00:03:14.300> think<00:03:14.690> this<00:03:14.900> is

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
honestly like I actually think this is

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.620 
honestly like I actually think this is
like<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.590> best<00:03:15.830> light<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.700> sort<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.060> feel<00:03:17.330> I

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
like the best light and sort of feel I

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.300 
like the best light and sort of feel I
think<00:03:17.959> this<00:03:18.050> is<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.230> best<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.860> Batman

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
think this is the best and the Batman

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.460 
think this is the best and the Batman
series<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:19.880> terms<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.209> Arkham<00:03:20.780> origins<00:03:21.080> and

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
series in terms of Arkham origins and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.350 
series in terms of Arkham origins and
the<00:03:21.770> reason<00:03:22.010> why<00:03:22.100> I<00:03:22.130> say<00:03:22.310> that<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.550> because<00:03:22.610> the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
the reason why I say that is because the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.840 
the reason why I say that is because the
game<00:03:23.630> is<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.930> lot<00:03:24.200> more<00:03:24.400> consistent<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.550> turns

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
game is a lot more consistent it turns

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.390 
game is a lot more consistent it turns
off<00:03:26.090> from<00:03:26.450> point<00:03:26.750> A<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.170> point<00:03:27.260> B<00:03:27.620> action

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
off from point A to point B action

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.220 
off from point A to point B action
action<00:03:28.640> action<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.450> have<00:03:29.720> more<00:03:29.870> choice

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
action action and you have more choice

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.390 
action action and you have more choice
and<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.590> feels<00:03:30.800> like<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.040> can<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:31.250> whatever

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
and it feels like you can do whatever

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.220 
and it feels like you can do whatever
you<00:03:31.640> want<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:31.910> do<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.300> still<00:03:32.690> staying<00:03:33.110> around

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
you want to do and still staying around

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:57.760 
you want to do and still staying around
with<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.620> story<00:03:33.950> hey<00:03:34.519> yo<00:03:35.000> its<00:03:35.860> place<00:03:36.860> huh
