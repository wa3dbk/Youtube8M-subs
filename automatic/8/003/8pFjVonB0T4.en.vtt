00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
I tend to try to get behind the crab by

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.020 
I tend to try to get behind the crab by
using<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.500> three<00:02:49.770> skill<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.430> when<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.760> crabs

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
using the three skill so when the crabs

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.150 
using the three skill so when the crabs
start<00:02:51.360> rolling<00:02:51.840> they'll<00:02:52.050> roll<00:02:52.320> them<00:02:52.650> over<00:02:53.010> and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
start rolling they'll roll them over and

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
give me more time to get away if you

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.449 
give me more time to get away if you

gonna pop their three skill to get to

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.070 
gonna pop their three skill to get to
you<00:02:58.500> now<00:02:59.100> about<00:02:59.130> time<00:02:59.880> this<00:03:00.209> happens<00:03:00.660> your

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
you now about time this happens your

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.229 
you now about time this happens your
three<00:03:01.440> skills<00:03:01.800> gonna<00:03:02.010> be<00:03:02.190> off<00:03:02.400> cooldown<00:03:02.970> so

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
three skills gonna be off cooldown so

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.750 
three skills gonna be off cooldown so
you<00:03:03.570> can<00:03:03.720> pause<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.739> get<00:03:04.890> across<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.550> map

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
you can pause that to get across the map

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.729 
you can pause that to get across the map
one<00:03:06.239> thing<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.540> tend<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:06.900> use<00:03:06.959> if<00:03:07.320> they're<00:03:07.500> all

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
one thing I tend to use if they're all

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.160 
one thing I tend to use if they're all
grouping<00:03:08.459> up<00:03:08.610> it's<00:03:08.880> good<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.360> go<00:03:09.540> against<00:03:10.019> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
grouping up it's good to go against the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.050 
grouping up it's good to go against the
straggler<00:03:10.709> little<00:03:11.010> guy<00:03:11.100> who's<00:03:11.370> off<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
straggler little guy who's off to the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.960 
straggler little guy who's off to the
side<00:03:12.300> roll<00:03:13.050> into<00:03:13.680> him<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.160> come<00:03:14.580> out<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
side roll into him and come out the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.120 
side roll into him and come out the
other<00:03:15.000> side<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.050> then<00:03:16.320> probably<00:03:16.560> pop<00:03:16.920> your

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
other side and then probably pop your

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.770 
other side and then probably pop your
three<00:03:17.340> skill<00:03:17.640> if<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.540> always

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
three skill if you have it I always

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.720 
three skill if you have it I always
wanted<00:03:19.320> though<00:03:19.500> what<00:03:19.739> if<00:03:19.830> they<00:03:19.980> tied<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.489> all

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
wanted though what if they tied in all

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.759 
wanted though what if they tied in all
these<00:03:20.940> minigames<00:03:21.540> together<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.320> make<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> new
