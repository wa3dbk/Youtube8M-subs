00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.900 
stops in different phases and pictures
where<00:03:58.440> people<00:03:58.650> stop<00:03:58.920> it's<00:03:59.220> called<00:03:59.489> belaying

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
where people stop it's called belaying

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.490 
where people stop it's called belaying
