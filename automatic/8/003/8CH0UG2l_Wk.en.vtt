00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
the world but like I said our backs are

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.790 
the world but like I said our backs are
against<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.060> wall<00:03:39.120> we<00:03:39.660> gotta<00:03:39.900> we<00:03:40.290> gotta<00:03:40.470> put

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
thankfully that true step kind of

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.720 
thankfully that true step kind of
prevented<00:03:43.980> him<00:03:44.100> from<00:03:44.130> getting<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.550> first

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
prevented him from getting the first

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.719 
think I said it in a previous video I
think<00:04:33.409> that<00:04:33.530> was<00:04:33.620> 90<00:04:33.860> Megan<00:04:34.069> but<00:04:34.250> no<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:34.580> is

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
think that was 90 Megan but no this is

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.809 
think that was 90 Megan but no this is
his<00:04:34.819> first<00:04:34.970> game<00:04:35.210> right<00:04:35.360> hand<00:04:35.479> pretty<00:04:35.599> sure<00:04:35.810> um

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
his first game right hand pretty sure um

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.999 
his first game right hand pretty sure um
so<00:04:37.819> you<00:04:38.300> know<00:04:38.330> yet<00:04:39.259> so<00:04:39.440> we're<00:04:39.560> looking<00:04:39.710> at

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
so you know yet so we're looking at

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.860 
so you know yet so we're looking at
possibly<00:04:40.490> going<00:04:40.759> into<00:04:41.090> halftime<00:04:41.389> with<00:04:41.629> the

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
possibly going into halftime with the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.350 
possibly going into halftime with the
lead<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.770> now<00:04:43.009> hopefully<00:04:43.789> being<00:04:43.909> able<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.210> tie

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
lead to now hopefully being able to tie

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.149 
lead to now hopefully being able to tie
the<00:04:44.419> game<00:04:44.599> in<00:04:44.780> getting<00:04:45.409> you<00:04:45.620> know<00:04:45.740> ball<00:04:45.979> back

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
the game in getting you know ball back

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.189 
the game in getting you know ball back
so<00:04:46.370> right<00:04:47.150> here<00:04:47.360> we<00:04:47.509> end<00:04:47.629> up<00:04:47.720> just<00:04:47.870> running

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
so right here we end up just running

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.740 
so right here we end up just running
with<00:04:48.530> Bridgewater<00:04:49.520> I<00:04:49.729> desperately<00:04:50.270> want<00:04:50.690> to

get in the end zone right here we just
throw<00:04:52.639> it<00:04:52.789> one<00:04:53.120> yard<00:04:53.360> line<00:04:53.449> we<00:04:53.750> end<00:04:53.900> up<00:04:53.990> calling

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
throw it one yard line we end up calling

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.369 
throw it one yard line we end up calling
our<00:04:54.349> last<00:04:54.590> time<00:04:54.889> out<00:04:55.069> QB<00:04:55.849> sneak<00:04:55.909> and<00:04:56.599> we<00:04:56.870> just

get in the end zone tie game even though

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.320 
get in the end zone tie game even though
I<00:05:00.259> felt<00:05:00.500> like<00:05:00.650> we<00:05:01.190> should<00:05:01.460> possibly<00:05:01.759> be<00:05:02.180> with

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
I felt like we should possibly be with

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.850 
I felt like we should possibly be with
the<00:05:02.449> lead<00:05:02.659> but<00:05:02.960> nothing<00:05:03.319> we<00:05:03.379> can<00:05:03.530> do<00:05:03.620> about<00:05:03.710> it

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
the lead but nothing we can do about it

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.339 
the lead but nothing we can do about it
now<00:05:03.979> right<00:05:04.310> so<00:05:04.520> I'm<00:05:05.030> after<00:05:05.270> that<00:05:05.599> pic<00:05:05.840> 6<00:05:06.139> you

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
know our confidence definitely went down

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.689 
know our confidence definitely went down
but<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:09.469> touchdown<00:05:09.740> you<00:05:10.129> know<00:05:10.219> made<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.400> shot

deep<00:07:27.430> up<00:07:27.670> top<00:07:27.910> towards<00:07:28.240> the<00:07:28.330> right<00:07:28.510> side<00:07:28.540> we

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780 
deep up top towards the right side we

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.720 
deep up top towards the right side we
got<00:07:29.140> two<00:07:29.350> guys<00:07:29.530> over<00:07:29.770> there<00:07:29.950> we<00:07:30.460> end<00:07:30.610> up

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:30.730 
got two guys over there we end up

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.300 
got two guys over there we end up
getting<00:07:31.060> the<00:07:31.740> interception<00:07:32.740> with<00:07:32.860> braylon

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.310 
getting the interception with braylon

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.130 
getting the interception with braylon
and<00:07:33.490> right<00:07:34.150> here<00:07:34.330> is<00:07:34.450> pretty<00:07:34.600> much<00:07:34.780> safe<00:07:34.960> to

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:35.140 
and right here is pretty much safe to

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.510 
and right here is pretty much safe to
say<00:07:35.290> that<00:07:35.320> we<00:07:35.560> are<00:07:35.710> going<00:07:35.860> to<00:07:35.920> go<00:07:36.010> on<00:07:36.100> ahead<00:07:36.220> and

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 
say that we are going to go on ahead and

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.650 
say that we are going to go on ahead and
win<00:07:37.180> this<00:07:37.330> game<00:07:37.600> and<00:07:39.000> allow<00:07:40.000> us<00:07:40.210> to<00:07:40.330> continue

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660 
win this game and allow us to continue

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.720 
win this game and allow us to continue
hopefully<00:07:41.350> being<00:07:41.920> able<00:07:42.070> to<00:07:42.250> make<00:07:42.370> it<00:07:42.520> to<00:07:42.640> the

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:42.730 
hopefully being able to make it to the

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.370 
hopefully being able to make it to the
playoffs<00:07:42.850> so<00:07:43.240> again<00:07:43.450> we<00:07:43.630> have<00:07:43.870> to<00:07:44.080> run<00:07:44.260> the

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.380 
playoffs so again we have to run the

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.100 
playoffs so again we have to run the
table<00:07:44.560> here<00:07:44.860> we<00:07:45.340> need<00:07:45.550> to<00:07:45.700> win<00:07:45.820> each<00:07:46.090> and<00:07:46.540> every

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.110
