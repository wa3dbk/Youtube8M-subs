thought the whole second you lose the
whole<00:00:09.870> group<00:00:10.349> came<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:11.240> gave<00:00:12.240> us<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.480> big<00:00:12.690> spark

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
whole group came in gave us a big spark

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.169 
whole group came in gave us a big spark
in<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.710> second<00:00:14.099> quarter<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.639> opposite

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
in the second quarter just the opposite

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.760 
in the second quarter just the opposite
of<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:15.509> had<00:00:15.599> happened<00:00:15.990> against<00:00:16.260> Brooklyn

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
of what had happened against Brooklyn

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.900

and<00:00:17.330> in<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.570> other<00:00:18.690> game<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.460> but<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.640> need

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
and in the other game so but we need

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.080 
and in the other game so but we need
that<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.600> spark<00:00:22.109> from<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> bench<00:00:22.820> we<00:00:23.820> got<00:00:24.000> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that that spark from the bench we got to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.400 
that that spark from the bench we got to
get<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.240> quicker<00:00:24.480> start<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.900> don't<00:00:25.080> know<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.289> we

get a quicker start I don't know what we

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.050 
get a quicker start I don't know what we
have<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.939> know

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
starting unit but we got to come out

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.420 
starting unit but we got to come out
with<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> pedal<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.880> metal<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:31.230> find<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
with a pedal to the metal and find a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.910 
with a pedal to the metal and find a
group<00:00:33.000> that's<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.320> come<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.530> give<00:00:34.739> us<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
group that's going to come out give us a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.709 
group that's going to come out give us a
spark<00:00:35.190> but<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.460> love<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> way<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.000> bounce<00:00:36.390> back

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
spark but I love the way we bounce back

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.900 
spark but I love the way we bounce back
i<00:00:36.930> love<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> fight<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.950> tenacity<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.730> had

the<00:00:44.160> way<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> guys<00:00:44.579> responded<00:00:46.190> third<00:00:47.190> quarter

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the way the guys responded third quarter

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
the way the guys responded third quarter
was<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.000> again<00:00:48.480> yeah<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.350> try<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> get

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
was that again yeah just to try to get

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
was that again yeah just to try to get
to<00:00:49.829> keep<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.129> spark<00:00:50.460> keep<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.850> spark<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.180> thought

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
to keep a spark keep a spark I thought

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.939 
to keep a spark keep a spark I thought
you<00:00:51.660> know<00:00:51.780> Terrence<00:00:52.320> didn't<00:00:52.500> score<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> point

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
you know Terrence didn't score a point

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.369 
you know Terrence didn't score a point
what<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.640> point<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.750> many<00:00:54.899> points<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.260> have

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
what one point how many points you have

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.959 
what one point how many points you have
one<00:00:55.710> point<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.399> he<00:00:56.489> did<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> good<00:00:56.910> job

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
one point and but he did a good job

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.939 
one point and but he did a good job
defensively<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:58.079> thought<00:00:58.379> staying<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.829> front

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
defensively I thought staying in front

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.670 
defensively I thought staying in front
of<00:00:59.270> Crawford<00:01:00.270> staying<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.629> front<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.960> Paul

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
of Crawford staying in front of Paul

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
of Crawford staying in front of Paul
getting<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> good<00:01:02.640> job<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.879> using<00:01:03.149> his<00:01:03.300> length

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
getting a good job of using his length

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.020 
getting a good job of using his length
and<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.860> that's<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.640> his<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
and I you know and that's not his you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.340 
and I you know and that's not his you
know<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.210> would<00:01:06.510> think<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.810> him<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> shooter

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
know you would think of him as a shooter

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580 
know you would think of him as a shooter
but<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.400> was<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> huge<00:01:09.380> advantage<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.409> us

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
but and that was a huge advantage for us

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.640 
but and that was a huge advantage for us
as<00:01:10.890> him<00:01:11.070> using<00:01:11.400> his<00:01:11.430> land<00:01:12.049> Kyle<00:01:13.049> away<00:01:13.380> from

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
as him using his land Kyle away from

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.100 
as him using his land Kyle away from
those<00:01:13.770> guys<00:01:14.010> across<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.729> bit<00:01:15.360> number<00:01:15.840> but

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
those guys across a bit number but

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
those guys across a bit number but
bakkali<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:17.040> he<00:01:17.159> had<00:01:17.340> Paul<00:01:17.610> quite<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> bit

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
bakkali I think he had Paul quite a bit

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.429 
bakkali I think he had Paul quite a bit
i<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> look<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.659> tape<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.259> but

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
i have to look at the tape and see but

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
everything you know shots is a great and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.310 
everything you know shots is a great and
you<00:01:41.549> know<00:01:41.670> he's<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.299> good<00:01:42.840> drug<00:01:43.110> for

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you know he's a a good drug for

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.620 
you know he's a a good drug for
everything<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.040> UV<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.149> messing<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.540> in

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
everything that UV if you messing up in

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.780 
everything that UV if you messing up in
other<00:01:45.780> areas<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.290> he<00:01:46.740> made<00:01:47.009> some<00:01:47.250> good<00:01:47.399> shots

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
other areas so he made some good shots

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.940 
other areas so he made some good shots
but<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.479> thought<00:01:48.659> his<00:01:48.810> passing<00:01:49.409> was<00:01:49.439> good<00:01:49.799> he

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
but I thought his passing was good he

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.310 
but I thought his passing was good he
had<00:01:50.040> one<00:01:50.280> split<00:01:50.579> he<00:01:50.670> tried<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> go<00:01:51.119> through

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
had one split he tried to go through

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.420 
had one split he tried to go through
pick-and-roll<00:01:52.320> but<00:01:52.530> for<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.860> most<00:01:53.009> part<00:01:53.130> he

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
pick-and-roll but for the most part he

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.399 
pick-and-roll but for the most part he
did<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> good<00:01:53.759> job<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.000> passing<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.840> thought<00:01:55.290> his

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
did a good job of passing I thought his

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.830 
did a good job of passing I thought his
defense<00:01:55.799> was<00:01:55.890> solid<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.700> Paul<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.750> other

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
defense was solid on Paul and other

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.639 
defense was solid on Paul and other
perimeter<00:01:58.380> guys<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.930> know<00:02:01.049> again<00:02:01.409> he's<00:02:01.619> a

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
perimeter guys so you know again he's a

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.109 
perimeter guys so you know again he's a
veteran<00:02:02.009> knows<00:02:02.250> how<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> play<00:02:02.700> you're<00:02:03.000> gonna

veteran knows how to play you're gonna

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.469 
veteran knows how to play you're gonna

an opportunity guard deandre jordan we

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.330 
an opportunity guard deandre jordan we
were<00:02:29.840> concerned<00:02:30.230> about<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.650> matchup<00:02:30.920> but

know hang with him and keep him off the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.740 
know hang with him and keep him off the
boards<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.670> allowed<00:02:38.000> us<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.270> have<00:02:38.480> games

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
boards that allowed us to have games

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.880 
boards that allowed us to have games
before<00:02:38.960> which<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.440> big<00:02:39.740> advantage<00:02:40.180> james

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.260 

huge<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.250> thought<00:02:46.460> he<00:02:46.640> played<00:02:46.670> well<00:02:47.240> played

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
huge I thought he played well played

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.900 
huge I thought he played well played
under<00:02:47.750> control<00:02:48.230> made<00:02:49.010> his<00:02:49.190> shots<00:02:49.460> didn't

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
under control made his shots didn't

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.540 
under control made his shots didn't
force<00:02:50.090> anything<00:02:50.390> quarterback<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.250> thought

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
force anything quarterback but I thought

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.410 
force anything quarterback but I thought
he<00:02:52.700> was<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.850> little<00:02:53.090> bit<00:02:53.180> more<00:02:53.300> aggressive

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
he was a little bit more aggressive

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.420 
he was a little bit more aggressive
looking<00:02:54.170> for<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.410> shot<00:02:54.650> more<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.070> than<00:02:55.220> just

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
looking for a shot more so than just

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.670 
looking for a shot more so than just
coming<00:02:55.700> off<00:02:55.760> thinking<00:02:56.120> pass<00:02:56.360> first<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:57.050> that

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
coming off thinking pass first so that

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.660 
coming off thinking pass first so that
was<00:02:57.860> big<00:02:58.040> for<00:02:58.280> us<00:02:58.340> lu<00:02:59.920> lu<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.220> james<00:03:01.400> kind<00:03:01.610> of

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
was big for us lu lu and james kind of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.940 
was big for us lu lu and james kind of
