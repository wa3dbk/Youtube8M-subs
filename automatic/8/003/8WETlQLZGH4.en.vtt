00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.250
 but at canon they contradict the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.250
 People think I have the pants 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.380
 that's the end result, of course 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.040
 little would this aluminum foil but you 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.040
 not better now 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.329
 so much love you see I have 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.260
 this area too i have one too 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.440
 little feeling 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.390
 we have mushrooms so good that I 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.910
 they prove and always correct everything 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.610
 is that's not bad for me 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.379
 I'm used to it 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.500
 I'm just upset now I have 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.360
 I said I want a little bit more 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 Chicken on it were right so me 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.780
 Do me a bit behind it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.059
 Of course you can do whatever you like 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.229
 do what you want on it but if that 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.360
 Really such a pizza should be then 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.460
 Make sure that it is synonymous to each 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.759
 should be healthy ingredients 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.289
 mozzarella is in any case was just 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.130
 already on the eighth but we can 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.130
 just once a week 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.119
 something like mozzarella is yes 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.250
 also very bad very bad for games 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.750
 very bad if you are then 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.590
 was your training for free 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.000
 otherwise much momentum is already 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.440
 show times I've just half 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.229
 Been you still have something 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.380
 Eat buffet eaten right on 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.060
 neckar michigan is and i am now 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.679
 finished with evidence now comes the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.069
 delicious ingredients such as air 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.069
 dried 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.580
 we have little to prove 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.690
 we finished with pool table 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.700
 think we're done with evidence so 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.420
 and what does one have on total space 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.040
 a lot of little chicken is all right 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.040
 Chicken or that is good 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.510
 good seller is all cheese on it 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.220
 a bit of champignons from just that 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.080
 it marianne tip and if you want the 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.790
 You can already see a small comparison 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.410
 differed at least as what the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:46.910
 structures are concerned with neatness 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:46.910
 but apparently help even 200 or and 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.540
 not so far and not so far and 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.220
 Keep your pizza heater coming 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.260
 Of course without then really nice 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.640
 crisp in mine is not so gaudy 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:10.230
 Everything understood correctly 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:12.180
 no, that had something with the 16 well 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.280
 I can also do a bit deeper 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.410
 I've got deep deep down you can 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.889
 said no you asked me is it 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:24.230
 well so do but neat that here 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.230
 no, no, the other down 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.720
 a right head you are right 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:47.190
 people you can testify 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.230
 so it goes from here and indeed for the 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.349
 appeared 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.209
 probably due to the juiciness 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.659
 the reason of the juiciness no gives 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:01.450
 is the right fresh out he finished 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.450
 should be best in the oven shortly 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:09.739
 so he rucola due to the violence 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:18.519
 counterplay and otherwise are 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:18.519
 finished black relatively cheap 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.550
 I said that I 'm sorry 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:31.820
 Did you think normal if I'm something 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.340
 I really like how much is in it is only 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.750
 a very small pack 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.160
 If I like something then I'll get 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.840
 my ben jerry's ice no material 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.380
 we will deal with the final 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.630
 result again 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.889
 first part 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.350
 Here we have the finished one 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:56.060
 result without ham with ham 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.440
 on it and mozzarella or and yes the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.020
 Others are still in there that comes 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.940
 same it all, we have the 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.140
 see result 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.140
 here mozzarella matching 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.720
 ham 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:30.509
 the music is is made up of two beautiful the 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.660
 with sensitivity I here 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:49.910
 but I really give it to myself 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:49.910
 really beautiful from the living piece 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.199
 finished I do not want a cream cheese 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.550
 do 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.160
 the song kind of looking not only when 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.330
 I ran out 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.190
 wonderful internet because where today 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.259
 Bought 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.150
 look is now really frothy that is 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:08.580
 not normal that is normal 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.349
 So do not just look at canon 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:19.800
 and need to contradict 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:23.479
 People think I have how much 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:29.880
 how much fell on it again flashes 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:33.690
 yes something happen because for the 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:39.830
 pc dies then my advent of the 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:44.479
 heavy through by this iron 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:49.190
 oven floor really good 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.190
 commented today you like this 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:59.900
 I like feeling here one day today 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:07:02.610
 longer vacation and messages back so 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.860
 Good hunger I want to see that's it 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.690
 end result, of course, a bit 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.420
 happy tinfoil but went now 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:14.900
 not better my turn 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.780
 I know mine under yours it was 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.550
 he often had a heat 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.870
 people i would say i know 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.350
 made-up or we let it be 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.510
 taste 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.790
 if I'm interested in something like that 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.300
 maybe healthy dishes like hole day 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:31.220
 few dishes or as the general one 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.660
 Four days' refurbishment is actually 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.250
 a pizza right now i have to do that now 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.110
 just lose weight and eat because 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.950
 I would like to try that, of course 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.950
 but eat as I would like
