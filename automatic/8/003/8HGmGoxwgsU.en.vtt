00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.390
 hello very good everyone here you are rude and 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.999
 we are in the second episode of 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.559
 secret block minecraft blocks 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:13.490
 minecraft secrets here we see the 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:16.139
 name the peak of the channel is worth and we come 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.849
 here to see the 1st 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.960
 secret block z you know this is worth 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.570
 these are the ones that are putting now 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.390
 so that it stopped raining I was 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:31.020
 raining and I did not know how to remove 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.350
 it's worth 94 64 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.449
 very well 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.070
 the command that is the gift egress 12 and 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.600
 good our name that you have in byn 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.920
 craft the block that is here more and then 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.159
 64 which is the amount you want klose 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.570
 ok this would be nothing a repeated what 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.850
 it is a truth is turned off I do not know by 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.770
 what is it worth 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.640
 basically it would be this has no more 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.200
 ok this would be the first block today 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.700
 let's see 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.510
 the two zetas 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.510
 and we're not going to put the commander for 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.830
 he does not know how he gets it is so simple 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.830
 how to hit the arrow above 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.670
 good and wooden door is a door 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.300
 of wood with the different skin is not a 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.830
 invisible door or no does not leave me 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.729
 pass because it will be because there is a 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.729
 invisible force here is worth 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.810
 if we put one next to another they are created 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.479
 doors 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.610
 of whole wood that are no longer 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.960
 invisible, do not go and try to put them 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.860
 OK 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.140
 then it would be number 71 that for whom 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.159
 intuitates well 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.200
 Congratulations congratulations is exactly the 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.200
 same but from an iron door 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.560
 and then practically if you want a 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.740
 iron gate this would not do 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.200
 cheating because it's not the creative if you do not 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.200
 can say or the creative can not 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.570
 say that because they do not come out that creative 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.150
 that would not be practically cheating 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.520
 it would be as much cheating as for example 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.110
 make you pity on a server or any 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.230
 thing 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.000
 it's a command has no better and here 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.020
 you will say that is a cake 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.780
 well no no no no vale is a very 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.270
 well but the only thing that changes is the skin 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.890
 here is the conventional cake of 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.750
 minecraft round and the one that I am 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.060
 teaching is square 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.710
 I do not know why they do everything square in 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.020
 minecraft just the cake they have gone 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.390
 to do round let's throw this 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.220
 trash over here 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:49.600
 baby paper vale and we keep these cakes 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.600
 from here number 59 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.000
 59 64 Okay right now we're going to 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.040
 have here in the inventory because 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.520
 I want to reach number 60 to be able 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.870
 to explain better 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.870
 number 36 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:16.630
 36 64 this would be a piston does not let 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.940
 place it I do not know why but it would be a 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.400
 piston is already alone that I will change the 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.740
 corner like what the doors are like and how 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.350
 of the doors like the pie 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.959
 basically it would be that then this is the 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.430
 number 60 bars now I will explain the 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.680
 2 x 1 function is worth this for 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.560
 who does not see it well or anything is 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.380
 and cultivated land and what is this 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.300
 they are crops that there are types of crops 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.190
 you're telling me 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.880
 you will be asking many of 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.690
 you will take this here, it's worth it and 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.450
 in passing we took this 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.670
 so he does not know who exactly is 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.990
 same only that changes the skin will argue 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.170
 breaks stirrup changes the skin only 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.380
 it is the only thing 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.870
 is unique to me I do not like lumpy no 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.170
 OK 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.430
 we remove this and remove this and leave 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.489
 only secret blocks 1 and 2 are very valuable 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.980
 ok and we get to number 118 we're going to 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:26.280
 put the epic command 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.440
 64 very well and this puts cauldron or 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.840
 if it is a cauldron it will have some function 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.130
 especially not do not have anything in 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.410
 special now you will see normal cauldron 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.570
 cauldron so the only thing that changes is the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.699
 skin I do not know so that others work 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.510
 put secret blocks and if they were 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:49.610
 useful still but half are useless 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.610
 it's worth 95 here 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:59.290
 95 64 as you say host is a square 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.330
 black and pink yes are the blocks without 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.050
 textures that if you look 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:11.730
 disappearing alone 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:15.910
 it's a disco that does not 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:17.889
 or look at it beige and break it looks like water 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.110
 just disappear an air let's leave 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.110
 this and see if it disappears 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.350
 follow there disappear 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:36.120
 has disappeared has disappeared good 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:39.720
 let's go to the next block 119 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.490
 64 and it starts to rain as not in a 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.639
 episode as we are not generated to rain 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.320
 for it is as simple as coming here 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:50.070
 second command 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.300
 It stops raining I take away rain from 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.300
 this terrible world 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.500
 and you see they have ignored me has disappeared 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.500
 to the rain and this 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.320
 it would be the portal to the fridge 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.560
 to forgiveness 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.860
 in the never we saw it in episode 1 and 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.479
 this does bring the law 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.180
 I'm going to keep it better, it's not going to be 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.919
 I got inside and well this has been all 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.949
 for today we are going to collect all this garbage 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.199
 that does not cost me anything and now we 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.520
 we remove over 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.529
 what you are seeing here you will see 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.860
 later 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:31.990
 you will see 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:34.990
 it's very good and here it would be all for today 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:38.159
 if you like and share, we thank you and 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.159
 until next time
