00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
well you can see that this is right this

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.180 
well you can see that this is right this
is<00:00:14.690> a<00:00:14.840> red<00:00:15.200> clover<00:00:15.410> I've<00:00:15.620> got

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
is a red clover I've got

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.190 
is a red clover I've got
right<00:00:16.280> hand<00:00:16.550> here<00:00:16.820> and<00:00:17.060> this<00:00:17.330> is<00:00:17.510> white<00:00:17.960> clover

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
right hand here and this is white clover

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.620 
right hand here and this is white clover
I've<00:00:18.410> got<00:00:18.620> in<00:00:18.770> my<00:00:18.890> left<00:00:19.130> hand<00:00:19.280> and<00:00:19.670> you<00:00:20.300> can<00:00:20.450> see

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
I've got in my left hand and you can see

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.300 
I've got in my left hand and you can see
that<00:00:20.660> they<00:00:20.900> are<00:00:20.930> completely<00:00:21.260> different<00:00:22.190> in

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
that they are completely different in

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.760 
that they are completely different in
terms<00:00:22.550> of<00:00:22.760> their<00:00:22.910> growth<00:00:23.240> habits<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:24.560> red

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
terms of their growth habits the red

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.340 
terms of their growth habits the red
clover<00:00:25.040> here<00:00:25.430> goes<00:00:26.119> from<00:00:26.450> is<00:00:26.840> going<00:00:27.110> to<00:00:27.170> deep

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
clover here goes from is going to deep

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.510 
clover here goes from is going to deep
taproot<00:00:27.590> it<00:00:28.220> goes<00:00:28.520> from<00:00:28.700> a<00:00:28.820> crown<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:30.520> white

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
taproot it goes from a crown and white

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.830 
taproot it goes from a crown and white
clover<00:00:32.710> grows<00:00:33.710> from<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:34.880> stolen<00:00:35.390> I<00:00:35.540> stole<00:00:35.809> a

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
clover grows from a stolen I stole a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.520 
clover grows from a stolen I stole a
network<00:00:36.379> of<00:00:36.530> stolen<00:00:36.980> switch<00:00:37.220> branch<00:00:37.580> out<00:00:38.530> so

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
network of stolen switch branch out so

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.170 
network of stolen switch branch out so
for<00:00:39.800> example<00:00:41.080> you<00:00:42.460> can<00:00:43.460> see<00:00:43.670> here<00:00:43.879> the<00:00:44.000> main

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
for example you can see here the main

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.680 
for example you can see here the main
stolen<00:00:44.720> with<00:00:44.930> a<00:00:44.960> branch<00:00:45.320> here<00:00:46.239> and<00:00:47.239> there's

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
stolen with a branch here and there's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.240 
stolen with a branch here and there's
the<00:00:47.870> youngest<00:00:48.370> point<00:00:49.370> of<00:00:49.519> the<00:00:49.670> plant<00:00:50.600> and

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
the youngest point of the plant and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.860 
the youngest point of the plant and
here's<00:00:52.250> another<00:00:52.370> branch<00:00:52.909> growing<00:00:53.570> here

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
here's another branch growing here

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.200 
here's another branch growing here
there's<00:00:54.199> another<00:00:54.470> growing<00:00:55.430> point<00:00:55.730> here<00:00:56.030> and

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
there's another growing point here and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.110 
there's another growing point here and
each<00:00:56.449> of<00:00:56.690> these<00:00:56.839> nodes<00:00:57.489> you<00:00:58.489> can<00:00:58.670> either<00:00:58.760> have

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
each of these nodes you can either have

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.700 
each of these nodes you can either have
a<00:00:59.890> clover<00:01:00.890> PTO<00:01:01.280> or<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:02.180> flower<00:01:02.600> or<00:01:02.900> in<00:01:03.440> fact

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
a clover PTO or a flower or in fact

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.580 
a clover PTO or a flower or in fact
there's<00:01:03.949> roots<00:01:04.610> forming<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.330> at<00:01:05.690> this<00:01:06.350> node

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
there's roots forming it at this node

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.880 
there's roots forming it at this node
here<00:01:06.860> as<00:01:07.040> well<00:01:07.750> so<00:01:08.750> essentially<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:09.770> becomes

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
here as well so essentially it becomes

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.570 
here as well so essentially it becomes
an<00:01:10.250> independent<00:01:10.880> plant<00:01:11.380> so<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.770> this<00:01:13.130> kind<00:01:13.520> of

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
an independent plant so the this kind of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.960 
an independent plant so the this kind of
growth<00:01:13.729> habit<00:01:14.120> means<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:15.700> quite<00:01:16.700> height

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
growth habit means that quite height

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.420 
growth habit means that quite height
Coover<00:01:17.299> has<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.570> ability<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.200> fill<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:19.130> beer

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
Coover has the ability to fill in beer

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.120 
Coover has the ability to fill in beer

spaces to colonize new parts of the of

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
this world and that's what gives it its

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.330 
this world and that's what gives it its

on the other hand if we look at the the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.180 
on the other hand if we look at the the
red<00:01:30.440> clover<00:01:32.620> because<00:01:33.620> it's<00:01:33.800> growing<00:01:34.040> from

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
red clover because it's growing from

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.510 
red clover because it's growing from
this<00:01:34.340> one<00:01:34.610> single<00:01:35.180> growth<00:01:35.840> point<00:01:36.220> once<00:01:37.220> this

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
this one single growth point once this

nothing to fill that space other than

nothing to fill that space other than
probably<00:01:44.380> weeds<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.790> that's<00:01:47.000> what<00:01:47.180> makes<00:01:47.390> red

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
probably weeds so that's what makes red
