00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
much on your custom class so what I

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.510 
much on your custom class so what I
would<00:01:52.229> recommend<00:01:52.350> doing<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.950> unlocking<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
would recommend doing is unlocking the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.429 
would recommend doing is unlocking the
tactician<00:01:53.970> wildcard<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.840> then<00:01:54.930> using<00:01:55.229> two

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
tactician wildcard and then using two

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.859 
tactician wildcard and then using two
different<00:01:55.649> tactical<00:01:56.280> equipements

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
different tactical equipements

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.149 
different tactical equipements
personally<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.899> use<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.409> concussions<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
personally I use the concussions and the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.130 
personally I use the concussions and the
shock<00:01:59.399> charges<00:01:59.850> but<00:01:59.969> another<00:02:00.210> amazing<00:02:00.899> setup

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
shock charges but another amazing setup

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.899 
shock charges but another amazing setup
would<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.710> use<00:02:01.829> concussions<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.670> black

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
would be to use concussions and black

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.789 
would be to use concussions and black
hats<00:02:03.210> because<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:03.960> you're<00:02:04.079> not<00:02:04.259> using<00:02:04.469> ghost

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
hats because if you're not using ghost

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.080 
hats because if you're not using ghost
you're<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> radar<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.000> if

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
you're going to be on the radar but if

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.789 
you're going to be on the radar but if
you<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> black<00:02:06.570> hat<00:02:06.780> PDA<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.469> destroy

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
you have a black hat PDA you can destroy

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.309 
you have a black hat PDA you can destroy
any<00:02:08.039> enemy<00:02:08.220> UAVs<00:02:08.819> now<00:02:09.720> there's<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.959> reason<00:02:10.110> that

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
any enemy UAVs now there's a reason that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.660 
any enemy UAVs now there's a reason that
I<00:02:10.379> don't<00:02:10.500> use<00:02:10.860> any<00:02:11.039> lethal<00:02:11.280> Zoar<00:02:11.640> secondaries
