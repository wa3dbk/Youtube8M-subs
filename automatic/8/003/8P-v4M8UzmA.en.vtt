00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
formula to this I went ahead and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.580 
formula to this I went ahead and
measured<00:02:45.610> out<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.510> cap<00:02:46.780> fulls<00:02:47.079> of<00:02:47.319> the

measured out for cap fulls of the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.229 
measured out for cap fulls of the
developer<00:02:48.130> about<00:02:48.250> four<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.670> half<00:02:48.700> or<00:02:49.060> so

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
developer about four and a half or so

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.030
