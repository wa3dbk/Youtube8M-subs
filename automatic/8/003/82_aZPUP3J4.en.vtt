00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.809
 in the video 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.820
 on this occasion to distinguish here 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.580
 another trick to pass the second part 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.930
 of troops so good in this case what 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.120
 only one that we are going to show is there a 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.880
 sorcerer who has the ability to 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.760
 fire on the side of the sun 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.370
 the audiences what we are going to occupy and 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.050
 we are going to occupy a titan to happen to see 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.820
 they see that previously they had 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.850
 shown how to pass from the other side 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.530
 of equal flying with a sword is good 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.150
 if they want me to be a little bit still 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.699
 easier the only thing we need is a 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.530
 sorcerer and a titan can actually 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.820
 also be more sorcerers no more than 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.070
 everyone has to have the same 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.860
 ability the radiance what we're going to 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.630
 do is that good the titan as is the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.220
 that can fly a little bit higher is 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.710
 the one that will cross to the other side 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.110
 there is in this case it accompanies me good 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.000
 pablo without out there in the video and because 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.040
 we will teach how to do Notice 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.680
 there is the same part of what is the 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.650
 the bridge and was already arriving towards the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.300
 final part ok the only thing that has to 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.540
 to do is to hide and behind that as 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.250
 lamp and from there it does not have to be him 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.020
 absolutely nothing more than being 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.820
 waiting around that from this side 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.490
 kill all the monkeys that are in 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.810
 that side ok for the trick to work 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.220
 properly 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.200
 once the step for us a 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.520
 good man 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.610
 we have to do is to increase 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.500
 us to the precipice there is and we are going to 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.140
 appear until the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.409
 lackeys let's observe 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.060
 ok we already saw out there that they disappeared 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.100
 then we turn to 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.659
 revive and as you see on this side no longer 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.920
 there are lackeys and nothing else is the only thing that goes 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.649
 to be out there is going to be the portal 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.420
 swords but good with only his we see by 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.370
 here a stone with that and we avoid that 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.010
 he attacks us and we are going to do 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.560
 the work that is out there to destroy 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.180
 all the monkeys on that side that 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.580
 I recommend there, I tell them if they have 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.260
 more more players, well, everything is 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.709
 commit suicide and that only the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.900
 professor the pure sorcerers since for 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.940
 there of not doing it we run the risk of 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.190
 that totems are activated and therefore 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.680
 good and they know that we would die instantly 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.080
 so as you can see then 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.900
 the truth is that it is a very cliche 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.880
 simple to do we only need 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.890
 I tell the titan and we need a 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.160
 sorcerer or more sorcerers to pass 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.930
 that part faster in this case then 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.880
 well I got icebreaker because if 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.950
 I do not have to be buying more 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.550
 ammunition and that's why I was regenerating 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.850
 alone 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.640
 good as you see we are killing what 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.590
 it's the monkeys 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.350
 I'm going to put some speed 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.780
 about this matter because there we are going to 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.209
 take about 5 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.730
 minutes maybe a little more a 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.260
 little less killing enemies like that 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.360
 it's good for you not to have 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.980
 that winnow all this time there watching 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.660
 how he killed them, well, well, I 'm going 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.660
 to put some speed 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.060
 and I say good because if there lead 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.650
 more friends I do not know what to recommend to you 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.630
 those who are sincere, well, they are good 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.090
 the radio already know after that 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.770
 The lackeys disappear because if the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.940
 we do before because nothing is going to 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.640
 serve then 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.680
 that's going to be the way to do it and in is 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.630
 the trick and so good here as far as 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.400
 to be the final part of the video I'm going to 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.220
 put out there what they gave me for 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.730
 have passed this part so with what 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.790
 is the cliche, it should also be mentioned that 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.569
 also serves for level 33 and serves to 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.700
 level 30 in 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.459
 so that they want to do it the truth is 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.030
 that out there will come out that way so 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.709
 but so simple and so good then 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.780
 it makes me that I leave here for 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.159
 keep watching the video but 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.950
 more of the advance going up there 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.009
 more videos and hopefully out there more 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.739
 tricks of the other network also from 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.870
 atheists and for good I leave it here by 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.210
 moment and then we see each other until 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.210
 soon and goodbye thank you
