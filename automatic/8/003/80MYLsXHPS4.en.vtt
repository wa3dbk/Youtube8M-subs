at food compared to a year ago I don't

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.240 
at food compared to a year ago I don't
see<00:05:38.250> any<00:05:38.460> deflation<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.390> if<00:05:40.169> you<00:05:40.680> have<00:05:40.890> that

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
see any deflation and if you have that

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.719 
see any deflation and if you have that
week<00:05:41.970> and<00:05:42.270> economy<00:05:42.960> and<00:05:43.169> no<00:05:43.560> deflation<00:05:44.430> then<00:05:44.700> I

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
week and economy and no deflation then I

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.550 
week and economy and no deflation then I
think<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.270> when<00:05:45.479> the<00:05:45.690> economy<00:05:46.229> whenever

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
think that when the economy whenever

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.860 
think that when the economy whenever
that<00:05:46.800> is<00:05:46.830> will<00:05:47.310> recover<00:05:47.790> that<00:05:48.419> we<00:05:48.660> will<00:05:48.840> have

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
that is will recover that we will have

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.780 
that is will recover that we will have
actually<00:05:49.500> a<00:05:49.530> relatively<00:05:49.979> high<00:05:50.190> inflation

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
actually a relatively high inflation

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.450 
actually a relatively high inflation
rate<00:05:51.240> I<00:05:51.479> think<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:51.930> deflation<00:05:52.680> is<00:05:52.800> just<00:05:53.220> don't

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
rate I think the deflation is just don't

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.330 
rate I think the deflation is just don't
understand<00:05:54.120> anything<00:05:55.020> about<00:05:55.340> economics

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
understand anything about economics

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.230 
understand anything about economics
because<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:58.110> fact<00:05:58.410> that<00:05:58.710> the<00:05:59.010> flat<00:05:59.250> panel<00:05:59.760> TV

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
because the fact that the flat panel TV

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.600 
because the fact that the flat panel TV
price<00:06:00.900> goes<00:06:01.320> down<00:06:01.350> has<00:06:02.070> to<00:06:02.250> do<00:06:02.400> with

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
price goes down has to do with

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.300 
price goes down has to do with
technological<00:06:03.240> progress<00:06:03.840> and<00:06:04.290> has<00:06:04.890> to<00:06:05.130> do

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
technological progress and has to do

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.900 
technological progress and has to do
with<00:06:06.090> a<00:06:06.360> new<00:06:07.320> product<00:06:07.710> becoming<00:06:08.460> a<00:06:08.550> commodity

with a new product becoming a commodity

like a calculator in the 1980s was first
I<00:06:12.450> taken<00:06:13.020> then<00:06:13.200> it<00:06:13.320> becomes<00:06:13.740> a<00:06:13.890> commodity<00:06:14.460> or<00:06:14.580> a

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
I taken then it becomes a commodity or a

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.390 
I taken then it becomes a commodity or a

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
but that is not deflation because the

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.000 
but that is not deflation because the
money<00:06:20.220> supply<00:06:20.600> continues<00:06:21.600> to<00:06:21.900> rise<00:06:22.140> explode

00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.670 
I just like to highlight the problem

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.660 
I just like to highlight the problem
that<00:06:59.850> I<00:06:59.880> see<00:07:00.090> going<00:07:00.570> forward<00:07:01.160> there<00:07:02.160> will<00:07:02.220> be<00:07:02.640> a

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:02.670 
that I see going forward there will be a

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:05.600 
that I see going forward there will be a
time<00:07:03.030> when<00:07:03.780> the<00:07:04.320> Federal<00:07:04.620> Reserve<00:07:04.770> should

time when the Federal Reserve should

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.900 
time when the Federal Reserve should
increase<00:07:06.090> interest<00:07:06.570> rates<00:07:06.720> and<00:07:07.110> I<00:07:07.290> may<00:07:07.470> add

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
increase interest rates and I may add

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.200 
increase interest rates and I may add
that<00:07:08.910> this<00:07:09.150> happened<00:07:09.720> in<00:07:10.020> the<00:07:10.320> period<00:07:11.210> 2004

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
that this happened in the period 2004

that this happened in the period 2004

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.310 
June 2004 to August 2006 the Fed
increased<00:07:17.640> interest<00:07:18.090> rates<00:07:18.390> but<00:07:19.140> the

interest<00:07:39.060> rate<00:07:39.210> from<00:07:39.450> the<00:07:39.510> upside<00:07:40.080> lag<00:07:40.470> and<00:07:40.890> I

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.130 
interest rate from the upside lag and I

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.190 
interest rate from the upside lag and I
think<00:07:41.190> that<00:07:41.400> will<00:07:41.730> be<00:07:41.790> in<00:07:42.150> future<00:07:42.690> also<00:07:42.720> the

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.200 
think that will be in future also the

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.700 
think that will be in future also the
case<00:07:43.550> because<00:07:44.550> at<00:07:45.000> that<00:07:45.330> time<00:07:45.500> the<00:07:46.500> government

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.710 
case because at that time the government

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.540 
case because at that time the government
tect<00:07:47.370> will<00:07:47.670> have<00:07:47.880> exploded<00:07:48.450> and<00:07:48.980> the<00:07:49.980> deficits

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:50.550 
tect will have exploded and the deficits

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.030 
tect will have exploded and the deficits
will<00:07:50.850> probably<00:07:51.240> not<00:07:51.360> come<00:07:51.720> down<00:07:51.750> very<00:07:52.050> much<00:07:52.620> or

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:53.040 
will probably not come down very much or

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.840 
will probably not come down very much or
maybe<00:07:53.400> even<00:07:53.610> go<00:07:54.270> up<00:07:54.570> and<00:07:54.950> the<00:07:55.950> feds<00:07:56.280> will<00:07:56.580> own<00:07:56.820> a

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:56.850 
maybe even go up and the feds will own a

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.420 
maybe even go up and the feds will own a
lot<00:07:57.210> of<00:07:57.240> government<00:07:57.900> bonds<00:07:58.350> so<00:07:58.860> they<00:07:59.010> will<00:07:59.220> be

00:07:59.420 --> 00:07:59.430 
lot of government bonds so they will be

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.210 
lot of government bonds so they will be
very<00:07:59.670> relaxed
