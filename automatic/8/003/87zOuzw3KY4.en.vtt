00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 ok welcome to another 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.580
 fifa 13 skrodzki creator and today 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.990
 I would like to show you what for 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.240
 class silver games in the Bundesliga 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.160
 be on the way 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:20.070
 In the gate we have ralf ferryman of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.410
 Schalke 04 went to the boni 78 71 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.619
 So, safety is in the near future 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.160
 German faith 73 kicking so much 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.140
 good deals also and 81 reflexes to it 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.030
 good speed is at one today 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.050
 not decisive and in addition 69 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
 So positioning is also quite good 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.950
 in internal defense we have 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.129
 michael man's people from hamburger sv 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.989
 74 speed pace 72 participate 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.969
 and 80 header so very solid 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.399
 defense statistics on this very much 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.840
 fast as one can not so easily 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.210
 passing on the other center-back 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.250
 position we do not have the kind of man 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.140
 Here is his slide near 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.829
 freiburg in the game just not yet 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.409
 included is 74 ps 75 defend 79 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.900
 head balances yes i would say one 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.280
 Pieces even better than mons en 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.780
 because he just a much better 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.760
 defense value had the same speed 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.270
 is and only one bad in the header 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.110
 is on the back-to-back positions 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.720
 if have on the right side 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.049
 diekmeier from hamburger sv 90 ps has the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.970
 72 fit 372 dribble 70 participate 70 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.680
 so defensive by header 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.780
 his two statistics here on 70 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 very solid as well as offensive through 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.750
 his enormous speed is his good 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.420
 dribbling and also his good passes 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.340
 So also speak good flanks so the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.380
 optimal occupation for the right 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.000
 defender position on left we have 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.320
 then cristian molinaro there you could 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.869
 I also believe Chris has to take Leo 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.399
 But 85 ps is with the others 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.149
 statistics do not last as well as 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.119
 one in a row here to about 84 ps and 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.729
 74 still fit 74 dribble and 73 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.189
 defend so defensively this 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.619
 relatively high defense quite well and 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.990
 also obvious fit and dribble 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.990
 quite good in the defensive midfield 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.060
 then we have no idea how harvard 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.760
 it is still a long way from borussia 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.310
 defend Mönchengladbach with 72 78 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.620
 and 73 header 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.810
 again, so to speak, a supporting member in 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.670
 the defensive if you are a defender 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.260
 he should build a bit of joke 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.319
 his has good defense values 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.480
 Fast has a good fit too 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.770
 no offensive player there so extreme 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.569
 bad in shot and no great 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.239
 but dribbling is not for that 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.260
 because there we have completely different men 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.880
 in midfield then have me 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.140
 Maximilian Beister at hamburg 90 ps 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.180
 71 So the good thing is he is 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.920
 I believe left foot so only left foot 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.530
 So say if on the right side 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.180
 is also able to pull in and out 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.980
 with 170 were certainly synonymous times out 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.819
 deduct the distance because that is one 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.130
 class worth 74 dribble and 71 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.410
 so head in the penalty area with the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.000
 Head quite dangerous and not 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.880
 to write off on the left middle field 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.920
 position we have idea of ​​mainz 05 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.000
 so far, I think that was at union 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.880
 Berlin I'm not sure 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.410
 90 ps 74 about that the rest is not 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.390
 is not spectacular 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.530
 bad but nothing special there 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.750
 I'm not sure yet 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.660
 I should not use it sadly 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.250
 with its 87 ps 78 in it because that has 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.609
 Very good in the last game 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.620
 very quick to be very agile with 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.980
 So I really believe in equity and 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.989
 something over 90 so what more do you want 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.700
 so buzzing in the central offensive 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.220
 midfield we have zlatko 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:40.069
 junuzovic of bremen 76 ps 71 shoot 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.180
 73 fit and 78 dribble so now 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.829
 not necessarily the fastest but in 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.630
 good shot good passes still a good one 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.750
 hopefully also dribbling forster 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.519
 skills had been had then I think 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.299
 that will happen again 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.549
 Of course always good 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.430
 the storm top then form alexander 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.639
 alexander he is called so I know 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:03.980
 it does not have you alexander esswein 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:06.769
 with his glass will be 86 ps 71 75 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.180
 dribble and 74 header so what wants 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.220
 you spend more in a striker very quickly 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.780
 great shot good dribbling and also 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.850
 very good headballs with 74 and yes and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.880
 Then we come to the captain of this 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.260
 teams have giovanni sio here 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.180
 I now taken the cassio 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.620
 means yes 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.740
 In any case, I will not do it 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.110
 brazilian but i think franzose 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.340
 something like French or African 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.229
 land I 'm sure but anyway 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:39.180
 88 ps 74 let 70 fit 79 rebels 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.550
 so incredibly fast good third 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.199
 classic and also very good 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:49.259
 So bottlenecks so that was really 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:51.479
 outstanding and the team looks very good 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.680
 I will definitely build that 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.970
 this will probably be one of the first 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.800
 I'll do that and 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.570
 maybe that brazil team will become one 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.830
 but then see this is on everyone 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.690
 fall at the first of the two draws 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.039
 very very good with very fast 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.750
 players on the outside, respectively 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.340
 everywhere very fast 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.919
 home defense with good scores one 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.630
 class goalkeeper nordfeld the waste heat 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.919
 should hedge a bit and 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.199
 Junuzovic also not bad 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.020
 Parents are optional you can then too 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.900
 still giovanni sio by mike kanncke 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.210
 from Erzgebirge aue put that way 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.639
 a bit the German offensive 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.490
 93160 record this 65 63 on ball 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.340
 Silver player with a gold bronze 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.610
 player yes bronze with 61 is natural 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.139
 anything but bad 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.919
 and then you can zlatko 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.349
 Junuzovic 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.419
 that's why it's done by trochowski 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.130
 replace the silver one believes it 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:46.169
 not to be syllable with these values 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:48.210
 77 ps 80 in it 78 shoot 73 fit 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.479
 Remember, he really is 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.620
 silver with these values ​​that is sick 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.930
 whether it will remain in the end, of course 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.830
 is the question but if it is so 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.380
 remains in the values ​​are really 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.530
 Outstanding he also has 5star we could 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.970
 and for researches that applies that is true 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.820
 that would of course be an absolute mega 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.490
 player and the problem is if you have the 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.330
 now the uses to Giovanni sio then 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.380
 he only has i believe 7 or 6 kimi 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.759
 which is of course not so optimal and 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.250
 if you have two German ones next to it 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.020
 German rhine is used everywhere here 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.120
 which is very good and they fit too 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.530
 here again to Nordveidt because all 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.449
 from bundesliga are therefore there would be 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.979
 99 chemistry can come about again 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.389
 with just these two changes here 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.470
 In that case you should not just then 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.750
 to bring in sadly 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.180
 for idea there it is already important 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.620
 that there is still a German 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.180
 but all in all, this team sees 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.539
 As I said, very very very good 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.919
 So far, there have been very good ones 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:46.610
 bundesliga silver teams but not for a long time 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:49.520
 as good as this one here right here 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.410
 of course the star player with 88 ps 74 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.860
 also let it was a great apprentice 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:57.020
 very fast, a good shot 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.900
 really good team and i'm happy 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.830
 already on it to play with it 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.949
 and yes I just wanted you fast 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.889
 show how that can be in fifa 12 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:07.729
 13 then with this towering silver 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.650
 bundesliga team 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.150
 since he prefers a lot much anyway 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.570
 with silver teams as with gold teams 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.220
 games 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.699
 I've in the past game 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.990
 actually almost exclusively done 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:21.080
 That's it from today 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.710
 episode tomorrow will probably be one 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.960
 another duel against subscribers com 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.190
 this morning tomorrow, either tomorrow 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.210
 or the day after tomorrow that will show 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.210
 See you
