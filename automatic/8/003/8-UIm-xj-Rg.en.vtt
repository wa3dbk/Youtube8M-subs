00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.310

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.029
 cedar approves if you at least 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.890
 any experienced user then 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.960
 You probably know a bunch of applications that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.880
 work with various notifications 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.820
 but finally an application appeared 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.859
 which may well replace them all but 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.989
 even if not everything is really very 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.170
 many called on fox and this 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.300
 an application that provides you 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.989
 absolutely huge range of different 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.870

 your favorite show by results 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.579

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.250

 new comment on the raid tag when in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.710

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.990
 will help you to offer some 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.020
 notifications based on that to 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.090
 Generally highly recommended 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.299
 try to download the hooks can be on the link 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.299
 in description 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.740
 today's second application is 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.340
 the toy is here today we have them 2 and 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.350
 The first toy is called finger daughter 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.990
 you will need to be active 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.840
 use your finger here for more 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.729
 you do not need anything toys 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.060
 I personally immediately appeared to create 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.400
 some duet or something like that 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.750
 since here too on a dark background in 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.200
 what geometric in the world 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.370
 you are fighting a blue sphere against 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.740
 little red spheres and 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.090
 or rather to say all the circles that you 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.340
 need to do it hold your finger on 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.950
 blue circle and dodges 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.130
 red seems just really quite 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.490
 wrong and make it quite another 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.410
 time is hard enough other than that from 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.570
 the red ball flies constantly 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.300
 any blue nishtyaki you need 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.850
 pick up red you need to avoid 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.830
 the multiplier of your points depends on it 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.730
 here you need to earn as much as possible 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.440
 more points 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.040
 then different things will happen 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.489
 for example the red circle is divided into 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.250
 two or something else really cool and 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.140
 good time with good soundtrack and 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.680
 quite atmospheric on hand drawn 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.780
 graphics 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.780
 You can download the game by the link in the description 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.470
 and today's second game is not released 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.510
 about bbc itself and cause 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.880
 she has some nostalgia for this 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.460
 the oldest top gear since 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.070
 it is for this franchise that it is made 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.530
 promise tea she is trying to return 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.710
 attention to the top gear brand to say what 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.000
 all the clarkson is no longer needed you have 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.960
 mobile toy 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.380
 but even though we are despised for it no one 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.420
 prevents us from playing around and helping 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.970
 trailers to which we have developed 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.420
 persistent dislike for twenty s 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.790
 a little season in general gray goals 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.780
 run the machine which along with on 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.700
 You can choose different and wet it 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.550
 traders the more trailers you 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.890
 soak the better for help with this 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.210
 hard work you will be issued 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.280
 various tools like springs 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.170
 to further jump the wings to 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.980
 continue to fly or vice versa drove from 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.890
 to dive and wet trailers 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.870
 own toys it's pretty simple 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.310
 one that makes it unique 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.410
 top gear armor 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.620
 but here if you want to be nostalgic 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.840
