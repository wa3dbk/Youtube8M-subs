00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.149 
a look at him in truck mode I got a say
for<00:01:15.159> a<00:01:15.400> smaller<00:01:15.790> version<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.390> Prime<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
for a smaller version of Prime it

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.010 
for a smaller version of Prime it
doesn't<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.790> mean<00:01:19.030> it's<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:20.409> not<00:01:20.560> perfect<00:01:22.020> but

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
doesn't I mean it's it's not perfect but

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.530 
doesn't I mean it's it's not perfect but
for<00:01:23.409> what's<00:01:23.590> involved<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:24.610> transforming<00:01:25.390> him

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
for what's involved and transforming him

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.960 
for what's involved and transforming him
to<00:01:26.079> make<00:01:26.380> him<00:01:26.530> accurate<00:01:26.979> enough<00:01:27.189> at<00:01:27.369> in<00:01:27.550> robot

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
to make him accurate enough at in robot

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.420 
to make him accurate enough at in robot
mode<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.810> guess<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.470> had<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.860> sacrifice<00:01:30.100> a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
mode I guess you had to sacrifice a

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.270 
mode I guess you had to sacrifice a
little<00:01:30.730> bit<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.150> truck<00:01:31.420> but<00:01:31.659> all<00:01:32.440> in<00:01:33.130> all

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
little bit of the truck but all in all

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.640 
little bit of the truck but all in all
though<00:01:33.550> the<00:01:34.240> truck<00:01:34.540> mode<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.930> still<00:01:35.230> pretty

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
though the truck mode is still pretty

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.340 
though the truck mode is still pretty
solid<00:01:36.270> you've<00:01:37.270> still<00:01:37.540> got<00:01:37.690> all<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.900> elements

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
solid you've still got all the elements

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.210 
solid you've still got all the elements
that<00:01:38.470> make<00:01:38.710> up<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:39.580> course<00:01:39.820> Optimus<00:01:40.240> Prime

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that make up of course Optimus Prime

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.170 
that make up of course Optimus Prime
sirens<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:42.340> everything<00:01:42.580> else<00:01:42.700> on<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:42.970> top

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
there again not one of the best vehicle

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.370

arms<00:02:30.580> again<00:02:30.730> make<00:02:30.970> sure<00:02:31.090> his<00:02:31.239> arms<00:02:31.269> are<00:02:31.690> all

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
arms again make sure his arms are all

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.450 
arms again make sure his arms are all
unraveled

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
unraveled

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.150 
unraveled
there<00:02:36.460> you<00:02:36.550> go<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:38.050> separate<00:02:38.530> those<00:02:38.740> legs

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
there you go and separate those legs

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.790 
there you go and separate those legs
bring<00:02:40.030> out<00:02:40.150> his<00:02:40.360> feet<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:43.020> then<00:02:44.020> just<00:02:44.470> fold

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
bring out his feet and then just fold

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:56.970 
bring out his feet and then just fold
over<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.460> tires<00:02:45.820> here<00:02:54.060> there<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.180> go<00:02:55.980> and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
over the tires here there you go and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.870 
over the tires here there you go and
there<00:02:57.970> we<00:02:58.060> go<00:02:59.130> yeah<00:03:00.130> just<00:03:00.400> like<00:03:00.490> that<00:03:00.550> you've

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
there we go yeah just like that you've

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.960 
there we go yeah just like that you've
got<00:03:01.060> yourself<00:03:01.450> Optimus<00:03:02.050> Prime

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
got yourself Optimus Prime

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.510 
got yourself Optimus Prime
yes<00:03:03.970> not<00:03:04.300> completely<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.050> would<00:03:05.290> say<00:03:05.520> fully

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
yes not completely I would say fully

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.430 
yes not completely I would say fully
activated<00:03:07.150> it's<00:03:07.780> not<00:03:07.930> like<00:03:08.110> some<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.380> the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
activated it's not like some of the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.140 
activated it's not like some of the
others<00:03:08.650> where<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.160> can<00:03:09.370> just<00:03:09.520> easily<00:03:09.730> press

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
others where you can just easily press

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.730 
others where you can just easily press
the<00:03:10.330> button<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.980> Prime<00:03:11.980> completely<00:03:12.580> opens<00:03:12.970> up

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
the button and Prime completely opens up

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.160 
the button and Prime completely opens up
but<00:03:14.740> still<00:03:15.690> makes<00:03:16.690> for<00:03:16.870> an<00:03:16.930> easy

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
but still makes for an easy

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.130 
but still makes for an easy
transformation<00:03:18.150> certainly<00:03:19.150> add<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.840> bit<00:03:19.990> of<00:03:20.050> a

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
transformation certainly add a bit of a

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.830 
transformation certainly add a bit of a
problem<00:03:20.380> where<00:03:20.470> it's<00:03:20.620> sagged<00:03:20.920> on<00:03:21.100> me<00:03:21.280> but<00:03:21.840> in

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
problem where it's sagged on me but in

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.570 
problem where it's sagged on me but in
robot<00:03:23.200> mode<00:03:23.230> he<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.740> very<00:03:24.190> very<00:03:24.490> nice

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
robot mode he is very very nice

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.040 
robot mode he is very very nice
his<00:03:27.580> articulation<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.750> he's<00:03:28.840> got<00:03:29.020> a

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
his articulation is that he's got a

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.140 
his articulation is that he's got a
rotation<00:03:29.560> in<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.770> head<00:03:29.980> it's<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.120> a

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
rotation in the head it's on a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.320 
rotation in the head it's on a
ball-joint<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:32.680> can<00:03:32.800> rotate<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.280> arms<00:03:33.640> you

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
ball-joint you can rotate the arms you

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.980 
ball-joint you can rotate the arms you
bend<00:03:34.570> at<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.720> elbow<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:37.090> also<00:03:37.420> rotate<00:03:37.840> them

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
bend at the elbow you also rotate them

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.340 
bend at the elbow you also rotate them
as<00:03:38.140> well<00:03:38.910> no<00:03:39.910> waist<00:03:40.210> articulation<00:03:40.420> but<00:03:41.200> you

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
as well no waist articulation but you

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.810 
as well no waist articulation but you
can<00:03:41.470> bend<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.710> legs<00:03:41.890> out<00:03:42.130> you've<00:03:42.490> been<00:03:42.700> the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
can bend the legs out you've been the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.400 
can bend the legs out you've been the
knees

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
knees

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.920 
knees
you<00:03:44.410> bend<00:03:44.650> feet<00:03:44.860> slightly<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:48.600> would<00:03:49.600> say<00:03:49.750> not

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
you bend feet slightly I would say not

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.700 
you bend feet slightly I would say not
necessarily<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.590> great<00:03:50.980> vehicle<00:03:51.580> mode<00:03:52.710> there

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
necessarily a great vehicle mode there

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.280 
necessarily a great vehicle mode there
are<00:03:53.740> better<00:03:54.220> Prime's<00:03:54.640> out<00:03:54.880> there<00:03:55.180> but<00:03:55.870> again

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
are better Prime's out there but again

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.770 
are better Prime's out there but again
being<00:03:56.770> that<00:03:56.860> it's<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.340> simplified<00:03:58.120> activator

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
being that it's a simplified activator

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.430 
being that it's a simplified activator
it<00:03:59.770> does<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.040> pretty<00:04:00.520> good<00:04:00.760> job<00:04:00.970> I<00:04:01.690> would<00:04:02.200> say<00:04:02.350> it

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
it does a pretty good job I would say it

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.340 
it does a pretty good job I would say it
does<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.620> pretty<00:04:02.890> good<00:04:02.980> job<00:04:04.110> just<00:04:05.110> bring<00:04:05.260> out

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
does a pretty good job just bring out

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.910 
does a pretty good job just bring out
the<00:04:05.470> hands<00:04:05.680> therefore<00:04:06.130> there<00:04:06.340> we<00:04:06.430> go<00:04:07.620> if<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.770> can

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
the hands therefore there we go if I can

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.430 
the hands therefore there we go if I can
give<00:04:09.100> Prime<00:04:09.820> here<00:04:10.120> any<00:04:10.300> sort<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.840> grade<00:04:11.140> I

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
give Prime here any sort of a grade I

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.790 
give Prime here any sort of a grade I
would<00:04:11.590> probably<00:04:11.830> give<00:04:12.100> them<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.460> 6.5<00:04:13.330> I<00:04:13.800> really

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
would probably give them a 6.5 I really

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.910 
would probably give them a 6.5 I really
like<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.070> robot<00:04:15.400> mode<00:04:16.380> not<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.410> super

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
like the robot mode not a super

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.450 
like the robot mode not a super
simplistic<00:04:18.630> activation<00:04:19.630> but<00:04:20.290> still<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:20.890> pretty

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
simplistic activation but still a pretty

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:28.710 
simplistic activation but still a pretty
well-rounded<00:04:23.130> transformer<00:04:24.130> to<00:04:24.310> own<00:04:27.660> there<00:04:28.660> we

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
well-rounded transformer to own there we

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
well-rounded transformer to own there we
go<00:04:29.280> today's<00:04:30.280> toys<00:04:30.520> ba<00:04:30.820> we<00:04:31.030> were<00:04:31.150> having<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.510> look
