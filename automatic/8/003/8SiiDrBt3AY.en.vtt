look at how I knew that if you go to his

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.690 
look at how I knew that if you go to his
website<00:00:47.809> example<00:00:48.809> his<00:00:49.800> main<00:00:50.010> channels<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
website example his main channels you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.750 
website example his main channels you
can<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:51.149> here<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:51.840> how<00:00:52.050> much<00:00:52.430> viewer<00:00:53.430> he

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
can see here that's how much viewer he

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.170 
can see here that's how much viewer he
have<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:55.170> far<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.160> knowing<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.579> if<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.059> look

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
have so far so knowing that if you look

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.200 
have so far so knowing that if you look
at<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.329> estimate<00:00:58.579> taking<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> low<00:00:59.789> end<00:00:59.969> like

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
at the estimate taking the low end like

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.520 
at the estimate taking the low end like
let's<00:01:00.390> say<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.570> assume<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.079> two<00:01:01.230> dollars

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
let's say you assume you get two dollars

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.139 
let's say you assume you get two dollars
per<00:01:01.680> thousand<00:01:02.160> view<00:01:02.280> he<00:01:02.789> would<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:02.940> made

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
per thousand view he would have made

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
per thousand view he would have made
close<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.449> two<00:01:03.750> million<00:01:03.960> dollars<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.680> see

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
close to two million dollars you can see

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.679 
close to two million dollars you can see
that<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> high-end<00:01:06.000> viola<00:01:06.479> say<00:01:06.600> he

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
that and in the high-end viola say he

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.810 
that and in the high-end viola say he
makes<00:01:06.869> six<00:01:07.200> dollars<00:01:07.500> per<00:01:07.530> thousand<00:01:08.220> view<00:01:08.400> he

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
makes six dollars per thousand view he

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.910 
makes six dollars per thousand view he
would<00:01:08.970> make<00:01:09.119> closest<00:01:09.479> six<00:01:10.200> million<00:01:10.560> dollars

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
would make closest six million dollars

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.670 
would make closest six million dollars
okay<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:12.119> two<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.900> six<00:01:13.290> million<00:01:13.619> i'm

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
okay from two to six million i'm

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.200 
okay from two to six million i'm
thinking<00:01:14.010> somewhere<00:01:14.220> between<00:01:14.520> three<00:01:14.909> million

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
thinking somewhere between three million

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.300 
thinking somewhere between three million
dollars<00:01:15.570> i<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:16.650> that's<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.250> of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
dollars i know that's kind of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
dollars i know that's kind of
far-fetched<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.270> honest<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.780> i<00:01:18.930> can

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
far-fetched but to be honest you i can

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.560 
far-fetched but to be honest you i can
tell<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:19.920> probably<00:01:20.340> factual<00:01:20.939> but

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
tell you that's probably factual but

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.910 
tell you that's probably factual but

then<00:02:14.130> fam<00:02:15.200> she<00:02:16.200> has<00:02:16.410> over<00:02:18.830> 476<00:02:19.830> million

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
then fam she has over 476 million

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.920 
then fam she has over 476 million
930,000<00:02:22.050> 106<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.730> her<00:02:23.940> estimate<00:02:24.390> earning<00:02:24.810> in

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
930,000 106 so her estimate earning in

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.260 
930,000 106 so her estimate earning in
the<00:02:25.020> low<00:02:25.140> end<00:02:25.380> would<00:02:25.680> be<00:02:25.890> around<00:02:26.400> nine<00:02:26.850> hundred

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
the low end would be around nine hundred

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.150 
the low end would be around nine hundred
and<00:02:27.300> fifty<00:02:27.840> seven<00:02:28.290> thousand<00:02:28.890> eight<00:02:29.040> hundred

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
and fifty seven thousand eight hundred

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.130 
and fifty seven thousand eight hundred
sixty<00:02:29.970> dollars<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.990> all<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.710> way<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:32.480> 2.8<00:02:33.480> or

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
sixty dollars to all the way to 2.8 or

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.680 
sixty dollars to all the way to 2.8 or
2.9<00:02:34.620> million<00:02:34.890> so<00:02:35.610> i<00:02:35.640> would<00:02:35.880> say<00:02:36.030> around<00:02:36.120> over

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
2.9 million so i would say around over

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.670 
2.9 million so i would say around over

1.5 million on an average gain lisanova

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.410 
1.5 million on an average gain lisanova

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.070 
around 350,000 all the way to 1 million
so<00:02:52.140> i'm<00:02:52.260> thinking<00:02:52.290> somewhere<00:02:52.770> between

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
dollars now let's look at you what would

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.480 
dollars now let's look at you what would
you<00:03:38.190> have<00:03:38.280> earned<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:39.360> if<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:40.200> joined<00:03:41.190> and

you have earned you if you joined and
let's<00:03:42.060> say<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.240> could<00:03:42.450> join<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.960> partnership

let's say you could join the partnership
and<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:43.980> got<00:03:44.760> your<00:03:44.910> first<00:03:45.150> hundred<00:03:45.480> thousand

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990

and you got your first hundred thousand
view<00:03:46.230> hits<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:47.160> would<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:47.400> got<00:03:47.580> about<00:03:47.760> two

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
view hits you would have got about two

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.220 
view hits you would have got about two
hundred<00:03:48.150> dollars<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.810> know<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.110> doesn't

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
hundred dollars I know that doesn't

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.470 
hundred dollars I know that doesn't
sound<00:03:49.470> much<00:03:49.710> right<00:03:50.520> that's<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.880> low<00:03:51.030> end<00:03:51.300> of

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
sound much right that's a low end of

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.850 
sound much right that's a low end of
course<00:03:51.690> estimate<00:03:52.110> but<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.650> could

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
course estimate but that could

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.770 
course estimate but that could
potentially<00:03:53.160> reach<00:03:53.850> all<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.270> way<00:03:54.300> to<00:03:54.450> six

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
potentially reach all the way to six
