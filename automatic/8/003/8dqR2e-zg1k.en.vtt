00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
to create the nest you can use a variety

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.640 
to create the nest you can use a variety
of<00:00:25.490> materials<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:26.630> base<00:00:26.900> I<00:00:27.140> like<00:00:27.320> to<00:00:27.470> work

that you love can be used to create a
nest

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.730 

to<00:00:53.890> begin<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.370> nest<00:00:54.670> determine<00:00:55.570> how<00:00:55.870> wide<00:00:56.320> you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
to begin the nest determine how wide you

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.090 
to begin the nest determine how wide you
want<00:00:56.770> it<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.250> be<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.760> create<00:00:58.630> a<00:00:58.900> circle<00:00:59.530> and

want it to be and create a circle and

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.790 
want it to be and create a circle and
this<00:01:00.250> begins<00:01:00.580> the<00:01:00.820> outer<00:01:01.090> parameter<00:01:01.900> then

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
this begins the outer parameter then

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.370 
this begins the outer parameter then
determine<00:01:03.370> how<00:01:03.400> deep<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:04.510> want<00:01:04.540> your<00:01:04.900> nest<00:01:05.140> to

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
be cutting pieces of additional wire

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.560 
be cutting pieces of additional wire
that<00:01:08.170> are<00:01:08.290> going<00:01:08.410> to<00:01:08.470> attach<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.250> base

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that are going to attach to the base

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.650 
that are going to attach to the base
then<00:01:10.570> do<00:01:11.170> two<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.650> those<00:01:12.150> creating<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.390> base

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
then do two of those creating the base

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.219 
then do two of those creating the base
with<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.260> ring<00:01:14.470> around<00:01:15.120> two<00:01:16.120> and<00:01:16.450> then<00:01:17.200> just

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
with the ring around two and then just

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.290 
with the ring around two and then just
weave<00:01:17.620> one<00:01:18.010> more<00:01:18.250> connector<00:01:18.760> at<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.970> middle

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
weave one more connector at the middle

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.570 
weave one more connector at the middle
and<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.870> have<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.260> perfect<00:01:20.440> start<00:01:20.979> for<00:01:21.220> your

and you have the perfect start for your

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.160 
and you have the perfect start for your
nest

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.010 

then<00:01:28.159> just<00:01:28.610> add<00:01:28.909> additional<00:01:29.479> materials

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
then just add additional materials

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.380 
then just add additional materials
whatever<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:30.650> desire<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.729> caning<00:01:32.240> is

whatever you desire the caning is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.499 
whatever you desire the caning is
wonderful<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.439> it<00:01:33.530> weaves<00:01:33.770> in<00:01:34.040> nicely<00:01:34.610> cut<00:01:35.360> it

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
wonderful and it weaves in nicely cut it

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.359 
wonderful and it weaves in nicely cut it
down<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.290> don't<00:01:36.439> have<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.649> thread<00:01:36.979> too

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
down so you don't have to thread too

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.359 
down so you don't have to thread too
much<00:01:37.610> through<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:38.000> once<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.540> then<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:39.619> feed

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
much through it once and then just feed

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.969 
much through it once and then just feed
it<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:40.729> over-under<00:01:41.630> over-under<00:01:41.979> thinking

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
it in over-under over-under thinking

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.639 
it in over-under over-under thinking
back<00:01:43.190> like<00:01:43.460> when<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.729> were<00:01:43.820> in<00:01:43.940> kindergarten

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
back like when you were in kindergarten

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.370 
back like when you were in kindergarten
weaving<00:01:45.649> it<00:01:45.770> through<00:01:46.899> bring<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.020> back<00:01:48.200> from

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
weaving it through bring it back from

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.219 
weaving it through bring it back from
the<00:01:48.560> other<00:01:48.710> side<00:01:49.330> again<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.539> doesn't<00:01:50.720> have<00:01:50.869> to

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
the other side again it doesn't have to

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.440 
the other side again it doesn't have to
be<00:01:51.380> perfect<00:01:51.950> you'd<00:01:52.399> be<00:01:52.490> kind<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:52.789> wild<00:01:53.270> and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
be perfect you'd be kind of wild and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.320 
be perfect you'd be kind of wild and
messy<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.110> then<00:01:54.890> wherever<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.580> want<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:56.060> lock

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
messy and then wherever you want to lock

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.770 
messy and then wherever you want to lock
it<00:01:56.360> just<00:01:57.289> a<00:01:57.380> bit<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.860> bind<00:01:58.130> wire<00:02:01.690> lashing<00:02:02.690> it

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
it just a bit of bind wire lashing it

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.779 
it just a bit of bind wire lashing it
together<00:02:03.200> then<00:02:03.890> go<00:02:04.039> back<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.460> another

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
together then go back to another

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.289 
together then go back to another
material<00:02:05.240> be<00:02:06.200> at<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.409> curly<00:02:06.799> willow<00:02:07.299> weaving
