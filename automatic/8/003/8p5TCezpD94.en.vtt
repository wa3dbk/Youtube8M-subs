00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 talk with beauty and let's give 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.339
 a test explanation for you to see that the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.099
 Staff with Lula yesterday what quality to 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.820
 people tested gta5 to give 60 frames in 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.120
 A 4k x 970 then okay we're with 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.590
 our bench and the gtx 970 g20 force do not 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.590
 is a model of a model game of the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.680
 uniform only 16 gb of memory and 7 47 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.779
 90 km to motherboard gigabyte 1917 xsl tá 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.529
 and the configuration that we did the test 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.849
 is here on the screen for you 4k 3,840 for 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.009
 2 160 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.200
 You can keep track of what you need. 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.739
 off is right will emphasize that it 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.559
 want to buy any video card 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.230
 1979 390 x and run 10 females just bounce 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.180
 here 18 is in 4 cactus nor can 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.100
 jeitão run each can play in 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.079
 quality key in your house 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.879
 but our test text was done in this 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.680
 quality you are seeing here 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.899
 is high which was pretty cool to which 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 Accuse me of bent, is that it? 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.180
 and here in the advanced graphs everything 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.470
 off what to do a standard good 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.060
 remembering that people are doing 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.640
 for the first time here we always 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.220
 makes three Russians and we divide by three 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.229
 to make the general average is our best 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.119
 how it works here we use the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.670
 flex in the corner, you are seeing the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.409
 people press f11 on the last part of this 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.450
 benchmark on the match in the next logo 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.580
 after that city is where the people 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.979
 makes us feel good we did not 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.450
 otherwise our methodology this 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.920
 so if you compare with some 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.020
 something has to be in this 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.360
 methodology does not like comparing 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.229
 pasta with banana and apple beginning to see 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.720
 Which one is the best? 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.280
 I think that's the logic, then. 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 When it arrives in that part there the squeeze 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.869
 f11 he starts doing the computing 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.850
 brakes and at the end of the explosion 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.560
 with the truck and a new grip for 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.049
 determine the benfiquista then from here 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.520
 you will not see where we do 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.250
 This is how to do this part. 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 dark because it will break the whole average 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.420
 has no way 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.280
 and that part we thought the weight 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.380
 quite a few on the sale options at the beginning each 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.780
 one gives a damn normally at the beginning of the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.479
 night in the mine and is already over 60 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.970
 frames at various times at 14 with 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:17.520
 only a 970 only has 4 GB of memory, right? 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.720
 o pf 11 started already disappeared from the corner and 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.640
 Now you 'll do it when you get 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.430
 last part there usually always here 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.260
 of our minimal already there then remembering 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.540
 what are we doing the first time? 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.610
 we do three times must add up and 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.230
 divided by three pan from the mean to the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.030
 my average maximum average for 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.800
 You these results that we go through 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.980
 so for you always when people 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.340
 It is there that you have created personal confusion and 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.600
 never 1909 170 rotate in 4k 60 frames 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.910
 60 frames 80 front reached peak 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.530
 then you ride smoothly is like me 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.730
 I told the staff to go back there in 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:57.330
 house in an excellent da gda and activate everything 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.340
 at most it does not spin exactly if each 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.770
 one think you have to limit the way to 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.600
 our intention of the test was low 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.570
 configuration according to the said board 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.800
 who was testing a tea to play play 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.800
 exactly simple 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.350
 the staff seems to like board 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.540
 not to play the game is I think sometimes the 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.519
 which gives the impression that only 70 front 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.290
 so it's going from 60 to the staff 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.600
 Are you saying that it does not happen? 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.670
 close will have a discrepancy because 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.980
 comes close to leaving or is not there 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.140
 response from 60 crimes is 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.280
 practiced each site in its methodology 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.989
 it is also no comparison methodologies 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.920
 equal only We always say that our 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.920
 technology is this 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.630
 This is because the other methodology 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.950
 already has f4 technology in the channel that 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.840
 give a look you can look and also 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.580
 we have recorded it is already how we people 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.380
 already done several tests in this part 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.340
 several parts you know here that 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.019
 we do 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.850
 is rolling verses in the channel of a 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.049
 several other processor you can 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.730
 accompany the channel also in this 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.830
 gt part in this is how we do the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.049
 route almost at the end when 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.239
 arrive from the explosion I wait and squeeze 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.209
 the phone 11 to stop because after the 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.860
 black screen under many frames f11 opera 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.010
 You can see now you came back there. 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.660
 corner and 203 can not leave this 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.590
 black screen if leaving this black screen 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.000
 breaks any average of the minimum frames 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.849
 he also told me to press f 11 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.740
 before the black screen is clear 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.599
 now I'm going to leave the game here to pick up 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.069
 You're going to let it go wrong now. 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.150
 problem is before 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:34.349
 remembering that we did it only once 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.870
 now you get there look how nice people 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:45.210
 check the file that we have made here 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:47.220
 close so here is here O car right 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.020
 If this is so, it's better here. 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:55.110
 first round or minimum of 37 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.880
 58,810 9 59 and maximum of 77 the first 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.900
 Street then what happens in the second as 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.759
 past 40 here gave 80 and 65 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.500
 You add up and do not divide it. 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.300
 three times we are three times for three 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.659
 this global average that we do 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.520
 so it's there half way running at 58 frames 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:13.050
 point on the first street 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.479
 Monday, when it does, it will go up a bit. 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.889
 all neighborhoods work that way 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.630
 gives a little more performance in the 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.840
 second or third time you drive right 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.380
 It's a clock radio that always works 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.150
 like this 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.509
 But it's just to get the staff out there. 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.860
 maximum of 77 average of 59 so you 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.990
 they can also at ease as we speak 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.789
 if you want to run at 10 frames you 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.270
 can do 10/3 boot all 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:38.130
 then the mode played in 4k 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.570
 People thought this board was this one then. 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.009
 just to make it crystal clear 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.139
 world that just wanted to know how it was done 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.800
 the test was done in this way in both 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.389
 plates 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.340
 I hope you can understand now 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.320
 who was in doubt how it had been 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.479
 I got it right now because I think 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.639
 that more drawn than this is only going 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.710
 take a picture draw write part 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.909
 from you will understand then 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.139
 This leaves the cell phone that was in the 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:59.520
 car to not lose any video 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.039
 I believe thank you 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.360
 Do not forget that, I wanted to thank you 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.099
 first in the first 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.130
 finally finally leaving finally 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.599
 to the 3 thousand and lava and smoke of likes that 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.819
 gave yesterday's video many thanks to 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.069
 all of you who have seen the test that 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:16.800
 let Tarshis 3 thousand make the 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:18.060
 Testing Exactly 70's Stolen in 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.310
 truth will weigh 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.750
 so you three thousand and many thanks 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.900
 same portal supporting us to watch 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.099
 National 70 can apply powder 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.139
 Paulo 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.150
 I'm not denying that 70 well 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.770
 relevant to 3 thousand then our public 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.750
 is thanks to you that even in 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.250
 accompanied and trusted our tests 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.050
 What is there when we get someone to stay? 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.610
 With some doubt, we can 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.600
 show you smoothly that 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.280
 people have time 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.650
 we have all the possible hardware to 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.650
 test for 60 thank you very much it was
