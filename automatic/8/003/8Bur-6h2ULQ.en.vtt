last<00:02:29.030> but<00:02:29.270> not<00:02:29.300> least<00:02:29.420> we're<00:02:29.840> going<00:02:29.960> to<00:02:30.140> work

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
last but not least we're going to work

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.560 
last but not least we're going to work
on<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.650> thumbnail<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.580> took<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.820> black<00:02:32.210> nail

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
on the thumbnail and I took a black nail

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.170 
on the thumbnail and I took a black nail
art<00:02:32.900> polish<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.650> with<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.370> I<00:02:34.610> just<00:02:34.910> made

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
art polish and with this I just made

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.530 
art polish and with this I just made
some<00:02:35.450> thick<00:02:35.960> black<00:02:36.410> framed<00:02:36.860> glasses<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.820> it

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
some thick black framed glasses and it

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:48.870 
some thick black framed glasses and it
looks<00:02:38.810> something<00:02:39.080> like<00:02:39.350> this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.640 

to<00:02:49.880> fill<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.300> space<00:02:50.540> on<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.900> thumb<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.380> just

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
to fill in the space on the thumb I just

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.860 
to fill in the space on the thumb I just
used<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:52.040> blue<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:52.700> gold<00:02:53.030> glitter<00:02:53.390> polish

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
used the blue and gold glitter polish

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.860 
used the blue and gold glitter polish
from<00:02:54.170> our<00:02:54.530> previous<00:02:55.250> nails<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.120> I<00:02:56.420> made<00:02:56.630> some

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
from our previous nails and I made some

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.890 
from our previous nails and I made some
polka<00:02:57.050> dots<00:02:57.290> on<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.680> thumbnail

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.600 

the<00:03:01.900> last<00:03:02.080> step<00:03:02.349> is<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.650> obviously<00:03:02.739> add<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> top

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
the last step is to obviously add a top

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.339 
the last step is to obviously add a top
coat<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.120> then<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.689> have<00:03:04.900> your<00:03:05.110> finished

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
coat and then you have your finished

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.739 
coat and then you have your finished
product
