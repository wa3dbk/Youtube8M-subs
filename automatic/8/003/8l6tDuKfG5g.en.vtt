00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello here today come to a new one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.970
 video of me and that is it today and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.220
 three things first which one to you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.190
 give tip as the hairstyles better 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.320
 Keep that means like your hairpin or 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.080
 hairclips better to hold the hair 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.240
 and then two simple hairstyles 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.189
 full positive because you have 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.949
 you can not have a French braid 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.529
 just have to be able to cover and the whole thing 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.480
 I will now show you theirs 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.310
 hamm ahlen and the hair clips the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.679
 hairstyle also needs to withstand the one 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.899
 kitchen towel then the hall and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.700
 hair clips and hairspray the step 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.110
 is not compulsory however he brings 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.600
 I have to say really very much 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.730
 the part of the made over the fishing cloth and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.950
 afterwards she sprayed with hairspray on 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.360
 best with a very strong and then 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.280
 they are shaken up a bit and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.379
 the whole thing repeats the three or so 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.329
 up to four times and then you should 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:59.609
 really quite physics with the hairstyle 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.949
 three will begin for the first break 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.220
 braided quite simple braids and indeed 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.020
 will be the first in with me behind the head 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.090
 jumped braced and with the almost 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.060
 complete deckhair and that will be 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.840
 Also with a small thin rubber 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.880
 tied down you will find the rubbers 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.439
 Actually pretty much in her shop 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.640
 moment I have mine from the clergy and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.659
 of course, should the best your 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.479
 to be hair color 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.570
 the next stop that we continue to see 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.440
 right below the blanket hair and the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.720
 third will be then 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.520
 braided over the top, so to speak 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.280
 Last hair from the side on the arm 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.960
 and then the braid becomes something 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.490
 braided further to the left should really 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.620
 make sure that you tried stripping 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.410
 to take the final consonance 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.420
 because he is plaited plait yet 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.250
 otherwise it might be short 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.440
 when you're done, that's the first one 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.520
 Variant already to the end and the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.110
 you can then hair to the side 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.870
 take and the whole looks then 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.700
 In the end, that is one thing 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.930
 very nice hairstyle that has a lot of effect 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.270
 although not much done 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.340
 was found the whole still something 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.230
 messy you should have the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.600
 So the rest of the game fell 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.790
 again divided into three parts and 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.470
 then just down normal 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.420
 braid and again with a thin one 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.310
 fasten rubber and something else 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.740
 pull apart some volume 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.930
 in the whole thing comes in and then 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.100
 is also the second alternative of this 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.100
 Hairstyle already done 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.370
 in the second hairstyle will take a first 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.110
 normal job so a normal 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.430
 ponytail start approximately in the middle 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.170
 Of course you can do that too 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.660
 that means either higher or higher 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.270
 make it deeper and then it will be the beginning 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.090
 the braid pulled something apart and 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.100
 then the whole pot is going down from below 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.780
 pulled up with the rest of hair 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.870
 Now slow down a bit so you can 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.700
 something more clearly recognizes the parts I 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.110
 in three parts depending on many hair 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.840
 It could also split four parts 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.310
 and the rest are then individually 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.390
 braided means that you then 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.300
 finally in the hairstyle so to speak in 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.840
 this rest h3 braided pigtails from 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.250
 or 49 would suit me 32 would have 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.180
 can rapidly that I make 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.300
 a matter of taste 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.890
 if you have finished then so 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.830
 as I am here now you can still last 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.800
 aspire to the real zuckeln and then the 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.870
 three-headed the rear have something 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.790
 pinning and that will be for it again 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.150
 a rubber is needed and the three digits 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.910
 tied down and then become 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.830
 put the ends of the hair inside 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.200
 that is, you turn them, so to speak, once 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.330
 after in and then put them down 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.950
 below and then you can yours 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.330
 Hair clips or hairpin 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.790
 I personally prefer to use 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.010
 hairclips so you can then this 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.000
 Dutt this and similar structures again 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.000
 cling 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.360
 more 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.000
 Now this is the second finished try 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.260
 if you can do that, you can 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.840
 Of course I like pictures 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.459
