 in the middle of the natural green of the 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.480
 mountains of the west of caldas in the 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.930

 a rural area where the 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.000
 trapiches and the sweet aroma of 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.400
 Panela in the environment is born 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.289
 several years a musical experience that 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.360
 with the name of parranda show has 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.240
 persevered in time to do in 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.130
 currently one of the groupings 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.270
 more solid artistic and with projection 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.270
 region of 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.780
 Y 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.470
 randazzo is an orchestra that comes 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.110
 approximately 13 years ago 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.270
 was formed by family with the 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.310
 Over the years and without moving 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.120
 as a group and initially as I say 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.800
 they were and the famous joselito and with 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.080
 letters with those of time 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.740
 it's already formed as an orchestra what it is today 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.740
 for randazzo 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.930
 We have been at the manizales fair 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.730
 we've been doing at parties 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.950
 ovando we have been at the party of the 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.170
 collation in the resolution parties in 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.420
 the devil of the carnival and in many 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.180
 parts of Colombia in Cali and then man 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.650
 with look if God wants possibly not 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.370
 later because not at the level 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.370
 international too 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.810
 is a collective largely integrated 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.210
 for the same peasant family that with 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.850
 discipline was devoted to rehearse in the middle 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.250
 of the trapiche reaching a high level 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.360
 musical to the point that it became 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.160
 one of the most 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.500
 significant genres of music 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.270
 tropical with empiricism but with 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.310
 dedication this collective has 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.320
 artistically strengthened they have already 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.330
 made some recordings with themes 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.760
 themselves and have participated in multiple 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.550
 events in various places where they leave 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.220
 footprint with its simplicity but with great 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.380
 musical style what denotes as the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.720
 agricultural man outside of cultivating the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.450
 land can project its talent without 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.910
 abandon and ignore its origins as 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.370
 these musicians once they finish their 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.650
 essays or presentations return to 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.500
 daily work as producers of 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.540
 panela the majority and others to their 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.860
 livestock activities 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.860
 in life 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.500
 the group very good right now the 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.310
 my experience as a musician was born from 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.900
 child I always with was 8 years old 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.390
 right then to dad to teach me to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.340
 the sounds so bank and there for 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.520
 Here, you feel when you are in 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.810
 a platform and see an entire audience 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.600
 responding to the music of party 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.220

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.540
 they between joy the boys 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.750
 also because it's a group that comes 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.580
 sidewalk and stand one of mario gÃ³mez 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.830
 johnny rivera el charrito negro uno 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.210
 he feels proud despite the peasant and 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.210
 the people applauding 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.280
 when I started in this group as 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.569
 doing by the way then the measurement 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.159
 that the partner who was singing with me 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.450
 then he read me for a drop issues and 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.310
 Well, well, men, because we 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.019
 love this topic that I do not know how good I 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.420
 also but something is restoring to 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.340
 sing you talk about the subject when the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.940
 my friend went out then I walk 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.940

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.130
 my mind 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.130
 do not 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.580
 thus it is acclimated with the smell of wood 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.740
 from the trapiche to the public stage 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.660
 parranda show is for your aunt one of the 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.060
 best musical groups that we 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.060
 represent with height in the region 

00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:47.489
