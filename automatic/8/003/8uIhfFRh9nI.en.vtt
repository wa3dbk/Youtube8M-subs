so<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:49.690> chicken<00:03:50.050> is<00:03:50.230> three<00:03:50.650> ounces<00:03:52.050> which<00:03:53.050> is

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
so this chicken is three ounces which is

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.330 
so this chicken is three ounces which is
actually<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:53.860> lot<00:03:54.310> them<00:03:54.520> because<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:56.340> bottle

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
actually a lot them because a bottle

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.790 
actually a lot them because a bottle
like<00:03:57.460> this<00:03:57.520> it's<00:03:58.090> three<00:03:58.390> ounces<00:03:58.750> this<00:03:59.500> is<00:03:59.650> like

like this it's three ounces this is like

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.950 
like this it's three ounces this is like
two<00:04:00.040> ounces<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.660> one<00:04:01.870> ounce<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:03.960> the

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
you give em on Amazon background or

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.350 
you give em on Amazon background or
chrome<00:06:29.900> art<00:06:30.139> five<00:06:30.949> bucks<00:06:31.220> or<00:06:31.370> something<00:06:31.520> it's

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
chrome art five bucks or something it's

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.899 
chrome art five bucks or something it's
just<00:06:32.419> like<00:06:32.659> a<00:06:33.370> material<00:06:34.370> on<00:06:34.460> the<00:06:34.550> airflows

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
just like a material on the airflows

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:38.170 
just like a material on the airflows
they're<00:06:35.120> infuses<00:06:35.659> the<00:06:35.780> airflow<00:06:36.199> so<00:06:36.830> that<00:06:37.180> you

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
they're infuses the airflow so that you

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.570 
they're infuses the airflow so that you
can't<00:06:38.449> blow<00:06:38.599> dryer<00:06:38.810> your<00:06:38.990> hair<00:06:39.199> and<00:06:39.580> something

can't blow dryer your hair and something

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.269 
can't blow dryer your hair and something
else<00:06:40.699> you<00:06:40.819> probably<00:06:40.849> want<00:06:41.780> to<00:06:41.840> do<00:06:42.610> before

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
else you probably want to do before

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:46.189 
else you probably want to do before
we<00:06:44.759> need<00:06:44.879> to<00:06:44.999> go<00:06:45.089> on<00:06:45.179> your<00:06:45.269> trip<00:06:45.419> is<00:06:45.629> check<00:06:46.049> the

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
we need to go on your trip is check the

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.069 
we need to go on your trip is check the
weather<00:06:46.439> and<00:06:46.769> took<00:06:47.279> the<00:06:47.429> humidity<00:06:48.079> because

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:49.079 
weather and took the humidity because

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:50.629 
weather and took the humidity because
for<00:06:49.259> me<00:06:49.379> I<00:06:49.409> find<00:06:49.679> this<00:06:49.769> to<00:06:49.949> be<00:06:49.979> a<00:06:50.129> really<00:06:50.519> big

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
for me I find this to be a really big

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:52.549 
for me I find this to be a really big
determinant<00:06:50.969> but<00:06:51.599> how<00:06:51.779> many<00:06:51.989> carats<00:06:52.259> an<00:06:52.349> act

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:52.559 
determinant but how many carats an act

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:55.399 
determinant but how many carats an act
is<00:06:52.679> usually<00:06:53.099> the<00:06:53.249> humidity<00:06:53.819> check<00:06:54.629> the

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:55.409 
is usually the humidity check the

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:56.779 
is usually the humidity check the
percentage<00:06:55.859> of<00:06:55.979> humidity<00:06:56.549> the<00:06:56.699> humidity

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
percentage of humidity the humidity

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.039 
percentage of humidity the humidity
actually<00:06:57.389> wasn't<00:06:57.539> that<00:06:57.629> different<00:06:57.989> from

00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:58.049 
actually wasn't that different from

00:06:58.049 --> 00:07:00.979 
actually wasn't that different from
North<00:06:58.259> Carolina<00:06:58.589> to<00:06:59.059> organ<00:07:00.059> so<00:07:00.239> I<00:07:00.299> wasn't<00:07:00.599> that

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:00.989 
North Carolina to organ so I wasn't that

00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:02.389 
North Carolina to organ so I wasn't that
afraid<00:07:01.229> except<00:07:01.619> right<00:07:01.739> here<00:07:01.769> will<00:07:02.009> be<00:07:02.039> rainy

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:02.399 
afraid except right here will be rainy

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.069 
afraid except right here will be rainy
all<00:07:02.579> week<00:07:02.789> so<00:07:02.969> I<00:07:03.029> knew<00:07:03.179> I<00:07:03.209> wanted<00:07:03.419> products<00:07:03.869> a

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:04.079 
all week so I knew I wanted products a

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:07.609 
all week so I knew I wanted products a
lot<00:07:04.259> of<00:07:04.349> cold<00:07:04.759> so<00:07:05.759> yeah<00:07:05.879> check<00:07:05.969> the<00:07:06.749> percent

00:07:07.609 --> 00:07:07.619 
lot of cold so yeah check the percent

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:09.109 
lot of cold so yeah check the percent
humidity<00:07:07.949> in<00:07:08.279> the<00:07:08.309> air<00:07:08.399> before<00:07:08.789> you<00:07:08.969> leave

00:07:09.109 --> 00:07:09.119 
humidity in the air before you leave

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:11.869 
humidity in the air before you leave
because<00:07:09.479> um<00:07:10.229> that<00:07:11.069> can<00:07:11.249> be<00:07:11.369> very<00:07:11.549> different

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879 
because um that can be very different

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:13.489 
because um that can be very different
also<00:07:12.059> the<00:07:12.329> water<00:07:12.509> can<00:07:12.779> change<00:07:13.019> and<00:07:13.259> lots<00:07:13.409> of

00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:13.499 
also the water can change and lots of

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:15.529 
also the water can change and lots of
things<00:07:13.739> I<00:07:13.979> just<00:07:14.459> recommend<00:07:14.909> bringing<00:07:15.119> lung

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 
things I just recommend bringing lung

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:17.029 
things I just recommend bringing lung
care<00:07:15.749> whole<00:07:16.019> euro<00:07:16.259> products<00:07:16.649> the<00:07:16.739> products

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039
