00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.639
 prominent ears 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.130
 in these cases the lateral border of the ear 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.859
 stands far from the head 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.920
 highlighting the ear on the face of this 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.470
 change is of genetic origin. 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.689
 cause embarrassment and distress 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.750
 especially in children. 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:37.350
 that become the object of games and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:40.230
 nicknames to constituted ear 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.140
 internally by cartilage of this 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.840
 The cartilage has a very 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.219
 Particularly high lateral 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.980
 propeller call 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.180
 then we have a depression called 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.420
 escapes 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.360
 continuing with another elevation 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.640
 called the propeller in contact with the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.090
 and we have a great depression. 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.229
 called the shell the bottom is a 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.430
 ovule 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.380
 usually the malformation of the amt helix 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.590
 associated with the increase of the shell 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.950
 can lead to prominent ears 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.650
 Otoplasty is a surgery that takes

 aesthetic correction of the ears also a 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.520
 most natural and harmonious aspect of age 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.430
 ideal for performing the autocracy is to pre- 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.250
 when the ear is already formed 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.759
 and is almost the same size as a 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.759
 adult

 conditions to perform the surgery 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.689
 consultation is carried out 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.990
 physical evaluation and are 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.780
 ordered laboratory tests some 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.310
 recommendations should be followed before 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.590

 tell your doctor the medicines you 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.750

 be suspended as in the case of 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.540
 anticoagulants advise the doctor in case

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.209
 a few days 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.019
 other specific recommendations 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.609
 concerning curative care 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.519

 post operative 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.709
 over a few months you can see 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.079
 a more natural and definitive result 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.049
 complications are rare due to 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.959
 preparation performed in the preoperative period 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.430
 care offered during and after the 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.380
 surgery 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.319

 talk about your expectations with your 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.209
 and I see that it really can be 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.530
 done in your case since perfection does not

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.250
 scars 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.859
 each person has a process of 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.010
 healing difference that does not depend 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.740

 performed an incision behind the ear 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.970
 removes excess of bad cartilage 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.270
 formed by giving a new form to the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.680
 scar is imperceptible hidden behind 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.160
 of the ear 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.320
