only<00:07:35.000> thing<00:07:35.210> i<00:07:35.330> recommend<00:07:35.870> doing<00:07:36.110> is

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:36.470 
only thing i recommend doing is

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.980 
only thing i recommend doing is
disabling<00:07:37.190> the<00:07:37.370> bridge<00:07:37.580> and<00:07:37.790> sound<00:07:38.450> when<00:07:38.840> you

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:38.990 
disabling the bridge and sound when you

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.690 
disabling the bridge and sound when you
install<00:07:39.410> the<00:07:39.590> long<00:07:39.770> because<00:07:40.130> it<00:07:40.280> is<00:07:40.400> a<00:07:40.430> little

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:40.700 
install the long because it is a little

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.640 
install the long because it is a little
annoying<00:07:41.090> though<00:07:42.020> if<00:07:42.200> you<00:07:42.320> have<00:07:42.500> any

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.650 
annoying though if you have any

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.040
