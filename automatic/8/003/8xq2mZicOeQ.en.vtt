00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.270
 we will need vanilla flavor cookies 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.660
 it may be these hours that you are 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.510
 they just have to be vanilla flavor 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.810
 two envelopes of grenetina and half a cup of 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:26.169
 water a can of condensed milk one 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.439
 can of evaporated milk the juice of 6 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.390
 Simon is this size and molds 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.210
 small in this case I'm going to occupy 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.690
 these if you do not have you can occupy one 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.180
 only big 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.989
 to half a cup of water we will place the two 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.989
 Grenetine envelopes 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.559
 let's dissolve them 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.690
 and we are going to reserve them for a moment 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.670
 once it has been done as a sponge what 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.309
 what we are going to do is take it to the oven 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.019
 of microwave for 30 seconds or until 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.060
 that becomes liquid 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.100
 If you do not have a microwave oven, you can 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.890
 do it in a water bath, but it must be 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.200
 liquid since we have liquid the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.720
 let's reserve for the moment in the 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.549
 blender let's add the milk 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.549
 condensed and evaporated milk 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.890
 ok now let's liquefy what we're going to 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.049
 do is the following while we go 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.649
 we are going to withdraw this stage of the 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.649
 blender 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.090
 and we are going to add little by little the 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.549
 lemon juice while still liquefying and 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.920
 then we are going to add little by little 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.170
 the grenetina in the same way also 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.009
 continuing to liquefy 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.009
 i 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.079
 Y 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.409
 a mix of can we are left with this 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.539
 consistency and what we are going to do 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.539
 Now it's preparing our molds 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.819
 as follows 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.040
 we will place a layer of this mixture 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.260
 later we are going to add a 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.260
 cookie 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.709
 or the cookies you need from each one 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.709
 of your molds 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.390
 now let's add another layer of 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.390
 mixture 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.260
 just cover the cookie 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.890
 and now you will need a cookie 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.530
 and we'll add another layer another cookie and 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.300
 let's go alternating like this until 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.300
 we finished with our mixture 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.860
 Y 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.230
 well finally I stayed from this 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.530
 way now I also made one in this 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.720
 mold to see how it is 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.150
 and what I'm going to do is take them to 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.880
 freezer for 30 minutes and they will be 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.010
 ready to be enjoyed 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.000
 well finally to decorate I'm just going to 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.070
 add a few slices of lemon 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.370
 and a little bit of the same grated 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.370
 lemon 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.069
 and I'm going to present it this way I 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.200

 and
