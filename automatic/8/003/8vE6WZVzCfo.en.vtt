think<00:02:00.130> here<00:02:00.310> although<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:00.760> think<00:02:01.150> we<00:02:01.240> do<00:02:01.360> see<00:02:01.540> a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
think here although I think we do see a

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.360 
think here although I think we do see a
little<00:02:01.690> contact<00:02:02.170> between<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.590> 33<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.190> 5

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
little contact between the 33 and the 5

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.030 
little contact between the 33 and the 5
but<00:02:03.820> when<00:02:04.450> he<00:02:04.570> pulls<00:02:04.810> out<00:02:04.990> there<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.680> car<00:02:05.920> is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
but when he pulls out there that car is

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.920 
but when he pulls out there that car is
automatically<00:02:06.580> going<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:06.970> start<00:02:07.330> coming<00:02:07.720> back

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
automatically going to start coming back

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.180 
automatically going to start coming back
a<00:02:07.960> little<00:02:08.110> bit<00:02:08.320> because<00:02:08.500> he's<00:02:08.800> come<00:02:09.040> out

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
a little bit because he's come out

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.090 
a little bit because he's come out
against<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.960> brick<00:02:10.960> wall<00:02:10.990> of<00:02:11.320> wind<00:02:11.620> right<00:02:11.890> there

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
against a brick wall of wind right there

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.740 
against a brick wall of wind right there
even<00:02:12.340> though<00:02:12.430> he's<00:02:12.610> got<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.820> run<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.540> car

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
even though he's got a run that car

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.270 
even though he's got a run that car
automatically<00:02:14.320> slows<00:02:14.590> down<00:02:14.830> when<00:02:14.950> he<00:02:15.070> pulls

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
automatically slows down when he pulls

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.530 
automatically slows down when he pulls
out<00:02:15.430> there<00:02:15.640> until<00:02:15.760> he<00:02:15.970> starts<00:02:16.240> getting<00:02:16.450> that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
out there until he starts getting that

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.200 
out there until he starts getting that
he'll<00:02:16.720> say<00:02:17.110> but<00:02:17.800> if<00:02:17.890> you're<00:02:17.980> Tony<00:02:18.160> Stewart<00:02:18.580> and
