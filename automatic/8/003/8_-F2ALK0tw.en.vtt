00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 He 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.510
 That said 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.969
 It is a topic in two directions of overseas university in summer 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.730
 Recently, I closed 24 schools soon after I was fired 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.630
 Trouble is a problem, but today in Kobe 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.689
 Students who attend the school open a debate to refute the criticism 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.550
 Was 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.680
 This debate is in Kobe, but first of all students from university Japan are 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.110
 It was planned as a school festival event 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.550
 In addition to the students from this university, Americans and international students 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.090
 Naoki Prize writer Ryo Ishikawa as a guest paneler 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.110
 I participated 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.030
 The University of the United States of America 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.720
 Even if it is a problem of shape, such as becoming closed in about two years because of a problem or graduation 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.650
 Problems such as not being able to get a university diploma from Japan 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.880
 It has been 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.650
 At the debate, students will focus on language and focus on school features 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.040
 Many people are actively studying 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.020
 I think all the people in the world are true 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.330
 There was a series of complaints that I wanted you to do 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.750
 In North America 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.080
 There is no basis but it was further 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.490
 To raise the mass tax due to the appearance of the unexpected and the damage 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.300
 Finally 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.210
 Young people with dreams expand their eyes with calm eyes 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.210
 It was held in the city or the suburbs 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.409
 Universities in Japan overseas are classified by recent years and 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.010
 It seems that there are nearly 40 amounts in Japan 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.290
 But after that, it was shifted to the Japanese traffic in Osaka recently 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.670
 There are also three minutes of Japanese for overseas Japanese 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.730
 I can't say that my eyes are not necessarily friendly 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.220
 Such a student who actually goes to the Japanese school of the overseas university 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.640
 Open a debate in which people advocate their own opinions 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 Was 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.259
 This debate was held as part of the school festival 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.189
 Located in Kita-ku, Kobe City, the students themselves of the university Japan school mainly planned 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.459
 Impersonating guest panelers and their own conversation overseas university Japanese school 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.359
 It was advanced to the subject 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.779
 The students who planned are trying to acquire language and internationalism 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.469
 I dare to enter Edmonds University without going to a Japanese university 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.819
 Most students are 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.529
 It is said that it is a club as it is trying to stop slipping from recent days 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.989
 Because the voice is rising from the world 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.989
 I've been working on the preparation to get to know 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.549
 I went to the opportunity to hold a debate 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.399
 First by bus 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:50.859
 Full charge 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.380
 It is our problem 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.359
 It is this system 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.799
 Japan ibm your own guys are really doing 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.499
 I think it's wonderful 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:01.370
 if you can 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.730
 Please understand 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.019
 I want to visit Onishi 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.230
 Nipponkoa has been in a rush to start classes in recent years 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.849
 Japan's inability to obtain university qualifications, and 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.639
 It is popular because critics are one after another in Eurasian sloppy management 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.599
 I went to Kishiwada city city last week at US International University of Japan. 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.969
 Due to business difficulties, the closing school of Edmonds University and the new year's students who entered this year 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.069
 Anxiety has spread to students by less than 30% 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.609
 Because of these things, at the beginning of the debate we 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.249
 The students who were supposed to let out unleash their daily anxiety 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.109
 It was become a thing 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.109
 I am alone 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.919
 Fate 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:54.649
 Eye 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:57.649
 Kagawa 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.139
 Kazuharu Noda 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.779
 But you know 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:08.069
 About 20% 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.890
 free 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.269
 The way is 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.039
 26 minutes 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:15.099
 I have English 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.099
 Run 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.259
 I understood 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:30.240
 f1 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.710
 In the end, the debate on the student side 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.699
 Most people will hit Ra 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.419
 Overseas university Japan Japanese school is still in the state of policy 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.729
 It is a result to show 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.400
 A student of another university who is swung around and painted a man 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.379
 I feel like you are serious and serious 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.379
 Please give me a ball 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.449
 Say 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.210
 It's this bubble 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.210
 There is a corporation 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.710
 The price is 30,000 yen 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:21.819
 at home 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.189
 Japanese from overseas universities has recently floated in the air 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:29.860
 Some voices of criticism such as there are some schools in parallel several years ago 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.089
 Many are asked 

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:34.929
 How about one place The number of taxi use is a maximum of three at bats 

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:36.659
 To 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.169
 by hows-x-adcp 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.419
 The university's school festival is told in the early stage 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.699
 The University of the United States of America means to take care of ice anyway 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.520
 Unlike university in Japan, after the school's queen classroom Morioka 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.080
 I'm in 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.569
 The day before Osaka Pref. Yao City Barefoot US Bond University Japan School 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:00.689
 I say closed 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.449
 The problem of how to handle explosives is taken up 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.139
 Which responds to what the students worked for in the school 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.069
 On the occasion of the school festival 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.389
 It became discussion meeting Hiratsuka 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:12.990
 Just that day 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.860
 Due to the effects of parallel functions of US Treasuries 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.710
 Doing at all overseas subsidiaries in Japan 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.740
 There is no problem with stamina, but it seems that she cried because of business difficulties 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.669
 Unexpected look 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.539
 I will turn my eyes 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:33.469
 Not only do the wrong thing at first 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.460
 I conveyed it as the correct information 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.830
 I made a wide area because I want to know 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.830
 is 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:59.580
 I am photographing 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.649
 there 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:04.649
 Rice 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:07.439
 Then 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.330
 But at the stage 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.620
 Questions about overseas universities and Japanese schools such as questions when you get a job 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.990
 It was quite strict about 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.370
 It is certain that overseas universities and Japanese schools are attracting attention 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.639
 But what matters most to universities is nuclear vitality 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:28.419
 I felt that 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.809
 And more importantly carry out customs procedures 

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:35.939
 But what I think I want you to improve and improve 

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:36.179
 is
