00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:17.130
 ie8 yang 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:23.180
 Wow 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:27.060
 My family knows know of a blackout am 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.260
 Our mother who stayed gave her what 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.769
 It happened 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.329
 xvii and finished electric power kika o 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.809
 she is also electric 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.829
 the light has returned that is where the law or a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:49.440
 I relax here that you're very electric. 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:52.170
 No one daughter of my question I 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.079
 I call kika the electric energy comes from 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.360
 force of the sun's 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.510
 burning of natural gas and oil and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.489
 force of water as in Brazil the energy 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.619
 Our country's electric 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.530
 mainly from hydroelectric plants 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.200
 and change it does not yield water 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.570
 electrical engineer 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.909
 so they are called hydroelectric dams 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.100
 the plants that use the force of the waters 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.170
 to produce electricity 11th the waters 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.610
 of the rains will fill a huge 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.579
 concrete dam 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.220
 then the water comes out through huge pipes and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.890
 inside them she runs to the plant a 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.520
 great speed passes through turbine 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.050
 the movement of water in turbine blades 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.600
 trigger tub ionic ethical 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.940
 the team is a huge touring machine has 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.770
 strong transforming mechanical energy 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.770
 in electrical energy 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.070
 there are shells with little water 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.310
 to drive the turbines and dynamo and 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.470
 then power may be lacking in houses 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.300
 industries schools and hospitals 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.479
 that's why in times of little rain 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:18.900
 We have to save electricity. 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:21.480
 kika mile that was this tv hi energy 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.910
 comes here at my house to 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.220
 from the plants to your home to 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.250
 electricity travels kilometers to 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.100
 pole post to pit post in front 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.769
 to her house she follows a cable to the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.980
 wires that distribute power across all 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:43.200
 rooms points since saw is taken 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.799
 that will come this bright idea 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.420
 invent the electric light between the centuries 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.640
 17 and 18 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.760
 the American physicist benjamin franklin and 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.070
 watched the sky and stormy night and 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.900
 He found that the rays were discharges 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.380
 electric currents coming from 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.970
 but only at the end of the 19th century 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.400
 the men started to use energy 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.160
 electrical in your day to day 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.110
 today we can not live yes she is 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.190
 with electric power that we connect the 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.160
 computers 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.730
 the floor frozen the ice cream and 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.120
 We heat the pasta. 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.239
 tac benjamin button electric power and 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.760
 the battle of good clean water sales 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.690
 then nothing had to see who falls in 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.180
 move a tip for the fnma 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.120
 participate that bring fight the fight camp 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.090
 go to our land from where so many 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.739
 energy wisdom that tell you not 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.980
 will believe 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.690
 an electric bye and even the program 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.110
 that even with one more 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.110
 cover well
