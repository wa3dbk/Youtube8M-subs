 to replace and after the major acted 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.239
 normal huh 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:04.560
 after I have the panel all the panoplie 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.450
 is it not our forces so this is where 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.880
 especially I aimed in the panel there 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.510
 I targeted the damage is a pity we 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.540
 shut up 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.320
 I have almost perfect dg so there the game 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 perfect is 12 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:23.159
 so there someone who loves me p after 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.499
 so to gellannes to young people 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.479
 after the king's belt that bull there 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:29.999
 this one I'm going to focus on is the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.420
 six of these is that I thought not bad 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:35.819
 to reach and then the damage 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.619
 I'm really going to pray that for that it's 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:42.479
 like that it allows me to be in one on 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.899
 two full cc punished boot of account he 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.619
 good i also when you see 10 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.829
 nodes ten cn lands to do so 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.599
 it me has an air after the hat 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.659
 line l so that's almost a game 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:02:02.879
 perfect good vital appearance and 6 of 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.909
 stop the twelve damage neuter 480 on 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:08.429
 500 and a half we move it aida iced 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.019
 ice mode and it can go me y'a 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.750
 the ten damage really I aimed 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.519
 really the damage to our from when he 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.920
 the two critics who interested me 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:22.500
 cap damages when he so the fair 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.079
 this is not bad cc but I believe that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.090
 that's if you can go up to 2 with his cloak 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:30.150
 if I remember well and after many 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.970
 dragodinde take a world to 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.430
 start before and then huh so there 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.250
 after the panoply emden so the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.579
 damage of the cci of the tackle so after I 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.459
 will show you my stats so 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:48.630
 629 of strength what is it that is not 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.069
 badly and after the ji 500 da j 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.200
 suddenly with the pso and then harassing 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.730
 it's really the art this land to kill 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.919
 the guys behind the walls that's good 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.540
 shit in parcels and then I make a beautiful 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:01.079
 then in less than 1000 like that but 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.160
 who's raging after a so in my 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.590
 characteristics 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.819
 so good after the super show 100 to force 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.709
 we will act so 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.840
 that's why my stats are okay 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.920
 what I'm trying to see for myself 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.110
 you have in the other elements to be 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.480
 multi 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.050
 so after the go there damage by cons 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.470
 damage and 60 everywhere we do not land you 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.250
 and after normal damage power it's 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.270
 really the damage 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.720
 here we are going to test them the stuff 1 we're going 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.970
 test 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.290
 I want to start direct with the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.920
 punishes arrow then yeah I'm not going to me 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:44.070
 booster at the beginning in coop less 300 good 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.650
 a little throw if I have to start up 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.660
 month 500 to the second 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.500
 alas as you see there a lot of these 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.980
 that's when I do not have so tutures 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.840
 without tutu it's not bad a call to 100% 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.030
 to be boosted by the 700 and here I am going to 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.250
 booster I did a boost ride 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.400
 hop a little boost round to pass 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.370
 it's another cce after an arrow 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.440
 scathing stinging way - two 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.820
 cents 264 little gets off dpm is there 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.130
 support 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:22.330
 wae 1000 1050 eight months it can go 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.420
 destructive arrow I have to do less 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.310
 four hundred 400 donations we will have a turn 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:37.360
 I easily do at least 1000 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:40.540
 1500 wii 1500 we go about after we 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.610
 will test the pso the aps at least 400 have 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.140
 two times less 400 not it depends 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.060
 normally I'm doing cc I'm 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.019
 one in five is also the absence 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.659
 boom the hardest uphill in cc 

00:04:50.019 --> 00:05:01.219
 after good and top I think that's it 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:05:06.229
 does not a little 161,5 booster 200 is 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:07.669
 me it will send so it's really there 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.769
 then 1 really played my skull 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:20.469
 level with punitive fishing support 

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:27.189
 get close after you ipod little sense 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:29.139
 after he also shrank by 150 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:32.659
 after which other tests 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:35.239
 this is also that that I will not go up 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:36.769
 level it's worth it but I 

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:39.619
 do not go up the night before 6 would have to 

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:42.739
 I make games show you a little 

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:45.829
 d axa does not less than 300 but there is 

00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:47.959
 both there are both damage so the 

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:52.999
 two poisons and normally I can 

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:58.830
 to arrive at at least 400 ha not a try 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:06:00.540
 of max bomb attests kako cac 6 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.810
 curan 1 of 2 cc with the dagues there 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:13.260
 so it's a spell of ice ceseda and 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:17.970
 it's not bad up amarok it's good 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.380
 less 400 - 603 times and after bah if 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:24.330
 you have an enemy on the wall bullshit 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.350
