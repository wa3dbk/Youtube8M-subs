00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.649
 edgar martins from the school of life and today 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:12.660
 I'll give you a very good tip. 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.540
 So you can calm down your house. 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.609
 also calm those people who are 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.670
 beneficiaries who are not well 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.130
 they can sleep and also to clean the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.180
 general negative energies so the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.650
 environment and everything in your life is 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.090
 power in the trees 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.800
 recently in mind is not our 2007 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.210
 It's been four months since I've been 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.420
 receiving some knowledge 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.660
 information about the power of the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.539
 trees also do not err is no thing is 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.539
 Related floral in that only 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:55.620
 trees and it works as follows 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:59.190
 if I'm going to talk about a fruit leaf 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.710
 hose leaves are 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.159
 excellent for you to calm and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.470
 transmute the energies your house you have 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.119
 To do the following I searched the area 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.210
 I do not know if it will end here in my 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.090
 region is very difficult to find that it is 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.259
 tropical region is find more 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.860
 in a hose the foot of your house goes 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.689
 until it's there when you get down to it 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.479
 you ask for leave of science hose 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.479
 I'll need your sheets here. 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.400
 There you get lots of leaves that way. 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.979
 will take you home and then you will 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.939
 spread these leaves all over your house 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.680
 under the bed is your whole room in the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:50.189
 bathroom and living room in the hallway 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.649
 kitchen outside 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.640
 spreading was the demand for all 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.200
 parts of your house and you leave it's for 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.600
 For example you do this in the morning and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.790
 until the end of the afternoon leaves you with 24 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.649
 hours and something is going to happen 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.380
 interesting is if you were the one 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.810
 type will realize that I am talking about is 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.270
 talk experience leaves leaf demand 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.170
 Working there you go outside. 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.540
 from your home 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.819
 and then come back to stand five 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.010
 A few minutes later, he comes back and starts walking. 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.020
 right in your house to see you 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.890
 realize that it seems that you will through 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.930
 what fruit so it looks like you're going 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.110
 lose the notion so middle of the floor goes 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.200
 climb to the leaf of the morning she goes 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.140
 begin to calm her home so she 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.340
 It leaves very still but calm 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.310
 That's enough, and if your home is 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.290
 very charged in a negative energy 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.080
 you do the following you will realize 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.900
 that the leaves will start to dry 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.209
 start pulling so in a matter of 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.810
 hours or 24 hours 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.209
 the leaves can dry out even wither 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.819
 totally even ok if you do this 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.400
 again next to your house you have good 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.069
 It will not happen so quickly. 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.680
 okay so there you take the leaves is 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.830
 Odd quota and throw away in the trash 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.780
 anyway so I do is is another 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:24.420
 interesting thing also pick up sheet 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:27.630
 hose demand could not sleep 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.970
 logic is very good, it's not even another day 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.890
 out that sheet replaced another ne 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.079
 if you realize that it has dried up a lot you 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.650
 Are you going to have a night's sleep? 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.570
 quiet and one thing here the ancients 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.900
 also made it very interesting to 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.130
 Calm people are nervous, and you? 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.140
 get the clothes 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.660
 usually the person uses a lot in this 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.000
 person who is nervous stressed 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.840
 then you take sheet demand and washes 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.359
 clothes in the same tank scrub the faith 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.470
 scrub the sheets on clothing that 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:03.480
 let calmer then also the person 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.600
 hose she has this paper late to 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.340
 Kalmadi who cleaned energy to do 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.280
 you sleep better 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.200
 tomorrow the next video I'll pass the trash 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.810
 For you, hose. 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.880
 I'll pass the technical sheets 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.700
 also for you you can and will in your 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.550
 home and it's really cool, it's really simple there 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.950
 this process I saw a very 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.380
 strong on these 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.140
 trees are not dealing with bad luck as 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.020
 are in the Celtic culture the shamanism then 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.140
 I could see butt lit up a tree 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.000
 have olive trees have the native birds here 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.370
 I'm very rich, Brazil. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.240
 Is to have the Brazilian zaga I spoke celtas 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.100
 Three doubts, finally, in Japan, in China. 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.320
 all that is there on the trees 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.960
 and then I'll pass on that knowledge 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.630
