00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.950 
as you introduce dynamic
widgets<00:02:14.830> plugins<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:15.820> on<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.630> want<00:02:16.840> your

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
widgets plugins and so on you want your

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.280 
widgets plugins and so on you want your
base<00:02:17.380> skeleton<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.550> be<00:02:18.670> as<00:02:18.910> simple<00:02:19.690> as<00:02:20.050> you

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
base skeleton to be as simple as you

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.800 
base skeleton to be as simple as you
think<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.590> can<00:02:20.740> get<00:02:20.890> away<00:02:20.920> with<00:02:21.370> now<00:02:22.060> each<00:02:22.330> one

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
think you can get away with now each one

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.830 
think you can get away with now each one
of<00:02:22.840> these<00:02:23.020> div<00:02:23.380> tags<00:02:23.740> is<00:02:24.100> going<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.120> act<00:02:25.300> like<00:02:25.480> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
of these div tags is going to act like a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.050 
of these div tags is going to act like a
container<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:27.190> will<00:02:27.280> be<00:02:27.430> filled<00:02:27.670> out<00:02:27.790> with

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
container that will be filled out with

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.710 
container that will be filled out with
dynamic<00:02:28.600> content<00:02:29.050> for<00:02:29.770> example<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.520> h1<00:02:31.390> and

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
dynamic content for example the h1 and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.500 
dynamic content for example the h1 and
h2<00:02:32.110> up<00:02:32.830> at<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.100> top<00:02:33.280> here<00:02:33.340> will<00:02:33.790> contain<00:02:34.270> the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
h2 up at the top here will contain the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.970 
h2 up at the top here will contain the
site<00:02:34.810> title<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:36.250> site<00:02:36.490> tagline<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
site title and the site tagline the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.370 
site title and the site tagline the
content<00:02:38.980> area<00:02:39.220> right<00:02:39.760> here<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:40.140> probably<00:02:41.140> what

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
content area right here is probably what

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.290 
content area right here is probably what
we're<00:02:41.530> most<00:02:41.770> interested<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:42.550> though<00:02:42.730> this

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
we're most interested in though this

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.150 
we're most interested in though this
will<00:02:43.480> be<00:02:43.630> where<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:44.080> loop<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.860> we<00:02:45.010> were

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
will be where the loop that we were

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.160 
will be where the loop that we were
talking<00:02:45.520> about<00:02:45.640> earlier<00:02:45.910> will<00:02:46.630> actually

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
talking about earlier will actually

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.710 
talking about earlier will actually
occur<00:02:47.800> we<00:02:48.640> only<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> few<00:02:49.210> tags<00:02:49.450> here

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
occur we only have a few tags here

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.870 
occur we only have a few tags here
because<00:02:50.170> we'll<00:02:50.590> be<00:02:50.620> filling<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.220> with<00:02:51.250> dynamic

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
because we'll be filling it with dynamic

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.030 
because we'll be filling it with dynamic
content<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.480> then<00:02:52.690> looping<00:02:53.380> over<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.770> area

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
content and then looping over this area

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.330 
content and then looping over this area
several<00:02:54.940> times<00:02:55.300> for<00:02:55.780> each<00:02:55.840> post<00:02:56.320> will<00:02:57.220> be

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
several times for each post will be

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.120 
several times for each post will be
adding<00:02:57.700> more<00:02:57.730> tags<00:02:58.180> as<00:02:58.420> we<00:02:58.540> go<00:02:58.660> along<00:02:58.780> but<00:02:59.710> this

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
adding more tags as we go along but this

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.100 
adding more tags as we go along but this
will<00:03:00.310> give<00:03:00.460> us<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.640> good<00:03:00.670> start<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.570> next<00:03:01.930> step

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
will give us a good start the next step

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.800 
will give us a good start the next step
is<00:03:02.320> to<00:03:02.380> split<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.400> skeleton<00:03:03.880> up<00:03:04.060> amongst<00:03:04.690> our

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
is to split the skeleton up amongst our

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.260 
is to split the skeleton up amongst our
various<00:03:05.200> template<00:03:05.680> files<00:03:05.920> then<00:03:06.640> we<00:03:06.970> need<00:03:07.120> to

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
various template files then we need to

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.690 
various template files then we need to
include<00:03:07.600> those<00:03:07.900> templates<00:03:08.350> back<00:03:09.010> into<00:03:09.550> this

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
include those templates back into this

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.400 
include those templates back into this
file<00:03:09.970> if<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.540> never<00:03:10.810> done<00:03:11.020> this<00:03:11.170> type<00:03:11.380> of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
file if you never done this type of

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.140 
file if you never done this type of
thing<00:03:11.650> before<00:03:11.770> it<00:03:12.190> might<00:03:12.370> seem<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.640> little<00:03:12.940> bit

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
thing before it might seem a little bit

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.190 
thing before it might seem a little bit
counterintuitive<00:03:13.510> at<00:03:14.080> first<00:03:14.110> just<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.010> re<00:03:15.520> in

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
counterintuitive at first just to re in

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.630 
counterintuitive at first just to re in
but<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.350> technique<00:03:17.830> will<00:03:18.040> help<00:03:18.100> keep<00:03:18.520> our

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
but this technique will help keep our

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.630 
but this technique will help keep our
code<00:03:18.850> Queen<00:03:19.240> and<00:03:19.510> maintainable<00:03:20.410> so<00:03:20.980> first

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
code Queen and maintainable so first

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.550 
code Queen and maintainable so first
we'll<00:03:21.940> go<00:03:22.030> ahead<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.510> start<00:03:23.050> with<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.380> header

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
we'll go ahead and start with the header

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.670 
we'll go ahead and start with the header
so<00:03:24.280> everything<00:03:25.210> that<00:03:25.360> comes<00:03:25.600> before<00:03:26.080> the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
so everything that comes before the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.040 
so everything that comes before the
content<00:03:27.520> div<00:03:27.760> there<00:03:28.060> we<00:03:28.570> want<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.930> go<00:03:29.020> ahead

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
content div there we want to go ahead

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.310 
content div there we want to go ahead
and<00:03:29.350> cut<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.540> we'll<00:03:31.540> switch<00:03:31.840> over<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.080> the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
and cut and we'll switch over to the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.490 
and cut and we'll switch over to the
header<00:03:32.530> here<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:32.950> paste<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.500> we'll

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
header here and paste it in and we'll

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.390 
header here and paste it in and we'll
save<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:36.010> file<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.610> then<00:03:38.160> everything<00:03:39.160> that

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
save that file and then everything that

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.130 
save that file and then everything that
comes<00:03:39.880> before<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:42.120> sidebar<00:03:43.120> here<00:03:43.150> we<00:03:43.900> want<00:03:44.080> to
