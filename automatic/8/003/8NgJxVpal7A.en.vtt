00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
experiment is three things one we can

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.710 
experiment is three things one we can
conclude<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.920> there<00:03:25.550> are<00:03:25.640> too<00:03:25.790> many<00:03:25.940> unknown

variables<00:03:26.890> involved<00:03:27.890> in<00:03:28.100> this<00:03:28.190> experiment<00:03:28.730> to

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
variables involved in this experiment to

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.330 
variables involved in this experiment to
make<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.090> valid<00:03:29.740> so<00:03:30.740> we<00:03:30.830> have<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.070> throw<00:03:31.220> out

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
make it valid so we have to throw out

make it valid so we have to throw out
the<00:03:31.430> data<00:03:31.900> -<00:03:32.900> we<00:03:33.350> can<00:03:33.500> conclude<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.940> was

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
the data - we can conclude that this was

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.900 
the data - we can conclude that this was
much<00:03:35.360> more<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.600> an<00:03:35.720> excuse<00:03:36.170> for<00:03:36.410> me<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.920> do<00:03:37.790> an

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
much more of an excuse for me to do an

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.230 
much more of an excuse for me to do an

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
three we can conclude based on my

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.790 
three we can conclude based on my
personal<00:03:46.040> experience<00:03:46.130> with<00:03:46.550> him<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.800> taking
