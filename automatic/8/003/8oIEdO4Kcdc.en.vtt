00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
electric power steering on this one

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.490 
electric power steering on this one
starts<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.300> buttons<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.690> can<00:00:12.719> hear<00:00:15.500> you

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
starts on the buttons you can hear you

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:32.040 
starts on the buttons you can hear you
first<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.609> off<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:17.940> go

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.410 

no<00:00:32.649> nasty<00:00:33.010> bumps<00:00:33.340> or<00:00:33.460> clunks<00:00:33.820> going<00:00:34.090> over<00:00:34.329> the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
no nasty bumps or clunks going over the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:44.270 
no nasty bumps or clunks going over the
rough<00:00:35.110> terrain<00:00:35.260> there

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.540 

and<00:00:45.149> off<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:45.930> go

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:57.960 

changes<00:00:50.329> gear<00:00:50.510> nicely

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.580 

no<00:00:58.510> problems<00:00:58.840> with<00:00:58.930> the<00:00:59.020> clutch<00:00:59.200> or<00:00:59.410> gearbox

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
no problems with the clutch or gearbox

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.840 
no problems with the clutch or gearbox
so<00:00:59.890> it's<00:01:00.070> like<00:01:00.220> that<00:01:02.460> engine<00:01:03.460> sounds<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:03.790> bit

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
so it's like that engine sounds a bit

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.220 
so it's like that engine sounds a bit
fussy<00:01:04.270> but<00:01:04.390> then<00:01:04.480> again<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.720> always<00:01:04.840> does<00:01:05.110> on

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
fussy but then again it always does on

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.520 
fussy but then again it always does on
this

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.440 

but<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.400> temperature<00:01:10.760> gauge<00:01:10.940> is<00:01:11.150> sitting

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
but the temperature gauge is sitting

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.760 
but the temperature gauge is sitting
just<00:01:11.570> below<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.840> halfway<00:01:12.020> mark<00:01:12.229> exactly

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
just below the halfway mark exactly

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.620 
just below the halfway mark exactly
where<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:13.100> should<00:01:13.130> there's<00:01:13.610> no<00:01:13.790> overheating

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
where it should there's no overheating

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.770 
where it should there's no overheating
problems<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.409> thought<00:01:15.619> that<00:01:15.770> with<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.010> one

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.860 

trax<00:01:23.440> nicely

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
trax nicely

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.420 
trax nicely
my<00:01:25.410> steering<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.180> coming<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
my steering on it coming up to the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:49.770 
my steering on it coming up to the
round<00:01:29.060> about<00:01:29.210> now

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.680 

so<00:01:50.470> no<00:01:50.680> nasty<00:01:51.130> expensive<00:01:51.760> groans<00:01:52.060> or<00:01:52.299> squeaks

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
so no nasty expensive groans or squeaks

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.310 
so no nasty expensive groans or squeaks
are<00:01:52.869> over<00:01:53.020> like<00:01:53.229> that<00:01:53.380> from<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:53.710> at<00:01:53.799> all

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.339 

as<00:03:12.180> we've<00:03:12.360> got<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> car<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:12.810> front<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:13.140> us<00:03:13.170> we

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
as we've got a car in front of us we

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.720 
as we've got a car in front of us we
can't<00:03:13.560> really<00:03:13.969> give<00:03:14.969> it<00:03:15.060> its<00:03:15.180> full<00:03:16.549> try<00:03:17.549> out

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
can't really give it its full try out

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.229 
can't really give it its full try out
but<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.980> way<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.310> drives<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:20.849> sort<00:03:20.969> of<00:03:21.060> 30
