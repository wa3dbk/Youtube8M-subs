with<00:03:16.269> this<00:03:16.420> trailer<00:03:16.930> was<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.560> felt<00:03:17.680> like

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
with this trailer was that I felt like

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.610 
with this trailer was that I felt like
it<00:03:18.220> gave<00:03:18.400> way<00:03:18.730> too<00:03:18.790> much<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:20.260> guess<00:03:20.440> they're

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
it gave way too much and I guess they're

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.080 
it gave way too much and I guess they're
doing<00:03:20.859> it<00:03:20.980> because<00:03:21.100> they<00:03:21.280> realize<00:03:21.820> there's

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
doing it because they realize there's

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.610 
doing it because they realize there's
people<00:03:22.359> like<00:03:22.540> me<00:03:22.780> out<00:03:22.810> there<00:03:22.959> who<00:03:23.470> are<00:03:23.530> just

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
people like me out there who are just

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.490 
people like me out there who are just
not<00:03:23.950> giving<00:03:24.430> this<00:03:24.519> movie<00:03:24.850> a<00:03:24.880> chance

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
not giving this movie a chance

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.740 
not giving this movie a chance
regardless<00:03:26.500> if<00:03:26.590> they<00:03:26.739> want<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.750> they're

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
regardless if they want to and they're

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.870 
regardless if they want to and they're
just<00:03:29.380> putting<00:03:29.560> way<00:03:29.859> too<00:03:29.920> much<00:03:30.130> I<00:03:30.370> felt<00:03:30.609> like<00:03:30.730> I

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
just putting way too much I felt like I

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.930 
just putting way too much I felt like I
saw<00:03:31.690> too<00:03:32.019> much<00:03:32.319> of<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:33.040> movie<00:03:33.250> like<00:03:33.549> too<00:03:33.790> much

going to lie there's this one particular

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.430 
going to lie there's this one particular
scene<00:03:46.180> with<00:03:46.329> spider-man<00:03:46.660> flying<00:03:47.079> in<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> air

that<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:48.010> looked<00:03:48.600> pretty<00:03:49.600> epic<00:03:49.930> i<00:03:50.500> would<00:03:50.680> say<00:03:50.950> i

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
that I looked pretty epic i would say i

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.160 
that I looked pretty epic i would say i
was<00:03:51.280> actually<00:03:51.519> kind<00:03:51.819> of<00:03:51.880> amazed<00:03:52.120> by<00:03:52.299> that<00:03:52.329> but

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
was actually kind of amazed by that but

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.110 
was actually kind of amazed by that but
I<00:03:53.410> just<00:03:53.799> feel<00:03:53.950> like<00:03:53.980> it's<00:03:54.370> just<00:03:54.790> too<00:03:55.090> much

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
I just feel like it's just too much

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.819 
I just feel like it's just too much
being<00:03:55.600> shown<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:56.049> this<00:03:56.139> trailer<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.650> guess

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
being shown in this trailer I guess

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.199 
being shown in this trailer I guess
they're<00:03:57.010> just<00:03:57.160> trying<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.459> really<00:03:57.670> sell<00:03:58.060> this

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
they're just trying to really sell this

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.780 
they're just trying to really sell this
movie<00:03:58.660> in<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:59.709> way<00:03:59.920> where<00:04:00.250> it's<00:04:00.519> something

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
movie in a way where it's something

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.520 
movie in a way where it's something
fresh<00:04:01.329> something<00:04:01.359> new<00:04:01.840> something<00:04:02.260> we've

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
fresh something new something we've

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.379 
fresh something new something we've
never<00:04:02.739> seen<00:04:02.889> before<00:04:03.690> but<00:04:04.690> in<00:04:05.079> reality<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:06.700> just

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
never seen before but in reality it just

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.349 
never seen before but in reality it just
feels<00:04:07.690> like<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:09.220> just<00:04:09.790> happened<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:10.329> other
