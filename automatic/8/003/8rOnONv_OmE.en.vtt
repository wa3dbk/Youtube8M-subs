00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.750
 how many girls are waiting for me 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.450
 are very well and for which I do not 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.110
 you know my name is karel and the day of 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.080
 today I bring you this look is very very 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.410
 like nature alone but not so natural 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.750
 but as if to leave a normal day and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.880
 then if you want to use it too 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.529
 at night it is also perfect it is 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.320
 very simple to do just deal with the 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.339
 eyeliner and two colors what is of the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.250
 face of the makeup is very very 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:42.859
 light I do not know any dust or anything because 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.309
 I want to do it like it seems like I do not 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:49.309
 I bring makeup and if you were interested 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.899
 some product or something that are going 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.210
 to be urges them down here to be 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.129
 make it easier for you to go look for them but 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.809
 well I'm going to stop talking and if you 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.990
 like this look and want to recreate it 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.120
 keep watching 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.460
 I will start applying for 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.500
 professional drink effect and this is going to 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.470
 help the pores close in that 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.690
 My face is more lawful after 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.410
 grab the mailing corrector and 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.970
 and I put it under my eyes in 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.700
 a triangle this is the one 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.870
 I always use after I'm going to grab 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.370
 this rhythm mate and I put it as in 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.370
 little dots all over my face 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.880
 already after doing this now just 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.250
 I grab my sponge and start mixing 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.330
 the two colors and this is the only thing 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.190
 I do in my face 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.130
 and the consistency of the base of 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.510
 Makeup is like a mousse so do not 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.270
 I feel like I have to apply 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.190
 powder over because he already feels very 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.190
 light and does not feel greasy 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.680
 and here are the two colors already well 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.150
 combined now the only thing I do is 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.750
 I grab my bronzer 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.620
 and this is a very light tan 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.259
 I applied it on the cheekbones of my bones and 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.119
 I do not do much outline but just 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.119
 I want to give a tanned look to my face 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.080
 he also made sure to apply me is in the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.350
 neck so that I can not see myself two 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.140
 tones 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.830
 now I grab my blog this looks like this is 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.820
 as a type 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.840
 I apply it in this way and then only 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.310
 I want to blend it with my hands 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.620
 delicately 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.050
 for the days that I just want my 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.460
 makeup look very natural this is the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.610
 that I definitely use 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.670
 after grabbing this white color and 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.190
 I want to apply only very little in 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.760
 my eyes so I can give you just one 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.760
 illumination 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.790
 then I use this color that is in 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.180
 like between coffee and purple and he applied it to me 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.709
 as well as propelled around the eye but 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.709
 focusing on the bowl 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.280
 then line my eyes with a 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.280
 eyeliner 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.660
 and this I do as part of 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.550
 outside in only one 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.550
 little bit more than half 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.470
 with a skewer that looks like this alone 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.840
 blur the outline so it does not look 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.840
 so marked and that looks more natural 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.270
 all the products that I am using 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:52.600
 I'm going to leave them down some links to 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.880
 that they can see them if they are interested 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.610
 and with the same as on the brochita 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.280
 I want to apply only to the latest 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.410
 last of the eye to make it big 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.860
 for my eyebrows I will be using 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.150
 this one that I made is only a gel 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.310
 clear and no more milk a shade brown and 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.380
 he turned it around and he made this 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.120
 consistency just like that to comb my 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.160
 eyelashes and they look more natural 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.560
 if you want me to show you how I did 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.889
 this gel only comments and leaves me 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.889
 to know 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.110
 for my lips I will use this 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.990
 color like between pink coffee and I'm going to 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.539
 delineate my lips but the technique that 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.960
 I always use is to outline my lips 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.229
 around and then blur it towards 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.229
 in 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.130
 I do it this way and I've given myself 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.150
 mind that the color of the labial always 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.150
 it lasts me longer 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.230
 then he applied a lipstick that is from this 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.730
 color a day to give dimension to my 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.730
 lips and that look fuller 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.350
 for my lashes I use this mask and 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.010
 some of you already know that it is my 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.010
 favorite 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.340
 I apply the white side first to make 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.500
 longer my lashes and then the 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.500
 black side to give volume 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.370
 already how can you tell 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.720
 much the look already after 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.720
 we apply the mask 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.220
 to finish my lips I'm using 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.650
 this one that is de l'orÃ©al I'm going to leave you 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.630
 the link below but seriously this 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.600
 has been one of my favorites is super 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.529
 soft and feel very good in my 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.169
 lips 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:08.519
 apart this color is very very beautiful and 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.519
 It is very shiny 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.950
 as I saw that I missed a little more than 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:23.250
 blas decided to apply at the end and 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.250
 to give the final touch to this look 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.060
 and good girls this is the look already 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.389
 finished that as I mentioned in the 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.639
 principle was very easy is super 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.650
 nice it has done me good to taste 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.000
 because I do not feel like the face like that 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.620
 I have a lot of dust and this is something and I do not 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.599
 have seen the video I'm going to leave 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.700

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:49.040
 the purchases that I made in high 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.790
 this little thing was much smaller 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:55.640
 that this but the woman and when the 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.610
 squeeze stays like a medita and 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.940
 then when you apply makeup 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:06.200
 There, your face is not super cool 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.820

 to be serious that is super easy to 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:15.350
 apply is recommended if not yet 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:18.230

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.480
 also for mature skin 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.690
 with brushes or with your hand you are not going to 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:26.270
 cover that is all the pores that have 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.520
 to be covered and with this little thing 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.040
 the makeup goal where is 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.920

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.080
