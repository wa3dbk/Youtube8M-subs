seven<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.810> hanger<00:01:17.450> unpin<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> pattern

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
seven for the hanger unpin the pattern

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.580 
seven for the hanger unpin the pattern
and<00:01:19.200> set<00:01:19.470> those<00:01:19.710> two<00:01:19.920> pairs<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.460> fabric<00:01:20.850> aside

bring<00:01:22.590> back<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> pattern<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.670> now<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:23.939> want

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
bring back the pattern and now we want

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.050 
bring back the pattern and now we want
to<00:01:24.360> cut<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.170> pads<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> pot<00:01:26.100> this

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
to cut out the pads of the pot this

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.030 
to cut out the pads of the pot this
pattern<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.780> symmetrically<00:01:28.439> mirrored<00:01:28.860> down

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
pattern is symmetrically mirrored down

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
pattern is symmetrically mirrored down
the<00:01:29.220> middle<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> folded<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> paper<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.049> half

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the middle so I folded the paper in half

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.420 
the middle so I folded the paper in half
and<00:01:31.619> cut<00:01:32.159> around<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.640> large<00:01:32.880> middle<00:01:33.240> Pat<00:01:34.430> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and cut around the large middle Pat the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.730 
and cut around the large middle Pat the
finger<00:01:35.759> pads<00:01:36.030> are<00:01:36.329> all<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.689> same<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.500> just

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
finger pads are all the same so you just

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.179 
finger pads are all the same so you just
need<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.130> cut<00:01:38.310> out<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:39.409> for<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> pads<00:01:40.770> I'm

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
need to cut out one for the pads I'm

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.780 
need to cut out one for the pads I'm
using<00:01:41.490> some<00:01:42.030> scrap<00:01:42.509> fleece<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.619> had<00:01:43.950> leftover

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
using some scrap fleece I had leftover

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.690 
using some scrap fleece I had leftover
but<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.600> course<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.200> cheaper<00:01:46.649> alternative

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
but of course a cheaper alternative

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.639 
but of course a cheaper alternative
would<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.759> felt<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.259> want<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> make<00:01:49.619> sure

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
would be felt you just want to make sure

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.490 
would be felt you just want to make sure
you<00:01:50.070> use<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.579> fabric<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.420> doesn't<00:01:52.020> fray

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
you use a fabric that doesn't fray

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.109 
you use a fabric that doesn't fray
easily<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:55.350> cut<00:01:55.649> out<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> large<00:01:56.729> pad

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
easily so cut out one of the large pad

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.540 
easily so cut out one of the large pad
and<00:01:57.479> four<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.829> finger<00:01:59.369> pads

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
and four of the finger pads

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.220 
and four of the finger pads
so<00:02:01.550> here<00:02:01.850> they<00:02:02.000> all<00:02:02.180> are<00:02:02.480> take<00:02:03.110> the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
so here they all are take the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.500 
so here they all are take the
best-looking<00:02:03.830> side<00:02:04.130> of<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.580> stocking<00:02:04.880> fabric

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
best-looking side of the stocking fabric

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.750 
best-looking side of the stocking fabric
and<00:02:05.720> line<00:02:05.960> up<00:02:06.230> the<00:02:06.260> pattern<00:02:06.830> again<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.370> make<00:02:07.550> it

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
and line up the pattern again to make it

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.480 
and line up the pattern again to make it
easy<00:02:08.030> to<00:02:08.300> line<00:02:08.509> up<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.899> pop<00:02:09.110> pieces<00:02:09.560> pin<00:02:10.340> them

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
easy to line up the pop pieces pin them

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.420 
easy to line up the pop pieces pin them
in<00:02:10.610> place<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.600> chose<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.740> machine<00:02:13.100> sew

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
in place and so I chose to machine sew

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.340 
in place and so I chose to machine sew
but<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:13.850> can<00:02:14.060> easily<00:02:14.270> be<00:02:14.510> done<00:02:14.690> with<00:02:15.080> hand

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
but this can easily be done with hand

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.190 
but this can easily be done with hand

was<00:03:04.190> kind<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.640> bad<00:03:04.820> idea<00:03:05.030> because<00:03:05.959> it<00:03:06.560> frays

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
was kind of a bad idea because it frays

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.460 
was kind of a bad idea because it frays
and<00:03:07.070> leaves<00:03:07.610> little<00:03:07.790> fuzzies<00:03:08.390> everywhere<00:03:09.049> and

and leaves little fuzzies everywhere and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.729 
and leaves little fuzzies everywhere and
that<00:03:10.100> happened<00:03:10.519> in<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.880> last<00:03:11.120> project<00:03:11.900> but

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
that happened in the last project but

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.650 
that happened in the last project but
you<00:03:13.040> can<00:03:13.340> just<00:03:13.519> use<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.910> same<00:03:14.090> fleece<00:03:14.420> or

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
you can just use the same fleece or

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
measure out the size of the band I just

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.539
