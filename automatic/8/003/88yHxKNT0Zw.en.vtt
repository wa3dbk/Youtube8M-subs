to aim for the chest or the stomach and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.420 
to aim for the chest or the stomach and
about<00:01:29.970> half<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.390> those<00:01:30.450> situations<00:01:31.100> this<00:01:32.100> will

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
about half of those situations this will

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.819 
about half of those situations this will
go<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.939> well<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.740> be

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
go very well it's not going to be

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.410 
go very well it's not going to be
overpowered<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> only<00:01:36.150> way<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> be

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
overpowered because the only way to be

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.330 
overpowered because the only way to be
overpowered<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.470> worked<00:01:38.040> for<00:01:38.250> your

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
overpowered is if it worked for your

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.060 
overpowered is if it worked for your
entire<00:01:38.610> body<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:40.140> that's<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.650> simply<00:01:40.950> not

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
entire body and that's just simply not

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.370 
entire body and that's just simply not
the<00:01:41.310> case<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.270> think<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.869> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.290> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the case so I think it's going to be a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.370 
the case so I think it's going to be a
great<00:01:43.860> option<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:45.540> me<00:01:45.689> personally<00:01:45.869> I

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
great option to have for me personally I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.139 
great option to have for me personally I
will<00:01:46.470> probably<00:01:46.920> use<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.549> because<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.970> get

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
will probably use it because I get

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.539 
will probably use it because I get
frustrated<00:01:48.420> by<00:01:49.020> those<00:01:49.229> shotgun<00:01:49.740> guys<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.340> I'm

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
frustrated by those shotgun guys so I'm

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.010 
frustrated by those shotgun guys so I'm
probably<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.509> into<00:01:51.750> that

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
probably going to get right into that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.380 
probably going to get right into that
now<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> second<00:01:53.430> perk<00:01:53.610> I've<00:01:53.820> always<00:01:54.119> pre

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
now the second perk I've always pre

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
now the second perk I've always pre
interesting<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> stealth<00:01:55.619> perk<00:01:55.920> again

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
interesting is the stealth perk again

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.950 
interesting is the stealth perk again
people<00:01:56.670> seen<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.930> just

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
people seen that is like you can just

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.080 
people seen that is like you can just
flanked<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.159> know<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.490> whatever<00:01:59.729> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
flanked with you know or whatever and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.539 
flanked with you know or whatever and
there's<00:02:00.659> no<00:02:00.899> way<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.350> counter<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.189> in

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
there's no way to counter that in

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.580 
there's no way to counter that in
battlefield<00:02:03.360> there's<00:02:03.570> always<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.960> counter<00:02:04.560> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
battlefield there's always a counter to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.999 
battlefield there's always a counter to
everything<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.090> no<00:02:06.270> exception<00:02:07.009> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
everything and this is no exception the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.219 
everything and this is no exception the
stove<00:02:08.280> perk<00:02:08.580> will<00:02:08.789> work<00:02:09.060> okay<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.869> will<00:02:09.989> work

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
stove perk will work okay it will work

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.900 
stove perk will work okay it will work
most<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.830> time<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.879> are

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
most of the time but if you are

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.280 
most of the time but if you are
sprinting<00:02:12.599> you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
sprinting you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.199 
sprinting you
will<00:02:13.439> be<00:02:13.620> seen<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.129> mini-map<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.969> like

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
will be seen on the mini-map just like

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.050 
will be seen on the mini-map just like
normal<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.980> anything<00:02:16.980> besides<00:02:17.370> sprinting

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
normal so anything besides sprinting

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.119 
normal so anything besides sprinting
you'll<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.599> fine<00:02:18.780> if<00:02:19.079> you're<00:02:19.349> sprinting<00:02:19.709> it

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
you'll be fine if you're sprinting it

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.280 
you'll be fine if you're sprinting it
will<00:02:20.640> use<00:02:20.909> but<00:02:21.299> still<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.629> shown<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.019> on<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
will use but still be shown up on the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.559 
will use but still be shown up on the
minimap<00:02:22.409> by<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.310> know<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:23.849> motion<00:02:24.120> balls

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
minimap by you know like motion balls

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.720 
minimap by you know like motion balls
and<00:02:25.049> and<00:02:25.230> all<00:02:25.469> of<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.159> that's<00:02:26.489> pretty

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
and and all of that so that's pretty

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.670 
and and all of that so that's pretty
much<00:02:26.939> that<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.900> last<00:02:28.109> thing<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.290> wanted<00:02:28.530> to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
much that and the last thing I wanted to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.800 
much that and the last thing I wanted to
go<00:02:28.829> over<00:02:28.859> is<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.189> quick<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.879> spot<00:02:30.450> now<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
go over is the quick on spot now the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.990 
go over is the quick on spot now the
quicken<00:02:31.200> spot<00:02:31.470> itself<00:02:31.890> doesn't<00:02:32.370> really<00:02:32.670> do

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
quicken spot itself doesn't really do

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.849 
quicken spot itself doesn't really do
that<00:02:33.030> much<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.870> initially<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.349> thought<00:02:34.650> it

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
that much and initially I thought it

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.360 
that much and initially I thought it
would<00:02:35.040> be<00:02:35.189> really<00:02:35.730> good<00:02:36.090> because<00:02:36.200> my<00:02:37.370> idea

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
would be really good because my idea

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.280 
would be really good because my idea
would<00:02:38.519> be<00:02:38.579> just<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.329> know<00:02:39.450> someone<00:02:39.810> spots<00:02:40.079> you

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
would be just you know someone spots you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.839 
would be just you know someone spots you
you<00:02:40.530> get<00:02:40.709> unspotted<00:02:41.129> straight<00:02:41.519> away<00:02:41.700> it's

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
you get unspotted straight away it's

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.009 
you get unspotted straight away it's
just<00:02:42.000> one<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.180> those<00:02:42.269> things<00:02:42.389> that<00:02:42.659> you<00:02:42.780> have

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
just one of those things that you have

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.589 
just one of those things that you have
actually<00:02:43.769> what's<00:02:44.549> going<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.879> be<00:02:45.000> happening<00:02:45.030> is

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
actually what's going to be happening is

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.960 
actually what's going to be happening is
normally<00:02:46.139> you're<00:02:46.379> spotted<00:02:46.769> 47<00:02:47.250> seconds<00:02:47.730> now

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
normally you're spotted 47 seconds now

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.729 
normally you're spotted 47 seconds now
it's<00:02:48.120> going<00:02:48.359> to<00:02:48.540> just<00:02:48.780> reduce<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.379> five

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
it's going to just reduce that to five

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.679 
it's going to just reduce that to five
seconds<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.400> don't<00:02:50.730> really<00:02:50.909> see<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.209> point<00:02:51.329> in

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
seconds I don't really see the point in

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.569 
seconds I don't really see the point in
using<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.349> don't<00:02:52.980> know<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.370> two

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
using it I don't know is that two

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.800 
using it I don't know is that two
seconds<00:02:54.060> really<00:02:54.299> going<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.629> make<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
seconds really going to make a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.780 
seconds really going to make a
difference<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.470> only<00:02:55.500> words<00:02:55.950> ain't<00:02:56.280> making<00:02:56.700> a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
difference the only words ain't making a

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.699 
difference the only words ain't making a
difference<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.419> if<00:02:57.629> you're<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.109> a<00:02:58.139> camping

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
difference is if you're like a camping

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.280 
difference is if you're like a camping
sniper<00:02:59.040> or<00:02:59.310> something<00:02:59.700> but<00:02:59.879> besides<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:00.900> I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
sniper or something but besides that I

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.319 
sniper or something but besides that I
don't<00:03:02.129> really<00:03:02.280> see<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.700> difference<00:03:02.730> but

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
don't really see the difference but

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.520 
don't really see the difference but
