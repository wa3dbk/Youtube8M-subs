they<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.560> w.e<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.729> he<00:01:17.820> followed<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.119> bit

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
they are and w.e so he followed a bit

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.590 
they are and w.e so he followed a bit
more<00:01:19.250> he<00:01:20.250> felt<00:01:20.460> liberated<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.210> being

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
more he felt liberated you know being

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.810 
more he felt liberated you know being
there<00:01:21.780> but<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.920> ended<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.369> being<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
there but it ended up being for the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.370 
there but it ended up being for the
worst<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.270> mean<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.509> whole<00:01:24.689> driving<00:01:25.229> while

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
worst I mean this whole driving while

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.200 
worst I mean this whole driving while
intoxicated<00:01:25.500> thing<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.580> crashing<00:01:26.970> into<00:01:27.180> a

intoxicated thing and crashing into a
tree<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:27.960> whether<00:01:28.229> he<00:01:28.409> did<00:01:28.530> or<00:01:28.590> not

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
tree I think whether he did or not

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
tree I think whether he did or not
crashing<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> truth<00:01:29.610> point<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.970> he<00:01:30.119> was

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
crashing the truth point is he was
