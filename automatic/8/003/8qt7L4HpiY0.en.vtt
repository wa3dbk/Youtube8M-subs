00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:13.520
So, now is the time to work on our abs.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.580
I've been seeing some of you out there with
half tops, no shirts, and let me tell you

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.150
people, it doesn't look pretty.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.320
I'm just saying.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.560
I'm bringing it real.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.599
I teach cause I care.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.509
So, what we're going to do now is some body
waves.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.290
Now, you can work out your abs and look sexy
at the same time.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.540
And you're like, no way Seabreeze.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.920
And I'm like, "Yes way!"

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.930
I'm gonna show you how it's done.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.510
So, you gonna let your feet go slightly over
shoulder width apart.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.240
You're gonna turn a little bit to the diagonal.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.140
Make sure your toes are pointed in the same
direction.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.410
Now, breaking down your forehead, goes back.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.160
Bring it to your chest and then you drop it
into your hips.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.980
And that's the basic breakdown.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.410
Remember, let your forehead drop back.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.410
Boom.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.410
Chest.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.410
Boom.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.410
Hips.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.410
Boom.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.180
Now, when you put them all together, it looks
like a wave.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.810
And I like this because it with like my name.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.020
Seabreee, Bodywave.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.960
And you can do it to any side.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
And this again, you can do it anywhere.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.040
On a crowded subway is best because you really
get a seat.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.390
Start doing this in front of the person.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.390
You know what they think?

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.030
You need to sit down.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.310
You can do this right at the beach.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.080
Just in case you forgot and took your shirt
off and everything didn't look too great.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.960
You can start rolling, waving.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.680
One more time.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.350
Let's break it down one more time.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.070
Because some people, it's a little, little
stiff.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.910
So, let's just make sure it's smooth.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:49.970
You wanna make sure it's smooth.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.920
Remember, your feet are a little bit shoulder
width apart.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.090
Don't forget to breathe because if you fall
out, it's gonna look crazy.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.170
Trust me.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.610
You waving and you fall, it's not cute.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.690
So, remember, forehead, boom, chest, boom.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.690
Forehead.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.690
Chest.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.690
Hips.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.690
Remember to sit in your hips.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.340
Now, if you want to reverse it, you can bring
it back up.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.480
Hey, taking it back.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.480
Forehead.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.480
Chest.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480
Hips.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.480
Hips.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.480
Chest.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480
Forehead.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480
Forehead.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.480
Chest.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480
Hips.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.480
I think we got it.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.480
Now, remember to smooth it out.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.480
This is just the break down.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.180
You don't wanna be out there on the dance
floor doing this.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.380
They gonna talk about you when you leave.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.380
Trust me.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.420
Make sure you smooth it out.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.970
I feel it.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.460
You know what?

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:52.950
You know what would really make me feel it?

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.100
DJ, you know what I'm talking about.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.670
Now, rememeber to engage your abs.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:17.700
When you lift up your shirt, you want it to
be really, really smooth, like your body wave.
