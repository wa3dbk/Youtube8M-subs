00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
ripping you off my answer this might be

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.020 
ripping you off my answer this might be
very<00:00:12.570> different<00:00:12.809> from<00:00:13.139> Pat's<00:00:13.500> but<00:00:13.799> um<00:00:14.099> there's

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
very different from Pat's but um there's

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.700 
very different from Pat's but um there's
almost<00:00:15.269> no<00:00:15.719> way<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.020> guarantee<00:00:16.320> you're

almost no way to guarantee you're

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.620 
almost no way to guarantee you're
getting<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.070> manual<00:00:17.580> with<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:18.060> game

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
getting a manual with a game

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.529 
getting a manual with a game
I<00:00:18.660> mean<00:00:18.930> buying<00:00:19.890> manuals<00:00:20.699> if<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.119> want<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.420> buy

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
I mean buying manuals if you want to buy

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.929 
I mean buying manuals if you want to buy
them<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.990> lot<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.410> times<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.550> have<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
them a lot of times I think you have to

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.910 
them a lot of times I think you have to
buy<00:00:24.060> them<00:00:24.300> separately<00:00:24.630> there<00:00:25.410> are<00:00:25.500> people<00:00:25.800> who

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
buy them separately there are people who

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.759 
buy them separately there are people who
can<00:00:26.189> overcharge<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.359> price<00:00:27.710> but<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
can overcharge you on the price but I

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.990 
can overcharge you on the price but I
don't<00:00:29.279> think<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.060> they<00:00:30.480> are<00:00:30.949> intentionally

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
don't think that they are intentionally

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.459 
don't think that they are intentionally
milking<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.210> customer<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.870> think<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.350> at

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
milking the customer I think they can at

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.470 
milking the customer I think they can at
times<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.860> think<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.120> do<00:00:36.270> see

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
times I think you you actually do see

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.729 
times I think you you actually do see
auctions<00:00:36.870> where<00:00:37.050> they<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> rare<00:00:37.559> game

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
auctions where they have a rare game

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.799 
auctions where they have a rare game
they'll<00:00:38.040> separate<00:00:38.579> out<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.000> manual<00:00:39.360> from<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
they'll separate out the manual from it

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.240 
they'll separate out the manual from it
because<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.110> know<00:00:40.320> they'll<00:00:40.469> maximize<00:00:41.040> their

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
because I do know they'll maximize their

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
because I do know they'll maximize their
value<00:00:41.280> harpus<00:00:42.000> yes<00:00:42.390> okay<00:00:42.899> yeah<00:00:43.200> well<00:00:43.440> then

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
value harpus yes okay yeah well then

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.020 
value harpus yes okay yeah well then
that's<00:00:43.739> bullish<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.550> if<00:00:44.730> they<00:00:44.879> have

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that's bullish they have it if they have

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.139 
that's bullish they have it if they have
a<00:00:45.059> DuckTales<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:46.070> manual<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.489> game<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.059> they

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
a DuckTales to manual in game or they

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.430 
a DuckTales to manual in game or they
have<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> panic<00:00:48.660> restaurant<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:49.260> will

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
have a panic restaurant they will

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.900 
have a panic restaurant they will
separate<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> out<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:50.399> they'll<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.760> more

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
separate it out because they'll get more

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.850 
separate it out because they'll get more
money<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.329> okay<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.809> guess<00:00:52.379> I'm<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.739> thinking

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
money for okay I guess I'm just thinking

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.869 
money for okay I guess I'm just thinking
like<00:00:53.719> Luna<00:00:54.719> has<00:00:55.190> alphabetized<00:00:56.190> boxes<00:00:56.760> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
like Luna has alphabetized boxes of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.060 
like Luna has alphabetized boxes of
manuals<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.559> pick<00:00:58.859> what

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
manuals and you can you know pick what

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.069 
manuals and you can you know pick what
you<00:00:59.219> want<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.660> don't<00:01:00.899> that's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
you want and we can I don't that's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.540 
you want and we can I don't that's
repaired<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.770> don't<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.190> those<00:01:02.370> those<00:01:02.489> are

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
repaired we don't have those those are

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.109 
repaired we don't have those those are
only<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.850> pet<00:01:03.199> or<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.500> go<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
only for pet or you can go to like a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.010 
only for pet or you can go to like a
convention<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.270> find<00:01:06.510> people<00:01:06.720> who<00:01:06.869> have

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
convention and find people who have

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080 
convention and find people who have
boxes<00:01:07.770> manuals<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.250> don't<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:08.820> those<00:01:08.909> people

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
boxes manuals I don't think those people

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.730 
boxes manuals I don't think those people
are<00:01:09.270> milking<00:01:09.720> they're<00:01:09.900> helping<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.350> complete

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
are milking they're helping you complete

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.420 
are milking they're helping you complete
your<00:01:10.830> collection

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
your collection

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.910 
your collection
but<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> guess<00:01:12.210> what<00:01:12.659> Pat<00:01:12.900> says<00:01:13.260> probably<00:01:13.590> has

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
but I guess what Pat says probably has

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
but I guess what Pat says probably has
some<00:01:14.159> validity<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:15.799> most<00:01:16.799> I'd<00:01:17.070> say<00:01:17.310> 90%<00:01:17.970> for

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
some validity now most I'd say 90% for

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
some validity now most I'd say 90% for
example<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.840> NES<00:01:19.049> manuals<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.830> for

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
example of NES manuals you can get for

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.429 
example of NES manuals you can get for
Cup<00:01:20.130> dollars<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:20.549> less<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:21.030> mean<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.290> now

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
Cup dollars or less I mean I have now

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.890 
Cup dollars or less I mean I have now
over<00:01:22.710> 500<00:01:22.920> manuals<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.299> probably<00:01:24.600> do

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
over 500 manuals and I probably do

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.149 
over 500 manuals and I probably do
haven't<00:01:25.110> spent<00:01:25.320> more<00:01:25.500> than<00:01:25.560> 10<00:01:25.799> bucks<00:01:25.979> at

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
or on most of them I probably spend less
