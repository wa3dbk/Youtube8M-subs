final the women's final is starting on

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.840 
final the women's final is starting on
the<00:00:04.170> right<00:00:04.290> side<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.710> wall<00:00:04.859> it's

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
the right side of the wall it's

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.360 
the right side of the wall it's
basically<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.779> few<00:00:07.350> olds<00:00:07.710> all<00:00:07.859> these<00:00:08.040> orange

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
basically a few olds all these orange

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.000 
basically a few olds all these orange
slopers<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.150> very<00:00:09.660> small<00:00:09.900> feet<00:00:10.200> starts<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:10.920> a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
slopers and very small feet starts in a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.009 
slopers and very small feet starts in a
corner<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.519> it's<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.700> little<00:00:11.910> bit<00:00:12.030> tricky<00:00:12.540> how

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
corner and it's a little bit tricky how

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.600 
corner and it's a little bit tricky how
to<00:00:13.080> press<00:00:13.349> into<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.590> dihedral<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.309> move<00:00:14.460> up

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
to press into the dihedral and move up

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.000 
to press into the dihedral and move up
and<00:00:14.790> then<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:15.540> basically<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.410> physical

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and then it's basically just a physical

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.560 
and then it's basically just a physical
powerful<00:00:17.640> finish<00:00:17.910> how<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> find<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> right

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
powerful finish how to find the right

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.620 
powerful finish how to find the right
position<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.619> come<00:00:19.770> around<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.010> corner

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
position to to come around the corner

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.870 
position to to come around the corner
problem<00:00:21.630> two<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.810> uh<00:00:21.990> all<00:00:22.710> purple<00:00:23.430> volumes

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
problem two is uh all purple volumes

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.790 
problem two is uh all purple volumes
it's<00:00:24.060> basically<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.449> wall<00:00:24.689> filled<00:00:25.140> with<00:00:25.320> with

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it's basically a wall filled with with

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.160 
it's basically a wall filled with with
volumes<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.430> yeah<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.240> takes<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.660> bit<00:00:28.140> of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
volumes and yeah it takes a bit of

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.800 
volumes and yeah it takes a bit of
compression<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.010> also<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.640> knowing<00:00:30.599> how<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
compression and also just knowing how to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.060 
compression and also just knowing how to
maneuver<00:00:31.260> through<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.529> volumes<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
maneuver through the volumes in the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.700 
maneuver through the volumes in the
right<00:00:32.219> way<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> bit<00:00:33.000> tricky

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
right way it's really a bit tricky

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.920 
right way it's really a bit tricky
problem<00:00:34.710> three<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.820> short<00:00:36.030> fairly

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
problem three is really short fairly

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.549 
problem three is really short fairly
basic<00:00:37.910> but<00:00:38.910> involves<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.690> kind<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.230> tricky

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
basic but involves a kind of a tricky

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.459 
basic but involves a kind of a tricky
jump<00:00:41.010> basically<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.940> start<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.360> two<00:00:43.170> okay

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
jump basically you start on two okay

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.250 
jump basically you start on two okay
hold<00:00:43.649> move<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.489> Ana<00:00:44.640> read<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.120> find<00:00:45.930> one

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
hold move to to Ana read and find one

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.869 
hold move to to Ana read and find one
way<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:46.530> another<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:47.010> jump<00:00:47.280> around<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.579> corner

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
way or another to jump around the corner

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.619 
way or another to jump around the corner
and<00:00:48.059> then<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.420> hard<00:00:49.110> match<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.980> finish<00:00:50.629> problem

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
and then a hard match to finish problem

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.389 
and then a hard match to finish problem
for<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> steepest<00:00:52.860> section<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
for is in the steepest section of the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.600 
for is in the steepest section of the
wall<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.539> yeah<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.289> basically<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.980> mix

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
wall and it's yeah it's basically a mix

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.090 
wall and it's yeah it's basically a mix
of<00:00:56.789> styles<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.570> gymnastic<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.590> powerful

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
of styles it's gymnastic and powerful

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.819 
of styles it's gymnastic and powerful
it's<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.239> bit<00:01:00.690> longer<00:01:01.020> than<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.710> other

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
it's it's bit longer than the other

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.889 
it's it's bit longer than the other
problem<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.609> tests<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.329> climbers<00:01:03.750> in

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
problem so it tests the climbers in

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.570 
problem so it tests the climbers in
terms<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> how<00:01:04.320> long<00:01:04.530> they<00:01:04.739> they<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.369> stay<00:01:05.519> on

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
terms of how long they they can stay on

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.910 
terms of how long they they can stay on
the<00:01:05.700> wall<00:01:05.930> but<00:01:06.930> yeah<00:01:07.200> moves<00:01:07.470> through<00:01:07.710> has<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the wall but yeah moves through has a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.130 
the wall but yeah moves through has a
small<00:01:08.220> jump<00:01:08.520> maybe<00:01:08.729> maybe<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.600> jump<00:01:09.869> maybe<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
small jump maybe maybe a jump maybe a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.990 
small jump maybe maybe a jump maybe a
static<00:01:10.530> we'll<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.369> then

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
static we'll see what they do and then

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.320 
static we'll see what they do and then
yeah<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.080> hard<00:01:13.290> hard<00:01:13.740> finish<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:15.060> some

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
yeah just a hard hard finish on some

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.719 
yeah just a hard hard finish on some
small<00:01:15.540> holds<00:01:15.810> why<00:01:16.500> men's<00:01:16.920> problem<00:01:17.340> worn<00:01:17.580> in

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
small holds why men's problem worn in

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.880 
small holds why men's problem worn in
the<00:01:17.820> final<00:01:18.240> tell<00:01:18.540> us<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.960> men's

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the final tell us all about it men's

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.560 
the final tell us all about it men's
problem<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.280> starts<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.150> left<00:01:21.360> corner

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
problem one starts in the left corner

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.840 
problem one starts in the left corner
and<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.229> takes<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.950> lot<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.130> space<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.700> it's

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and it takes up a lot of space but it's

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.359 
and it takes up a lot of space but it's
basically<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:25.200> sequence<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> three<00:01:26.009> moves

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
basically a sequence of three moves

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.980 
basically a sequence of three moves
there's<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> number<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.000> holes<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.509> basically

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
there's a number of holes but basically

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.600 
there's a number of holes but basically
you<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> find<00:01:28.740> your<00:01:28.920> way<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.070> get<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you have to find your way to get the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
you have to find your way to get the
right<00:01:29.729> balance<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.420> kind<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
right balance to kind of do a little a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.340 
right balance to kind of do a little a
little<00:01:32.100> skate<00:01:32.490> style<00:01:32.820> jump<00:01:33.180> move<00:01:33.360> at<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
little skate style jump move at the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.039 
little skate style jump move at the
start<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:35.310> second<00:01:36.119> jump<00:01:36.299> move<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:36.780> kind

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
start a second jump move and then kind

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.050 
start a second jump move and then kind
of<00:01:37.140> an<00:01:37.259> easy<00:01:37.409> finish<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.400> about<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> bit

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
of an easy finish but it's about a bit

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.590 
of an easy finish but it's about a bit
of<00:01:39.150> coordination<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.079> bit<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.320> balance

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
of coordination and a bit of balance
