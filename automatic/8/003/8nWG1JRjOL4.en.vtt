Technical Tip: How to descale a hand shower 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:14.235
Should the hand shower be scaled after a long period of use

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:18.274
or due to water hardness,

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:22.504
it needs to be descaled.

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:26.076
Proceed like this:

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:31.884
Remove the hand shower from the hose, 

00:00:31.884 --> 00:00:39.736
fill some descaler in a flat bowl

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:50.144
put in the hand shower up to the spray head and soak it for 3-5 minutes.

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:56.289
Put on rubber gloves for your own protection  

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.241
and remove the hand shower after 3-5 minutes.

00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:12.125
It is very important to rinse the hand shower with clean water afterwards.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:21.127
Do not only attach it to the hose and turn on the water, but also clean it from the outside.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:37.756
Do not forget to insert the fine mesh filter 

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:40.227
before reconnecting the hand shower.

00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:46.719
Now make sure to properly rinse the hand shower before use

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:53.175
in order to wash out all residue of the descaler.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.350
Another advice: Use the Hansgrohe QuickClean Function

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:10.363
and rub off the spray head from time to time to protect it from scale.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:15.332
To descale shower heads and faucets, do not use cleaning products containing vinegar

00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:20.825
but rather descalers based on citric acid

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:26.237
to enjoy your Hansgrohe products for a longer time.
