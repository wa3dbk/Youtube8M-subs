00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
welcome to a different video this is

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.810 
welcome to a different video this is
going<00:00:07.460> to<00:00:07.550> I<00:00:07.729> carve<00:00:08.090> on<00:00:08.269> my<00:00:08.900> ps4<00:00:09.440> to<00:00:10.340> turn<00:00:10.700> it

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
going to I carve on my ps4 to turn it

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.239 
going to I carve on my ps4 to turn it
into<00:00:10.940> a<00:00:11.059> white<00:00:11.269> ps4<00:00:11.780> that<00:00:12.559> I've<00:00:12.679> got<00:00:12.889> from<00:00:13.099> the

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:13.249 
into a white ps4 that I've got from the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:18.660 
into a white ps4 that I've got from the
UK<00:00:13.639> distribution<00:00:14.889> from<00:00:15.889> phone<00:00:16.430> manic<00:00:16.760> Kodu<00:00:17.420> UK

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
UK distribution from phone manic Kodu UK

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.590 
UK distribution from phone manic Kodu UK
but<00:00:19.670> I<00:00:19.700> think<00:00:19.850> it'd<00:00:19.940> be<00:00:19.970> a<00:00:20.060> slight<00:00:20.330> quicker

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
but I think it'd be a slight quicker

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.160 
but I think it'd be a slight quicker
than<00:00:20.840> ordinate<00:00:21.560> by<00:00:22.040> the<00:00:22.100> u.s.<00:00:22.790> site<00:00:23.000> so<00:00:23.360> lot

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
than ordinate by the u.s. site so lot

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.730 
than ordinate by the u.s. site so lot
easier<00:00:24.500> so<00:00:25.460> we<00:00:25.490> got<00:00:26.170> two<00:00:27.170> pieces<00:00:27.560> for<00:00:27.680> each

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
easier so we got two pieces for each

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.030 
easier so we got two pieces for each
side<00:00:28.040> so<00:00:28.820> once<00:00:29.270> one<00:00:29.480> side<00:00:29.770> and<00:00:30.770> you<00:00:30.860> got<00:00:30.950> a

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
side so once one side and you got a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.060 
side so once one side and you got a
point<00:00:31.190> for<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.460> other<00:00:31.580> side<00:00:32.920> then<00:00:33.920> you<00:00:33.950> got

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
point for the other side then you got

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.680 
point for the other side then you got
yeah

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
yeah
