alright<00:04:05.440> now<00:04:05.830> we<00:04:05.890> made<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.520> all<00:04:06.670> our<00:04:06.850> wiring

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
alright now we made the all our wiring

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.550 
alright now we made the all our wiring
connections<00:04:07.660> here<00:04:07.840> behind<00:04:07.990> the<00:04:08.140> taillights

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
connections here behind the taillights

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.710 
connections here behind the taillights
I'm<00:04:08.740> go<00:04:08.890> ahead<00:04:09.040> take<00:04:09.280> some<00:04:09.310> black<00:04:09.610> tape<00:04:09.880> and

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
I'm go ahead take some black tape and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.720 
I'm go ahead take some black tape and
wrap<00:04:10.900> our<00:04:11.050> wires<00:04:11.230> back<00:04:11.530> up<00:04:11.740> got<00:04:12.370> our<00:04:12.490> wires

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
wrap our wires back up got our wires

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.220 
wrap our wires back up got our wires
taped<00:04:13.150> back<00:04:13.330> up<00:04:13.600> go<00:04:14.080> ahead<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.410> reconnect

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
taped back up go ahead and reconnect

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.350 
taped back up go ahead and reconnect
connectors<00:04:17.230> put<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.250> back<00:04:18.400> in<00:04:18.550> place<00:04:18.790> we'll<00:04:19.330> go

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
connectors put it back in place we'll go

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.660 
connectors put it back in place we'll go
ahead<00:04:19.420> and<00:04:19.570> put<00:04:19.720> our<00:04:20.160> carpet<00:04:21.160> panels<00:04:21.460> back<00:04:21.610> in

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
ahead and put our carpet panels back in

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.000 
ahead and put our carpet panels back in
place<00:04:21.970> that<00:04:22.960> completes<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.440> passenger<00:04:23.830> side

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
place that completes the passenger side

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.380 
place that completes the passenger side
I<00:04:24.070> repeat<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.610> same<00:04:24.790> process<00:04:25.000> on<00:04:25.270> the

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
I repeat the same process on the

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.710 
I repeat the same process on the
driver's<00:04:25.780> side<00:04:26.190> we<00:04:27.190> have<00:04:27.310> left<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.850> connect

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
driver's side we have left to connect

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.390 
driver's side we have left to connect
our<00:04:28.870> battery<00:04:29.050> wire<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.770> reason<00:04:30.100> for<00:04:30.130> that

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
our battery wire and the reason for that

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.500 
our battery wire and the reason for that
is<00:04:30.550> because<00:04:30.580> we're<00:04:30.940> going<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.090> need<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.300> route

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
is because we're going to need to route

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.390 
is because we're going to need to route
it<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.410> front<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.800> vehicle<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.280> make

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
it to the front of the vehicle and make

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.190 
it to the front of the vehicle and make
an<00:04:33.580> actual<00:04:33.730> connection<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.510> battery<00:04:34.870> post

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
an actual connection to a battery post

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.410 
an actual connection to a battery post
to<00:04:36.010> route<00:04:36.190> our<00:04:36.340> power<00:04:36.580> wire<00:04:36.820> we're<00:04:37.150> going<00:04:37.330> to

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
to route our power wire we're going to

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.660 
to route our power wire we're going to
access<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.170> spare<00:04:38.440> tire<00:04:38.680> here<00:04:41.580> we're<00:04:42.580> going

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
access the spare tire here we're going

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.600 
access the spare tire here we're going
to<00:04:42.790> run<00:04:42.910> our<00:04:43.030> wire<00:04:43.240> through<00:04:43.690> this<00:04:43.840> grommet<00:04:44.350> and

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
to run our wire through this grommet and

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.090 
to run our wire through this grommet and
under<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.730> vehicle<00:04:46.680> we're<00:04:47.680> gonna<00:04:47.770> go<00:04:47.980> ahead

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
under the vehicle we're gonna go ahead

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.120 
under the vehicle we're gonna go ahead
and<00:04:48.340> remove<00:04:48.730> the<00:04:49.120> rubber<00:04:49.360> grommet<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.860> that<00:04:51.010> we

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
and remove the rubber grommet so that we

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.640 
and remove the rubber grommet so that we
can<00:04:51.340> feed<00:04:52.180> our<00:04:52.330> wire<00:04:52.510> through<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:55.500> now<00:04:56.500> we've

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
can feed our wire through it now we've

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.920 
can feed our wire through it now we've
got<00:04:56.770> all<00:04:56.890> of<00:04:57.040> our<00:04:57.220> wired<00:04:57.520> pull<00:04:57.850> through<00:04:58.120> the
