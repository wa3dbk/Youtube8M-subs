see<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.289> shape<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.799> little<00:02:07.860> bit<00:02:08.130> better<00:02:09.259> okay

so after I've brushed the eyebrows
through<00:02:12.299> what<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.600> going<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.170> I'm

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
through what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.309 
through what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.190> use<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.640> Paris<00:02:15.090> Berlin<00:02:15.450> eyebrow

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
going to use a Paris Berlin eyebrow

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.430 
going to use a Paris Berlin eyebrow
pencil<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.400> brown<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.480> define<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.019> eyebrows

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
pencil in brown to define the eyebrows

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.559 
pencil in brown to define the eyebrows
like<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.950> said<00:02:20.130> before<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.790> theater<00:02:21.269> lights

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
like I said before the theater lights

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.630 
like I said before the theater lights
tend<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.989> bleach<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.410> out<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.799> stage<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.610> you

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
tend to bleach you out on stage so you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.220 
tend to bleach you out on stage so you
need<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.940> define<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.450> features<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.079> you've

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
need to define the features that you've

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.720 
need to define the features that you've
got<00:02:26.329> so<00:02:27.680> usually<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.890> use<00:02:29.040> an<00:02:29.160> eyebrow<00:02:29.340> pencil

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
got so usually you use an eyebrow pencil

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.990 
got so usually you use an eyebrow pencil
just<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:31.040> pencil<00:02:32.040> in<00:02:32.160> gaps<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.700> things<00:02:32.820> like

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
just to pencil in gaps and things like

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.400 
just to pencil in gaps and things like
that<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:33.359> you<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.660> actually<00:02:33.870> go<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> little

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
that but you can actually go a little

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.759 
that but you can actually go a little
bit<00:02:34.620> heavier<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.570> really<00:02:36.570> define<00:02:37.019> them<00:02:37.290> with

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
bit heavier and really define them with

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:57.520 
bit heavier and really define them with
the<00:02:37.920> pencil

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.170 

okay<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.620> what<00:02:58.830> I'm<00:02:58.890> gonna<00:02:58.980> do<00:02:59.160> next<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.730> we

place<00:06:49.940> on<00:06:50.270> the<00:06:50.390> face<00:06:50.630> the<00:06:50.870> important<00:06:51.380> place<00:06:51.560> to

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
place on the face the important place to

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.030 
place on the face the important place to
say<00:06:51.890> pay<00:06:52.100> attention<00:06:52.520> to<00:06:52.670> is<00:06:52.880> the<00:06:52.940> eyelids

say pay attention to is the eyelids

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.500 
say pay attention to is the eyelids
after<00:06:55.040> that<00:06:55.190> we<00:06:55.430> moved<00:06:55.640> on<00:06:55.850> to<00:06:55.880> the<00:06:56.000> eyebrows

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
after that we moved on to the eyebrows

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.800 
after that we moved on to the eyebrows
and<00:06:56.900> we<00:06:57.350> used<00:06:57.560> a<00:06:57.800> Paris<00:06:58.250> Berlin<00:06:58.610> Brown<00:06:59.180> eyebrow

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
and we used a Paris Berlin Brown eyebrow

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.620 
and we used a Paris Berlin Brown eyebrow
pencil<00:07:00.380> for<00:07:00.530> this<00:07:00.710> and<00:07:01.070> the<00:07:01.730> idea<00:07:02.090> of<00:07:02.210> this<00:07:02.360> is

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
pencil for this and the idea of this is

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.810 
pencil for this and the idea of this is
just<00:07:02.870> to<00:07:02.960> really<00:07:03.320> define<00:07:03.860> the<00:07:03.890> eyebrows<00:07:04.520> make

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820 
just to really define the eyebrows make

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.550 
just to really define the eyebrows make
sure<00:07:04.970> you've<00:07:05.120> got<00:07:05.330> a<00:07:05.360> good<00:07:05.660> shape<00:07:05.990> and<00:07:06.320> that

sure you've got a good shape and that

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.220 
sure you've got a good shape and that
they<00:07:06.680> can<00:07:06.860> be<00:07:06.980> seen<00:07:07.220> from<00:07:07.580> the<00:07:07.760> audience<00:07:08.230> after

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.230 
they can be seen from the audience after

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.320 
they can be seen from the audience after
the<00:07:09.620> eyebrows<00:07:10.010> we<00:07:10.160> moved<00:07:10.340> on<00:07:10.520> to<00:07:10.550> the<00:07:10.760> eyes<00:07:10.880> and

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
the eyebrows we moved on to the eyes and

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.840 
the eyebrows we moved on to the eyes and
we<00:07:12.080> started<00:07:12.560> with<00:07:12.710> a<00:07:12.770> Paris<00:07:13.100> Berlin<00:07:13.400> liquid

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850 
we started with a Paris Berlin liquid

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.230 
we started with a Paris Berlin liquid
eyeliner<00:07:14.270> and<00:07:15.310> what<00:07:16.310> we<00:07:16.430> did<00:07:16.640> was<00:07:16.910> we<00:07:16.940> just

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 
eyeliner and what we did was we just

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.910 
eyeliner and what we did was we just
basically<00:07:17.390> went<00:07:17.690> over<00:07:18.080> the<00:07:18.200> top<00:07:18.410> of<00:07:18.470> the<00:07:18.740> lid

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:18.920 
basically went over the top of the lid

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.520 
basically went over the top of the lid
and<00:07:19.130> really<00:07:19.850> defined<00:07:20.270> the<00:07:20.600> top<00:07:20.900> eyelid<00:07:21.350> and

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530 
and really defined the top eyelid and

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.530 
and really defined the top eyelid and
gave<00:07:21.980> a<00:07:22.010> little<00:07:22.220> flick<00:07:22.550> outward<00:07:22.970> so<00:07:23.180> it<00:07:23.240> really

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540 
gave a little flick outward so it really

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.980 
gave a little flick outward so it really
accentuated<00:07:23.900> it<00:07:25.240> moving<00:07:26.240> on<00:07:26.360> from<00:07:26.540> that<00:07:26.780> we

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990 
accentuated it moving on from that we

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.470 
accentuated it moving on from that we
use<00:07:27.230> the<00:07:27.380> Paris<00:07:27.740> balloon<00:07:28.040> black<00:07:28.400> mascara<00:07:29.120> we

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:29.480 
use the Paris balloon black mascara we

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.960 
use the Paris balloon black mascara we
used<00:07:29.660> black<00:07:29.990> because<00:07:30.470> it's<00:07:30.650> the<00:07:31.310> best<00:07:31.550> color

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:31.970 
used black because it's the best color

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.570 
used black because it's the best color
to<00:07:32.240> use<00:07:32.540> for<00:07:32.780> a<00:07:32.810> stage<00:07:33.110> to<00:07:33.530> define<00:07:34.370> the

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.580 
to use for a stage to define the

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.230 
to use for a stage to define the
eyelashes<00:07:35.620> after<00:07:36.620> that<00:07:36.770> we<00:07:36.950> went<00:07:37.160> on<00:07:37.370> to<00:07:37.670> a<00:07:37.700> Ben

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 
eyelashes after that we went on to a Ben

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.140 
eyelashes after that we went on to a Ben
Nye<00:07:38.540> blusher<00:07:39.200> which<00:07:40.040> was<00:07:40.280> in<00:07:40.400> a<00:07:40.460> rosy<00:07:40.730> color

Nye blusher which was in a rosy color
and<00:07:41.450> it<00:07:41.570> just<00:07:41.780> basically<00:07:41.930> gives<00:07:42.380> you<00:07:42.500> a<00:07:42.530> little

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:42.740 
and it just basically gives you a little

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.450 
and it just basically gives you a little
bit<00:07:42.920> of<00:07:43.040> color<00:07:43.250> and<00:07:43.340> defines<00:07:43.820> the<00:07:43.940> cheekbones
