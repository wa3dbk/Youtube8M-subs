few things to note on my update here is
that<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.410> added<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:36.290> for<00:00:37.290> fan<00:00:37.590> controller<00:00:38.219> right

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that I added a for fan controller right

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
that I added a for fan controller right
there<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.120> front<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:40.200> i<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.500> easily<00:00:42.170> DISA

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
there in the front so i can easily DISA

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.440 
there in the front so i can easily DISA
dimmed<00:00:43.530> LED<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.340> fans<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.270> will

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
dimmed LED on the fans and this will

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.790 
dimmed LED on the fans and this will
also<00:00:45.980> increase<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> decrease<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.760> speed<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
also increase and decrease the speed so

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.850 
also increase and decrease the speed so
right<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.950> got<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.370> set<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> way<00:00:51.059> up

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
right now I got it set all the way up

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.580 
right now I got it set all the way up
because<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.070> fans<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.520> i'm<00:00:53.670> using<00:00:53.699> are

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
because the fans that i'm using are

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.049 
because the fans that i'm using are
pretty<00:00:55.590> low<00:00:55.770> RPM<00:00:56.219> cons<00:00:56.460> they<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:56.789> move<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
pretty low RPM cons they don't move that

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.990 
pretty low RPM cons they don't move that
much<00:00:57.480> air<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:58.590> were<00:00:58.920> basically<00:00:59.250> four<00:00:59.730> sho<00:00:59.969> i

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
much air they were basically four sho i

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
much air they were basically four sho i
guess<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.960> case<00:01:01.410> itself<00:01:01.770> had<00:01:01.980> some

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
guess but the case itself had some

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.650 
guess but the case itself had some
decent<00:01:02.309> cooling<00:01:02.760> anyway<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.090> i<00:01:03.329> didn't<00:01:03.539> really

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
decent cooling anyway so i didn't really

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.800 
decent cooling anyway so i didn't really
need<00:01:03.870> high-end<00:01:04.260> fans<00:01:04.640> but<00:01:05.640> uh<00:01:05.670> oh<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.750> guys

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
need high-end fans but uh oh if you guys

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.750 
need high-end fans but uh oh if you guys
didn't<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> monitor<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> monitor

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
window blinds are open and I try to

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.630 
window blinds are open and I try to
bring<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.990> a<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.080> bit<00:02:10.350> more<00:02:10.500> light<00:02:10.740> into

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
bring it a little bit more light into

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.070 
bring it a little bit more light into
the<00:02:11.850> video<00:02:12.630> here<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.050> uh<00:02:13.520> yeah<00:02:14.520> basically

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the video here so uh yeah basically

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.550 
the video here so uh yeah basically
that's<00:02:16.080> about<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.590> from<00:02:17.190> an<00:02:17.340> update<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:18.750> think

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
that's about it from an update I think

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.890 
that's about it from an update I think
that<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:20.070> hyper<00:02:20.490> 212<00:02:20.760> plus<00:02:21.270> was<00:02:21.480> definitely<00:02:21.840> a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
that the hyper 212 plus was definitely a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.480 
that the hyper 212 plus was definitely a
big<00:02:22.050> as<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.350> biggest<00:02:22.680> update<00:02:22.800> i<00:02:23.010> have<00:02:23.160> here

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
big as the biggest update i have here

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.780 
big as the biggest update i have here
and<00:02:23.760> then<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.800> fan<00:02:25.800> controller<00:02:26.280> right<00:02:26.520> there

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and then the fan controller right there

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.240 
and then the fan controller right there
so<00:02:27.150> other<00:02:27.960> than<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.290> man<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.770> rig<00:02:28.950> still

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
so other than that man the rig still

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.620 
so other than that man the rig still
doing<00:02:29.520> good<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:30.860> am<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.490> don't<00:02:33.300> know<00:02:33.420> how<00:02:33.540> to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
doing good I am I don't know how to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.890 
doing good I am I don't know how to
overclock<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> CPU<00:02:35.010> yet<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.270> do<00:02:36.390> know<00:02:36.750> that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
overclock the CPU yet but I do know that

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.600 
overclock the CPU yet but I do know that
I<00:02:37.110> am<00:02:37.290> ready<00:02:37.440> for<00:02:37.710> an<00:02:37.830> overclock<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.490> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
I am ready for an overclock with the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.030 
I am ready for an overclock with the
heatsink<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.840> could<00:02:40.620> overclock<00:02:40.950> it

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
heatsink like this I could overclock it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.430 
heatsink like this I could overclock it
a<00:02:41.250> little<00:02:41.400> bit<00:02:41.580> more<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.080> get<00:02:43.080> decent

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
a little bit more and get decent

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.980 
a little bit more and get decent
performance<00:02:44.010> out<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.310> CPU<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.060> still<00:02:45.870> got

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
performance out of that CPU so still got

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
performance out of that CPU so still got
the<00:02:46.110> 16<00:02:46.470> gigs<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.830> ram<00:02:46.980> still<00:02:47.430> got<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:48.380> AMD<00:02:49.380> HD

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
the 16 gigs of ram still got the AMD HD

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.150 
the 16 gigs of ram still got the AMD HD
6870<00:02:50.550> graphics<00:02:51.360> card<00:02:51.630> don't<00:02:52.620> mind<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.890> cable

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
6870 graphics card don't mind the cable

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.640 
6870 graphics card don't mind the cable
management<00:02:53.340> man<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:54.540> all<00:02:54.690> crap<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.500> right

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
management man it's all crap you right

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.040 
management man it's all crap you right
now<00:02:55.830> but<00:02:56.160> uh<00:02:56.480> I'm<00:02:57.480> still<00:02:57.750> trying<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:57.990> figure

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
now but uh I'm still trying to figure

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.920 
now but uh I'm still trying to figure
out<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.380> way<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.620> better<00:02:59.610> route<00:02:59.970> my<00:03:00.180> cables<00:03:00.600> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
out a way to better route my cables and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.810 
out a way to better route my cables and
it's<00:03:01.410> like<00:03:01.560> an<00:03:01.710> ongoing<00:03:01.860> project<00:03:02.280> every<00:03:02.670> time

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
it's like an ongoing project every time

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.020 
it's like an ongoing project every time
open<00:03:03.120> on<00:03:03.210> my<00:03:03.330> case<00:03:03.540> um<00:03:03.870> I'm<00:03:04.650> uh<00:03:04.820> moving<00:03:05.820> wires

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
open on my case um I'm uh moving wires

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.979 
open on my case um I'm uh moving wires
around<00:03:06.300> and<00:03:06.900> redoing<00:03:07.470> about<00:03:08.390> redoing<00:03:09.390> straps

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
around and redoing about redoing straps

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.680 
around and redoing about redoing straps
wire<00:03:10.320> straps<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.010> whatnot<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:12.390> know

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
wire straps and whatnot so you know

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.500 
wire straps and whatnot so you know
there's<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.500> big<00:03:13.680> 250<00:03:14.220> millimeter<00:03:14.610> fan<00:03:14.880> right

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
there's a big 250 millimeter fan right

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.120 
there's a big 250 millimeter fan right
there<00:03:15.570> which<00:03:16.140> I'm<00:03:16.260> gonna<00:03:16.350> replace<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.920> too

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
there which I'm gonna replace that too

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.670 
there which I'm gonna replace that too
because<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.610> sucks<00:03:18.030> there's<00:03:18.959> barely<00:03:19.350> anything

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
because it sucks there's barely anything

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.100 
because it sucks there's barely anything
coming<00:03:19.980> out<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.340> thing<00:03:20.550> man<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.270> I'm

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
coming out of this thing man so I'm

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.540 
coming out of this thing man so I'm
hearing<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.560> there's<00:03:23.010> not<00:03:23.160> very<00:03:23.220> many

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
hearing that there's not very many

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.360 
hearing that there's not very many
options<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.120> 250<00:03:24.630> millimeters<00:03:25.140> but<00:03:25.470> uh<00:03:25.530> I'm

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
options for 250 millimeters but uh I'm

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.650 
options for 250 millimeters but uh I'm
hearing<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.820> uh<00:03:26.850> there's<00:03:27.209> one<00:03:27.450> out<00:03:27.630> there

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
hearing that uh there's one out there

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.960 
hearing that uh there's one out there
it's<00:03:27.959> about<00:03:28.140> 20<00:03:28.560> bucks<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:29.040> moves<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.730> lot<00:03:29.820> of

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
it's about 20 bucks that moves a lot of

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.150 
it's about 20 bucks that moves a lot of
air<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.390> still<00:03:30.570> very<00:03:30.750> silent<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:31.500> that's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
air and is still very silent so that's

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.090 
air and is still very silent so that's
what's<00:03:32.340> going<00:03:32.520> on<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:34.709> guys<00:03:34.890> could

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
what's going on and you guys could

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.500 
what's going on and you guys could
probably<00:03:35.400> pick<00:03:35.670> up<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.940> lot<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.270> noise<00:03:36.450> i

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
probably pick up a lot of the noise i

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.850 
probably pick up a lot of the noise i
guess<00:03:36.780> probably<00:03:37.020> could<00:03:37.320> hear<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.560> noise<00:03:37.770> from

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
guess probably could hear the noise from

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.280 
guess probably could hear the noise from
his<00:03:38.040> fans<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.970> matter<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.330> fact<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.840> not

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
his fans the matter of fact it's not

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.410 
his fans the matter of fact it's not
that<00:03:40.560> loud<00:03:40.739> i<00:03:40.800> had<00:03:41.160> some<00:03:41.400> regular<00:03:41.880> case<00:03:42.120> fans

that loud i had some regular case fans

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.990 
that loud i had some regular case fans
that<00:03:42.890> well<00:03:43.890> then<00:03:44.040> weren't<00:03:44.190> regular<00:03:44.610> but<00:03:44.850> they

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
that well then weren't regular but they

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.470 
that well then weren't regular but they
were<00:03:45.890> standard<00:03:46.890> black<00:03:47.340> case<00:03:47.670> fans<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.330> had

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
were standard black case fans that had

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.300 
were standard black case fans that had
it<00:03:48.660> like<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> 2,000<00:03:49.470> RPM<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.100> they<00:03:50.250> were

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
it like a 2,000 RPM and they were

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.270

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
also I had a hard time finding

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.250 
also I had a hard time finding
out<00:04:19.380> what<00:04:20.040> size<00:04:20.370> of<00:04:20.610> a<00:04:20.760> cpu<00:04:21.330> cooler<00:04:21.750> would<00:04:21.990> fit

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
out what size of a cpu cooler would fit

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.880 
out what size of a cpu cooler would fit
in<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.680> as<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.010> toledo<00:04:23.970> 301<00:04:24.810> case<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.470> if<00:04:25.740> you

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
in this as a toledo 301 case and if you

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.240 
in this as a toledo 301 case and if you
guys<00:04:26.070> are<00:04:26.250> wondering<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:27.830> cooler<00:04:28.830> master

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
guys are wondering the cooler master

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.680 
guys are wondering the cooler master
hyper<00:04:29.450> 212<00:04:30.450> plus<00:04:31.230> does<00:04:31.890> fit<00:04:32.580> at<00:04:32.880> least<00:04:32.940> for<00:04:33.600> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
hyper 212 plus does fit at least for the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.130 
hyper 212 plus does fit at least for the
AMD<00:04:34.260> set<00:04:34.620> up<00:04:34.770> because<00:04:35.430> AMD<00:04:36.090> goes<00:04:36.300> north<00:04:36.660> or

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
AMD set up because AMD goes north or

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.700 
AMD set up because AMD goes north or
south<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:38.160> north<00:04:38.460> on<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:39.300> only<00:04:40.080> mounts<00:04:40.530> and

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
south to north on the only mounts and

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.010 
south to north on the only mounts and
then<00:04:40.830> intel<00:04:41.730> those<00:04:42.410> east<00:04:43.410> to<00:04:43.740> west<00:04:43.980> this<00:04:44.730> way

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
then intel those east to west this way

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.800 
then intel those east to west this way
so<00:04:46.020> i<00:04:46.560> think<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.280> east<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:47.760> west<00:04:47.910> set<00:04:48.210> up<00:04:48.360> the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
so i think the east to west set up the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.240 
so i think the east to west set up the
copper<00:04:49.200> heat<00:04:49.350> sinks<00:04:49.680> right<00:04:49.740> here<00:04:50.040> will

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
copper heat sinks right here will

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.320 
copper heat sinks right here will
interfere<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.880> 250<00:04:51.300> millimeter<00:04:51.690> fan<00:04:52.130> but<00:04:53.330> not

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
interfere the 250 millimeter fan but not

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.240 
interfere the 250 millimeter fan but not
with<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.870> namd<00:04:55.410> set<00:04:55.650> up<00:04:55.770> where<00:04:55.950> it<00:04:55.980> goes<00:04:56.190> from

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
with the namd set up where it goes from

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.390 
with the namd set up where it goes from
south<00:04:56.670> to<00:04:56.700> north<00:04:56.880> set<00:04:57.300> up<00:04:57.420> and<00:04:57.630> uh<00:04:57.660> oh<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:59.250> guys

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
south to north set up and uh oh you guys

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.040 
south to north set up and uh oh you guys
can<00:04:59.580> also<00:04:59.700> realize<00:05:00.180> i<00:05:00.360> forgot<00:05:00.390> to<00:05:00.660> mention<00:05:00.750> i

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
can also realize i forgot to mention i

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.260 
can also realize i forgot to mention i
do<00:05:01.110> have<00:05:01.350> a<00:05:01.440> push-pull<00:05:02.070> configuration<00:05:02.120> on<00:05:03.120> it

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
do have a push-pull configuration on it

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.990 
do have a push-pull configuration on it
so<00:05:03.510> this<00:05:04.290> fan<00:05:04.530> is<00:05:04.560> blowing<00:05:04.980> air<00:05:05.310> in<00:05:05.490> this<00:05:05.730> fan

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
so this fan is blowing air in this fan

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.420 
so this fan is blowing air in this fan
is<00:05:06.030> sucking<00:05:06.810> air<00:05:07.050> out<00:05:07.080> so<00:05:07.590> did<00:05:07.830> they<00:05:07.950> work<00:05:08.130> in

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
is sucking air out so did they work in

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.580 
is sucking air out so did they work in
tandem<00:05:08.670> and<00:05:09.000> then<00:05:09.780> i<00:05:09.870> got<00:05:10.020> these<00:05:10.230> two<00:05:10.380> fans

cooling setup i think this case is
wonderful<00:05:17.910> for<00:05:17.940> cooling<00:05:18.420> it's<00:05:19.290> a

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
wonderful for cooling it's a
