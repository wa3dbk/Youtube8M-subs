00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
all right in the last lesson I had this

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.869 
all right in the last lesson I had this
I<00:00:04.140> had<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.319> pill<00:00:04.589> picking<00:00:05.100> out<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.250> box<00:00:05.490> and

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
I had a pill picking out a box and

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.030 
I had a pill picking out a box and
pushing<00:00:06.210> it<00:00:06.299> around<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.470> would<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> bully

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
pushing it around and I would a bully

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.240 
pushing it around and I would a bully
pill<00:00:08.429> right<00:00:08.780> okay<00:00:09.780> but<00:00:10.200> today<00:00:10.920> we're<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.190> to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
pill right okay but today we're going to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.509 
pill right okay but today we're going to
be<00:00:11.370> looking<00:00:11.490> at<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.880> finite<00:00:12.349> adjustment<00:00:13.349> of

afford any way when I went to basically
taught<00:00:30.570> computer<00:00:30.810> programming<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:31.769> this

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
taught computer programming as this

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.910 
taught computer programming as this
here's<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.420> database<00:00:34.020> you're<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.770> be

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
here's a database you're going to be

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.979 
here's a database you're going to be
sitting<00:00:35.370> behind<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.880> computer<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.630> eating

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
sitting behind the computer in eating

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260 
sitting behind the computer in eating
doughnuts<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.649> rest<00:00:37.829> your<00:00:37.980> life<00:00:38.270> interacting

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
doughnuts to rest your life interacting

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.180 
doughnuts to rest your life interacting
with<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.750> database<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.980> your

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
with the database and that is your

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.930 
with the database and that is your
coding<00:00:41.670> that's<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:42.510> you're<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.870> code

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
coding that's how you're going to code

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.979 
coding that's how you're going to code
colleges<00:00:44.940> never<00:00:45.180> thought<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.870> know

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
colleges never thought that you know

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.380 
colleges never thought that you know
maybe<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.469> could<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:47.309> something<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.760> unity

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
maybe we could have something like unity

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.410 
maybe we could have something like unity
and<00:00:48.629> teach<00:00:48.960> JavaScript<00:00:49.860> man<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:51.239> had

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and teach JavaScript man they had

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.760 
and teach JavaScript man they had
something<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.199> when<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> went<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
something like that when I went to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.400 
something like that when I went to
school<00:00:52.920> I'd<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.489> all<00:00:53.699> over<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.690> well

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
school I'd be all over that right well

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.720 
school I'd be all over that right well
that's<00:00:56.280> how<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> database

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
that's how one so I have a database

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.090 
that's how one so I have a database
programming<00:00:59.730> standpoint<00:01:00.030> behind<00:01:00.750> me<00:01:01.070> then<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
programming standpoint behind me then I

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.270 
programming standpoint behind me then I
went<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.899> into<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> teaching<00:01:04.350> field<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:04.920> that's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
went to into a teaching field so that's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.270 
went to into a teaching field so that's
my<00:01:05.430> background<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> when<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:07.950> at<00:01:08.070> code

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
my background so when I look at code

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.300 
my background so when I look at code
like<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:10.549> my<00:01:11.549> brain<00:01:11.820> goes<00:01:12.000> down<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.220> does

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
like this my brain goes down so does

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.300 
like this my brain goes down so does
very<00:01:14.939> many<00:01:15.450> people's<00:01:15.990> brains<00:01:16.439> probably<00:01:17.009> so

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
very many people's brains probably so

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.539 
very many people's brains probably so
we're<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> look<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.119> how<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.930> would

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
we're going to look at how you would

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.359 
we're going to look at how you would
analyze<00:01:20.549> code<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.619> tweak<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
analyze code and kind of tweak it in a

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.120 
analyze code and kind of tweak it in a
way<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> non<00:01:24.960> destructive<00:01:25.320> form<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
way that is a non destructive form and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.780 
way that is a non destructive form and
we<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.430> learn<00:01:26.640> from<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.229> ok<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:31.790> we

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
we can learn from it ok so to do that we

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.030 
we can learn from it ok so to do that we
will<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:33.240> first<00:01:34.340> looking<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.790> from<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.210> 3d

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
will be first looking at it from a 3d

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
will be first looking at it from a 3d
person's<00:01:38.040> perspective<00:01:38.720> ok<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:41.150> that<00:01:42.150> being<00:01:42.479> in

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
person's perspective ok so that being in

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.350 
person's perspective ok so that being in
a<00:01:43.320> 3d<00:01:43.860> world<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.490> know<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.360> vector<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.950> what

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
a 3d world I know a vector to be what

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.210 
a 3d world I know a vector to be what
well<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.259> vector<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.070> X<00:01:50.399> Y<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.329> Z<00:01:52.220> ok

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
well I know a vector to be X Y or Z ok

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.240 
well I know a vector to be X Y or Z ok
and<00:01:53.790> there's<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.630> positive<00:01:54.899> x<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.619> negative<00:01:55.649> x

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
and there's a positive x and negative x

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.480 
and there's a positive x and negative x
and<00:01:56.520> y<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.210> positive<00:01:57.810> Y<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:59.070> eating<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and y and positive Y and is eating the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.670 
and y and positive Y and is eating the
positive<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.829> if<00:02:01.829> there's<00:02:02.820> three<00:02:03.420> vectors<00:02:03.930> I'm

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
positive so if there's three vectors I'm

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.679 
positive so if there's three vectors I'm
going<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> look<00:02:05.040> at<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.369> because<00:02:06.360> right<00:02:06.659> here

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
going to look at this because right here

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.930 
going to look at this because right here
is<00:02:07.140> his<00:02:07.320> move<00:02:07.619> direction<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.399> my<00:02:08.550> brains<00:02:08.819> going

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
is his move direction so my brains going

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729 
is his move direction so my brains going
to<00:02:09.119> mediately<00:02:09.599> go<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.319> say<00:02:10.470> well

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
to mediately go to this and say well

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.910 
to mediately go to this and say well
move<00:02:11.160> direction<00:02:11.700> must<00:02:11.970> mean

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
move direction must mean

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.530 
move direction must mean
something<00:02:13.160> on<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.550> line<00:02:13.849> is<00:02:14.120> actually

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
something on this line is actually

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.660 
something on this line is actually
making<00:02:14.720> sense<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.349> if<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.160> look<00:02:16.370> at<00:02:16.490> this

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
making sense and if you look at this

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.880 
making sense and if you look at this
move<00:02:17.239> Direction<00:02:17.810> gets<00:02:18.050> carried<00:02:18.380> over<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.739> the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
move Direction gets carried over to the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.600 
move Direction gets carried over to the
next<00:02:18.980> line<00:02:19.520> okay<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.800> important

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
next line okay so this is the important

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.350 
next line okay so this is the important
line<00:02:22.880> right<00:02:23.300> here<00:02:23.569> so<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.920> actually

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
line right here so this actually

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.780 
line right here so this actually
describes<00:02:26.360> vector<00:02:28.000> okay<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.060> vector<00:02:29.540> 3<00:02:29.959> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
describes vector okay so vector 3 and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.449 
describes vector okay so vector 3 and
here<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:32.000> what<00:02:32.420> it's<00:02:32.569> looking<00:02:32.989> at<00:02:33.170> now<00:02:33.620> I<00:02:33.950> had

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
here is what it's looking at now I had

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.370 
here is what it's looking at now I had
somebody<00:02:34.670> email<00:02:35.150> me<00:02:35.300> saying<00:02:35.540> hey<00:02:35.870> how<00:02:36.140> do<00:02:36.200> i

somebody email me saying hey how do i

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.790 
somebody email me saying hey how do i
change<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:37.819> actual<00:02:38.150> direction<00:02:40.000> or<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.800> WASD

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
change the actual direction or the WASD

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.229 
change the actual direction or the WASD
on<00:02:43.300> keyboard<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.620> arrow<00:02:45.980> keys<00:02:46.239> well

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239

hopefully<00:02:48.310> I'm<00:02:49.310> not<00:02:49.580> going<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.790> be<00:02:50.330> able<00:02:50.360> to

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
hopefully I'm not going to be able to

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.390 
hopefully I'm not going to be able to
answer<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.930> right<00:02:51.260> up<00:02:51.470> yet<00:02:51.650> as<00:02:51.890> of<00:02:52.130> yet

answer that right up yet as of yet

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.070 
answer that right up yet as of yet
because<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.090> know<00:02:53.180> I'm<00:02:53.360> still<00:02:53.630> into<00:02:53.959> this

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
because you know I'm still into this

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.670 
because you know I'm still into this
code<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.620> but<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.370> would<00:02:55.610> say<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.930> is<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.290> very

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
code to but I would say this is a very

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.780 
code to but I would say this is a very
good<00:02:58.100> line<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.239> start<00:02:59.540> at<00:03:00.010> okay<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.340> remember

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
good line to start at okay and remember

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.650 
good line to start at okay and remember
small<00:03:02.390> victories<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:04.090> once<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.239> get<00:03:05.390> small

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
small victories and once you get small

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.420 
small victories and once you get small
victories<00:03:06.080> out<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.410> way<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.620> learn<00:03:07.130> from

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
victories out of the way you learn from

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.410 
victories out of the way you learn from
them<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.720> know<00:03:09.019> this<00:03:09.500> red<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.459> probably

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
them so I know this red is probably

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.850 
them so I know this red is probably
machine<00:03:11.870> language<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:13.850> means<00:03:14.860> horizontal

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
machine language that means horizontal

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.970 
machine language that means horizontal
vertical<00:03:16.510> jump<00:03:17.510> these<00:03:18.470> have<00:03:18.709> all<00:03:18.920> been

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
vertical jump these have all been

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.000 
vertical jump these have all been
scripted<00:03:20.049> into<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.200> unity<00:03:21.650> engine<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:24.010> they

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
scripted into the unity engine and they

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.740 
scripted into the unity engine and they
have<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.190> lot<00:03:25.430> to<00:03:25.579> do<00:03:25.700> with<00:03:25.730> character<00:03:26.299> control

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
have a lot to do with character control

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.050 
have a lot to do with character control
I<00:03:27.070> know<00:03:28.070> that<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.519> be<00:03:28.549> true<00:03:29.140> now<00:03:30.370> what<00:03:31.370> if<00:03:31.640> I

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
I know that to be true now what if I

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.569 
I know that to be true now what if I
wanted<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.750> try<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.019> break<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.470> system<00:03:33.709> well

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
wanted to try to break the system well

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.940 
wanted to try to break the system well
first<00:03:35.269> off<00:03:36.489> command<00:03:37.489> C<00:03:37.850> to<00:03:38.769> highlight<00:03:39.769> that

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
first off command C to highlight that

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.310 
first off command C to highlight that
and<00:03:40.570> let's<00:03:41.570> do<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.930> this<00:03:42.049> way<00:03:44.019> between<00:03:45.019> these

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
and let's do it this way between these

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.289 
and let's do it this way between these
brackets<00:03:45.560> are<00:03:45.890> going<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.100> put<00:03:46.370> 0<00:03:46.970> dash<00:03:47.840> 0<00:03:48.470> or

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
brackets are going to put 0 dash 0 or

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.370 
brackets are going to put 0 dash 0 or
comma<00:03:50.299> 0<00:03:50.799> 0<00:03:51.799> 0<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:53.420> then<00:03:53.690> we<00:03:53.780> could<00:03:53.900> close<00:03:54.200> it

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
comma 0 0 0 and then we could close it

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.309 
comma 0 0 0 and then we could close it
and<00:03:54.560> save<00:03:54.799> it<00:03:55.329> it's<00:03:56.329> play<00:03:58.569> right<00:03:59.569> I<00:03:59.810> can't<00:04:00.170> move

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
and save it it's play right I can't move

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.460 
and save it it's play right I can't move
at<00:04:00.470> all<00:04:00.590> okay<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.700> told<00:04:02.060> me<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.750> I<00:04:03.049> was

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
at all okay that told me that I was

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.380 
at all okay that told me that I was
absolutely<00:04:03.890> correct<00:04:04.579> in<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.880> assumption

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
absolutely correct in the assumption

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
absolutely correct in the assumption
that<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:06.200> is<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.920> actual<00:04:08.049> walking<00:04:09.049> script

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
that that is the actual walking script

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.069 
that that is the actual walking script
right<00:04:09.620> there<00:04:09.889> in<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.130> direction<00:04:12.489> okay<00:04:13.489> now

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
right there in the direction okay now

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:21.099 
right there in the direction okay now
luckily<00:04:15.079> I<00:04:16.299> made<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.329> copy

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.909 

and<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:22.129> will<00:04:22.250> fail<00:04:22.520> unless<00:04:22.819> i<00:04:23.150> have<00:04:23.360> this

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
and it will fail unless i have this

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.249 
and it will fail unless i have this
semicolon<00:04:28.270> all<00:04:29.270> right<00:04:29.449> now<00:04:29.599> do<00:04:29.659> you<00:04:29.900> see<00:04:30.110> the

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:30.259 
semicolon all right now do you see the

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:39.399 
semicolon all right now do you see the
three<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.969> have<00:04:31.969> one<00:04:33.430> two<00:04:35.229> three<00:04:38.080> all<00:04:39.080> right<00:04:39.229> so

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
three I have one two three all right so

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.580 
three I have one two three all right so
what<00:04:39.590> it's<00:04:39.710> doing<00:04:39.830> is<00:04:40.270> getting<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.659> input<00:04:42.229> get

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
what it's doing is getting the input get

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.740 
what it's doing is getting the input get
access<00:04:43.129> horizontal<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:44.240> get<00:04:44.539> access

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
access horizontal and get access

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.659 
access horizontal and get access
vertical<00:04:45.819> okay<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:48.590> if<00:04:48.889> I<00:04:49.099> was<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.310> say

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
vertical okay so if I was to say

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.330 
vertical okay so if I was to say
horizontal<00:04:50.629> or<00:04:50.780> vertical<00:04:50.810> which<00:04:51.530> area<00:04:52.159> do<00:04:52.310> I

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
horizontal or vertical which area do I

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.339 
horizontal or vertical which area do I
want<00:04:52.729> to<00:04:52.849> run<00:04:53.030> in<00:04:53.240> do<00:04:53.449> I<00:04:53.509> want<00:04:53.779> to<00:04:53.870> run<00:04:53.990> an<00:04:54.199> all

vertical<00:04:55.009> or<00:04:55.189> horizontal<00:04:55.810> i<00:04:56.810> would<00:04:57.620> have<00:04:57.770> to

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
vertical or horizontal i would have to

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.779 
vertical or horizontal i would have to
first<00:04:58.189> kind<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:58.550> look<00:04:58.699> at<00:04:58.789> my<00:04:58.909> little<00:04:59.090> world<00:05:00.789> if

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
first kind of look at my little world if

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.480 
first kind of look at my little world if

I looked at it this way I want to run

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.540 
I looked at it this way I want to run
only<00:05:04.789> in<00:05:05.180> X<00:05:05.449> I<00:05:05.810> want<00:05:06.289> to<00:05:06.409> not<00:05:06.620> be<00:05:06.830> able<00:05:06.979> to<00:05:07.159> run

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
only in X I want to not be able to run

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.330 
only in X I want to not be able to run
in<00:05:08.000> Z<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:08.719> it<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.229> why<00:05:09.770> doesn't<00:05:10.159> really

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
in Z and it and why doesn't really

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.709 
in Z and it and why doesn't really
matter<00:05:11.020> ok<00:05:12.039> so<00:05:13.039> let's<00:05:13.460> try<00:05:13.759> this<00:05:13.819> out<00:05:16.719> I'm

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
matter ok so let's try this out I'm

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:28.629 
matter ok so let's try this out I'm
going<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.199> lock<00:05:18.500> out<00:05:19.870> vertical<00:05:20.870> 0<00:05:26.529> x<00:05:27.610> yeah<00:05:28.610> I

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
going to lock out vertical 0 x yeah I

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:29.950 
going to lock out vertical 0 x yeah I
don't<00:05:28.969> even<00:05:29.029> know<00:05:29.180> which<00:05:29.300> one<00:05:29.539> of<00:05:29.569> these<00:05:29.719> are

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
don't even know which one of these are

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.959 
don't even know which one of these are
yet<00:05:30.169> so<00:05:30.409> let's<00:05:30.620> just<00:05:31.009> break<00:05:31.219> the<00:05:31.370> system<00:05:31.580> first

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
yet so let's just break the system first

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:40.570 
yet so let's just break the system first
0<00:05:38.529> all<00:05:39.529> right<00:05:39.680> so<00:05:39.860> this<00:05:40.129> is<00:05:40.219> what<00:05:40.339> I'm<00:05:40.400> going<00:05:40.550> to

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
0 all right so this is what I'm going to

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:48.040 
0 all right so this is what I'm going to
do<00:05:40.699> I'm<00:05:40.789> going<00:05:40.849> to<00:05:40.969> try<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.270> run<00:05:41.680> perfect<00:05:47.050> nice

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
do I'm going to try to run perfect nice

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.980 
do I'm going to try to run perfect nice
so<00:05:48.650> I<00:05:48.680> can't<00:05:49.069> move<00:05:49.250> forward<00:05:49.550> can't<00:05:50.479> move<00:05:50.599> in<00:05:50.779> Z

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
so I can't move forward can't move in Z

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.899 
so I can't move forward can't move in Z
at<00:05:51.110> all<00:05:51.259> I<00:05:51.639> can<00:05:52.639> jump<00:05:52.939> still<00:05:53.270> and<00:05:54.909> essentially

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
at all I can jump still and essentially

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:57.519 
at all I can jump still and essentially
what<00:05:55.939> I<00:05:56.120> just<00:05:56.419> made<00:05:56.629> was<00:05:56.839> a<00:05:56.870> side-scrolling

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:57.529 
what I just made was a side-scrolling

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:04.839 
what I just made was a side-scrolling
game<00:05:58.569> it's<00:05:59.569> just<00:06:00.229> that<00:06:00.349> easy<00:06:03.339> all<00:06:04.339> I<00:06:04.400> need

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
game it's just that easy all I need

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.379 
game it's just that easy all I need
really<00:06:05.150> to<00:06:05.270> do<00:06:05.569> is<00:06:05.839> take<00:06:06.289> my<00:06:06.729> main<00:06:07.729> camera<00:06:08.060> and

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
really to do is take my main camera and

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:14.210 
really to do is take my main camera and
pull<00:06:09.229> it<00:06:09.259> back<00:06:13.060> what

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
pull it back what

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.670 
pull it back what
like<00:06:14.340> about<00:06:14.580> this<00:06:14.850> is<00:06:15.090> I<00:06:15.690> still<00:06:16.200> can<00:06:16.350> actually

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
like about this is I still can actually

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.080 
like about this is I still can actually
rotate<00:06:16.860> my<00:06:17.160> camera<00:06:17.580> around<00:06:17.700> so<00:06:17.910> we're<00:06:18.000> going

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
rotate my camera around so we're going

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.110 
rotate my camera around so we're going
to<00:06:18.180> have<00:06:18.270> to<00:06:18.330> look<00:06:18.510> at<00:06:18.630> that<00:06:18.780> too<00:06:19.970> because<00:06:20.970> that

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
to have to look at that too because that

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.820 
to have to look at that too because that
makes<00:06:21.330> an<00:06:21.510> interesting<00:06:21.720> perspective<00:06:22.440> on

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
makes an interesting perspective on

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.210 
makes an interesting perspective on
things<00:06:25.040> it's<00:06:26.040> actually<00:06:26.460> making<00:06:26.640> me<00:06:26.790> sick<00:06:27.180> okay

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
things it's actually making me sick okay

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.280 
things it's actually making me sick okay
so<00:06:29.220> now<00:06:29.850> that<00:06:30.090> we've<00:06:30.240> fixed<00:06:30.510> it<00:06:30.780> so<00:06:30.930> the<00:06:31.050> player

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
so now that we've fixed it so the player

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.230 
so now that we've fixed it so the player
can<00:06:31.560> only<00:06:31.860> run<00:06:32.370> in<00:06:32.640> one<00:06:32.940> axis<00:06:33.540> and<00:06:34.460> jump<00:06:35.460> let's

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
can only run in one axis and jump let's

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.600 
can only run in one axis and jump let's
look<00:06:36.420> at<00:06:36.630> how<00:06:36.870> we<00:06:36.930> would<00:06:37.290> fix<00:06:37.620> the<00:06:37.860> camera<00:06:38.130> so

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
look at how we would fix the camera so

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.830 
look at how we would fix the camera so
it<00:06:38.640> only<00:06:38.880> moves<00:06:39.180> in<00:06:39.540> 1<00:06:40.700> 1<00:06:41.700> vector<00:06:42.090> or<00:06:42.420> two

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
it only moves in 1 1 vector or two

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.980 
it only moves in 1 1 vector or two
vectors<00:06:43.230> also<00:06:43.590> all<00:06:43.860> right
