hi<00:00:04.890> I'm<00:00:05.339> heating<00:00:05.730> reduce<00:00:06.120> it<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.390> the

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:06.630 
hi I'm heating reduce it to the

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.869 
hi I'm heating reduce it to the
crossbones<00:00:07.229> detector<00:00:07.830> stand<00:00:08.129> we're<00:00:08.700> going<00:00:08.790> to

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:08.879 
crossbones detector stand we're going to

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.090 
crossbones detector stand we're going to
show<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.120> how<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:09.629> goes<00:00:09.660> on<00:00:10.049> a<00:00:10.080> detector<00:00:10.830> and

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
show you how it goes on a detector and

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.839 
show you how it goes on a detector and
we'll<00:00:12.059> show<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.480> how<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.900> functions<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.849> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
we'll show you how it functions on the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.380 
we'll show you how it functions on the
stand<00:00:15.420> itself<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.259> where's<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.770> user<00:00:17.390> okay

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
stand itself and where's the user okay

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.420 
stand itself and where's the user okay
what<00:00:18.599> we<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.259> the<00:00:19.560> rod<00:00:19.800> would<00:00:20.310> be

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
what we have here is the rod would be

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.109 
what we have here is the rod would be
two<00:00:20.640> rods<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.119> go<00:00:21.180> into<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.840> hinge<00:00:22.110> and<00:00:23.119> we

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
two rods that go into the hinge and we

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.889 
two rods that go into the hinge and we
have<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.689> clamp<00:00:25.259> that<00:00:25.470> goes<00:00:25.649> around<00:00:25.860> the

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:26.899 
have the clamp that goes around the

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:30.979 
have the clamp that goes around the
shaft<00:00:27.899> of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.169> detector<00:00:29.419> what<00:00:30.419> we<00:00:30.540> do<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.840> you

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
shaft of the detector what we do is you

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.740 
shaft of the detector what we do is you
take<00:00:31.250> on<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.610> particular<00:00:32.969> model<00:00:33.390> we're

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
take on this particular model we're

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.560 
take on this particular model we're
going<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.930> put<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.290> right<00:00:34.559> here<00:00:38.420> take<00:00:39.420> the

that's<00:02:06.940> what<00:02:07.150> I<00:02:07.180> like<00:02:07.360> about<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:09.040> when

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
that's what I like about it the when

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
that's what I like about it the when
you're<00:02:10.209> done<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.800> pick<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:11.950> up<00:02:12.630> let's<00:02:13.630> go<00:02:13.840> up

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
you're done you pick it up let's go up

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.770 
you're done you pick it up let's go up
now<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:14.980> you're<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.310> brushy<00:02:15.580> area<00:02:16.180> or<00:02:16.480> out<00:02:16.660> in
