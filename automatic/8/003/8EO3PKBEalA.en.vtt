went into the dressing room I'm thinking
if<00:01:58.039> we<00:01:58.579> were<00:01:58.609> leading<00:01:58.909> one<00:01:59.149> nil<00:01:59.359> I<00:01:59.539> had<00:01:59.750> saved

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
a wonderful free kick in I said the

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.100 
a wonderful free kick in I said the
penalty<00:02:06.679> and<00:02:06.829> we<00:02:07.369> went<00:02:07.579> in<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.759> half<00:02:07.909> time<00:02:08.179> but

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110
