00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:16.619
 if an association would be there lower Rhine 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.760
 this great community connects young people 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.760
 and old 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.940
 so far not petty is behind 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.230
 you as the twelfth man 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.670
 black wall clock 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.670
 firefighters at you 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360
 2 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540
 2 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.800
 The End 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.020
 duke 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 7 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.500
 2 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.619
 i think i think that the team 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.910
 actually very well prepared is that 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.610
 the facility of the trainer that he very much 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.010
 Do a good job with the injured 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.420
 Of course, now are also important 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.010
 players who are actually missing 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.350
 But I have to say that we think so 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.640
 strengthened us very well by the squad 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.480
 We just have it in the wide 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.790
 better placed 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.350
 we can also rotate now 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.180
 You really have to say that because he has 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.380
 Verein did a great job and 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.910
 that's why I think if everything now 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.160
 Paired if that one adviser 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.510
 Others, I think that we too 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.220
 season start next week in any case 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.500
 are really well prepared 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.200
 the other teams have opposite 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.560
 the group strengthened me enormously the previous year 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.350
 I think I'm not very strong 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.550
 everything matched barely hurt the 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.640
 I go much weaker 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.510
 So for me there is some main thing we 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.650
 have to do the descent 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.000
 So who does not run as a footballer 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.010
 is not and will not be the first not 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.270
 he wants to win something else 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.440
 I have to say that and I think so 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.970
 We have the last one and a half 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.830
 So years since I'm here too 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.150
 you have to say we really have that 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.530
 always presented very well that we 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.540
 just with the absolute 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.340
 to go to the square and win 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.220
 that we have no doubt at all 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.200
 Let's win a game and 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.660
 I have to say that we have last 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.230
 year made outstanding there you have 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.230
 seen what's going on 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.470
 be
