 good morning to the subscribers of 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.870
 youtube today we are going to make you the semi 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.069
 restore to the iphone I think that's a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.230
 Iphone 4s 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.440
 let's go with the logo and start as the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.440
 video 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.990
 although I, as you know, I gave the 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.930
 news about the semi restore but in 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.390
 that same week you yourself the same 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.880
 community told me that an airbag existed 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.099
 I did basically the same 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.960
 I researched I did the tutorial and I 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.369
 I showed right here on this channel I'm going 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.020
 to show the two videos here below in 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.220
 if you have not seen it and in 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.140
 If you have not given him 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.000
 little hands up those videos but 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.220
 you know that in that first video 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.660
 where I gave the information and announced 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.450
 that he was working on a semi 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.940
 whistle I showed this semi víctor that 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.890
 was going to be that simpler ministor for 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.580
 those who do not know a semi christ is like 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.210
 a restoration but without removing cydia 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.760
 okay 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.370
 look here that I have my this iphone 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.830
 of a New York Martian who told me 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.360
 so that I can give you this favor because 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.070
 the phone already have problems and I 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.900
 said please look to see what what 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.280
 I have already but it is perfect now I 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.409
 I take advantage and I make the semis video 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.520
 seen in addition to this procedure 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.520
 its alot 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.130
 I gave the camera to be moving the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.820
 hands in addition to that this procedure 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.100
 it is much much easier than 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.659
 previous procedure that we have to 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.250
 go to finish and all that here 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.159
 we only have as you can 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.670
 see we have here I restore myself but 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.850
 before that we need that we need 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.920
 do you need to make a backup or 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.439
 a backup of your device 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.090
 to your computer then I'm going to do 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.009
 backup where lucky backup 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.899
 you know why you are 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.989
 remember that the idea of ​​the semeji store 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.739
 is to eliminate everything that has the 

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:54.049
 device is exactly everything except the 

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:56.599
 jailbreak and what will this seeds do 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.539
 base torque the semi restoration to 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:02.420
 sometimes they can not even go back 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.849
 nor forwards this process that is 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.789
 super easy is only going to be the 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:10.099
 restoration to it is that you have 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.890
 the same version of jade or is that you 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.170
 have on her device she is 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.180
 ending that process from the back in to 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.710
 saving the backup so 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.690
 when I finish the return as 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.340
 because and that's it, I finished doing the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.950
 backup now yes I'm going to 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.450
 look for the program that I need this 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.950
 is the program that will be needed in 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.410
 my ready if I have not told them I'm going to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.630
 leave the links in the description of 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.570
 this same video ok for you 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.290
 download works the same for windows and 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.060
 for mac 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.860
 ok only you are going to open the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.930
 program and you are going to have this you are going to 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.510
 connect the device look i have already 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.770
 connected if I disconnected it say look 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.530
 as he says there he says he is 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.930
 waiting for me to connect a device 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.880
 there gold connect from iphone versions 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.670
 forest and we are going to give it here we do 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.290
 Victor and ready let's hope that the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.990
 process is going to be a process 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.750
 just like the jailbreak so it's going to 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.910
 take a while as you know I'm going 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.180
 to say right here we only have 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.180
 jailbreak available for ios 6.1 point 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.770
 2 and the previous versions to that but 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.350
 today 6.1 point 3 and 6 point 1.4 for him 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.200
 specifically for the iphone 5 for 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.370
 that we do not have any jailbreak 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.310
 we have no solution and I do not know 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.140
 currently if you are working on that 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.420
 so this is the only solution if your 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.920
 device has some problem if 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.230
 you think you should do a common 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.330
 format your device this is the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.130
 best solution 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.750
 this is not a complete restoration 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.160
 but it's a semi restoration almost almost 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.980
 complete a very long process like 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.260
 you can see there is we already have the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.390
 bar and there as you can see and back 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.110
 with us but I do not see look where 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.410
 says this my christ that is to say that it is already finished 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.820
 cloud and here we can give cross by 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.650
 it came to leave there to make it look more 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.860
 pretty but what I recommend is that 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.600
 leave the procedure and do not touch it 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.010
 as Martian does not touch that you saw 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.970
 that I was playing we're going to see that 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.269
 he also did the clean this device 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.340
 I had car I had everything had sprint and 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.420
 you could see that I was 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.910
 highly tie-break hoisted I invented that 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.890
 word right now we can see 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.010
 I come back with us but I see that the 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.990
 typeface has not changed the type of 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.210
 letter that she had on the device 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.410
 has not changed so I do not think it 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.030
 has cleaned up so completely that 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.110
 let's say it is taking us by the 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.110
 main configuration 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.190
 and stadium mister font and as we can see 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.710
 everything has been removed but the tweets 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.000
 desidias have not gone we will see to use 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:06.540
 to use either if auto went to use not 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.640
 is safe and there are not any tweets either 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.430
 they are still working because you 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.070
 can see in the typeface only 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.370
 you realize that if you still 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.170
 still working but other tweets are not 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.700
 they are functioning as they can see several 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.480
 it's not working or anything out there 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.700
 we have syria and we have tweets like that 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.970
 as those that are installed by means of 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.970
 cydia that will give to see with the use that I 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.060
 I gave the device, I got to see if in 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.220
 true the device is clean of 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.380
 all evil how deep is the 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.610
 restoration volts and lower this 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.530
 video up to here I hope that there 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.390
 liked tell me down here that you guys 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.100
 they think about the video and that you think 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.050
 of this procedure and that you 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.580
 think of the semi restoration if the 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.350
 use or not tell me everything you 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.880
