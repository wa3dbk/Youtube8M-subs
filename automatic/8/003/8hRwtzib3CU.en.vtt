00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.240
 hello to all friends of mobile experience 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.559
 and android live.it 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.059
 as you can see we are in company again 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.370
 by huawei to sean p 6 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.760
 to show some launchers 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.130
 magic on this phone to this 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.720
 classic interface in which yes 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.330
 they can drink themes that I didn't say 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.060
 a review on topics you change you are 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.230
 kept on that one wants that kind there 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.000
 there are 5 6 places to download others 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 studied away there is the download option here 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.410
 here I found they found a way 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.860
 but if you find it put it in 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.610
 comments I didn't look for much of life 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.020
 because I really like it very much 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.899
 two is enough for me and advances 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.379
 I scored a good they found fiat e 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.449
 uIL 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.440
 I repeat, there is the download option here, there isn't 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:00.570
 so I don't understand this thing anyway 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.850
 nothing from the Mayan interface combo can 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.369
 don't like it since one happened 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.460
 a screen there is the menu so what do you 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.040
 can do you can download a launcher 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.229
 I bet you five sixths of you saints 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.400
 due to a launcher for those who do not 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.490
 should you know it is an application 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.080
 let's say it modifies the interface of the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.110
 the sisters of the telephone so yes 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.650
 now for example there is a net 9 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.200
 launcher don't go we don't look for more 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.020
 famous will change your interface 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.520
 as you can see that now you have a menu 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.119
 secondary here it is with you 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.409
 applications giving the widget plus how 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.880
 on pure android and for some then if me 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.869
 like to use a genre launcher because 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.649
 on the display already used on 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.149
 applications you want 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.930
 the beauty of this launcher which is a lot 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.350
 customizable go to settings 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.350
 you can decide 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:11.690
 the sliding effect none for 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.690
 example 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.570
 believe that it is not subject to 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.200
 scrolling is really very beautiful 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.200
 fluid also 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:33.230
 then you can increase or reduce them 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.439
 flare-up however it is enough to crush a 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.750
 when you have installed and always use it 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.810
 just press as you can increase 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.760
 two screens of possibilities here 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:51.290
 launch applications like on android 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.389
 we are 4.2 4.1 pure and nothing this 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.500
 launch a very famous one anyway 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.620
 fluid stable way 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.840
 in this way the most recommended then I have 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.439
 downloaded apex launcher that is 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.180
 practically identical to me can what 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.180
 type this function downloaded in the menu 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:17.150
 the almost identical genial fruit 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.489
 so there is no new and apex board 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.609
 you are based on the book to the comment 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.930
 which you like best 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.620
 someone had suggested to download to 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.049
 launcher 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.849
 I have not downloaded much of the 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:36.049
 life and a couple trace of ios a 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.280
 as they are born nor one seems to be there 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.790
 find application in the screen 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.790
 surely getting married quoting when 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.400
 it decreases but I don't even like it 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.129
 because it is not very fluid that after I go 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.750
 even on phones so let's say that 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:55.040
 his life is not maximum then me 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.319
 let's say that new android 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.519
 I take it because I don't want to be 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.319
 so less than a dinner then maybe 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.599
 someone will have other reasons for the honesty 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.040
 interface just doesn't like it 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:14.229
 however we have faced in the is not 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.229
 of the best we see some functions 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.200
 in short it is not very well done it seems to me 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:30.540
 what you friends have you have not be 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.920
 very fluid so this is not much 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.670
 recommended I showed that he has 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.310
 asked enough 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.240
 here we go now instead the next 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.710
 launcher away more interesting maybe that 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.100
 few of you know why it's a bit 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.900
 more new more particular here now has 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:56.190
 put the random nations then sees that 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:57.180
 they change a little at random, it's a lance 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.690
 changes developed by that from 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.300
 go launcher developers what 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:10.260
 there is no ex there is this course for per 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:13.380
 act on the pages here you can and yes 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.460
 they can increase the pages so you see 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.530
 in feathers or more that are posed so there is 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.220
 like this carousel effect as above 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.670
 spb shell these cats if we also had 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.940
 large payment which replied cds 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:35.900
 the intent is just so kind here 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.900
 on average we see the menu 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.240
 sorry 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.660
 the pause I said here is at least also 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.710
 this is a nice 3d effect 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.139
 this adds in my opinion he did 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.520
 really very good beautiful because world 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.889
 customizable you can put the 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.250
 widgets one above the other also 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:58.530
 the application instead does a little all the 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.840
 very beautiful course has changed icon 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.949
 change very customizable a lot 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.130
 nice very fluid advised good 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.560
 degree there are also the wii date of 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:14.810
 launcher choose which one is right for you 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.810
 nothing I did not know from is badly turned off
