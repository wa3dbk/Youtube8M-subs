so<00:02:53.620> long<00:02:53.950> we've<00:02:54.580> just<00:02:54.790> been<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.330> used<00:02:55.540> to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
so long we've just been so used to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.449 
so long we've just been so used to
figuring<00:02:56.200> about<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.770> think<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.130> it<00:02:57.250> comes

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
figuring about it I think that it comes

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.880 
figuring about it I think that it comes
down<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:58.000> which<00:02:58.840> could<00:02:59.110> be<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.350> sixth<00:02:59.739> ave

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
down to it which could be the sixth ave

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.160 
down to it which could be the sixth ave
already<00:03:00.250> in<00:03:00.550> well<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.270> think<00:03:01.570> it's<00:03:01.900> kind<00:03:02.050> of

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
already in well I think it's kind of

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.070 
already in well I think it's kind of
like<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.380> hot<00:03:03.130> Vietnam<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.209> all<00:03:04.480> second<00:03:04.900> 10
