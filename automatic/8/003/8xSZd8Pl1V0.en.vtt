stylus it's not the citing one so here's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.440

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
if it wasn't before the pink and white

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.640 
if it wasn't before the pink and white
version<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.270> probably<00:01:15.509> would<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.140> got<00:01:16.409> an

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
version I probably would not have got an

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.370 
version I probably would not have got an
XL<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.520> didn't<00:01:18.299> want<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> don't<00:01:19.229> like

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
XL I didn't want one but I don't like

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.890 
XL I didn't want one but I don't like
the<00:01:19.530> colors<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.159> out<00:01:20.280> normally<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
the colors that are out normally so the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600 
the colors that are out normally so the
inside<00:01:22.259> looks<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> also

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
inside looks like this and it also

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.179 
inside looks like this and it also
clicks<00:01:24.119> back<00:01:24.450> which<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.290> really<00:01:25.650> like

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
clicks back which I really like

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.980

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
so just like that so that's what the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.219 
so just like that so that's what the
inside<00:01:31.350> looks<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.659> let<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.020> back

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
inside looks like and just let it back

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.940

shut

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.190 

and<00:01:38.950> there's<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.880> quick<00:01:40.090> comparison<00:01:40.330> of<00:01:40.930> the

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
and there's a quick comparison of the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.370 
and there's a quick comparison of the
normal<00:01:41.590> 30s<00:01:42.010> and<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.610> Excel<00:01:43.150> and<00:01:43.810> as<00:01:44.080> you<00:01:44.230> can
