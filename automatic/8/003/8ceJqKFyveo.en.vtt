00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello to you again and alexey shurygin 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.330
 my food category is now 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.750
 mid-November let's talk about dried fruits 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.269
 by the way they didn’t speak at all 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 meanwhile just in winter 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.490
 autumn and winter time very comfortable view 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:25.859
 food today dates 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.470
 so here are dried fruits or dates of pieces 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.349
 extremely useful 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.360
 sweet very energetically 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.579
 energy gives us a lot of energy 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.410
 because there are a lot of sugars 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.570
 need to be neat because big 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.960
 The quantity of course affects Yamal 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.180
 whatever they say but a lot I think 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.399
 regularly eat on a regular basis not 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.559
 worth it but a very handy thing with 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.489
 transition for example for those who here 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.879
 sweet tooth 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.250
 who loved to eat a lot of candy chocolate 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.100
 some kind of chocolate we still separately 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.109
 let's talk Alan I will not run ahead 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.909
 but you'll save that thought postpone 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.670
 and now sweet dates are very 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.770
 useful thing a lot of well 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 sugar well I understand sugar they are harmful and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 sugars that quickly enter the blood and 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.700
 spent quickly and don't annoy our 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.549
 the pancreas has amino acids and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.670
 even some of the irreplaceable 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.070
 amino acids which is also very useful for 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 our muscles for functioning 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.049
 organism to restore our 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.600
 the body and vitamin A Vitamin A Vitamin 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.540
 c b vitamins not common 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.759
 some sort of vitamins is very 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.409
 many salts and potassium and calcium and magnesium and 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.510
 trace elements and zinc and selenium it is very 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.320
 rare such 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:55.550
 they are not everywhere you meet them at home 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.590
 themselves in Asia is in general almost 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.540
 basic food is our delicacy yes 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.970
 there, well, at one time of course now 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.040
 changing it was all like bread 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.830
 probably yes ours is like wheat 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.330
 enough such a product on which 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.920
 tuned almost the country's economy 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.630
 Asia therefore 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.940
 but not so good but delicious now 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.920
 when it's cold 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.920
 can any tree brew from 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.700
 grass and eat in the bite here with these 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.850
 dates 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.880
 I like them a lot here as well as all 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.340
 ancestors did not enjoy straight 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.260
 I don’t even buy a lot just because 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.560
 what 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:43.690
 fond and behold until everyone who does not 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:48.490
