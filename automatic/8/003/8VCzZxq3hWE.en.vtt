00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.319 
equal to the number of hearts rolled so
that's<00:03:00.260> pretty<00:03:00.500> good<00:03:00.849> you<00:03:01.849> would<00:03:02.000> recover

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
that's pretty good you would recover

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.720 
that's pretty good you would recover
five<00:03:02.900> health<00:03:03.319> and<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:03.920> would<00:03:04.130> all<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.640> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
five health and so would all of the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.830 
five health and so would all of the
other<00:03:04.880> heroes<00:03:05.360> within<00:03:05.870> three<00:03:06.230> spaces<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.920> you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
other heroes within three spaces of you

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.780 
other heroes within three spaces of you

a campaign-style game but we have two
cards<00:03:44.450> i<00:03:44.569> think<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:45.200> are<00:03:45.350> going<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.620> be

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
cards i think that are going to be

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.680 
cards i think that are going to be
usable<00:03:46.280> for<00:03:46.549> the<00:03:46.700> basic<00:03:47.060> game<00:03:47.239> let's<00:03:47.480> take<00:03:47.569> a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
usable for the basic game let's take a

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.729 
usable for the basic game let's take a
look<00:03:47.959> at<00:03:48.049> them<00:03:48.549> looks<00:03:49.549> like<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.940> have<00:03:50.180> a<00:03:50.739> melee

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
look at them looks like you have a melee

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.670 
look at them looks like you have a melee
weapon<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.900> takes<00:03:54.200> two<00:03:54.680> hands<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.220> use<00:03:55.700> and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
weapon this takes two hands to use and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.699 
weapon this takes two hands to use and
it's<00:03:57.680> got<00:03:57.829> reach<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:59.139> think<00:04:00.139> that's<00:04:00.290> going<00:04:00.530> to

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
it's got reach I think that's going to

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.259 
it's got reach I think that's going to
be<00:04:00.829> pretty<00:04:01.010> good<00:04:01.280> that's<00:04:01.519> going<00:04:01.819> to<00:04:01.940> allow<00:04:02.060> you

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
be pretty good that's going to allow you

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.830 
be pretty good that's going to allow you
to<00:04:02.569> attack<00:04:03.160> not<00:04:04.160> only<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.670> square<00:04:05.030> adjacent

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
to attack not only the square adjacent

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.550 
to attack not only the square adjacent
to<00:04:05.989> you<00:04:06.280> but<00:04:07.280> one<00:04:07.700> more<00:04:08.030> square<00:04:08.480> away<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.470> you

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
to you but one more square away so you

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.610 
to you but one more square away so you
can<00:04:09.829> actually<00:04:09.910> attack<00:04:10.910> a<00:04:11.239> monster<00:04:11.870> that's<00:04:12.349> two

can actually attack a monster that's two
squares<00:04:13.010> away<00:04:13.220> not<00:04:13.670> just<00:04:13.700> adjacent<00:04:16.150> you're

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
squares away not just adjacent you're
