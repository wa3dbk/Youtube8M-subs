for<00:00:22.840> this<00:00:22.990> tutorial<00:00:23.170> you're<00:00:23.800> going<00:00:24.070> to<00:00:24.189> a<00:00:24.400> few

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
for this tutorial you're going to a few

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.420 
for this tutorial you're going to a few
items<00:00:25.000> they're<00:00:25.810> not<00:00:25.930> very<00:00:26.259> hard<00:00:26.770> to<00:00:26.919> get<00:00:27.099> but

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
items they're not very hard to get but

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.040 
items they're not very hard to get but
the<00:00:27.610> main<00:00:27.789> thing<00:00:27.820> is<00:00:28.029> that<00:00:28.180> you<00:00:28.419> find<00:00:28.689> yourself

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
the main thing is that you find yourself

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.339 
the main thing is that you find yourself
around<00:00:29.410> here<00:00:29.740> around<00:00:29.949> this<00:00:30.130> lava<00:00:30.520> pool<00:00:30.939> area<00:00:31.390> I

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
around here around this lava pool area I

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.689 
around here around this lava pool area I
believe<00:00:33.010> let<00:00:33.370> me<00:00:33.460> pull<00:00:34.000> up<00:00:34.030> my<00:00:34.710> f3<00:00:35.710> I<00:00:35.739> am<00:00:36.430> on

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
believe let me pull up my f3 I am on

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.030 
believe let me pull up my f3 I am on
approximately<00:00:37.600> layer<00:00:37.750> 25<00:00:38.260> so<00:00:38.739> I'm<00:00:38.860> guessing

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
approximately layer 25 so I'm guessing

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.799 
approximately layer 25 so I'm guessing
they<00:00:39.250> spawn<00:00:39.550> around<00:00:40.000> there<00:00:40.269> if<00:00:40.480> you<00:00:40.660> could

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
they spawn around there if you could

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.180 
they spawn around there if you could
find<00:00:40.960> one<00:00:41.199> of<00:00:41.230> these<00:00:41.379> they're<00:00:41.650> actually<00:00:42.040> kind

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
find one of these they're actually kind

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.950 
find one of these they're actually kind
of<00:00:42.339> common<00:00:42.730> or<00:00:43.269> you<00:00:43.390> might<00:00:43.480> be<00:00:43.629> able<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:43.809> find

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
of common or you might be able to find

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.810 
of common or you might be able to find
one<00:00:44.170> on<00:00:44.260> the<00:00:44.350> surface<00:00:44.739> in<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.190> desert<00:00:45.430> I<00:00:45.640> can

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
one on the surface in a desert I can

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.549 
one on the surface in a desert I can
find<00:00:46.059> then<00:00:46.210> sometimes<00:00:46.720> but<00:00:47.079> you're<00:00:47.410> going<00:00:47.500> to

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
find then sometimes but you're going to

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.289 
find then sometimes but you're going to
need<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.800> find<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.190> lava<00:00:48.489> pool<00:00:48.790> because<00:00:49.030> you<00:00:49.239> are

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.299 
need to find a lava pool because you are

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.479 
need to find a lava pool because you are
going<00:00:49.479> to<00:00:49.600> need<00:00:49.659> some<00:00:49.930> lava<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:51.159> just<00:00:51.400> found

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
going to need some lava and I just found

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.759 
going to need some lava and I just found
that<00:00:51.640> it<00:00:51.760> is<00:00:51.850> easier<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.449> do<00:00:53.229> what<00:00:53.500> we're<00:00:53.680> going

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
that it is easier to do what we're going

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.149 
that it is easier to do what we're going
to<00:00:53.949> be<00:00:53.979> doing<00:00:54.159> down<00:00:54.729> here<00:00:55.170> under<00:00:56.170> you<00:00:56.860> know<00:00:56.979> the

to be doing down here under you know the

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.750 
to be doing down here under you know the
Minecraft<00:00:57.519> world<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.989> let's<00:00:59.170> get<00:00:59.260> started<00:00:59.760> I'm

like<00:01:53.620> it<00:01:53.650> to<00:01:53.950> light<00:01:54.100> up<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.250> area<00:01:54.460> i<00:01:54.760> am<00:01:54.970> using

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
like it to light up the area i am using

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.790 
like it to light up the area i am using
shader<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.900> does<00:01:56.020> make<00:01:56.050> it<00:01:56.290> kind<00:01:56.440> of<00:01:56.470> dark

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
shader so it does make it kind of dark

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.920 
shader so it does make it kind of dark
and<00:01:56.950> last<00:01:57.640> but<00:01:57.729> not<00:01:57.850> least<00:01:57.909> this<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.300> very

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
and last but not least this is very

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.350 
and last but not least this is very
useful<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.799> you<00:02:00.250> need<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.610> it's<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.120> plinth

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
useful and you need it it's a plinth

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.060 
useful and you need it it's a plinth
steel<00:02:01.600> obviously<00:02:02.110> that's<00:02:02.320> how<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:02.500> activate

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
steel obviously that's how you activate

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.399 
steel obviously that's how you activate
nether<00:02:03.310> portal<00:02:03.780> let's<00:02:04.780> get<00:02:04.960> started<00:02:05.290> right

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
nether portal let's get started right

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.230 
nether portal let's get started right
here<00:02:05.470> let's<00:02:06.130> try<00:02:06.310> not<00:02:06.490> fall<00:02:06.670> inside<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:07.030> lava

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
here let's try not fall inside the lava

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.050 
here let's try not fall inside the lava
so<00:02:08.200> first<00:02:08.409> going<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.709> dig<00:02:09.099> out<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.580> area<00:02:09.759> where

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
so first going to dig out the area where

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.130 
so first going to dig out the area where
you're<00:02:10.149> going<00:02:10.360> where<00:02:10.659> you're<00:02:10.690> going<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.110> put

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
you're going where you're going to put

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.780 
you're going where you're going to put
your<00:02:11.379> nether<00:02:11.830> portal

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
your nether portal

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.880 
your nether portal
so<00:02:13.150> we'll<00:02:13.629> dig<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.840> out<00:02:13.900> inside<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.349> wall<00:02:14.530> I

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
so we'll dig it out inside the wall I

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.770 
so we'll dig it out inside the wall I
believe<00:02:15.879> this<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:17.140> structure<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.680> it

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
believe this is the the structure of it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.709 
believe this is the the structure of it
so<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:20.620> very<00:02:21.010> simple<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.609> do<00:02:21.879> this<00:02:22.299> this<00:02:22.659> uh

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:22.719 
so is very simple to do this this uh

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.440 
so is very simple to do this this uh
this<00:02:23.140> method<00:02:23.650> it'll<00:02:24.189> probably<00:02:24.310> only<00:02:24.849> take<00:02:25.180> you

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
this method it'll probably only take you

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.300 
this method it'll probably only take you
maybe<00:02:25.780> like<00:02:25.989> five<00:02:26.260> minutes<00:02:26.560> if<00:02:26.859> you<00:02:26.950> want<00:02:27.250> to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
maybe like five minutes if you want to

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.589 
maybe like five minutes if you want to
like<00:02:27.430> some<00:02:27.579> sort<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.790> speedruns<00:02:28.269> gets<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
like some sort of speedruns gets the

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.210 
like some sort of speedruns gets the
nether<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.439> best<00:02:29.620> way<00:02:29.799> to<00:02:29.859> do<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.040> in

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
nether this is the best way to do it in

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.089 
nether this is the best way to do it in
my<00:02:30.340> opinion<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.810> do<00:02:32.379> something<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:32.799> this

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
my opinion so you do something like this

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.199 
my opinion so you do something like this
and<00:02:33.310> then<00:02:33.400> you're<00:02:33.519> going<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.730> dig<00:02:33.970> out<00:02:34.090> the

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
and then you're going to dig out the

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.520 
and then you're going to dig out the
bottom<00:02:34.540> because<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.810> don't<00:02:34.989> want<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.260> water

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
bottom because you don't want the water

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.470 
bottom because you don't want the water
when<00:02:35.799> we<00:02:35.890> do<00:02:36.099> put<00:02:36.310> some<00:02:36.519> water<00:02:36.730> down<00:02:36.939> to<00:02:37.209> flow

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
when we do put some water down to flow

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.259 
when we do put some water down to flow
out<00:02:37.510> all<00:02:37.870> into<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.140> lava<00:02:39.090> something<00:02:40.090> that's

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
out all into the lava something that's

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.849 
out all into the lava something that's
kind<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.510> laggy<00:02:40.870> under<00:02:41.230> here<00:02:41.409> maybe<00:02:41.709> it's

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
kind of laggy under here maybe it's

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.459 
kind of laggy under here maybe it's
because<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.189> lava<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.790> don't<00:02:43.090> know<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:44.319> then

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:44.469 
because of the lava I don't know so then

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:45.270 
because of the lava I don't know so then
you're<00:02:44.590> going<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.739> put<00:02:44.859> down<00:02:44.950> your<00:02:45.099> water

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
you're going to put down your water

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.699 
you're going to put down your water
buckets<00:02:45.639> right<00:02:46.269> here<00:02:47.049> and<00:02:47.290> right<00:02:47.319> here<00:02:49.709> there

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
buckets right here and right here there

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.099 
buckets right here and right here there
we<00:02:50.799> go<00:02:50.919> just<00:02:51.099> like<00:02:51.519> that<00:02:51.579> so<00:02:52.510> if<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.870> water

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
we go just like that so if the water

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.899 
we go just like that so if the water
will<00:02:53.409> flow<00:02:53.769> into<00:02:54.010> there<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.579> then<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.760> have

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
will flow into there and then you have

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.179 
will flow into there and then you have
your<00:02:54.939> structure<00:02:55.480> behind<00:02:56.079> there<00:02:56.470> then<00:02:57.099> you're

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
your structure behind there then you're

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.460 
your structure behind there then you're
gonna<00:02:57.280> start<00:02:57.519> filling<00:02:57.849> up<00:02:58.000> your<00:02:58.299> buckets<00:02:59.109> with

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
gonna start filling up your buckets with

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.369 
gonna start filling up your buckets with
lava<00:02:59.769> and<00:03:00.299> start<00:03:01.299> placing<00:03:01.480> them<00:03:01.750> down<00:03:01.930> inside

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
lava and start placing them down inside

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.869 
lava and start placing them down inside
the<00:03:02.530> little<00:03:02.709> area<00:03:02.919> that<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.129> built<00:03:03.340> out<00:03:03.519> so

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
the little area that you built out so

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.460 
the little area that you built out so
let's<00:03:04.030> see<00:03:04.090> if<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.180> can<00:03:04.209> see<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:05.230> right<00:03:05.409> there

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
let's see if I can see you right there

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.009 
let's see if I can see you right there
there<00:03:06.189> and<00:03:06.370> as<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.579> can<00:03:06.700> see<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.150> water<00:03:07.419> mixed

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
there and as you can see the water mixed

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.809 
there and as you can see the water mixed
with<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.169> lava<00:03:08.470> actually<00:03:09.129> does<00:03:09.400> create

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
with the lava actually does create

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.479 
with the lava actually does create
obsidian<00:03:10.750> that's<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.769> pretty<00:03:11.889> basic<00:03:12.129> thing

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
obsidian that's a pretty basic thing

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.190 
obsidian that's a pretty basic thing
about<00:03:12.669> Minecraft<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.930> just<00:03:14.019> start

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
about Minecraft so you just start

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.629 
about Minecraft so you just start
placing<00:03:14.379> them<00:03:14.620> around<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:14.859> can<00:03:14.980> play<00:03:15.069> bring

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
placing them around you can play bring

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.069 
placing them around you can play bring
more<00:03:15.879> buckets<00:03:16.269> if<00:03:16.359> you<00:03:16.450> want<00:03:16.599> to<00:03:16.689> it<00:03:16.810> probably

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
more buckets if you want to it probably

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.390 
more buckets if you want to it probably
speed<00:03:17.290> up<00:03:17.379> the<00:03:17.470> process<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.979> little<00:03:18.069> bit<00:03:18.190> more

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
speed up the process a little bit more

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.490 
speed up the process a little bit more
you<00:03:19.389> do<00:03:19.540> that<00:03:19.569> believe<00:03:19.930> we<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.139> one<00:03:20.349> more

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
you do that believe we have one more

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.069 
you do that believe we have one more
right<00:03:20.650> there<00:03:20.940> up<00:03:21.940> there<00:03:23.340> few<00:03:24.340> more<00:03:24.780> here<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:25.870> go

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
right there up there few more here we go

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.270 
right there up there few more here we go
there

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
there

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.270 
there
maybe<00:03:28.790> like<00:03:29.030> two<00:03:29.840> more<00:03:31.390> there<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.930> there<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:34.250> I

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
maybe like two more there and there so I

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.070 
maybe like two more there and there so I
believe<00:03:34.520> that's<00:03:34.610> our<00:03:34.910> nether<00:03:35.540> portal<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:35.959> then

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
believe that's our nether portal so then

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.380 
believe that's our nether portal so then
we<00:03:36.170> can<00:03:36.290> take<00:03:36.500> down<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:37.069> water<00:03:37.370> buckets<00:03:37.700> and

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
we can take down the water buckets and

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.120 
we can take down the water buckets and
just<00:03:38.420> wait<00:03:39.230> for<00:03:39.290> them<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.470> flow<00:03:39.709> down<00:03:39.740> and

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
just wait for them to flow down and

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.590 
just wait for them to flow down and
don't<00:03:40.250> put<00:03:40.430> any<00:03:40.580> blocks<00:03:40.910> back<00:03:41.090> girl<00:03:41.330> so<00:03:41.450> we'll

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
don't put any blocks back girl so we'll

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.930 
don't put any blocks back girl so we'll
start<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.870> flow<00:03:42.050> onto<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.410> lava<00:03:42.620> I<00:03:42.980> mean<00:03:43.790> you

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
start to flow onto the lava I mean you

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.100 
start to flow onto the lava I mean you
could<00:03:44.120> do<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.420> but<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.750> just<00:03:44.780> gets<00:03:45.050> a<00:03:45.080> little

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
could do that but it just gets a little

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.449 
could do that but it just gets a little
bit<00:03:45.319> messy<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:45.800> don't<00:03:45.950> really<00:03:46.040> you<00:03:46.430> know

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
bit messy and I don't really you know

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.120 
bit messy and I don't really you know
I'm<00:03:46.610> not<00:03:46.730> really<00:03:46.850> too<00:03:47.030> big<00:03:47.180> fan<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.420> messy

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
I'm not really too big fan of messy

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.470 
I'm not really too big fan of messy
there<00:03:49.130> we<00:03:49.220> go<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.640> then<00:03:49.819> can<00:03:50.030> plug<00:03:50.270> this<00:03:50.420> back

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
there we go and then can plug this back

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.660 
there we go and then can plug this back
up<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:51.080> boom<00:03:51.470> that's<00:03:51.650> basically<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.430> have

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
up and boom that's basically it you have

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.449 
up and boom that's basically it you have
your<00:03:52.880> nether<00:03:53.239> portal<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.650> can<00:03:55.069> dig<00:03:55.340> this

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
your nether portal so you can dig this

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.740 
your nether portal so you can dig this
out<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:55.819> obviously<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.270> did<00:03:56.450> not<00:03:56.569> use<00:03:56.720> a

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
out and obviously I did not use a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.770 
out and obviously I did not use a
diamond<00:03:57.020> pickaxe<00:03:57.500> whatsoever<00:03:58.510> so<00:03:59.510> that's

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
diamond pickaxe whatsoever so that's

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.750
