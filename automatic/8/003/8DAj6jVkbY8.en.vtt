00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.810 
when people are looking at spending on a
premium<00:01:56.810> ATV<00:01:57.500> they're<00:01:58.250> looking<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.520> go<00:01:58.670> all-in

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
premium ATV they're looking to go all-in

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.240 
premium ATV they're looking to go all-in
and<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.140> for<00:02:00.290> us<00:02:00.380> being<00:02:00.650> able<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.890> move<00:02:00.980> to<00:02:01.100> that

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
and so for us being able to move to that

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.520 
and so for us being able to move to that
1,000<00:02:01.820> level<00:02:02.120> was<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.570> key<00:02:02.780> thing<00:02:02.990> for<00:02:03.020> us<00:02:03.230> and

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
1,000 level was a key thing for us and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.890 
1,000 level was a key thing for us and
that<00:02:04.040> we<00:02:04.190> started<00:02:04.490> first<00:02:05.150> with<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.510> scrambler

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
that we started first with the scrambler

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.990 
that we started first with the scrambler
with<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.140> more<00:02:06.260> performance<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.950> vehicle<00:02:07.820> and

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
with the more performance of vehicle and

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.790 
with the more performance of vehicle and
then<00:02:08.390> again<00:02:08.570> it<00:02:08.660> was<00:02:08.750> unnatural<00:02:09.290> as<00:02:09.500> there's<00:02:09.710> a

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
then again it was unnatural as there's a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.960 
then again it was unnatural as there's a
lot<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:10.040> shared<00:02:10.220> components<00:02:10.429> between<00:02:10.820> those

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
lot of shared components between those

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.370 
lot of shared components between those
vehicles<00:02:11.390> to<00:02:11.510> be<00:02:11.600> able<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.840> transition<00:02:12.170> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
vehicles to be able to transition the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.650 
vehicles to be able to transition the
1,000<00:02:12.980> into<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.670> sportsman<00:02:14.090> chassis<00:02:14.480> and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
1,000 into the sportsman chassis and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.440 
1,000 into the sportsman chassis and
make<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:14.990> very<00:02:15.470> very<00:02:16.010> performance<00:02:17.000> oriented

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
make a very very performance oriented

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.650 
make a very very performance oriented
wreck<00:02:17.960> utility<00:02:18.410> vehicle<00:02:19.160> as<00:02:19.430> well<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:20.330> idea

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
wreck utility vehicle as well the idea

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.900 
wreck utility vehicle as well the idea
of<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.260> sportsman<00:02:21.560> 1000<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.490> first<00:02:22.700> thought

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
of a sportsman 1000 the first thought

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.100 
of a sportsman 1000 the first thought
people<00:02:23.090> will<00:02:23.330> have<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.630> like<00:02:23.810> well<00:02:23.960> that's

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
people will have is like well that's

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.270 
people will have is like well that's
going<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.350> be<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.470> handful<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.040> know<00:02:25.130> that's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
going to be a handful you know that's

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.550 
going to be a handful you know that's
going<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.430> be<00:02:25.490> hard<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.730> manage<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.780> with<00:02:27.440> that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
going to be hard to manage and with that

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.230 
going to be hard to manage and with that
kind<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.740> horsepower<00:02:27.890> level<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.670> we<00:02:28.910> spend<00:02:29.180> a

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
kind of horsepower level so we spend a

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.910 
kind of horsepower level so we spend a
lot<00:02:29.420> of<00:02:29.450> time<00:02:29.780> working<00:02:30.230> on<00:02:30.440> tuning<00:02:30.830> our

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
lot of time working on tuning our

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.410 
lot of time working on tuning our
vehicle<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.520> power<00:02:31.790> comes<00:02:32.120> on<00:02:32.270> at<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
vehicle so that the power comes on at a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.180 
vehicle so that the power comes on at a
very<00:02:32.600> controlled<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.200> manageable<00:02:33.650> rate<00:02:33.920> and

very controlled and manageable rate and

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.820 
very controlled and manageable rate and
and<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.930> gives<00:02:36.350> you<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.500> confidence

sportsman<00:02:51.290> version<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:51.680> did<00:02:51.860> go<00:02:51.980> with<00:02:52.130> a

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
sportsman version we did go with a

single exhaust system and it also

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.600 
single exhaust system and it also
resulted<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:54.860> just<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.130> little<00:02:55.160> bit<00:02:55.430> of

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
resulted in just a little bit of

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.190 
resulted in just a little bit of

great capability with great value last
season<00:03:08.630> there<00:03:08.810> were<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.959> few<00:03:09.200> things<00:03:09.470> about<00:03:09.620> the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
season there were a few things about the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.500 
season there were a few things about the
mid-sized<00:03:10.280> Ranger<00:03:10.670> we<00:03:10.850> thought<00:03:11.090> polaris

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
mid-sized Ranger we thought polaris

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.810 
mid-sized Ranger we thought polaris
could<00:03:11.720> easily<00:03:11.989> improve<00:03:12.560> on<00:03:12.799> it<00:03:13.430> would<00:03:13.580> seem

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
could easily improve on it would seem

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.030 
could easily improve on it would seem
this<00:03:13.970> season<00:03:14.360> they<00:03:14.720> agreed<00:03:15.049> with<00:03:15.080> us<00:03:15.410> but<00:03:15.830> took

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
this season they agreed with us but took

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.009 
this season they agreed with us but took
things<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.430> few<00:03:16.850> steps<00:03:17.120> further<00:03:18.130> for<00:03:19.130> 2014

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
things a few steps further for 2014

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.630 
things a few steps further for 2014
basically<00:03:21.019> we<00:03:21.110> put<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.380> 570<00:03:21.980> engine<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.549> set

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
basically we put the 570 engine and set

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.400 
basically we put the 570 engine and set
up<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.910> back<00:03:23.060> end<00:03:23.299> of<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:23.420> machine<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.989> then

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
up the back end of the machine and then

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.930 
up the back end of the machine and then
we<00:03:24.440> came<00:03:24.650> around<00:03:24.830> in<00:03:24.950> 2015<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:25.850> then

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
we came around in 2015 and then

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.090 
we came around in 2015 and then
basically<00:03:26.870> built<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.530> rest<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.860> machine

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
basically built the rest of the machine

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.460 
basically built the rest of the machine
up<00:03:28.250> new<00:03:28.459> around<00:03:28.880> it<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.720> incorporate<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.260> lot<00:03:30.410> of

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
up new around it to incorporate a lot of

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.670

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
bringing the goodness of the XP 1000

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.450 
bringing the goodness of the XP 1000
down<00:05:13.080> into<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:14.100> trail<00:05:14.400> models

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.710 

the<00:05:19.460> decision<00:05:19.820> behind<00:05:19.940> the<00:05:20.150> engine<00:05:20.450> was

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
the decision behind the engine was

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.600 
the decision behind the engine was
largely<00:05:21.200> as<00:05:21.650> we<00:05:21.860> thought<00:05:22.100> about<00:05:22.220> what<00:05:22.460> would

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
largely as we thought about what would

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.730 
largely as we thought about what would
be<00:05:22.730> the<00:05:22.850> right<00:05:23.090> performance<00:05:24.020> level<00:05:24.290> for<00:05:24.650> the

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
be the right performance level for the

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.980 
be the right performance level for the
trail<00:05:25.010> vehicles<00:05:25.520> it's<00:05:26.300> not<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.570> same<00:05:26.720> engine

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
trail vehicles it's not the same engine

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.420 
trail vehicles it's not the same engine
that<00:05:27.020> we've<00:05:27.230> been<00:05:27.320> putting<00:05:27.590> in<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.710> XPS<00:05:28.190> and

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
that we've been putting in the XPS and

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.800 
that we've been putting in the XPS and
then<00:05:28.760> if<00:05:28.910> you<00:05:28.970> also<00:05:29.090> think<00:05:29.360> just<00:05:29.420> about<00:05:29.630> the

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
then if you also think just about the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.170 
then if you also think just about the
evolution<00:05:30.200> of<00:05:30.260> time<00:05:30.500> since<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:30.950> XP<00:05:31.370> 900<00:05:32.030> was

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
evolution of time since the XP 900 was

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.580 
evolution of time since the XP 900 was
first<00:05:32.480> introduced<00:05:32.930> that<00:05:33.020> was<00:05:33.170> our<00:05:33.290> Gen<00:05:33.470> 1

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
first introduced that was our Gen 1

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.470 
first introduced that was our Gen 1
version<00:05:33.860> of<00:05:34.130> the<00:05:34.580> engine<00:05:34.850> and<00:05:34.940> we<00:05:35.000> are<00:05:35.120> now<00:05:35.240> on

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
version of the engine and we are now on

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.140 
version of the engine and we are now on
Gen<00:05:36.170> 2<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:36.710> there's<00:05:37.310> there's<00:05:37.670> actually<00:05:38.000> more

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
Gen 2 and there's there's actually more

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.930 
Gen 2 and there's there's actually more
commonality<00:05:38.570> and<00:05:38.960> these<00:05:39.170> this<00:05:40.070> motor<00:05:40.340> with

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
commonality and these this motor with

commonality and these this motor with
the<00:05:41.180> Ranger<00:05:41.750> 900<00:05:42.140> then<00:05:42.830> with<00:05:43.100> a<00:05:43.280> RZR<00:05:43.490> XP<00:05:43.640> 900<00:05:44.360> or

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
RZR XP 1000 motor the most important

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.230 
RZR XP 1000 motor the most important
thing<00:05:48.440> to<00:05:48.590> know<00:05:48.710> about<00:05:48.740> our<00:05:49.070> 2015<00:05:49.820> lineup<00:05:49.970> is

thing to know about our 2015 lineup is

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.180 
thing to know about our 2015 lineup is

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
from tip to tail we've got vehicles that

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.630 
from tip to tail we've got vehicles that
fit<00:05:53.990> just<00:05:54.200> about<00:05:54.380> every<00:05:54.710> off-road<00:05:55.310> vehicle

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640

is largely new with the fact that we
just<00:06:00.590> introduced<00:06:00.950> 29<00:06:01.580> new<00:06:02.030> models<00:06:02.390> which<00:06:02.600> is<00:06:02.750> a

just introduced 29 new models which is a

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.200 
just introduced 29 new models which is a
new<00:06:02.960> high-water<00:06:03.500> mark<00:06:03.740> for<00:06:03.770> us<00:06:03.980> as<00:06:04.160> well<00:06:04.370> it's

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
new high-water mark for us as well it's

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.730 
new high-water mark for us as well it's
very<00:06:05.450> important<00:06:05.840> for<00:06:05.900> us<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.170> very

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
very important for us to very
