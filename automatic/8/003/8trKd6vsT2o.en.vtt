00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
under ommited but like I said this is

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.929 
under ommited but like I said this is
the<00:02:46.480> more<00:02:47.109> value<00:02:47.590> oriented<00:02:48.189> case<00:02:48.459> so<00:02:48.730> you're

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
the more value oriented case so you're

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.940 
the more value oriented case so you're
gonna<00:02:49.030> get<00:02:49.180> some<00:02:49.359> stuff<00:02:49.599> like<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.139> CPU<00:02:50.650> cut

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
gonna get some stuff like this a CPU cut

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.770 
gonna get some stuff like this a CPU cut

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.729 
space there but all in all you know you
have<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.700> few<00:02:58.030> punch<00:02:58.299> outs<00:02:58.569> I<00:02:58.870> would<00:02:59.439> love<00:02:59.620> to

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
have a few punch outs I would love to

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.679 
have a few punch outs I would love to
see<00:02:59.919> companies<00:03:00.370> start<00:03:00.760> doing<00:03:01.060> either<00:03:01.299> punch

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
see companies start doing either punch

grommet<00:03:27.099> this<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.519> really<00:03:27.879> cool<00:03:28.090> guys<00:03:28.359> because

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
grommet this is really cool guys because

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.809 
grommet this is really cool guys because
you<00:03:29.319> can<00:03:29.470> still<00:03:29.680> get<00:03:29.889> a<00:03:29.949> lot<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.400> hard<00:03:30.549> drives

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
you can still get a lot of hard drives

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.619 
you can still get a lot of hard drives
in<00:03:31.000> this<00:03:31.120> case<00:03:31.389> they're<00:03:32.260> out<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.709> your<00:03:32.889> way<00:03:33.069> and

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
in this case they're out of your way and

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.599 
in this case they're out of your way and
you're<00:03:34.629> not<00:03:34.810> gonna<00:03:35.019> restrict<00:03:35.500> airflow<00:03:35.709> now

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
you're not gonna restrict airflow now

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.909 
you're not gonna restrict airflow now
the<00:03:36.669> cable<00:03:37.150> management<00:03:37.359> not<00:03:38.349> going<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.769> as

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:38.919 
the cable management not going to be as

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.759 
the cable management not going to be as
nice<00:03:39.159> as<00:03:39.609> it<00:03:40.120> could<00:03:41.019> be<00:03:41.199> because<00:03:41.409> you're<00:03:41.709> not

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
nice as it could be because you're not

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.170 
nice as it could be because you're not
really<00:03:41.979> gonna<00:03:42.159> hide<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.459> lot<00:03:42.669> of<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.849> cables

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
really gonna hide a lot of the cables

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.719 
really gonna hide a lot of the cables
but<00:03:43.900> it's<00:03:44.049> not<00:03:44.259> a<00:03:44.290> windowed<00:03:44.889> side<00:03:45.220> panel

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:45.729 
but it's not a windowed side panel

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.670 
but it's not a windowed side panel
anyways<00:03:46.209> so<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.840> doesn't<00:03:47.259> really<00:03:47.409> matter

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
anyways so that doesn't really matter

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.129 
anyways so that doesn't really matter
you<00:03:48.489> just<00:03:48.519> want<00:03:48.879> a<00:03:48.909> cable<00:03:49.239> manage<00:03:49.569> well<00:03:49.840> enough

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
you just want a cable manage well enough

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.189 
you just want a cable manage well enough
that<00:03:50.829> it's<00:03:51.459> gonna<00:03:51.669> stay<00:03:51.939> out<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.090> your<00:03:52.359> way<00:03:52.389> the

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
that it's gonna stay out of your way the

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.249 
that it's gonna stay out of your way the
nice<00:03:53.650> small<00:03:54.159> attention<00:03:54.849> to<00:03:55.000> detail<00:03:55.479> skies<00:03:55.930> are

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
nice small attention to detail skies are

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:59.369 
nice small attention to detail skies are
why<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.650> really<00:03:57.189> like<00:03:57.370> fractal<00:03:57.909> design<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.870> this

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
why I really like fractal design so this

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.050 
why I really like fractal design so this
is<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.680> value<00:04:00.040> oriented<00:04:00.549> case<00:04:00.729> I'm<00:04:00.909> you're

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
is a value oriented case I'm you're

there's a little but you know there's
not<00:04:39.640> a<00:04:39.700> ton<00:04:39.940> there<00:04:40.180> and<00:04:40.360> they're<00:04:40.540> pretty<00:04:40.810> hefty

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
not a ton there and they're pretty hefty

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.500 
not a ton there and they're pretty hefty
so<00:04:41.920> you<00:04:41.980> know<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.400> is<00:04:42.460> nice<00:04:42.760> quality

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
so you know it is nice quality

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
not gonna gas yourself open and you know

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.560 
not gonna gas yourself open and you know
it's<00:04:50.650> pretty<00:04:50.950> rigid<00:04:51.250> I'm<00:04:51.610> flexing<00:04:52.480> that

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
it's pretty rigid I'm flexing that

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.000 
it's pretty rigid I'm flexing that
pretty<00:04:52.810> hard<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.140> get<00:04:53.230> it<00:04:53.290> to<00:04:53.410> do<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:53.770> and

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
pretty hard to get it to do that and

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.790 
pretty hard to get it to do that and
that's<00:04:54.190> where<00:04:54.430> I<00:04:54.460> see<00:04:54.820> this<00:04:55.030> case<00:04:55.330> being

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
that's where I see this case being

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.560 
that's where I see this case being
extremely<00:04:56.800> good<00:04:57.010> value<00:04:57.520> for<00:04:57.550> money<00:04:57.820> you<00:04:58.360> can

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
extremely good value for money you can

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.560 
extremely good value for money you can
put<00:04:58.780> two<00:04:59.200> to<00:04:59.590> 80<00:04:59.830> rads<00:05:00.220> in<00:05:00.490> this<00:05:00.640> case<00:05:00.910> not

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
put two to 80 rads in this case not

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.990 
put two to 80 rads in this case not
restrict<00:05:02.200> airflow<00:05:02.440> at<00:05:02.950> all<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.490> mean<00:05:03.700> you<00:05:03.850> can

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
restrict airflow at all I mean you can

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.370 
restrict airflow at all I mean you can
put<00:05:04.120> another<00:05:04.210> one<00:05:04.600> in<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:04.780> bottom<00:05:05.170> if<00:05:05.350> you

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
put another one in the bottom if you

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.590 
put another one in the bottom if you
want<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:05.920> fan<00:05:06.430> well<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.030> guess<00:05:07.270> you<00:05:07.360> can<00:05:07.480> put<00:05:07.510> a

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
want to fan well I guess you can put a

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.330 
want to fan well I guess you can put a
rad<00:05:07.750> down<00:05:07.960> there<00:05:08.140> to<00:05:08.320> like<00:05:08.680> say<00:05:08.860> if<00:05:08.980> you<00:05:09.070> had<00:05:09.220> an

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
rad down there to like say if you had an

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.330 
rad down there to like say if you had an
hour<00:05:09.520> 9:00<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.660> 95<00:05:11.230> you<00:05:11.830> can<00:05:11.950> actually<00:05:12.100> put

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
hour 9:00 to 95 you can actually put

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.100 
hour 9:00 to 95 you can actually put
that<00:05:12.370> rad<00:05:12.670> down<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.120> floor<00:05:13.390> and<00:05:13.690> still<00:05:13.900> have

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
that rad down the floor and still have

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.710 
that rad down the floor and still have
like<00:05:14.440> nice<00:05:14.620> clean<00:05:14.950> exhaust<00:05:15.160> and<00:05:15.910> you<00:05:16.570> know<00:05:16.690> a
