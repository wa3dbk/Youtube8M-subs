00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
to start backing up in 120 seconds so

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.039 
to start backing up in 120 seconds so
after<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:02.400> countdown<00:04:02.910> it's<00:04:03.540> going<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.810> start

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
after this countdown it's going to start

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.809 
after this countdown it's going to start
backing<00:04:04.290> up<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:05.280> can<00:04:05.400> just<00:04:05.549> leave<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
backing up and you can just leave the

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.879 
backing up and you can just leave the
computer<00:04:06.000> on<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.739> depending<00:04:07.739> on<00:04:07.829> your

computer on and depending on your
internet<00:04:08.220> speed<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.820> going<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.150> start

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
internet speed it's going to start

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.409 
internet speed it's going to start
backing<00:04:09.600> up<00:04:09.840> everything<00:04:10.410> on<00:04:10.530> your<00:04:10.680> Mac<00:04:10.859> on

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
backing up everything on your Mac on

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:19.599 
backing up everything on your Mac on
from<00:04:12.419> the<00:04:12.540> time<00:04:12.720> machine<00:04:13.109> to<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.859> turbo<00:04:14.130> Nass

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.900 

so<00:04:20.609> let's<00:04:20.850> get<00:04:21.000> back<00:04:21.209> to<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.449> slides<00:04:21.720> today

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
so let's get back to the slides today

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.400 
so let's get back to the slides today
I've<00:04:23.910> demonstrated<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.690> backing<00:04:24.930> up<00:04:25.199> is

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
I've demonstrated that backing up is

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.650 
I've demonstrated that backing up is
very<00:04:25.470> crucial<00:04:26.040> for<00:04:26.400> every<00:04:26.520> computer<00:04:27.030> so<00:04:27.540> in

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
very crucial for every computer so in

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.900 
very crucial for every computer so in
