00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.170
 hi guys good in this video 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:15.089
 I will broadly explain the technique of 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:20.060
 double hit ok so the double hit is 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.210
 practically a blow that is stopped 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:30.449
 through the rebound technique 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:33.540
 so always playing in my opinion with the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.910
 inch more inwards than towards 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.590
 up 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.670
 let's go for a shot ok this is a 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:50.370
 normal stroke but not closed pulse 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:54.719
 that moves shot to make sure that 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.140
 the wand bounces should be done 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.910
 yes, however the wand is itself 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:07.140
 released in some way from the hand 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:12.900
 so I opened my fingers 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:17.970
 always keeping in touch with the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.780
 wand ok i always in control 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.909
 however it is but the wand however it is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.810
 raised because I did so 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:33.000
 through the fingers the wand is 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.560
 svincolasse then plot la la 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.460
 wand salt I close my fingers the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.460
 wand goes down 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.640
 all right 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:11.200
 same thing with the hand in this case 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:14.520
 right ok once you learned how to do 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.410
 so that the wand rises but 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:24.120
 always maintaining control of the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:29.050
 stick and with your fingers make it fall back 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.560
 on the drum on the on the side 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.180
 of the battery by playing this 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.640
 we can start doing exercises 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:51.580
 which in this case is simpler 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:58.870
 we could do so ok then before 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:06.750
 all learn this technique well 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:06.750
 so that it comes out well without details 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.739
 difficulty both with the right one 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.739
 left 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:24.159
 well then exercises that will then have to 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.159
 a second time 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.590
 see that when I do the double blow 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.370
 the hand tends to open up a little, you see 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.370
 from the video 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.889
 ok 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:11.480
 well then 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:14.629
 then recapping thumb not up 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.900
 because otherwise the wand does not 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:22.810
 would be able to come up then leave 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:32.349
 space so that the wand rises 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:37.690
 blow shot bounce down with your fingers 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.690
 young life bounce shot 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:52.250
 ok one thing I noticed is 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:55.130
 that when the double hit is faster 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:01.449
 it also instinctively increases to me 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:05.090
 so does the mistretta strength I have 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:07.009
 with the forefinger and thumb 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.320
 so when I reach I have to 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:13.180
 reach higher speeds 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.130
 I naturally feel more tight 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.370
 forefinger and thumb then the wand 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:23.060
 will bounce faster instead to 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:28.639
 contrary tightening less index e 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:34.930
 inch the wand bounces with more 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:36.860
 slowly and however the fingers give the 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.810
 possibility for the wand to descend 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:44.060
 so the things that are important 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.690
 in my opinion, to parry the fastest 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.039
 possible 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:55.279
 double hit are the control of 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:06:08.090
 fingers and the grasp we're going to make 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:06:09.620
 between thumb and forefinger ok so this is 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.370
 one thing I noticed that 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.750
 squeezing more thumb and forefinger the 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.969
 wand of a leap faster and 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:22.940
 on the contrary we will see more slowly 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:26.889
 on the battery then some application 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:30.430
 of the double blow that I think 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:34.510
 and very nice to do and 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:36.280
 remember that the double blow is one 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:40.090
 of the most important things to learn 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:43.330
 on the battery for anything 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:46.330
 write to me privately or publicly 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.780
 below the video and see you at 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.590
 next 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.590
 Hello
