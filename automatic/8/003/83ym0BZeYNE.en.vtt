00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.790
 i 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.980
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.210
 cut those but where is this 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.210
 black box and let's cut 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.940
 since we cut them what we're going to 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.680
 do is write 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.010
 the message that we want to put 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.590
 example this is a voucher here we know that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.840
 are several then it's worth a kiss for 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.080
 an appointment for a movie idea for a 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.750
 sweet to things so then let's go to 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.710
 start writing here and good since 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.300
 we write to all the two 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.190
 these are two of these 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.579
 what is one for the front and 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.700
 one for the back is this the 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.620
 who has this on this side 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.210
 and we're going to grab all the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.210
 the vouchers and we will accommodate them 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.300
 and good since we have our ours 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.880
 little package like this already arranged as we want 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.970
 we are going to match it from this part where 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.160
 we are going to put so that they stick and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.490
 can start and we're going to use something to 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.490
 stop it I'm going to use these without appointments 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.280
 is to take our silicone gun 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.930
 it can be transparent s has 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.320
 glitter since I already had with 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.320
 Brilliant then I'll put it like that 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.190
 and I will go as 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.190
 how are they filled with the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.110
 there is 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.090
 and I'm doing it like this with this edge 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.030
 quoted from here I'm going to go like that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.030
 combing you could say so 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.220
 and we're going to leave it like that in what 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.220
 we do everything else 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.470
 then what we are going to do is take 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:22.230
 our eye page or cardboard and we're going to 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.150
 start making the box and then we are going to 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.930
 take our ruler and our pencil and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.840
 we are going to mark in a corner we are going to 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.840
 mark 13 points 5 centimeters 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.310
 and from here to here we are going to mark 4 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.310
 centimeters 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.020
 and there it is 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.020
 and we are going to close the rectangle 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.129
 but we already have the rectangle here 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.390
 then the cause to do next is from 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:05.110
 down here we are going to mark 5.5 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.110
 centimeters 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.209
 from there we will mark down 0.5 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.819
 where this line ends we go to 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.819
 make 0.5 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.060
 0.5 and close again 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.800
 and here below we are going to do 6 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.800
 centimeters 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:50.000
 we join and we are going to make this line 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.000
 down 0.5 centimeters too 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.670
 and the same thing on this side 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.670
 and we are going to join 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.810
 and now let's cut all this 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.650
 since we have our rectangle let's 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.299
 to mark the bend 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.299
 in these lines 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.829
 and we are going to double it 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.569
 and good since we have our little box 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.009
 let's take our 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.009
 our coupons 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.060
 and we are going to need also 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.490
 Velcro pistol alcohol 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.830
 what we are going to do is 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.830
 put a little silicone here 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.110
 and we're going to stick it in this part 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.139
 what we have this at the end 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.139
 has already pasted and all that 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.650
 what we will do is take some 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.410
 of chrome 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.710
 to close I am here you can 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.780
 engineer and put something else I'm going to 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.550
 use this which is easier work more 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.110
 easy 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.110
 and I'm going to put a little 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.190
 or whatever you want to decorate it 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.630
 and well it's called it was already decorated 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.350
