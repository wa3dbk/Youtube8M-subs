chirality is important because it leads

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.180 
chirality is important because it leads
to<00:00:02.879> an<00:00:03.330> observable<00:00:03.959> physical<00:00:04.529> effect<00:00:04.920> the

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
to an observable physical effect the

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.120 
to an observable physical effect the
idea<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.640> optical<00:00:06.270> activity<00:00:07.130> optical

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
idea of optical activity optical

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.799 
idea of optical activity optical
activity<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.940> notion<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.330> chiral

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
activity is the notion that chiral

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.169 
activity is the notion that chiral
molecules<00:00:10.260> rotate<00:00:10.920> plane<00:00:11.370> polarized<00:00:11.969> light

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
molecules rotate plane polarized light

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.110 
molecules rotate plane polarized light
so<00:00:13.019> light<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.769> impinges<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.670> chiral

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
so light that impinges on a chiral

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.240 
so light that impinges on a chiral
compound<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.289> restricted<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.949> single

plane is actually rotated by the chiral
molecules<00:00:21.529> to<00:00:22.529> determine<00:00:23.010> optical<00:00:23.400> activity

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
molecules to determine optical activity

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.240 
molecules to determine optical activity
chemists<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.779> set<00:00:24.960> up<00:00:25.080> an<00:00:25.199> experiment<00:00:25.830> using

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
chemists have set up an experiment using

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.130 
chemists have set up an experiment using
an<00:00:26.340> instrument<00:00:26.490> called<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.269> polarizer

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
an instrument called a polarizer

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.779 
an instrument called a polarizer
so<00:00:28.529> let's<00:00:28.710> say<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.010> wanted<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> measure<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
so let's say we wanted to measure the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.240 
so let's say we wanted to measure the
optical<00:00:29.910> activity<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.289> molecule<00:00:31.830> here

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
optical activity of this molecule here

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.970 
optical activity of this molecule here
which<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> chiral<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.230> would<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.770> take

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
which is chiral what we would do is take

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.229 
which is chiral what we would do is take
a<00:00:35.040> light<00:00:35.309> shine<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.390> through<00:00:36.750> an<00:00:37.850> object<00:00:38.850> that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
a light shine it through an object that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.200 
a light shine it through an object that
has<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> slit<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.920> only<00:00:41.100> light<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.730> single

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
has a slit so that only light a single

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.790 
has a slit so that only light a single
plane<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:43.320> pass<00:00:43.620> through<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.640> polarizer

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
plane can pass through this polarizer

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
plane can pass through this polarizer
when<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.890> comes<00:00:47.129> out<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> other<00:00:47.550> side<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
when it comes out the other side the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.029 
when it comes out the other side the
light<00:00:48.840> will<00:00:49.020> look<00:00:49.200> something<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.829> this

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
light will look something like this

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.680 
light will look something like this
let's<00:00:50.340> say<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.610> polarized<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> plane<00:00:51.660> of

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
let's say it's polarized in the plane of

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.619 
let's say it's polarized in the plane of
the<00:00:51.899> screen<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.480> its

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the screen and so we can see its

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.250 
the screen and so we can see its
sinusoidal<00:00:55.410> waves<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.949> moves<00:00:56.190> along<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.260> if

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
sinusoidal waves it moves along and if

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.439 
sinusoidal waves it moves along and if
we<00:00:58.440> looked<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.129> from<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> perspective<00:00:59.850> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
we looked at it from the perspective of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.950 
we looked at it from the perspective of
head-on<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:02.399> looked<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> either<00:01:03.510> coming

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
head-on so we looked at it either coming

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.039 
head-on so we looked at it either coming
right<00:01:04.439> towards<00:01:04.890> us<00:01:05.040> or<00:01:05.390> moving<00:01:06.390> directly<00:01:06.810> away

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
right towards us or moving directly away

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.370 
right towards us or moving directly away
from<00:01:07.560> us<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.280> would<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
from us what we would see is that the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
from us what we would see is that the
plane<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.010> light<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.490> something<00:01:11.820> like

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
plane of the light is something like

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.050 
plane of the light is something like
this<00:01:12.420> right<00:01:13.260> perfectly<00:01:13.830> vertical<00:01:14.340> up<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
this right perfectly vertical up and

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
this right perfectly vertical up and
down<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> oscillated<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:16.680> go<00:01:16.799> up

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
down and as it oscillated it would go up

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.870 
down and as it oscillated it would go up
down<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.390> down

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
down up and down

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.149 
down up and down
now<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.119> hits<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> molecule<00:01:22.080> believe<00:01:23.070> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
now when it hits the molecule believe it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
now when it hits the molecule believe it
or<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.340> there's<00:01:23.610> actually<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.119> rotation<00:01:24.990> of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
or not there's actually a rotation of

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.200 
or not there's actually a rotation of
the<00:01:25.530> light<00:01:25.740> when<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> comes<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> other

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the light when it comes out the other

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.859 
the light when it comes out the other
side<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:28.400> somewhat<00:01:29.400> rotated<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.600> again

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
side it's somewhat rotated and so again

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.030 
side it's somewhat rotated and so again
if<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.680> looked<00:01:32.009> at<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.549> view<00:01:33.110> where<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.860> were

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
if we looked at a view where we were

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.850 
if we looked at a view where we were
directly<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:36.509> front<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.170> directly<00:01:37.680> behind

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
directly in front of or directly behind

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.940 
directly in front of or directly behind
the<00:01:38.220> light<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.090> would<00:01:39.240> see<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.590> it's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the light what we would see is that it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
the light what we would see is that it's
plane<00:01:41.340> has<00:01:41.610> been<00:01:41.640> rotated<00:01:42.360> somewhat<00:01:42.750> it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
plane has been rotated somewhat it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.990 
plane has been rotated somewhat it's
still<00:01:43.200> oscillating<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.100> down<00:01:44.220> but

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
still oscillating up and down but

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.399 
still oscillating up and down but
there's<00:01:45.180> been<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> rotation<00:01:46.049> from<00:01:46.290> that

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
there's been a rotation from that

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.999 
there's been a rotation from that
vertical<00:01:47.210> over<00:01:48.210> by<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:49.170> number<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.619> degrees

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
vertical over by some number of degrees

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.429 
vertical over by some number of degrees
the<00:01:50.850> reason<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.540> has<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
the reason for this has to do with the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.859 
the reason for this has to do with the
fact<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.369> treat<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.540> plane

number of degrees if instead we looked

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.490

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
we would see is a direction of rotation

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.220 
we would see is a direction of rotation
exactly<00:02:34.410> opposite<00:02:35.100> for<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.550> original<00:02:36.230> so

to<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.280> right<00:02:44.520> would<00:02:45.150> be<00:02:45.180> rotated<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.080> the

negative number of degrees so going
