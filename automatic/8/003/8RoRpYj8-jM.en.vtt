00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Welcome to part 3 of our video series 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.460
 pcgh builds a pc today it's about the pc 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.460
 room a tree 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.570
 One should think that the installation is one 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.230
 Trivial thing is actually 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.240
 also 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.039
 we take here our memory kit that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.920
 comes from home kingston that is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.340
 ddr3-memory fairly brisk even 8 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.260
 gb in this case and then we look 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.359
 was the mainboard comes in the four 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.730
 ram slots are pretty obvious 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.100
 but you should be careful that the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.440
 Both memories are usually also dual 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.840
 channel mode and for that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.520
 is on the mainboard on it where the ram 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.250
 should be placed 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.739
 In our case, these are the first rami 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.510
 We're right here from the front and the third 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.629
 but you can always synonymous in the manual 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.370
 read from the mainboard and takes there 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.620
 you have the memory bar which have such a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.960
 Notch in it 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.520
 just as the country itself is there 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.520
 you look out accordingly 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.150
 express something courageously then you hear it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950
 fold and the ram latch is 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.180
 engaged 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.430
 That's exactly how we do it now 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.380
 the second memory usually comes 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.479
 Herforder behind pure and finished yet 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.890
 as watch out for the ram installation because 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.790
 sometimes it can be a few sources of interference 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.759
 if you give, for example 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.250
 as we do in our example system of 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.900
 sweeping ram with big coolers 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.579
 especially the very high build and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.140
 at the same time a very big and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.780
 wants to use effective cooler 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.290
 because in our pcgh edition of 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.570
 chunk 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.890
 There you can attach two fans 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.079
 if you want that as much as we do 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.780
 have the problem but if the dam 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.250
 too high is then no space around 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.380
 to mount this fan here 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.119
 That means you should before you buy it 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.280
 Pay attention that either the ram is not like that 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.460
 builds high or just the heat sink 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.780
 not too far over the gram 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.820
 slots out 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.560
 otherwise the installation is complete 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.979
 simply you really can not go wrong 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.979
 do it 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.440
 that was our third one 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.660
 the installation of the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.950
 Memory in the next is about 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.950
 the housing until then
