door basically so I'm thinking it may be
a<00:03:58.790> giant<00:03:59.389> alligator<00:03:59.599> maybe<00:04:00.560> it's<00:04:00.799> just<00:04:00.889> a

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
a giant alligator maybe it's just a

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.909 
a giant alligator maybe it's just a
giant<00:04:01.459> puppy<00:04:01.940> or<00:04:02.060> something<00:04:02.349> with<00:04:03.349> scary<00:04:03.709> eyes

don't<00:06:22.560> know<00:06:22.620> kind<00:06:23.400> of<00:06:23.460> annoying<00:06:24.150> and<00:06:24.510> around

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
don't know kind of annoying and around

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.370 
don't know kind of annoying and around
the<00:06:24.840> way<00:06:25.760> but<00:06:26.760> yeah<00:06:26.940> this<00:06:27.810> is<00:06:27.900> going<00:06:28.050> to<00:06:28.170> be<00:06:28.260> the
