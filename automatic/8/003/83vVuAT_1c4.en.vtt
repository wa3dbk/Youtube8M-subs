00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.450
 firstly he is the lead player 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.610
 national team for me no matter how it became 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.830
 some kind of revelation the guy tries 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.860
 develops like a football player 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.600

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.190
 Chekanov you always on training so 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.070
 cool applied from the far 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.780
 distances both in training and in games 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.580
 him a good blow why not using 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.410
 if you need to beat the clans that he 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.480
 I try to score on goal 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.060
 because it's good for me 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.870
 and do not hesitate because there is 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.760
 opportunity to immediately think about it a 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.160
 whole if not about talk about your 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.630

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.830
 almost satisfied of course not everything is perfect 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:01.360
 It was so in general, all the same, scored long ago 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:08.080
 scored can be said almost satisfied 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.080
