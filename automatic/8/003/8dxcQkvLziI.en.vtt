from night room supporter and he asked
if<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.140> could<00:01:43.200> change<00:01:43.530> any<00:01:44.390> aspect<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
if I could change any aspect out in the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.410 
if I could change any aspect out in the
we<00:01:46.320> black<00:01:46.740> ops<00:01:47.009> game<00:01:47.189> if<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.939> could<00:01:48.119> improve

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
we black ops game if I could improve

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.090 
we black ops game if I could improve
anything<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.170> black<00:01:49.439> ops<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.860> would<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
anything and we black ops what would it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.749 
anything and we black ops what would it
be<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:51.110> probably<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.649> fact<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.070> some<00:01:53.579> kill

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
be and probably the fact that some kill

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.780 
be and probably the fact that some kill
streaks<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> features<00:01:54.780> were<00:01:54.899> taken<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.380> like

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
streaks and features were taken out like

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.300 
streaks and features were taken out like
theater<00:01:56.790> mode<00:01:57.049> chopper<00:01:58.049> gunner<00:01:58.310> gunship

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
theater mode chopper gunner gunship

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.889 
theater mode chopper gunner gunship
stuff<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.000> would<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
stuff like that I would put the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.469 
stuff like that I would put the
killstreaks<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.640> know<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:03.090> why<00:02:03.299> we

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
killstreaks in and I know I know why we

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.780 
killstreaks in and I know I know why we
can't<00:02:03.719> but<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.560> saying<00:02:04.770> if<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.490> could<00:02:05.670> add

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
can't but I'm just saying if I could add

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.190 
can't but I'm just saying if I could add
anything<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.270> would<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> killstreaks<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
anything it would be the killstreaks and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.199 
anything it would be the killstreaks and
maybe<00:02:07.950> even<00:02:08.160> theater<00:02:08.550> mode<00:02:08.700> theater<00:02:09.090> mode

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
maybe even theater mode theater mode

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.880 
maybe even theater mode theater mode
would<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.450> pretty<00:02:09.660> cool<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.899> check<00:02:10.200> out<00:02:10.379> like

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
would be pretty cool to check out like

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.979 
would be pretty cool to check out like
your<00:02:11.069> car<00:02:11.220> across<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> map<00:02:12.300> tomahawks<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
your car across the map tomahawks and

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.470 
your car across the map tomahawks and
stuff<00:02:13.200> like

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
stuff like

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.020 
stuff like
that<00:02:13.769> but<00:02:14.769> yeah<00:02:14.920> that's<00:02:15.129> that's<00:02:15.580> what<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:15.849> would

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
that but yeah that's that's what I would

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.119 
that but yeah that's that's what I would
change<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.480> would<00:02:16.540> just<00:02:16.780> add<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.230> killstreaks

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
change I would just add the killstreaks

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.320 
change I would just add the killstreaks
in<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.569> theater<00:02:19.569> mode<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:20.879> let's<00:02:21.879> go<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.120> the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
in the theater mode so let's go to the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.270 
in the theater mode so let's go to the
next<00:02:22.540> one<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.670> Nick<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.940> kiddo<00:02:26.159> what<00:02:27.159> is

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
next one we have Nick the kiddo what is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.979 
next one we have Nick the kiddo what is
my<00:02:27.400> favorite<00:02:27.700> call<00:02:27.849> of<00:02:27.940> duty<00:02:28.150> class<00:02:28.420> setup<00:02:28.810> on

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
my favorite call of duty class setup on

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.789 
my favorite call of duty class setup on
any<00:02:29.379> cod<00:02:29.730> um<00:02:30.730> hmm<00:02:31.629> I<00:02:32.280> always<00:02:33.280> liked<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:34.799> ak-47

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
any cod um hmm I always liked the ak-47

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.539 
any cod um hmm I always liked the ak-47
with<00:02:36.099> red<00:02:36.340> dot<00:02:36.519> sight<00:02:36.819> in<00:02:37.090> reflex<00:02:37.900> or<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.860> m16

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
with the ACOG but in black ops I would

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.920 
with the ACOG but in black ops I would
probably<00:02:41.769> have<00:02:42.099> to<00:02:42.129> go<00:02:42.400> with<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:44.129> mm<00:02:45.930> probably

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
it for my class setup we have another

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.030 
it for my class setup we have another
question<00:03:16.120> here<00:03:16.540> from<00:03:16.569> games<00:03:16.959> for<00:03:17.200> life<00:03:17.349> 23<00:03:17.950> and

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
question here from games for life 23 and

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.250 
question here from games for life 23 and
he<00:03:18.069> asks<00:03:18.519> will<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.760> ever<00:03:18.849> get<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.180> ps3<00:03:19.480> or<00:03:19.690> xbox

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
he asks will I ever get a ps3 or xbox

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.229 
he asks will I ever get a ps3 or xbox
and<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.489> good<00:03:21.669> question<00:03:21.700> but<00:03:22.180> I

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
and that is a good question but I

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.550 
and that is a good question but I
probably<00:03:22.540> will<00:03:22.780> never<00:03:22.900> get<00:03:23.200> one<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.470> those

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
probably will never get one of those

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.339 
probably will never get one of those
systems<00:03:24.040> because<00:03:24.569> I've<00:03:25.569> built<00:03:25.870> my<00:03:25.930> channel

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
systems because I've built my channel

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.030 
systems because I've built my channel
off<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.530> week<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.329> I've<00:03:28.329> come<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:29.109> be<00:03:29.829> known<00:03:29.859> as

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
off a week and I've come to be known as

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.879 
off a week and I've come to be known as
a<00:03:30.549> week<00:03:31.030> gamer<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.599> I'll<00:03:32.440> probably<00:03:32.680> always

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
a week gamer so I'll probably always

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.349 
a week gamer so I'll probably always
stay<00:03:33.250> on<00:03:33.400> way<00:03:33.579> unless<00:03:33.880> something<00:03:34.329> really

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
stay on way unless something really

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.120 
stay on way unless something really
awesome<00:03:34.720> comes<00:03:35.139> out<00:03:35.290> on<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.440> other<00:03:35.530> systems

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
awesome comes out on the other systems

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.089 
awesome comes out on the other systems
and<00:03:36.340> we<00:03:37.299> isn't<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.780> system<00:03:38.440> anymore<00:03:38.709> or

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
and we isn't the system anymore or

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.710 
and we isn't the system anymore or
something<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:39.639> don't<00:03:39.700> know<00:03:39.849> but<00:03:40.450> I'll<00:03:40.569> probably

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
something I don't know but I'll probably

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.229 
something I don't know but I'll probably
always<00:03:40.959> stay<00:03:41.319> with<00:03:41.470> me<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:42.250> will<00:03:42.639> never<00:03:42.970> switch
