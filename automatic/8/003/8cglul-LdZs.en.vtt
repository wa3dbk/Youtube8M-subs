exposure in manual you want to make sure
it<00:01:09.420> stays<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> same<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> entire<00:01:10.260> series

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
it stays the same for the entire series

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.649 
it stays the same for the entire series
even<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> Sun<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.880> setting<00:01:12.090> or<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.330> Sun<00:01:12.540> is

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
even if the Sun is setting or the Sun is

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.179 
even if the Sun is setting or the Sun is
rising<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.439> will<00:01:13.530> look<00:01:13.650> more<00:01:13.770> natural<00:01:13.830> that

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
rising it will look more natural that

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.690 
rising it will look more natural that
way<00:01:15.409> another<00:01:16.409> thing<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.369> settings

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
way another thing I do for my settings

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
way another thing I do for my settings
is<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.880> actually<00:01:18.000> shoot<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.420> JPEGs<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> only

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
is I actually shoot in JPEGs the only

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.170 
is I actually shoot in JPEGs the only
time<00:01:19.470> actually<00:01:19.740> will<00:01:20.130> shoot<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.490> JPEG<00:01:20.850> because

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
time actually will shoot in JPEG because

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
time actually will shoot in JPEG because
I<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.390> set<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> lot<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.990> images<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:22.409> one<00:01:22.619> cart<00:01:22.950> I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
I can set a lot of images on one cart I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.390 
I can set a lot of images on one cart I
can<00:01:23.670> take<00:01:23.970> over<00:01:24.540> 2,000<00:01:25.470> pictures<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.159> one

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
can take over 2,000 pictures for one

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.880 
can take over 2,000 pictures for one
actual<00:01:27.150> time-lapse<00:01:27.509> period<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.680> maybe

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
actual time-lapse period and get maybe

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.100 
actual time-lapse period and get maybe
30<00:01:29.159> seconds<00:01:29.549> or<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:30.150> our<00:01:30.360> 30-second

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
30 seconds or so of our 30-second

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.060 
30 seconds or so of our 30-second
minutes<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.890> actual<00:01:32.520> videos<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:34.710> I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
minutes of actual videos and that and I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.980 
minutes of actual videos and that and I
do<00:01:35.130> make<00:01:35.400> sure<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.689> one<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.930> these

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
do make sure I have I have one of these

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
do make sure I have I have one of these
expo<00:01:37.380> discs<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.829> use<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> preset<00:01:38.790> my

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
expo discs and I use this to preset my

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.600 
expo discs and I use this to preset my
white<00:01:39.119> balance<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.280> because<00:01:41.280> when<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.460> use

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
white balance and because when I use

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.950 
white balance and because when I use
JPEG<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.000> can't<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> lot<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.659> don't<00:01:42.840> have

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
JPEG you can't have a lot you don't have

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.749 
JPEG you can't have a lot you don't have
a<00:01:42.990> lot<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> room<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.460> with<00:01:44.579> RAW

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
a lot of room like you do with RAW

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.609 
a lot of room like you do with RAW
images<00:01:44.970> when<00:01:45.570> you're<00:01:45.689> actually<00:01:45.960> doing<00:01:46.259> white

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
images when you're actually doing white

one second exposure

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.140 
one second exposure
this<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:16.680> go<00:02:16.830> minutes<00:02:17.220> or<00:02:17.400> hours<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.060> do

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
usually just do a second or two and then

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.460 
usually just do a second or two and then
you<00:02:23.069> can<00:02:23.400> also<00:02:23.550> do<00:02:23.790> several<00:02:24.180> exposures<00:02:25.140> at<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
you can also do several exposures at the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.270 
you can also do several exposures at the
same<00:02:25.650> time<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.790> usually<00:02:27.239> keep<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.629> one<00:02:28.280> but

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
same time I usually keep it to one but

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.300 
same time I usually keep it to one but
the<00:02:29.430> most<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.730> can<00:02:29.849> do<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.000> 999<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.290> them<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.950> I

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
the most you can do is 999 of them so I

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.369

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
I'll have to restart it because it'll

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.110 
I'll have to restart it because it'll
it'll<00:02:36.599> take<00:02:36.870> 999<00:02:37.709> photos<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.459> then<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.030> will

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
it'll take 999 photos and then it will

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.789 
it'll take 999 photos and then it will
stop<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.629> then<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.840> just<00:02:39.989> have<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.230> restart<00:02:40.680> it

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
stop and then I just have to restart it

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:47.180 
stop and then I just have to restart it
and<00:02:40.920> then<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.549> go<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.530> click<00:02:43.680> OK<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.980> it
