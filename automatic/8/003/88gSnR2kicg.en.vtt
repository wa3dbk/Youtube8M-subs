after few quests I am the video on all
the<00:00:18.550> settings<00:00:19.090> of<00:00:19.270> all<00:00:19.570> my<00:00:19.689> helicopters

both<00:00:35.680> ways<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:38.170> cyclic<00:00:38.710> pitch<00:00:38.920> is<00:00:39.329> 10<00:00:40.329> degrees

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
both ways the cyclic pitch is 10 degrees

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.819 
both ways the cyclic pitch is 10 degrees
it's<00:00:42.219> quite<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.550> lot<00:00:42.700> but<00:00:43.480> you<00:00:44.140> can<00:00:44.320> use<00:00:44.469> a<00:00:44.500> dual

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
it's quite a lot but you can use a dual

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.060 
it's quite a lot but you can use a dual

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.020 
rates to turn them down I show you that
in<00:00:48.190> a<00:00:48.250> bit<00:00:48.430> in<00:00:48.550> my<00:00:48.579> transmitter<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:51.760> I'm<00:00:51.879> going

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
in a bit in my transmitter now I'm going

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.610 
in a bit in my transmitter now I'm going
to<00:00:52.090> show<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.270> my<00:00:52.510> transmitter<00:00:53.020> settings<00:00:53.469> or

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
to show you my transmitter settings or

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.380 
to show you my transmitter settings or
to<00:00:53.739> use<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:55.629> go<00:00:55.899> into<00:00:56.379> de-rate<00:00:57.039> and<00:00:57.699> expose

first<00:00:58.840> this<00:00:59.469> is<00:00:59.620> what<00:00:59.739> I<00:00:59.800> use<00:01:00.039> for<00:01:00.539> takeoffs

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
first this is what I use for takeoffs

the rudder I've recently turned that
down<00:01:23.979> because<00:01:24.159> is<00:01:24.430> crazy<00:01:25.090> fastest<00:01:25.780> tail<00:01:26.189> let's

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
down because is crazy fastest tail let's

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.679 
down because is crazy fastest tail let's
flick<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.490> back<00:01:27.520> you<00:01:27.909> see<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.240> 70<00:01:28.659> percent

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
flick it back you see that 70 percent

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.609

this<00:01:57.759> is<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.909> jar<00:01:58.240> again<00:01:58.719> this<00:01:58.899> depends<00:01:59.320> how<00:01:59.950> you

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
this is a jar again this depends how you

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.700 
this is a jar again this depends how you
mount<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:01.350> what<00:02:02.350> jar<00:02:02.619> you're<00:02:02.920> using<00:02:04.710> okay

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
mount it and what jar you're using okay
