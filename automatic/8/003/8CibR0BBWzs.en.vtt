00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
changes do bear in mind but I play

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.750 
changes do bear in mind but I play
solely<00:00:16.230> PvP<00:00:16.830> if<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.070> are<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.250> familiar<00:00:17.400> with

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
solely PvP if you are not familiar with

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.670 
solely PvP if you are not familiar with
the<00:00:17.850> channel<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> don't<00:00:19.260> really<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the channel and so I don't really have a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.650 
the channel and so I don't really have a
perspective<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.400> how<00:00:20.550> these<00:00:20.730> changes<00:00:20.760> might

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
perspective on how these changes might

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.870 
perspective on how these changes might
or<00:00:21.900> might<00:00:21.930> not<00:00:22.109> impact<00:00:22.740> PvE<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:23.670> going

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
or might not impact PvE so just going

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.460 
or might not impact PvE so just going
down<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.300> order<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> blood<00:00:25.289> elf

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
for me we are starting with the biggest

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.400 
for me we are starting with the biggest
racial<00:00:39.090> both<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:39.510> I'll<00:00:39.719> talk<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:39.930> why<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
racial both here I'll talk about why I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.840 
racial both here I'll talk about why I
think<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> biggest<00:00:41.430> bull<00:00:41.700> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
think that this is the biggest bull a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
think that this is the biggest bull a
little<00:00:42.059> bit<00:00:42.180> later<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.410> is

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
little bit later but this one is

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.350 
little bit later but this one is
definitely<00:00:43.649> huge<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.430> three<00:00:44.670> second<00:00:45.090> duration

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
definitely huge a three second duration

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.380 
definitely huge a three second duration
here<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.320> blanket<00:00:46.890> silence<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
here we blanket silence on a one and a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
here we blanket silence on a one and a
half<00:00:48.420> minute<00:00:48.840> cooldown<00:00:49.050> really<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
half minute cooldown really really is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
half minute cooldown really really is
strong<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.700> obviously<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.719> benefits

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
strong and obviously this benefits

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.779 
strong and obviously this benefits

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
little bit i do think blood elves got it

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.960 
little bit i do think blood elves got it
really<00:05:28.770> really<00:05:28.919> good<00:05:29.160> it's<00:05:29.430> almost<00:05:29.580> hard<00:05:29.910> to

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
really really good it's almost hard to

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.150 
really really good it's almost hard to
say<00:05:30.240> now<00:05:30.479> where<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.080> undead<00:05:31.560> of<00:05:31.770> blood<00:05:32.010> elves

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
say now where the undead of blood elves

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.650 
say now where the undead of blood elves
have<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.520> best<00:05:32.700> ratios<00:05:33.120> any<00:05:33.270> more<00:05:33.479> on<00:05:33.570> the

have the best ratios any more on the

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.150 
have the best ratios any more on the
horde<00:05:33.870> might<00:05:34.139> be<00:05:34.260> something<00:05:34.470> like<00:05:34.680> blood<00:05:34.979> elf

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
horde might be something like blood elf

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.890 
horde might be something like blood elf
if<00:05:35.340> you're<00:05:35.520> a<00:05:35.550> melee<00:05:35.910> and<00:05:36.210> undead<00:05:36.600> if<00:05:36.750> you're<00:05:36.870> a

if you're a melee and undead if you're a

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.379 
if you're a melee and undead if you're a
caster<00:05:37.380> when<00:05:37.500> this<00:05:37.620> goes<00:05:37.830> live<00:05:38.100> and<00:05:38.340> orcs<00:05:39.270> is

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
caster when this goes live and orcs is

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.790 
caster when this goes live and orcs is
still<00:05:39.539> going<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.720> be<00:05:39.780> top<00:05:40.020> tier<00:05:40.050> as<00:05:40.380> well<00:05:40.590> and

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
still going to be top tier as well and

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.560 
still going to be top tier as well and
then<00:05:40.889> at<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.039> bottom<00:05:41.130> of<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.639> pile<00:05:41.850> working

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
then at the bottom of the pile working

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.659 
then at the bottom of the pile working
our<00:05:42.690> way<00:05:42.780> down<00:05:42.900> we<00:05:43.289> have<00:05:43.440> torrent<00:05:43.860> then<00:05:44.370> trolls

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
our way down we have torrent then trolls

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.310 
our way down we have torrent then trolls
and<00:05:44.910> then<00:05:45.090> goblins<00:05:45.570> at<00:05:45.780> least<00:05:45.900> in<00:05:46.050> my<00:05:46.169> opinion

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
and then goblins at least in my opinion

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.080 
and then goblins at least in my opinion
so<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.860> biggest<00:05:47.160> change<00:05:47.310> there<00:05:47.550> is<00:05:47.700> to<00:05:47.849> blood

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
so the biggest change there is to blood

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.430 
so the biggest change there is to blood
elves<00:05:48.240> I<00:05:48.419> feel<00:05:48.599> like<00:05:48.690> they<00:05:48.840> used<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:49.200> be<00:05:49.289> about

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
elves I feel like they used to be about

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.200 
elves I feel like they used to be about
as<00:05:49.620> strong<00:05:49.830> as<00:05:50.010> tour<00:05:50.310> and<00:05:50.520> maybe<00:05:50.729> when<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:51.060> came

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
as strong as tour and maybe when it came

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.730 
as strong as tour and maybe when it came
to<00:05:51.360> rachels<00:05:51.750> but<00:05:52.139> now<00:05:52.229> i<00:05:52.260> would<00:05:52.380> say<00:05:52.590> that

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
to rachels but now i would say that

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.710 
to rachels but now i would say that
they're<00:05:52.860> in<00:05:52.979> the<00:05:53.010> top<00:05:53.220> three<00:05:53.520> fisher<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:54.180> the

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720
