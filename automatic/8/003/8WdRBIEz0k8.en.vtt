the body actually used a dremel tool to
do<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.140> wasn't<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.470> big<00:02:35.739> of<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.920> pain

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
do that and it wasn't that big of a pain

in<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.370> butt<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:37.780> took<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.049> little<00:02:38.140> time<00:02:38.410> and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
would basically wouldn't be able to

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.850 
would basically wouldn't be able to
return<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.760> so<00:03:10.030> there<00:03:10.239> was<00:03:10.329> a<00:03:10.360> $44<00:03:11.350> op<00:03:11.590> charge

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860
