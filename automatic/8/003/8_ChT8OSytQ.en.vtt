00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.420
 wash it lido is coming back 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.190
 what was it like to put your first feet back on the training complex 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.919
 it was very good 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.299
 I went to the Langstraat to see the true face years off 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.199
 match actually they were time and 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.660
 now i'm lucky 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.450
 from 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.409
 I am very happy to be back 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.589
 It yourself thought it was so long so expensive 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.019
 and do not start I thought there was a little kick to walk 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.349
 of my knees 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.800
 and notice nothing new like the 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.040
 just attacks 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.350
 overload o 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.960
 to place annemarie penn 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.370
 years had to appreciate and 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 hkz time we also have to give time for it 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.410
 make sure you received individual training 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.200
 how long do you have to do that you think 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.200
 time open again we watch day after day 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.080
 all have now been trained twice on the field went very well for years 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.710
 verger 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.939
 we mean more and more church day and we see it 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.880
 the boys have just returned from london you have met them 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.250
 what we have a good moments to take over 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.110
 nevertheless I managed everyone's family 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.110
 that players staff and 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.480
 people live 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.160
 I would recognize and that stegeman to see them it again I have actually missed the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.319
 the competition has been going on for a while, you have followed that a bit 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.110
 hell yes 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.930
 I followed and 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.880
 yes we are actually that i think good started to do weapons when you look 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.540
 forward for birthday 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.070
 such have not started yet 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.770
 and this year the competition will have everything 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.190
 I think that's a good start for us 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.480
 are you not yet afraid that you have fallen behind 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.979
 jazeera down 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.559
 not really I am injured can that happen to anyone there 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.490
 that smashes the throat of me the death penalty 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.489
 I did not expect I had done good preparation and 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:17.129
 now from I am I am certainly lagging behind 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.829
 I want to return to the field as soon as possible and show that 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.379
 that every one stood at the base there is now also one to the system 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.559
 played football 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:31.219
 fit you in then i think i can 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.229
 from the more the opposition year 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.959
 so I'm not scared 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.279
 what about the match last night 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:40.639
 and 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.249
 7 interesting matches 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:47.099
 ommen yes first name is the real strong and physical 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.509
 I think I played better 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:54.479
 but sometimes there 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:55.739
 too unfavorable 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.400
 I think we had to go deeper with the counter to this match 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:06.549
 to win we have achieved points and points and I think so 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.430
 make a nice room away match in enter day 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.129
 if you also have chances for twente in the rest of the pool 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.539
 yes i think t 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:21.079
 that in japan we may not be favorite for then with if i have how 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.229
 bigger a big team and the budgets and so ma I think we can 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.499
 compete with resident for the first place 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.989
 what do you need most missed 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:32.290
 7
