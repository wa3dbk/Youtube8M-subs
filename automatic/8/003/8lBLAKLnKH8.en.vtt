this<00:00:41.700> set<00:00:41.969> where<00:00:42.600> I'm<00:00:42.660> questioning<00:00:42.989> whether<00:00:43.829> i

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
this set where I'm questioning whether i

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.639 
this set where I'm questioning whether i
should<00:00:44.070> go<00:00:44.219> up<00:00:44.520> or<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.750> every<00:00:46.260> single

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
should go up or not really every single

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.880 
should go up or not really every single
training<00:00:46.920> session<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.520> unique<00:00:48.620> what<00:00:49.620> i<00:00:49.649> mean

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
training session is unique what i mean

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
training session is unique what i mean
by<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.910> judge<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> day

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
by that you have to judge it on the day

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.680 
by that you have to judge it on the day
ad<00:00:51.960> programmed<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.340> 444<00:00:54.149> as<00:00:54.239> many<00:00:54.390> reps<00:00:54.600> as

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
ad programmed to do 444 as many reps as

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.630 
ad programmed to do 444 as many reps as
possible<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.739> wait<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.039> feeling<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
possible but the wait was feeling a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.910 
possible but the wait was feeling a
little<00:00:56.850> more<00:00:57.180> difficult<00:00:57.390> than<00:00:57.750> normal<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.140> 365

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
little more difficult than normal on 365

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.869 
little more difficult than normal on 365
so<00:00:59.250> after<00:00:59.550> i<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.940> made<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> quick<00:01:00.359> comment<00:01:00.629> i

heavyweights you know I started nine

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.609 
heavyweights you know I started nine
weeks<00:01:17.159> ago<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> low<00:01:17.909> bar<00:01:18.180> squat<00:01:18.659> just

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619

weeks ago on the low bar squat just
doing<00:01:19.830> 365<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.180> transition<00:01:21.810> back<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
doing 365 and that transition back it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.130 
doing 365 and that transition back it
felt<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.710> awkward<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.759> hand<00:01:23.970> position<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.630> the

back<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> bunch<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.770> things<00:01:25.979> by<00:01:26.490> now<00:01:26.729> it's

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
back a bunch of things by now it's

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.210 
back a bunch of things by now it's
really<00:01:27.540> flowing<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> amount<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> volume

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
really flowing but the amount of volume

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219 
really flowing but the amount of volume
that's<00:01:29.490> accumulated<00:01:29.850> throughout<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.509> week<00:01:30.750> can

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that's accumulated throughout a week can

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.810 
that's accumulated throughout a week can
be<00:01:31.380> quite<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> lot<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.159> after<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.400> did<00:01:32.549> four<00:01:32.759> or

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
be quite a lot so after I did four or

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.249 
be quite a lot so after I did four or
five<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> did<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> little<00:01:33.360> bit<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.509> mobility<00:01:33.659> work

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
five I did a little bit of mobility work

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.190 
five I did a little bit of mobility work
some<00:01:35.220> plyometric<00:01:35.850> stuff<00:01:36.060> came<00:01:36.390> back<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
some plyometric stuff came back and the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.800 
some plyometric stuff came back and the
wait<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:38.040> 15<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.790> next<00:01:39.090> set<00:01:39.299> which<00:01:39.659> is

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
wait for 15 the next set which is

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.100 
wait for 15 the next set which is
heavier<00:01:40.170> actually<00:01:40.439> felt<00:01:41.280> lighter<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.479> renewed

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
heavier actually felt lighter so renewed

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.050 
heavier actually felt lighter so renewed
with<00:01:43.290> some<00:01:43.470> confidence<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.040> decided<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.850> up

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
with some confidence I decided to go up

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.330 
with some confidence I decided to go up
as<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.689> weight<00:01:45.840> was<00:01:46.110> feeling<00:01:46.619> good<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.040> form

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
as the weight was feeling good the form

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.249 
as the weight was feeling good the form
I<00:01:47.549> felt<00:01:47.579> confident<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> depth<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.170> was

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
I felt confident in the depth I was

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.990 
I felt confident in the depth I was
happy<00:01:49.619> about<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.130> I'm<00:01:50.579> going<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:50.880> you

Oh

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.720 

and<00:03:11.940> it's<00:03:12.240> good<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:13.200> last<00:03:13.650> third<00:03:14.190> rep<00:03:14.400> was<00:03:14.670> a

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
and it's good that last third rep was a

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.180 
and it's good that last third rep was a
grinder<00:03:15.360> but<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:15.930> went<00:03:16.200> for<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.470> three<00:03:16.709> after

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
grinder but I went for the three after

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.130 
grinder but I went for the three after
the<00:03:17.310> second<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.730> did<00:03:17.880> feel<00:03:18.120> heavy<00:03:18.420> but<00:03:18.750> this

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
the second it did feel heavy but this

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.190 
the second it did feel heavy but this
was<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.380> big<00:03:19.620> PR<00:03:19.920> for<00:03:20.280> me<00:03:20.400> I've<00:03:20.790> never<00:03:21.150> done<00:03:21.360> 440

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
was a big PR for me I've never done 440

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.050 
was a big PR for me I've never done 440
pounds<00:03:22.319> for<00:03:22.620> more<00:03:22.770> than<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.980> single<00:03:23.310> rep<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.030> I

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
pounds for more than a single rep so I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.110 
pounds for more than a single rep so I
got<00:03:24.209> three<00:03:24.480> reps<00:03:24.690> here<00:03:24.870> my<00:03:25.110> previous<00:03:25.620> best<00:03:25.800> is

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
got three reps here my previous best is

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.910 
got three reps here my previous best is
435<00:03:27.120> pounds<00:03:27.480> for<00:03:28.110> two<00:03:28.260> reps<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.590> really

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
435 pounds for two reps so really

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.979
