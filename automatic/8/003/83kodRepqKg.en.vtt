here<00:01:04.570> table<00:01:06.479> I'm<00:01:07.479> trying<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.840> get<00:01:07.960> my<00:01:08.080> shots

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
here table I'm trying to get my shots

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.899 
here table I'm trying to get my shots
pretty<00:01:08.619> consistent<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.369> get<00:01:09.549> that<00:01:09.670> muscle

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
pretty consistent and get that muscle

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.130 
pretty consistent and get that muscle
memory<00:01:10.180> working

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
memory working

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.459 

so<00:01:42.609> there's<00:01:42.880> our<00:01:43.030> results<00:01:43.509> I<00:01:43.749> shot<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.229> hundred

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
so there's our results I shot a hundred

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.919 
so there's our results I shot a hundred
balls<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:45.729> this<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.240> about<00:01:46.509> where<00:01:46.719> it<00:01:46.840> got

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
balls and this is about where it got

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.380 
balls and this is about where it got
started<00:01:47.409> here<00:01:47.679> and<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.670> heart<00:01:48.850> rate<00:01:48.909> was

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
started here and the heart rate was

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.359 
started here and the heart rate was
about<00:01:50.259> 78<00:01:50.920> or<00:01:51.069> 79<00:01:51.219> and<00:01:52.679> it<00:01:53.679> got<00:01:53.890> all<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.069> way<00:01:54.189> up

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
about 78 or 79 and it got all the way up

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.039 
about 78 or 79 and it got all the way up
to<00:01:54.719> 150<00:01:55.719> beats<00:01:55.950> per<00:01:56.950> minute<00:01:57.569> in<00:01:58.569> about<00:01:58.840> two

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
to 150 beats per minute in about two

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.819 
to 150 beats per minute in about two
minutes<00:01:59.229> and<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.840> can<00:02:01.990> see<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.200> burned<00:02:02.560> about
