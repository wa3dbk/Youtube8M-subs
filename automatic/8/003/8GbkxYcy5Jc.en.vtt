00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
synthetic polymer based product and we

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.620 
synthetic polymer based product and we
developed<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:27.000> give<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> durability

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
developed this to give the durability

and gloss of synthetic but the clarity

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.269 
and gloss of synthetic but the clarity
and<00:00:30.119> depth<00:00:30.420> of<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.840> best<00:00:31.140> carnuba<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.160> it's

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
and depth of the best carnuba so it's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.250 
and depth of the best carnuba so it's
the<00:00:32.340> best<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.669> both<00:00:32.880> worlds<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.809> we're<00:00:34.170> gonna

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the best of both worlds so we're gonna

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.299

and<00:01:09.950> we're<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.100> go<00:01:11.220> ahead

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.360 

apartment

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.780 

a<00:01:20.400> person<00:01:21.120> working

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.880 

now<00:01:26.390> one<00:01:26.570> thing<00:01:26.720> I<00:01:26.840> like<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.110> note<00:01:27.260> is<00:01:27.410> that<00:01:27.440> our

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
now one thing I like to note is that our

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.300 
now one thing I like to note is that our
gloss<00:01:28.130> finish<00:01:28.550> is<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:29.690> solvent-based<00:01:30.680> polymer

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
gloss finish is a solvent-based polymer

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.000 
gloss finish is a solvent-based polymer
so<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:32.810> can<00:01:33.020> appear<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.410> be<00:01:33.620> a<00:01:33.650> little<00:01:33.830> bit

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
so it can appear to be a little bit

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.550 
so it can appear to be a little bit
greasy<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:34.460> can<00:01:34.640> remove<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.030> right<00:01:35.150> away<00:01:35.560> and

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
greasy you can remove it right away and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.110 
greasy you can remove it right away and
one<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:36.950> tricks<00:01:37.070> we<00:01:37.250> use<00:01:37.490> is<00:01:37.700> distilled

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
one of the tricks we use is distilled

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.750 
one of the tricks we use is distilled
water<00:01:38.620> if<00:01:39.620> you<00:01:39.770> get<00:01:39.890> any<00:01:40.070> kind<00:01:40.220> of<00:01:40.310> hazy<00:01:40.580> or

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
water if you get any kind of hazy or

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.160 
water if you get any kind of hazy or
grease<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.270> almost<00:01:41.450> looks<00:01:41.660> like<00:01:41.690> a<00:01:41.840> scratching

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
grease it almost looks like a scratching

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.530 
grease it almost looks like a scratching
effect<00:01:42.440> but<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:42.890> not<00:01:43.070> it's<00:01:43.790> just<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:44.030> polymer

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
effect but it's not it's just a polymer

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.360 
effect but it's not it's just a polymer
are<00:01:44.690> setting<00:01:45.200> up<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.470> adhering<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.100> paint

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
are setting up and adhering to the paint

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.180 
are setting up and adhering to the paint
so<00:01:47.270> now<00:01:47.420> we've<00:01:47.630> accomplished<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.500> gloss

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
so now we've accomplished the gloss

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.190 
so now we've accomplished the gloss
finish<00:01:49.220> step<00:01:49.880> which<00:01:50.150> is<00:01:50.180> our<00:01:50.390> LSP<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.080> that's

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
finish step which is our LSP and that's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.810 
finish step which is our LSP and that's
a<00:01:51.380> product<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.890> we<00:01:52.010> want<00:01:52.160> to<00:01:52.190> apply<00:01:52.370> to<00:01:52.490> the
