 little bit of ponzu sauce what are we going 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:06.240
 to do first is to cut our insides 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.550
 let's go here to put together our medium 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.100

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.100

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.330
 that if he is going to put an ax to me he takes it 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.610
 for the issue of toilet cleaning has been more 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.430
 very well with fats the liquid of 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.739
 pork jowl is what follows followed 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.349
 of a dish that can never be missing in 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.870
 a letter tasting in Peru 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.920
 classic has been said but this time to the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.920
 Nikkei style 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.060
 proceed to mix 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.980
 our ceviche 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:59.830
 and very quick our sauce so that's why 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.650
 then we will put our cube 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.950
 fish and let's hit one of these 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.520
 buds of our see and folio simulating 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.650
 which is the culantro in the age other than 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.930
 that hour a very very cool 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.989
 interesting squid chicharrón 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.060
 we have our minister of jennifer there 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.970
 cold and hot and there are cold and 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.180
 hot for example this here that is the 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.400
 quiz and is already a guinea pig that is confit 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.980
 previously so that it comes out extremely 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.050
 soft the cui is confit and then it is 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.270
 fried in two times fry them once 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.830
 a low oil temperature remove it 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.370

 of wonderful Japanese rice yo 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.780
 I recommend eating it together here almost 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.090
 all are about two bites but when 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.290
 is this ice cream with something very hot not 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.580
 your brain scratches a little bit is 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.180
 interesting because it's fun 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.850
 also each of the 24 dishes of this 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.009
 tasting menu that took five months 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.979
 of thorough investigation 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:06.219
 perfectly accompanied here some 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.289
 examples the compact ros did not accompany 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.300
 with the malt beer he suggests to me 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.029
 shrimp I will accompany with perfect 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.550
 toluca or cracklings more white wine and 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:17.649
 ramen unaccompanied perfectly with the 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.629
 rup because of castellón that supplies 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:21.490
 liana we all know about arrears in reality 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.589
 because I serve you 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.589
 this dish first and this comes after 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:28.839
 and then it comes is a subject is now there 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:30.699
 to see what peaks you want the kitchen 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:32.349
 it does not have to be let's say flat they do not have 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.729
 to have peaks of flavors and then 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.129
 go down a bit there has to be a 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.509
 spicy because after a caldito no no 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.249
 it necessarily has to be everything 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:41.050
 too standard there are things that have 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:43.659
 what to get out of this box have to 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.689
 scratching a bit is not as you know it 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.939
 of love is only 30 years old is one of 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.639
 the youngest is already in our country 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:54.099
 says that when he was a teenager he lived 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.439
 between two minutes his mother cooked 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:59.409
 Peruvian food and his father only the 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:02.499
 Japanese but the desire to learn was going 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:05.110
 beyond that, no program of 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:06.820
 the remembered teresa ocampo 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.730
 then he went to the United States to study 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.340
 gastronomy and then traveled to japan 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.380
 where he lived two years there in a world 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.410
 totally different account that he learned 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.560
 from below in a restaurant his boss 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.810
 did wash holes for six months and 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.510
 there progressively acquired various 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.940
 cooking techniques when returning to Peru 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.980
 he started his career up until 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.990
 become one of the most cooks 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.990
 quoted from our culinary culture 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.000
 that now diffuses it all over the world 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.830
 first is the concept of teaching has 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.090
 a text administration that tells you what 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.240
 thing is what we want to show the 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:46.060
 Japanese immigration to Peru tastes the 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.160
 flavors or classic cases that are after 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.350
 we find in the sushis that already more or 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.910
 minus one has that chip in his head 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.650
 like I'm going to eat Nikkei out there 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.510

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.920
 schemes also good I invite you to 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:02.080
 come and try this nikkei experience 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.750
 in which they will know a little bit about 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.140
 crazy about the traditional Nikkei and his 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.830
 also a different concept 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.160
 funny 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.810
 pretty tasty apart if you want to 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.740
 also with a marriage that will be 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.740
 full and season 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.060
 here
