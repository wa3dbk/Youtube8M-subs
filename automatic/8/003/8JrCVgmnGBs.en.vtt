the rocket launcher can set people on

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.380 
the rocket launcher can set people on
fire<00:02:04.420> just<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.479> show<00:02:05.719> you<00:02:05.780> what<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.140> look<00:02:06.469> like

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.130 

one<00:02:11.960> minute<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:14.180> also<00:02:14.360> has<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.690> default<00:02:16.030> this

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
one minute it also has a default this

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.920 
one minute it also has a default this
here<00:02:18.140> put<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.980> away

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
of makes sense to be a diamond but it's

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.260

a gold sword that way um mobs can when
they're<00:03:34.420> holding<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:34.990> because<00:03:35.620> I've<00:03:36.130> seen

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
they're holding it because I've seen

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.900 
they're holding it because I've seen
them<00:03:37.210> like<00:03:37.630> zombies<00:03:38.080> for<00:03:38.230> example<00:03:38.590> um<00:03:39.070> and

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
that it'll be a walk through of this too

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.170 
that it'll be a walk through of this too
so<00:04:22.710> wait<00:04:23.710> for<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:24.100> so<00:04:24.340> download<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.000> play

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
it you'll get to see the walk through

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.790 
it you'll get to see the walk through
and<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:28.300> good<00:04:28.510> because<00:04:28.690> since<00:04:29.169> I<00:04:29.290> built<00:04:29.440> it<00:04:29.680> I

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
and it's good because since I built it I

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.220 
and it's good because since I built it I
know<00:04:29.860> and<00:04:30.340> I'll<00:04:30.460> get<00:04:30.730> to<00:04:30.790> every<00:04:31.150> every<00:04:31.960> little

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
know and I'll get to every every little

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.460 
know and I'll get to every every little
room<00:04:32.410> in<00:04:32.680> building

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.590 

so<00:04:38.190> yeah<00:04:38.490> basically<00:04:38.700> you<00:04:39.060> just<00:04:39.240> get<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.360> rack<00:04:39.570> of

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
so yeah basically you just get a rack of

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.370 
so yeah basically you just get a rack of
helmets<00:04:40.140> um<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:41.630> guess<00:04:42.630> I<00:04:42.780> could<00:04:42.990> do<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:43.230> were

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
helmets um I guess I could do it were

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.440 
helmets um I guess I could do it were
since<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.950> patcher<00:04:44.160> can<00:04:44.550> make<00:04:44.670> it<00:04:44.790> so<00:04:44.970> random

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
since the patcher can make it so random

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.870 
since the patcher can make it so random
mobs<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.870> could<00:04:46.050> make<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:46.350> so<00:04:46.380> your<00:04:46.740> mob<00:04:46.920> you're

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
mobs I could make it so your mob you're

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.700 
mobs I could make it so your mob you're
not<00:04:48.000> just<00:04:48.300> you<00:04:48.810> could<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.110> could<00:04:49.290> do<00:04:49.410> like<00:04:49.590> the

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
not just you could I could do like the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.590 
not just you could I could do like the
green<00:04:49.980> then<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.490> could<00:04:50.640> do<00:04:50.730> a<00:04:50.760> red<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.270> a<00:04:51.330> blue

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
green then I could do a red and a blue

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.670 
green then I could do a red and a blue
and<00:04:51.900> then<00:04:52.230> a<00:04:52.260> yellow<00:04:53.750> armor<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:54.930> then<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.200> plus

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
and then a yellow armor and then it plus

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.780 
and then a yellow armor and then it plus
I<00:04:55.800> could<00:04:55.920> make<00:04:56.010> more<00:04:56.160> elites<00:04:59.210> but<00:05:01.550> yeah<00:05:02.550> and

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
I could make more elites but yeah and

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.350 
I could make more elites but yeah and
it's<00:05:03.060> really<00:05:03.120> cool<00:05:07.670> so<00:05:08.670> a<00:05:08.700> bunch<00:05:09.000> of<00:05:09.180> things

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
it's really cool so a bunch of things

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.270 
it's really cool so a bunch of things
are<00:05:09.600> alien<00:05:10.410> eyes<00:05:12.380> you'll<00:05:13.380> find<00:05:13.620> two<00:05:13.980> keys

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
are alien eyes you'll find two keys

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.650 
are alien eyes you'll find two keys
there<00:05:14.640> will<00:05:14.730> be<00:05:14.820> key<00:05:14.970> number<00:05:15.240> one<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.540> key

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
there will be key number one and key

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.250 
there will be key number one and key
number<00:05:15.930> two<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:17.090> basically<00:05:18.090> you<00:05:18.930> need<00:05:19.110> those

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.350 
plus it go set the building on fire but
that<00:05:49.380> would<00:05:49.560> be<00:05:49.590> a<00:05:49.710> good<00:05:49.830> idea<00:05:50.160> I<00:05:50.220> guess<00:05:50.430> but<00:05:51.150> no

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
that would be a good idea I guess but no

it's<00:05:51.570> not<00:05:51.690> a<00:05:51.720> guest<00:05:52.430> although<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.610> would<00:05:53.790> be

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
it's not a guest although that would be

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.680 
it's not a guest although that would be
that<00:05:54.180> idea<00:05:54.480> yeah<00:05:56.060> then<00:05:57.060> I<00:05:57.120> could<00:05:57.270> change<00:05:57.419> fire
