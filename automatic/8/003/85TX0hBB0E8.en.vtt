00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.920 
that and working as the coach for them
now<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.579> brilliant<00:01:51.030> if<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.210> does<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.720> so

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
now be brilliant if it does do that so

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.080 
now be brilliant if it does do that so
if<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.470> falling<00:01:52.829> he's<00:01:53.189> got<00:01:53.399> any<00:01:53.549> free<00:01:53.729> rated

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.240 
if we falling he's got any free rated
card<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.079> don't<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.530> he's<00:01:55.710> gonna<00:01:55.860> get

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
card and I don't think he's gonna get

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.580 
card and I don't think he's gonna get
upgrade<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.880> downgrade<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.630> fifa15<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.409> think

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
upgrade or downgrade in fifa15 I think

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.260 
upgrade or downgrade in fifa15 I think
he's<00:01:58.680> gonna<00:01:58.799> stay<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.219> same<00:01:59.399> gonna<00:01:59.670> stay<00:01:59.880> 83

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
he's gonna stay the same gonna stay 83

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.910 
he's gonna stay the same gonna stay 83
ready<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:00.689> we've<00:02:00.840> tweaked<00:02:01.110> within<00:02:01.469> furious

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
ready but we've tweaked within furious

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.679 
ready but we've tweaked within furious
that<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.369> obviously<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.060> getting<00:02:03.270> old<00:02:03.450> news

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689

about<00:02:03.930> 36<00:02:04.469> or<00:02:04.590> 37<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:06.119> he's<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.509> to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
