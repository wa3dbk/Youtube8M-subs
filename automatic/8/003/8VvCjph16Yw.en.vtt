00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
off so from here this one's a little bit

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.619 
off so from here this one's a little bit
trickier<00:02:36.939> just<00:02:37.939> because<00:02:38.090> we<00:02:38.239> got<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.480> herbs

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629

to<00:02:38.870> deal<00:02:39.139> with<00:02:40.299> it's<00:02:41.299> just<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.599> little<00:02:41.749> trickier

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
to deal with it's just a little trickier

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.800 
to deal with it's just a little trickier
getting<00:02:42.409> it<00:02:42.499> into<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:43.099> actual<00:02:43.609> bottle
