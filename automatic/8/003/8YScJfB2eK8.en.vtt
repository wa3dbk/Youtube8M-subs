00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.389 
as a whole Apaches are attack
helicopters<00:00:31.170> we've<00:00:31.320> seen<00:00:31.560> them<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.800> general

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
helicopters we've seen them in general

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.479 
helicopters we've seen them in general
use<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.660> Iraq<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.530> in<00:00:34.649> Afghanistan<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
use in in Iraq and in Afghanistan and of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.520 
use in in Iraq and in Afghanistan and of
course<00:00:35.670> most<00:00:35.880> recently<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.540> Libya<00:00:37.110> where

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
course most recently in Libya where

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.709 
course most recently in Libya where
their<00:00:37.829> involvement<00:00:38.340> was<00:00:38.850> seen<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> marked

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
their involvement was seen as a marked

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.880 
their involvement was seen as a marked
escalation<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.969> involvement<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.809> UK<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
escalation in the involvement of UK and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.310 
escalation in the involvement of UK and
and<00:00:44.460> French<00:00:44.820> NATO<00:00:45.149> troops<00:00:45.660> they're<00:00:45.870> very<00:00:46.110> low

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and French NATO troops they're very low

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.229 
and French NATO troops they're very low
flying<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> likelihood<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.550> casualties

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
flying so the likelihood of casualties

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.470 
flying so the likelihood of casualties
is<00:00:48.930> much<00:00:49.500> increased<00:00:50.039> by<00:00:50.340> their<00:00:50.820> presence

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
is much increased by their presence

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.360 
is much increased by their presence
there<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.530> does<00:00:52.680> certainly<00:00:52.980> look<00:00:53.340> like

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
there and it does certainly look like

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.310 
there and it does certainly look like
him<00:00:53.699> escalation<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.510> involvement<00:00:54.899> again

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
him escalation of that involvement again

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.709 
him escalation of that involvement again
as<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.559> said<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.010> many<00:00:56.160> times<00:00:56.280> about<00:00:56.610> Libya<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
as we said so many times about Libya the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.580 
as we said so many times about Libya the
legality<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.250> extremely<00:01:00.239> unclear<00:01:00.809> we

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
legality of this is extremely unclear we

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.250 
legality of this is extremely unclear we
are<00:01:01.770> seeing<00:01:02.070> us<00:01:03.000> drone<00:01:03.329> attacks<00:01:03.690> increasing

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
are seeing us drone attacks increasing

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.560 
are seeing us drone attacks increasing
numbers<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.530> us<00:01:04.830> drone<00:01:05.070> attacks<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:06.060> Yemen

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
numbers of us drone attacks in in Yemen

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.990 
numbers of us drone attacks in in Yemen
and<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.950> reasoning<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and the the reasoning for that is that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.690 
and the the reasoning for that is that
al<00:01:09.479> Qaeda<00:01:09.840> according<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> US<00:01:10.979> forces<00:01:11.369> is

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
al Qaeda according to US forces is

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340 
al Qaeda according to US forces is
taking<00:01:12.240> advantage<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.750> what's<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.170> in

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
taking advantage of what's going in

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.960 
taking advantage of what's going in
there<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:14.250> they're<00:01:14.400> moving<00:01:14.760> into

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
there going on there they're moving into

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
there going on there they're moving into
this<00:01:15.060> power<00:01:15.360> vacuum<00:01:15.869> which<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> being<00:01:16.320> created

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
this power vacuum which is being created

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
this power vacuum which is being created
since<00:01:17.100> President<00:01:17.820> Saleh<00:01:18.060> left<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> went<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
since President Saleh left and went to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.420 
since President Saleh left and went to
Saudi<00:01:19.049> Arabia<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.830> medical<00:01:20.250> treatment

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
Saudi Arabia for medical treatment

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.520 
Saudi Arabia for medical treatment
moving<00:01:21.210> into<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.570> opping<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> activity

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
moving into that opping the activity

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
moving into that opping the activity
taking<00:01:22.950> advantage<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> general<00:01:23.909> civil<00:01:24.119> unrest

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
taking advantage of general civil unrest

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.990 
taking advantage of general civil unrest
to<00:01:24.750> grab<00:01:25.049> more<00:01:25.560> support<00:01:26.070> more<00:01:26.369> power<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.939> more

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
to grab more support more power and more

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.539 
to grab more support more power and more
territory<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.140> that's<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.650> reason<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
territory so that's the reason for the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.730 
territory so that's the reason for the
US<00:01:29.820> are<00:01:30.090> paying<00:01:30.509> those<00:01:30.630> those<00:01:31.110> drone<00:01:31.409> attacks

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
US are paying those those drone attacks

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.740 
US are paying those those drone attacks
that's<00:01:32.009> how<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.310> justifying<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that's how it's justifying it but of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.450 
that's how it's justifying it but of
course<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.990> power<00:01:34.290> vacuum<00:01:34.650> works<00:01:34.829> both<00:01:35.130> ways

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
course that power vacuum works both ways

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.460 
course that power vacuum works both ways
interestingly<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.329> US<00:01:36.600> forces<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.140> military

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
interestingly the US forces the military

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
interestingly the US forces the military
forces<00:01:37.740> used<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.159> cooperate<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.820> President

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
forces used to cooperate with President

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.539 
forces used to cooperate with President
Saleh<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.840> who<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.259> attack<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.860> when<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
Saleh on on who to attack and when the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.310 
Saleh on on who to attack and when the
intelligence<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.390> kind<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.780> typical<00:01:43.140> those

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.380 
intelligence that kind of typical those
kinds<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> territorial<00:01:44.189> issues<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
kinds of territorial issues but now the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999 
kinds of territorial issues but now the
u.s.<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:45.990> easily<00:01:46.290> say<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.500> there's<00:01:46.799> no

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
u.s. can easily say that there's no

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.010 
u.s. can easily say that there's no
authorities<00:01:47.549> with<00:01:47.759> whom<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.420> cooperate<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
authorities with whom to cooperate the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.300 
authorities with whom to cooperate the
government's<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.560> essentially<00:01:49.920> not<00:01:50.189> in

from from which to fly those so it's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.380 
from from which to fly those so it's
really<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.870> very<00:02:43.440> much<00:02:43.739> more<00:02:44.130> involved<00:02:44.520> in
