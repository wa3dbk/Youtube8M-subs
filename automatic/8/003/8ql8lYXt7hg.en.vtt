00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.900 
photography and patients are doing very
well<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.000> treatment<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:46.460> can<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.670> bits

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
well with the treatment I can see bits

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
well with the treatment I can see bits
and<00:00:48.090> pieces<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.840> see<00:00:48.870> where<00:00:49.440> hair

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and pieces of it I can see where hair

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.459 
and pieces of it I can see where hair
wasn't<00:00:49.860> before<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.879> other<00:00:51.840> people<00:00:52.199> have<00:00:52.289> seen

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
wasn't before but other people have seen

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.569 
wasn't before but other people have seen
me<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> head<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.370> past

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
me in the head and see me in the past

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.799 
me in the head and see me in the past
and<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:53.820> say<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.120> tremendous<00:00:54.329> difference

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and they say with tremendous difference

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.069 
and they say with tremendous difference
so<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.199> pretty<00:00:55.410> happy<00:00:55.590> about<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:57.660> entire

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
so I'm pretty happy about it the entire

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.740 
so I'm pretty happy about it the entire
front<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.469> my<00:00:58.559> hair<00:00:58.739> ruined<00:00:59.149> so<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> mean<00:01:00.539> he<00:01:00.719> has

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
front of my hair ruined so I mean he has

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.420 
front of my hair ruined so I mean he has
pictures<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.230> before<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.739> after<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.309> it's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
pictures of before and after and it's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.200 
pictures of before and after and it's
hard<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> believe<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.780> difference

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
hard to believe the difference

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.610 
hard to believe the difference
really<00:01:05.690> amazing

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.620 

dr.<00:01:08.980> Baumann<00:01:09.310> says<00:01:09.580> if<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.850> follicles<00:01:10.300> are<00:01:10.420> no

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
dr. Baumann says if the follicles are no

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.540 
dr. Baumann says if the follicles are no
longer<00:01:11.050> functioning<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:11.890> no<00:01:12.160> amount<00:01:12.400> of

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
longer functioning and no amount of

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.370 
longer functioning and no amount of
laser<00:01:12.760> therapy<00:01:13.060> will<00:01:13.420> make<00:01:13.570> new<00:01:13.840> hair<00:01:14.050> grow

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
laser therapy will make new hair grow

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.170 
laser therapy will make new hair grow
however<00:01:15.190> if<00:01:15.400> you<00:01:15.520> have<00:01:15.670> functioning

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
however if you have functioning

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.940 
however if you have functioning
follicles<00:01:16.690> it<00:01:16.840> may<00:01:16.990> improve<00:01:17.230> the<00:01:17.470> quantity

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
follicles it may improve the quantity

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:27.510 
follicles it may improve the quantity
and<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.520> quality<00:01:18.760> of<00:01:19.090> your<00:01:19.240> hair
