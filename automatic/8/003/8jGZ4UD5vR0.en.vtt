00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.250
 well we have a wonderful week going 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.809
 finally beautiful two weeks we have 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.370
 be in fourth place 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.600
 could nicely work towards this 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.820
 very nice yesterday our 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.950
 fantastic poorters this good and then 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.410
 starts the match and the polite albert 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.660
 rust nac and fantastic learning experience 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.060
 Let us thank you for playing the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.690
 Ball and LÃ©onard does not have a new one 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.910
 record 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.470
 the fastest pin all theory there we are 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.080
 proud because the record we 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.279
 only it was annoying because two 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.910
 weeks ago he was already tackled by 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.980
 a mole 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.840
 with psv is the last one for the boy 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.790
 that htnk action 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.650
 but it is annoying there I am 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.720
 very honest in the football so you 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.280
 actually the entire first half of football 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.510
 you go after it because you get the growth 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 it turns or returns in football you get 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.739
 one can blow you after so many seconds 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.120
 fortunately no red that you could plex 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.350
 someone of mine walked alongside someone 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.930
 the ball went to the side that is 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.270
 neatly a your back afterwards we got 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.250
 a number of opportunities in the first fifteen minutes 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.410
 we missed the knight and so too 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.630
 batch and after that heerenveen van 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.949
 my only chance you had that 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.829
 those how it didn't shoot in two 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.720
 three times well we are lucky after one 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.770
 we want to have peace of mind 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.060
 things discussed how we do things 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.350
 do it differently 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.970
 yes then we will get our own goal 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.640
 my operating for me and that are 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.070
 clapping clappers in football and like 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.510
 then we can do this with our team 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.299
 yes then we are actually backwards best 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.119
 well pleased with the point you have 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.500
 again excellent excellent switches 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.299
 raids 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.520
 and i think at that moment you can 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.900
 just the two three grasp the moment 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.270
 the virgil nothing only on the keeper 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.090
 coming off is just a bit very smart 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.549
 hold on to pdf does not hold 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.020
 love to hold on to what is not 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.400
 enough to get a pen or whatever 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.810
 then does not have to but he left 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.680
 shoot through her room nicely 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.990
 it doesn't 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.340
 and then the year goes back and forth and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.619
 I think it was Heerenveen him I recently too 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.150
 can win if a ball goes in then yes 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.450
 you can do that from a otigba corner 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.890
 there and then we are not really with 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.950
 chances are going to say do what it says 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.619
 more back and forth what they club and not 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.909
 play good football but think exciting 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.619
 found a nice match 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.259
 I think beautiful competition for the public 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.780
 not really the barcelona football 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.600
 where we normally do dwight no you too 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.880
 but but we have we have struggle 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.190
 but see both teams 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.770
 I enjoyed it with point beautiful 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.110
 a van again happy with longer and 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.150
 pick up a beer why are you staying 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.580
 Nations 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.530
 module nice point here and I take one 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.910
 nice neighborhood here 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.910
 thank you dan blight by dan 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.640
 I think we can take care of it 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.590
 the fresh started but there we are 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.050
 increasingly the same in the first minute 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.910
 I10 remmelt I think that chance 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.500
 sande from the area that came after that 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.500
 we had a great opportunity 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.170
 we no longer really had the initiative 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.350
 after some time we touch something 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.350
 lost 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.390
 so we are actually a bit one 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.350
 search gone from and how high and how 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.730
 we are going to put pressure quickly and ultimately 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.250
 you stand up from giving not much 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.950
 chances away it's a 0 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.540
 after the break we make 2 0 yes then come over 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.400
 again almost the feeling that you can 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.850
 some win 2 0 at home 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.170
 that could it is not over till 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.450
 it's about they say then 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.630
 and that happens in the two 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.739
 years of game resumes in which we put it 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.209
 let there be a this corner and there 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.549
 is a free kick where you don't melo 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.980
 so with the rebound it was natural 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.329
 of course I think we are deadly 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.980
 are still a search with it 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.900
 team of if we are on a certain 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.239
 want to play the way we are pursuing 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.620
 then it's about the little things that we do 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.870
 then do better and like that 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.030
 means running with a free kick 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.280
 so you riba which does not alter or 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.920
 you with the corner and rhijnestein free 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.239
 who heads it in but also in how to put it 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.980
 we are busy and how are we going to do that 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.570
 then we have to take a step then 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.040
 we have to do even better it is 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.769
 a shame for us that the 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.420
 diamond feeling of 2 0 for such a 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.890
 can win a competition and 2 2 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.630
 that feels a bit like one like one 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.440
 defeat but in the end I think it is 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.019
 a 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.019
 a justified result afterwards yes
