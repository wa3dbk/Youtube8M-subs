00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.280
 the contact cases are certainly rarer than not only UFOs in this 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.269
 moment a ship or a certain number of ships redundant repeated 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 times for the same person for a long time 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.150
 during the past few years a resident of mallarmÃ© called adriÃ¡n record what 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.349
 that today is considered one of the best documents of contact cases 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.609
 of history 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.599
 At first the observations were given at a distance from your house 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.150
 but it was not long before the ship began to appear on its 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.670
 yard 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.820
 these amazing images show a huge shining disk of 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.500
 approximately nine feet in diameter 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.270
 that was flying very close to his house 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.340
 in the blink of an eye the ship disappeared 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.260
 once the film was revealed it could be clearly seen how the ze ship 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.380
 material and sabha frame by frame 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.860
 the contact with Adrian was carried out for many years 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.880
 and the authorities were never informed for fear of being considered ridiculous and 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.930
 suffer some reprisal 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.090
 among the many movie hours this observation is considered one of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.610
 the most dramatic 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.659
 started at 10 3 pm on October 20, 1995 and lasted almost 50 thousand 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.050
 the meeting ended with Adrian following the ship on the high highway 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.590
 speed 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.940
 here we can see the ship minutes later started observation 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.810
 this extraordinary movie was never aired in 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.620
 since it is shown for the first time we can clearly see the ship 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.880
 fluttering silently over the houses 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.360
 these ships are known as lightning ships or in some cases as mother ships 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.090
 They won the reputation for the report on its size 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.150
 and the other two of them belong the ship when it appears 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.350
 approximately 38 minutes of observation 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.020
 the ship began to move away with a flutter of his house 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.290
 Adrian followed the ship from his car and stopped on the highway to 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.480
 filming it near an apartment building 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.630
 A few minutes later he flew to the Miami International Airport where 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.039
 He flew for a moment 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.849
 then he headed towards a residential area decision cost him to get lost 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.789
 completely sight 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.229
 when they emerged from my wooded field they could continue signing but not 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.999
 it took a long time until the ship accelerated 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:26.299
 while the signature goes to 50 miles per hour the ship was completely lost from 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.449
 view 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.719
 this image in slow motion 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.979
 clearly shows how the ship took speed along the coast 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.840
 until today Adrian maintains his experience of these appearances 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.920
 recurrent
