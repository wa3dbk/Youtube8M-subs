00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.620
 the smile is important in the 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.320
 social relations a few teeth 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.450
 clustered misaligned or overlapping 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.960
 they can compromise the appearance 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.209
 general of the person but beyond 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.340
 the aesthetic aspects a bad position 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.340
 dental can carry the following 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.530
 wrong hygiene problems since it will be 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.450
 more complicated to use the brush and the 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.880
 city â€‹â€‹'dental because of the difficulty of 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.010
 access to certain areas accumulation of 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.780
 food debris in retentive areas 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.160
 that should not exist with the 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.530
 consequent appearance of caries 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.260
 gingivitis and even more problems 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.390
 severe difficulty during chewing 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.600
 since the teeth do not mesh 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.219
 perfectly they can also appear 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.589
 ailments in the articulation of the 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:51.449
 muscle jaw and headaches 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.449
 and heard among others 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.850
 orthodontics in addition to improving the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.890
 aesthetics will solve the problems 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.829
 prior to bringing the teeth to your 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.409
 ideal position there are different types 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.140
 of orthodontics 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.509
 one option is fixed orthodontics that the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.310
 patient can not remove by itself and 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.649
 generally uses small elements 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.409
 of fastening called brackets that go 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.840
 glued to the teeth the brackets are 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.170
 unite each other by a thin wire and 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.170
 gums 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.460
 Another option is removable orthodontics 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.100
 that employs appliances that the patient 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.960
 You can take off and put freely 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.490
 Occasionally it is combined with orthodontics 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.890
 Fixed or serviced after it 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.049
 keep in mind that the choice of type 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.970
 of orthodontics does not depend on the patient 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.970
 but of the needs of his mouth 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.220
 If you have children, we advise you 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.009
 I do an orthodontic revision to 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.899
 from 6 years or even earlier to 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.180
 order to intercept any problem of 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.750
 development very difficult to solve in 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.750
 later ages 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.720
 and if your teeth are badly positioned 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.000
 and you feel unhappy do not worry about 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.860
 Orthodontic age can be performed 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.259
 both in childhood as well as in 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.619
 adolescence and during maturity 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.619
 Cheer up 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.520
 Y 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.730
 ah
