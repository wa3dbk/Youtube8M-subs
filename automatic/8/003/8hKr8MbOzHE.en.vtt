00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 hi to all the kids welcome 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.319
 personal episode of minecraft mod today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.620
 let's talk about a fashion day 1 point 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.929
 7.10 and 1.8 boys the fashion in these yes 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.910
 call memory cleaner is a lot of fashion 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.429
 interested and that is noticeable enough 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.619
 little for what reason guys now ve 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.869
 I show it you see the memory in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.529
 use is about 10 percent and fall by 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.170
 600 to 500 if we get beyond that 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.420
 quantity every 10 seconds because I 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.220
 I set it up so by config it will do this 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.050
 three seconds shot two seconds 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.910
 you have seen this wide from now on 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.190
 a little will do another for what reason 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 this mode takes technology 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.260
 precisely of gava itself and to make a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.570
 forced cleaning of all those 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.550
 variables that are installed inside a 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.239
 minecraft that are superfluous and remain 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.309
 on the rump 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.020
 you know that after a few packages 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.430
 especially large with so many fashions 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.829
 arrive 4 and 4 gb 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.050
 you will need to restart the package in this one 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.840
 so you can set a duration that 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.000
 goes from ten seconds to maybe a 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.320
 a few hours that practically does this 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.420
 shot of 23 seconds ago the police 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.460
 total more or less recovery if 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.290
 we talk about six jig filled with should 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.970
 get to 500 megs as if it didn't have 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.880
 used to nothing in fact when he does it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.799
 shooting from 500 mega passes 300 then in 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 large quantity should go from 2 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.369
 giga 300 mega then a cleaning 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.810
 total of the package 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.700
 so fashion guys is a lot 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.560
 simple that I can't explain you not 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.420
 I can show you though if you go to the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.159
 site then on the link you find in 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.220
 description you can see two images 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.189
 of cleaning a package of 60 fashions 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.159
 from first to after boys is a very way 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.810
 simple both client side and server side 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.090
 of any power to clean servers 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.070
 or only client and yours in a manner 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.930
 that if you know you don't need multiplayer 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.850
 you can make the game cleaner afterwards 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.070
 a certain amount of time it will be playing 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.659
