00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.190
 sleepless nights spent playing in bed 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.380
 without falling asleep 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.650
 all because of this new game 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.420
 weblog blizzard stone besides being 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.060
 the cause of my insomnia and also the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.529
 new and unexpected I would add game 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 of great beer 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.449

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.519
 at launch this game will be free e 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.809
 available for everyone 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.489
 following the new trend and the market 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.280
 videogame that is to create a 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.109
 game that lives on mum micro-transactions 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.489
 blizzard has decided to try to create 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.069
 two new products 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.469
 the first one is hairston and the second one 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.389
 heroes of the storm but we'll talk about it 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.829
 later 

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:03.059
 in this new game set 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.460
 in the warcraft universe 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.409
 we will return many characters already seen and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.219
 continuous quotes even to players 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.920
 such as the famous leroy jenkins 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.500
 in any case, I have some questions 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.140
 i am place because blizzard did 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.329
 this game didn't already have a game of 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.399
 collectible cards and never has 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.170
 created a readjustment of the game 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.899
 the original crankcase making 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.579
 simply the answer to everyone online 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.469
 these questions come from the way in 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.630
 which was conceived and developed this 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.149
 title was born as a small project 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.469
 of a small group of developers 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.240
 within the blizzard than for the 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.579
 pure taste of trying to create something 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.560
 of different they have combined mechanics of 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.630
 most famous card games but at the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.039
 same time simplifying and inserting 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.450
 in the cun and who gave way to 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.280
 exist only thanks 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.640
 to the unique interface that is a 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.500
 video game can offer 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.909
 slowly this project was done 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.650
 street within the company e 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.390
 conquering in his interest up to 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.880
 get to where we are today in the class 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.040
 beta that still has no idea when 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.950
 will end but instead now we talk about 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.720
 dynamics of the game itself judo itself 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.670
 very intuitive but don't let yourself go 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.950
 deceive by this apparent simplicity 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.510
 the high level title manages to 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.920
 be very competitive the rich of 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.930
 various strategies that make it very 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.760
 also interesting and attractive 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.130
 more experienced players 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.450
 the goal is of course 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.360
 defeat your opponent 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.310
 reducing its life points from 30 to 0 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.760
 before he can do the same 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.650
 with you this goal can be 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.230
 achieved either by attacking with one's own 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.550
 creatures both using spells and weapons 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.550
 unique abilities of their characters 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.180
 every creature its turn can have 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.980
 different lives such as charge that 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.380
 allows to attack immediately once 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.120
 put the card since it is normally every 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.760
 creature is forced to wait for a 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.920
 turn to attack or as for example 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.720
 to the town skill that compels 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.070
 the opponent to attack only the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.570
 monster that owns this 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.390
 feature until this does not 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.680
 other skills can be destroyed 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.209
 activate when your mini does not 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.070
 is put on the ground or comes 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.140
 defeated at the beginning or end of the 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.270
 own turn 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.410
 even spells have different effects 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.720
 some may still be our hero 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.650
 or damage the opponent 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.630
 allow us to draw cards or 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.930
 Destroy the enemy's creature and so 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.450
 Street 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.340
 in short, there is really a great variety 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.550
 of strategies that can be used to arrive at 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.080
 decimate the life of those we have against 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.880
 a type of paper that I never have 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.890
 encountered in other similar games are 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.660
 the weapons that allow our hero 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.490
 once equipped to attack 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.120
 directly a target to ours 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.100
 chosen up to the number of times avoided 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.440
 as I had already announced there are the 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.570
 9 different classes each with 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.310
 several unique skills at the time of 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.780
 deck creation is possible 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.450
 choose which of these heroes 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.580
 we're going to use this choice 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.650
 in addition to determining those unique skills 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.570
 we will use it will give us access also 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.790
 a series of usable cards 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.920
 only from the classical one to ours 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.870
 we will have the warrior there 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.930
 the paladin the rock swarm 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.870
 Hunter the Druid the Warlock The Wizard 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.490
 and finally the priest every class 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.709
 characterized by a well-known character 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.060
 from the world of warcraft 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.130
 when you start playing for the first one 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.620
 once hearst we will have one available 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.450
 single class but playing several games 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.669
 training against the computer e 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.500
 defeating we may not be unlocking 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.800
 new unique cards with our class 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.840
 but also unlock the hero defeated one 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.030
 very interesting mode that remembers 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.830
 very draft and arena style 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.919
 accessible only after unlocking 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.840
 all heroes to be able to access 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.690
 this free mode for the first 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.390
 time we will have to pay a cost of 150 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.310
 gold obtainable through wins is 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.050
 this is daily or thanks to 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.960
 payment of about 2 euros 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.640
 in this mode we will be placed in front 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.280
 to the choice of having to build a 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.560
 deck using random cards by putting 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.690
 so test our luck e 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.150
 I emphasize luck, not ours 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.830
 ability to succeed in creating a 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.120
 winning strategy with what is there 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.469
 captain 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.300
 in the arena you have the possibility of 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.169
 earn depending on the number of 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.990
 games won 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.029
 several the world gold sachets containing 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.219
 papers and finally even dust 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:19.020
 arcana the latter very useful indeed 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:21.659
 will allow us to treat any kind of 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.689
 paper the arkan powder is obtainable 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:27.150
 denying or better yes enchanting 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.340
 cards each with different values ​​a 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.020
 depending on the rarity and useless 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.580
 emphasize how to treat cards 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.129
 really rare useful they want 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.139
 industrial amount of dust each 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:40.409
 paper a different rarity that varies from 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:42.479
 common up to derby here I also want to 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.460
 emphasize how rare it is to find one 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:46.590
 ethical paper inside the sachets po 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.610
 how much arcar powder is needed for 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.680
 can even craft only one card in 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.759
 this game besides dental branch e 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.029
 to normal matches 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.229
 we also have missed entries 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.029
 each player starts from a level 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.710
 minimum of 30 up to a 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.719
 maximum level of small rations 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.729
 particular that the ranking every month 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:08.009
 will be reset at least for now in the 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.810
 I see in the future for every reset ai 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.439
 players will be recommended by 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.060
 wheels depending on the level reached 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.949
 before I talked about these daily 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.539
 they are a very original idea for 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.520
 allow us to accumulate gold 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.830
 necessary as I have already said to be able 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.080
 play an arena or buy sachets on 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.759
 our blog or mission log 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.439
 daily can contain at 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:31.110
 maximum 3 with the possibility also of 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:33.899
 discard a single mission a day for 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.060
 make room for a new 20 the ideas there are 

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:37.830
 different from player to player if 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.569
 surely they were all the same 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.310
 we would have witnessed a horde of 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:44.159
 characters and decks all the same not the same 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.569
 normal games like I said this 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:47.460
 is the first free to play of the house 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.919
 blizzard and I must say that after a few months 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.180
 the game is absolutely 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:53.189
 addicted to my experience with this 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.740
 the only title is a positive one 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:57.089
 sin is personally speaking the grave 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.069
 lack of which each card game 

00:06:57.089 --> 00:07:00.689
 online offers the possibility of 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:01.800
 socialize and meet new people 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:04.080
 play it 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.400
 I grew up with card games and 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.710
 thanks to them I have known many 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.690
 people and how many white nights passed 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.220
 to play all together at random in 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.259
 Association 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.120
 of course there is always the possibility of 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:16.560
 meet people from all over the world o 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.960
 better probably than all of Europe 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.620
 playing this title but not the 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.750
 same thing 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.580
 since probably these people don't 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.259
 we will never meet there even to say that 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.970
 thanks to the popularity that this title 

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:29.250
 is buying we will surely assist 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.349
 has a wide variety of offline tournaments 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.389
 and online that will make this game 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:34.800
 very competitive later present
