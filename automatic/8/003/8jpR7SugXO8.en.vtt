00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hi all guys i'm rain e 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.120
 welcome to this new review on 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.120
 age of miners 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.779
 start immediately means that this is a 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.540
 need a commitment so it won't be 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.070
 need to write register or login 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.110
 just entered 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.270
 playing we will find a book in hand 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.730
 where there will be information on 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.170
 server as the regulation le 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.300
 characteristics of the economy and to 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.950
 productions of 20 etc 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.750
 in the feature cards it will come 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.640
 written that serve and characterized 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.190
 just a world from two modes 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.010
 normal survival where we can build 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.440
 participate in events became more pe 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.330
 make and exchange objects and a way 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.030
 creative with the vegetable garden where you can 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.730
 advisor freely from the regulation 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.739
 the green is prohibited after building 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.050
 something in the survivor world will be 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.170
 necessary make a request on the forum 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.880
 to make it protected this is one thing 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.729
 particular enough that it should 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.020
 encouraging gameplay is however 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.039
 make it a little bit different from the others 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.210
 server that the book continues with faq 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.730
 commands ii and all very many 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.110
 very useful information 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.610
 so i think it will take a good one 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.220
 score for presentation like this 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.940
 exiting immediately from the first building yes 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.160
 will find an olivetti board and from here 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.140
 there will be various buildings including the stage 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.290
 to work for the exit to go to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.860
 zone clears the initial shock the shock 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.260
 of sel and other things the sel shop is not 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.880
 other than a shop where I can practically 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.350
 buy iter you can take 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 here you will find the start shop 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.730
 where things can be found 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.070
 free or in any case at a low price 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.040
 will serve for the beginning of ours 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.390
 all the adventure were 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.880
 world through signs 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.040
 just right click to enter 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.100
 the particular thing is that this side 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.080
 are in the users' city 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.600
 now I'm going to see a case remains 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.940
 here in practice this is a city of a 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.440
 user as the book said in fact 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.780
 requesting on the forum 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.230
 It is possible that the constructions made 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.519
 precisely the players come 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.519
 they explain powerful 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.940
 and cannot be broken 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.720
 but there will be the inn that goes well is not 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.390
 another fake bar and here is the exit 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.750
 to go to the area where you can go out 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.750
 freely 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.040
 very well it can be 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.400
 it lasted that apparently we are 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.430
 arrived at hiroshima 2.0 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.909
 Saturday and no city ​​was taken 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.909
 this city 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.650
 They are as beautiful as the most beautiful things series 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.610
 player 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.440
 a miss forgot to mention 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.110
 the ways you can earn 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.340
 the insiders in practice will be able to 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.110
 earn by killing mob kitchens 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.520
 or precisely by making shops 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.960
 personal 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.340
 to which to sell the objects to the documents 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.430
 player 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.790
 let's move on to creative work, i 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.790
 lots 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.930
 I read in the previous review 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.880
 the lots are not other areas 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.880
 creative where he can really so 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.170
 to 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.049
 I read 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.049
 Skin 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.360
 after seeing the server we pass 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.950
 immediately to all then from the point of 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.350
 view of the presentation the serve 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.690
 takes 10 points out of 10 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.450
 because then the spawn is certainly well 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.570
 made and original and above all there is a 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.900
 book that really explains everything is needed 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.620
 the events already the faq there is everything then 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.169
 for this decided to give 10 points from the 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.040
 point of view of playability 10 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.980
 points out of 10 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.080
 together with two because in practice this 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.030
 serve is very balanced and above all 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.669
 it is very pleasant to play since 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.760
 all the sun players are not friendly but 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.040
 we also say there is a spirit of 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.060
 collaboration between all the one who 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.410
 I could see 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.960
 also from the point of view of 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.960
 Server moderation takes 10 points on 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.460
 10 that the chat is really moderate there is 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.350
 there is no minimum of spam 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.780
 I could not control the city 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.460
 because honestly I have not found 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.770
 no more files p 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.509
 but even though there are 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.360
 very few online players probably 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.150
 because the server and premium oils are there 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.280
 there are two ten moderators online 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.349
 player two moderators and it means a lot 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.139
 this is also why chat is always 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:39.199
 very clean from the point of view of 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.120
 creativity and need to take 9.10 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:44.360
 I didn't want to give 10 out of ten cases 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.940
 just because of the fact that despite the 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.910
 creativity is there despite the fact 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.139
 of the cities that are then cremated later 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.389
 request on the forum 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.919
 it is the whole organization of the economy 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.840
 on the server 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.490
 I didn't give 10 points just because I didn't 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.500
 there are special plugins there 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.560
 despite being very organized 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.480
 different than normal servers 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.630
 there is no plug in that has me 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.030
 hit and only for this does not take 10 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.030
 points 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.970
 so in total the servers get 39 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.180
 points out of 40 before closing the video 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.710
 I wanted to tell you something in practice while 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.550
 I was making the video I came to 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.910
 know what server will close today or tomorrow 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:30.860
 since today or tomorrow is before the 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:35.130
 video will be released so today we are at 18 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.780
 I just wanted to tell you that since oh well me 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.810
 sorry that serves closed because a nice 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.490
 server from what I could see 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:45.390
 so I can only link to you 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.160
 the new discussion that I will leave you 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.720
 in description where it can be done 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.850
 request because in practice the server 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.800
 will not close you so they will sign up 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:56.310
 description the link for the discussion 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.760
 where you can be added white list 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.470
 then the link in this one I click though 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.500
 he didn't do it for me in meat though 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:08.350
 this jeff weiner spits out conference 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.750
 board is increasingly mice and oh well 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.250
 he writes a description because but 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.570
 I believe some of you want 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:20.320
 get here to really copy it 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:22.300
 which I hope will close with 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.990
 this white list version may have 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.970
 bahrain is more successful for today 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.570
 I greet you eh to the next review 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.570
 Hello
