did I interpret it wrong or without just
blatantly<00:03:32.760> wrong<00:03:33.000> because<00:03:33.480> by<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.260> looks<00:03:34.349> of

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
blatantly wrong because by the looks of

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.080 
blatantly wrong because by the looks of
it<00:03:34.799> everybody<00:03:35.310> was<00:03:35.459> right<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.849> I<00:03:35.910> was<00:03:35.940> wrong

but I'm thinking that it leave Matt 25
