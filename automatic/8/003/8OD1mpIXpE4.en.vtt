00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.910
 good these events are a new vice 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.910
 no video devil may cry bmc like you 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.380
 like the fans to call it 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.570
 it will truly be from May Cry 5 that the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.740
 history nothing will have to see there are 40 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.820
 minutes of gameplay that you do not have in the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.369
 description if you want to see what 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.410
 well as I say I will explain a little 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.060
 things not for a lot of people just do not 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.159
 they understand 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.159
 this new devil may cry of maccray 5 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:28.050
 worth what happens to him is truly 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.909
 It will not be a Maker to put 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.949
 a way like the previous ones will be 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.649
 totally different in the sense 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.870
 plot and in the sense of characters 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.359
 ok he wanted to give a new look a 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.340
 new touch and it will not be a bounce or a 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.719
 reboot of the sauce nor will it be the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.340
 continuation of none of the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.719
 previous games that's why it's called the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.060
 dmc to dry really micro 5 do not think 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.920
 what 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.750
 that I leave a short period of time I 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.810
 I guess they want to do these do 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.000
 with more with more 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.590
 with more deliveries and the most likely 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.900
 the most for those who want to do it with 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.090
 more deliveries and the company is already 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.040
 peeled in the pax and little else to say no 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.730
 the game is expected to arrive I think that 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.620
 in 2013 if I remember correctly and really 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.750
 the one that gives me characters and what truth 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.640
 who I do not like I do not like at all 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.500
 but really there will have to be 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.480
 wait is now now you have to wait for 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.230
 watch 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.150
 to see what it is that 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.280
 fuck we will have to wait for whom what 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.750
 offers is already without more but really 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.700
 Well let's go and said the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.800
 creators that this happens in a universe 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.750
 alternative or some paranoia if they said 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.460
 and how good that if they justify the change 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.770
 of look in front and nothing else but neither is 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.500
 the child follow in his regard for him as 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.270
 leave the saga open again and again 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.070
 ancient 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.259
 and that it can be done again not to advance 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.539
 a little open that that topic but 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.549
 really I know that they do it to follow 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.219
 with him in front and make more delivery tis 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.289
 ahead and so not have to continue with the 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.119
 old story and do not have to follow 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.520
 no script or any paper and nothing 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.490
 so well do not have any hope of 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.560
 see where to go you believe me 5 officially 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.390
 officially I mean with the story 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.129
 of the above because it's going to be 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.860
 quite difficult not the change of look and 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.660
 it will last a lot longer when you see 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.269
 that sales go up a lot not some 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.280
 people who think that it does not last 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.459
 fans are the ones that really make big 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.079
 it's a saga but really the commercial thing 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.989
 is what makes a great a great saga 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.209
 really and oblique account of what 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.390
 I say no even though the game is bad and such and 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.459
 the change of appearance or appearance of 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.170
 protagonist is going to make a lot of 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.970
 people who are going to buy not especially 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.140
 a generation 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.000
 I hope I want an image of a 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.070
 character does not change the gameplay of the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.770
 game because I see very well I 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.090
 it really is a game that I am seeing 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.190
 very good that should not have been called 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.870
 of the may cry that should have been called 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.300
 otherwise I would not have had 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.120
 the same pull but that 's how to go 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.610
 He has satisfied everyone not so much the fans 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.400
 as a student fan and really is the least 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.170
 do not call me believe something that is not no 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.040
 to put it one way to see it from another 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.260
 way 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.950
 go to a new saga with the same 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.780
 touches and it is more necessary that you do 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.520
 paranoia with those with titles and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.630
 good not gameplay of the game and nothing what 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.430
 extinction have very well want 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.440
 go to see it I see it good or 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.870
 I say it very inferior you can see the video 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.180
 I see it very good I quite like the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.580
 I really do not see it at all bad I like it 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.720
 pretty but good I guess like me 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.340
 now many people who think what 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.830
 it has pretty good looking are 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.110
 pretty pretty good 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:40.590
 and I see it very very fluid everything a few fights 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.020
 very intuitive so for what I 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.900
 seems to see 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.620
 and really everything very dark that leaves 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.350
 pretty enough to think maybe 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.230
 no cool is the character you will not see 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.360
 abundant different then in young people 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.380
 it's like when our favorite series and 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.420
 how the change say that of 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.080
 our protagonist not bent and 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.830
 We decided in the original version and here it is 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.830
 in the next video
