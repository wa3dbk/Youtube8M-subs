 hi girls and hi guys finally 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.070
 video of my golden lip balm 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.289
 here it is how long and I've been there 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.910
 said this thing about this low sprint 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.680
 and how long it took for 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.680
 realize this was enough for lips because 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.960
 in fact I wanted to make a recipe 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.489
 easy so you could all do it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.850
 especially with few ingredients 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.250
 available housewives ok though ne 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.739
 works if not the ciofega recipe that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.690
 maybe you don't need a pipe or a 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.940
 bassano lips that goes straight away in short 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.100
 no I wanted to do something well done e 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.260
 so i experienced experimented e 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.539
 experienced and eventually I came to 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 this recipe that I like mistrÃ  likes 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.020
 so I'm too happy 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.289
 I really hope you hunt that to you 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.969
 obviously what I tell you to do e 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.840
 he had there so much because besides 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.060
 be very hot and repair me 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.700
 lips obviously especially in winter 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.240
 I have to put it a few times because of me 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.950
 it remains enough on the lips and is enough 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.810
 few applications because the lips are 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.909
 maintain if it would have the soft and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.890
 hydrate so for example I put it 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.479
 always first to go out then also led to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 published but I put more and more to go out is 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.610
 the night before from a dorm is really 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.920
 I am really beautifully I 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.570
 made tea the rhyme and now I leave you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.090
 immediately to the video 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.009
 I recommend you do it and let me know then 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.659
 find it is very simple you can do it 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.640
 all inexpensive 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.250
 you know to buy any bassano 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.710
 in commerce but also in pharmacies all 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.049
 these things that cost a lot and not 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.299
 I am never like this that contains everyone 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.990
 hawking ingredients is too much too 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.119
 cute has a beautiful texture i 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.899
 I also love lipstick 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.790
 insanely really nice too shiny 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.729
 even the lips a little bit 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.740
 consistency and fabulous because it is creamy 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.930
 show finger contact and make-up 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.930
 even her lipstick is repeating to you 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.150
 very well 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.640
 obviously in the summer it will be a little bit 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.590
 a little bit softer and indeed it will be a 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.010
 a little bit harder then more 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.319
 dense and enough I hope a lot of data 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.019

 tutorial 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.930
 Hello

 here we are, this is the recipe 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.090
 really really simple 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.250
 you can do all you have no excuses 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.560
 and then let's see the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.810
 first main ingredient is butter 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.330
 of loads you know that I love madly 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.280
 shea butter and not just for the 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.500
 lips really everywhere for the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.780
 cook for as a nutritious ingredient 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.540
 soothing regenerating on the lips 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.430
 I also love what it is anyway 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.040
 the main ingredient of this 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.430
 lip balm that we're going to put one 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.800
 small bowl then we join the second honey 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.350
 basic apple simple ingredient 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.040
 kitchen very very simple because 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.660
 also honey and repairer e 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.430
 regenerating and soothing then goes 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.280
 great for your lips if you have any 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.830
 cracking of the cracks and very good 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.170
 really very very moisturizing then 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.330
 I also put honey inside the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.000
 shea butter this lip balm 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.490
 what we are doing is a lip balm 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.350
 which is excellent not only for the lips but 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.510
 also for nails this put 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.209
 forget to tell you in the intro is 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.400
 just thought by me for the lips and 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.989
 for the nails just to feed the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.989
 nails to soften the cuticles 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.030
 so you will also see useful ingredients 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.489
 for nail care so do two 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.440
 things in one that is always better then 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.050
 melt in a double boiler net seen butter 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.209
 very little is needed for shea and honey 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.640
 seconds because shea butter is 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.370
 it just needs to soften otherwise it goes 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.050
 to finish that deteriorates very little 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.970
 just the time that softens then 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.169
 turn off continue to stir see 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.150
 that melts 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.450
 at this point add the vitamin e 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.300
 8 co however, what an excellent soothing 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.330
 really moisturizing anti-aging repairer 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.610
 essential for chapped lips 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.680
 excellent and a bit of argan oil or 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.560
 another vegetable at your leisure 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.669
 for all doubtful substitutions and so on 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.510
 I always remind you to look at the blog 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.490
 www.kalicanthus.com end I added 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.800
 such of sweet orange that is excellent for 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.110
 excellent lemon lips also for nails 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.670
 because it is nourished and then reinforced 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.250
 both have a great taste and 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.460
 beautiful perfume and the important thing 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.090
 and stir stir always up to 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.620
 complete concentration even if maybe 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.990
 bring something else with you 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.210
 important mix up will become 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.710
 very very dense so fill the 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.350
 your containers recommend me 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.690
 glass containers but also already rhymes 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.820
 little ones if you want to give them as gifts 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.100
 well always and need not 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.620
 preserving this here and it is preserved 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.630
 so much really so you don't have 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.850
 reason to worry or good idea 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.120
