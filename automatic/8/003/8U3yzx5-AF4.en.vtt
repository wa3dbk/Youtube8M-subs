a little bit of black ops 2 and i'm
actually<00:00:17.470> recording<00:00:18.010> this<00:00:18.100> with<00:00:18.250> my<00:00:18.340> cell

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
actually recording this with my cell

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.560 
actually recording this with my cell
phone<00:00:18.610> i<00:00:18.789> think<00:00:19.000> it's<00:00:19.090> some<00:00:19.240> pretty<00:00:19.360> good

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
phone i think it's some pretty good

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.540 
phone i think it's some pretty good
quality<00:00:20.050> actually<00:00:20.560> you<00:00:20.980> guys<00:00:21.130> would<00:00:21.279> probably

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
quality actually you guys would probably

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.189 
quality actually you guys would probably
see<00:00:21.670> about<00:00:21.849> half<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.240> screen<00:00:22.449> at<00:00:22.660> most<00:00:22.839> points

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
see about half the screen at most points

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.929 
see about half the screen at most points
which<00:00:23.349> is<00:00:23.470> pretty<00:00:23.619> good<00:00:23.740> not<00:00:24.070> definitely<00:00:24.789> not

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
which is pretty good not definitely not

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.150 
which is pretty good not definitely not
the<00:00:25.060> worst<00:00:25.269> quality<00:00:25.689> ever<00:00:25.869> and<00:00:26.289> i<00:00:26.679> think<00:00:27.070> it's

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
the worst quality ever and i think it's

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.499 
the worst quality ever and i think it's
uh<00:00:27.310> i<00:00:27.519> think<00:00:27.609> it's<00:00:27.789> a<00:00:27.820> pretty<00:00:27.939> good<00:00:28.119> gameplay<00:00:28.480> i

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
uh i think it's a pretty good gameplay i

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.569 
uh i think it's a pretty good gameplay i
think<00:00:28.720> i<00:00:28.929> get<00:00:29.320> about<00:00:29.410> zero<00:00:29.800> kills<00:00:30.099> maybe<00:00:30.339> one

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:30.579 
think i get about zero kills maybe one

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.790 
think i get about zero kills maybe one
or<00:00:30.699> two<00:00:30.730> kills<00:00:31.089> not<00:00:31.300> really<00:00:31.599> sure<00:00:31.810> but<00:00:32.110> it<00:00:32.710> is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
or two kills not really sure but it is

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.380 
or two kills not really sure but it is
in<00:00:33.130> his<00:00:33.280> decent<00:00:33.670> quality<00:00:33.820> this<00:00:34.030> is<00:00:34.090> probably

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
in his decent quality this is probably

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.880 
in his decent quality this is probably
what<00:00:34.570> i'll<00:00:34.630> be<00:00:34.720> using<00:00:34.900> to<00:00:35.079> record<00:00:35.230> most<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.800> my

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
what i'll be using to record most of my

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.830

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.050 
just didn't really seem like something
that<00:02:54.049> but<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:54.920> would<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.370> know<00:02:55.400> enjoy<00:02:55.760> using

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
that but I would you know enjoy using

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.759 
that but I would you know enjoy using
and<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.599> think<00:02:56.780> there's<00:02:56.930> box<00:02:57.170> control<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.620> just

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
and I think there's box control is just

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.740 
and I think there's box control is just
a<00:02:57.799> little<00:02:58.010> bit<00:02:58.099> more<00:02:58.250> comfortable<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:59.480> ps4

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
a little bit more comfortable the ps4

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.270 
a little bit more comfortable the ps4
controller<00:03:00.349> looks<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.680> little<00:03:00.799> bit<00:03:00.950> different

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
controller looks a little bit different

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.920 
controller looks a little bit different
than<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.549> ps3<00:03:02.030> controller<00:03:02.359> but<00:03:02.569> I<00:03:02.720> still

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
than the ps3 controller but I still

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.050 
than the ps3 controller but I still
think<00:03:03.139> it's<00:03:03.260> got<00:03:03.409> this<00:03:04.099> about<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.639> same<00:03:04.790> size

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
think it's got this about the same size

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.180 
think it's got this about the same size
and<00:03:05.389> kind<00:03:05.599> of<00:03:05.750> looks<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.109> same<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.349> I<00:03:06.769> mean<00:03:07.129> I

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
and kind of looks the same so I mean I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.920 
and kind of looks the same so I mean I
really<00:03:07.310> i<00:03:07.700> just<00:03:07.730> really<00:03:08.090> like<00:03:08.389> the<00:03:08.569> xbox

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
really i just really like the xbox

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.910 
really i just really like the xbox
better<00:03:09.139> i<00:03:09.200> really<00:03:09.440> don't<00:03:09.560> have<00:03:09.650> too<00:03:09.829> much

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
better i really don't have too much

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.860 
better i really don't have too much
reasoning<00:03:10.370> for<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:10.639> a<00:03:10.700> lot<00:03:10.849> of<00:03:10.940> people<00:03:11.150> kind<00:03:11.810> of

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
reasoning for it a lot of people kind of

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.250 
reasoning for it a lot of people kind of
feel<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.139> same<00:03:12.319> way<00:03:12.500> about<00:03:12.620> me<00:03:12.950> about<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.579> but

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
feel the same way about me about it but

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.970 
feel the same way about me about it but
probably<00:03:15.260> not<00:03:15.409> going<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.590> be<00:03:15.680> getting<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:15.920> on

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
probably not going to be getting it on

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.289 
probably not going to be getting it on
release<00:03:16.220> date<00:03:16.400> i'm<00:03:16.489> actually<00:03:16.609> definitely<00:03:17.180> not

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
release date i'm actually definitely not

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.250 
release date i'm actually definitely not
going<00:03:17.389> to<00:03:17.450> be<00:03:17.510> getting<00:03:17.599> it<00:03:17.810> on<00:03:17.900> release<00:03:18.109> date

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
going to be getting it on release date

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.690 
going to be getting it on release date
just<00:03:18.470> because<00:03:18.500> i<00:03:18.829> don't<00:03:19.159> really<00:03:19.250> see<00:03:19.370> too<00:03:19.609> much

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
just because i don't really see too much

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.610 
just because i don't really see too much
of<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.909> point<00:03:20.150> in<00:03:20.389> getting<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.780> when<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.590> comes

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
of a point in getting it when it comes

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.229 
of a point in getting it when it comes
out<00:03:21.919> because<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.370> mean<00:03:22.699> all<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:22.940> games<00:03:23.150> that

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
out because I mean all the games that

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.610 
out because I mean all the games that
are<00:03:23.389> coming<00:03:23.690> out<00:03:23.750> within<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.049> next<00:03:24.139> month<00:03:24.319> or

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
are coming out within the next month or

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.979 
are coming out within the next month or
so<00:03:24.680> will<00:03:25.519> be<00:03:25.549> coming<00:03:25.819> out<00:03:26.000> for<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.180> xbox<00:03:26.540> 360

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
so will be coming out for the xbox 360

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:27.879 
so will be coming out for the xbox 360
that's<00:03:27.199> probably<00:03:27.470> what<00:03:27.590> I'm<00:03:27.680> gonna<00:03:27.769> be

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
that's probably what I'm gonna be

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.979 
that's probably what I'm gonna be
getting<00:03:27.980> them<00:03:28.220> for<00:03:28.370> anyways<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.959> just

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
getting them for anyways and I just

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.240 
getting them for anyways and I just
really<00:03:30.319> don't<00:03:30.410> see<00:03:30.590> too<00:03:30.709> much<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:30.859> a<00:03:30.980> point<00:03:31.129> of

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
really don't see too much of a point of

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.009 
really don't see too much of a point of
getting<00:03:31.459> it<00:03:31.699> on<00:03:31.849> the<00:03:31.970> release<00:03:32.269> date<00:03:32.510> because

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
getting it on the release date because

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.509 
getting it on the release date because
there's<00:03:33.349> not<00:03:33.470> really<00:03:33.650> much<00:03:33.859> more<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.370> it

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
there's not really much more that it

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.009 
there's not really much more that it
brings<00:03:34.699> to<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.030> table<00:03:35.209> than<00:03:35.419> the<00:03:35.599> xbox

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
brings to the table than the xbox

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.110 
brings to the table than the xbox
there's<00:03:36.620> really<00:03:36.799> not<00:03:37.370> not<00:03:37.699> too<00:03:37.819> much<00:03:37.940> more

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
there's really not not too much more

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.490 
there's really not not too much more
features<00:03:38.510> in<00:03:38.629> my<00:03:38.720> opinion<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.139> course<00:03:39.199> is

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
features in my opinion of course is

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.659 
features in my opinion of course is
improved<00:03:39.769> graphics<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.340> things<00:03:40.370> like<00:03:40.609> that

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
improved graphics and things like that

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.819 
improved graphics and things like that
but<00:03:40.849> I<00:03:41.239> mean<00:03:41.629> I<00:03:41.660> really<00:03:41.959> I<00:03:42.230> really<00:03:42.349> can<00:03:42.650> wait

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
but I mean I really I really can wait

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.379 
but I mean I really I really can wait
for<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.129> obviously<00:03:43.549> I'm<00:03:43.849> not<00:03:43.879> going<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.209> you

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
for that obviously I'm not going to you

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.420 
for that obviously I'm not going to you
know<00:03:44.480> spend<00:03:44.540> all<00:03:45.079> my<00:03:45.290> money<00:03:45.319> just<00:03:46.190> trying<00:03:46.370> to

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
know spend all my money just trying to

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.770 
know spend all my money just trying to
get<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.609> xbox<00:03:46.790> one<00:03:47.090> on<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.299> release<00:03:47.510> date

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
get the xbox one on the release date

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.539 
get the xbox one on the release date
because<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.319> is<00:03:48.530> five<00:03:48.739> hundred<00:03:49.069> dollars<00:03:49.370> which

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
because it is five hundred dollars which

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.339 
because it is five hundred dollars which
is<00:03:49.579> definitely<00:03:49.849> a<00:03:50.120> huge<00:03:50.510> downside<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.260> the

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
is definitely a huge downside to the

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.439 
is definitely a huge downside to the
Xbox<00:03:51.709> one<00:03:51.949> I<00:03:52.129> was<00:03:52.459> really<00:03:52.609> hoping<00:03:52.730> Microsoft

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
Xbox one I was really hoping Microsoft

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.470 
Xbox one I was really hoping Microsoft
was<00:03:53.870> going<00:03:54.079> to<00:03:54.169> announce<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.620> uh<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:55.760> xbox<00:03:56.239> one

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
was going to announce in uh a xbox one

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.629 
was going to announce in uh a xbox one
unbundled<00:03:57.290> with<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.739> with<00:03:58.129> the<00:03:58.160> Kinect<00:03:58.459> so<00:03:58.579> it

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
unbundled with the with the Kinect so it

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.729 
unbundled with the with the Kinect so it
would<00:03:58.730> be<00:03:58.819> four<00:03:59.090> hundred<00:03:59.180> dollar<00:03:59.739> console

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
would be four hundred dollar console

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.379 
would be four hundred dollar console
without<00:04:00.919> connect<00:04:01.519> because<00:04:01.639> I<00:04:01.909> really<00:04:02.150> don't

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
without connect because I really don't

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.670 
without connect because I really don't
like<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.659> connect<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:03.019> don't<00:04:03.169> really<00:04:03.290> see<00:04:03.409> too

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
like to connect I don't really see too

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.050 
like to connect I don't really see too
much<00:04:03.769> of<00:04:03.829> a<00:04:04.010> point<00:04:04.190> in<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.430> they're<00:04:04.819> really

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
much of a point in it they're really

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.309 
much of a point in it they're really
trying<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.299> make<00:04:05.449> the<00:04:05.569> connect<00:04:05.840> to<00:04:06.019> be<00:04:06.139> some

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
trying to make the connect to be some

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.379 
trying to make the connect to be some
awesome<00:04:06.680> feature<00:04:06.919> for<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.280> xbox<00:04:07.579> one<00:04:07.760> but<00:04:07.970> my

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
awesome feature for the xbox one but my

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.670 
awesome feature for the xbox one but my
opinion<00:04:08.599> is<00:04:08.780> just<00:04:08.930> kind<00:04:09.109> of<00:04:09.139> useless<00:04:09.440> that

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
opinion is just kind of useless that

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.710 
opinion is just kind of useless that

a<00:04:22.880> few<00:04:23.090> months<00:04:23.300> after<00:04:23.449> its<00:04:23.750> release<00:04:23.900> just

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
a few months after its release just

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.810 
a few months after its release just
because<00:04:24.470> it<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.740> expensive<00:04:24.889> and<00:04:25.490> again<00:04:25.789> i

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820
