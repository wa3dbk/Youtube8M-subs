gone I'm going to do one of the old
version<00:01:37.650> ones<00:01:38.750> see<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.869> looks<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.290> bit

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
version ones see this looks a little bit

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.969

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.010 
or something of that sort and you'll see
across<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.560> top<00:01:50.509> 2.09<00:01:52.429> so<00:01:53.429> check<00:01:53.729> these<00:01:53.910> ones

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020
