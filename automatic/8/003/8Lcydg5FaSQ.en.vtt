doesn't look harsh as well so I ended up
using<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.789> Marc<00:04:58.030> Jacobs<00:04:58.449> gel<00:04:58.990> black<00:04:59.410> liner

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
using the Marc Jacobs gel black liner

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.310 
using the Marc Jacobs gel black liner
and<00:05:00.190> I<00:05:00.639> just<00:05:00.820> use<00:05:00.970> this<00:05:01.090> into<00:05:01.449> the<00:05:01.599> inner<00:05:01.900> rim

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
and I just use this into the inner rim

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.409 
and I just use this into the inner rim
of<00:05:02.440> my<00:05:02.530> eyes<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.160> also<00:05:03.490> right<00:05:03.759> underneath<00:05:04.150> my

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
of my eyes and also right underneath my

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.230 
of my eyes and also right underneath my
lashline<00:05:04.690> ones<00:05:05.190> my<00:05:06.190> lashes<00:05:06.460> are<00:05:06.789> obviously

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
lashline ones my lashes are obviously

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.659 
lashline ones my lashes are obviously
and<00:05:07.539> then<00:05:08.139> I<00:05:08.349> smoked<00:05:08.949> it<00:05:09.099> out<00:05:09.190> a<00:05:09.220> little<00:05:09.490> bit

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
and then I smoked it out a little bit

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.089 
and then I smoked it out a little bit
underneath<00:05:10.180> as<00:05:10.570> well<00:05:10.630> so<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:11.650> made<00:05:11.919> this<00:05:12.039> a

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
underneath as well so I made this a

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.339 
underneath as well so I made this a
little<00:05:12.340> bit<00:05:12.550> thicker<00:05:12.909> and<00:05:13.270> then<00:05:13.900> I<00:05:13.930> ended<00:05:14.229> up

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
little bit thicker and then I ended up

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.740 
little bit thicker and then I ended up
going<00:05:14.590> back<00:05:15.039> with<00:05:15.580> shameless<00:05:16.240> from

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
going back with shameless from

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.080 
going back with shameless from
colour-pop<00:05:17.080> as<00:05:17.470> well<00:05:17.830> and<00:05:18.190> I<00:05:18.370> just<00:05:18.580> pop<00:05:18.849> this

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
colour-pop as well and I just pop this

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.960 
colour-pop as well and I just pop this
right<00:05:19.330> on<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.710> eyeliner<00:05:21.190> so<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.639> gives<00:05:21.760> it

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
right on the eyeliner so it gives it

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.820 
right on the eyeliner so it gives it
more<00:05:22.150> of<00:05:22.210> that<00:05:22.389> green<00:05:22.599> pop<00:05:22.900> but<00:05:23.169> it<00:05:23.260> also<00:05:23.440> keeps

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
more of that green pop but it also keeps

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.620 
more of that green pop but it also keeps
an<00:05:23.979> eye<00:05:24.159> liner<00:05:24.370> in<00:05:24.550> place<00:05:24.580> so<00:05:24.970> it<00:05:25.090> doesn't<00:05:25.120> move

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
an eye liner in place so it doesn't move

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.720 
an eye liner in place so it doesn't move
and<00:05:25.900> smudge<00:05:26.260> as<00:05:26.560> well

lipstick<00:07:02.970> and<00:07:03.150> the<00:07:03.210> color<00:07:03.539> nude<00:07:04.020> and<00:07:04.349> I<00:07:04.410> just

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
lipstick and the color nude and I just

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.930 
lipstick and the color nude and I just
pushed<00:07:04.800> that<00:07:04.860> all<00:07:05.130> over<00:07:05.280> my<00:07:05.490> lips<00:07:05.699> I

pushed that all over my lips I

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.879 
pushed that all over my lips I
personally<00:07:06.569> really<00:07:06.840> didn't<00:07:07.229> like<00:07:07.380> the<00:07:07.740> color

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:07.889

personally really didn't like the color
too<00:07:08.160> much<00:07:08.310> I<00:07:08.430> thought<00:07:08.580> it<00:07:08.669> was<00:07:08.729> a<00:07:08.789> little<00:07:08.849> bit

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
too much I thought it was a little bit

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.370 
too much I thought it was a little bit
too<00:07:09.210> broad<00:07:09.419> for<00:07:09.449> me<00:07:09.660> so<00:07:09.870> I<00:07:09.930> ended<00:07:10.139> up<00:07:10.199> using

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
too broad for me so I ended up using
