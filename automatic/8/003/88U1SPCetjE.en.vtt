00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
got better quality equipment so I

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.450 
got better quality equipment so I
figured<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.429> would<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.740> we<00:00:13.740> upload<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.190> with

series for beginners I'm going to drone

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.920 
series for beginners I'm going to drone
a<00:00:23.279> bit<00:00:23.519> about<00:00:23.789> some<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> basics<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.810> I'm

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
a bit about some of the basics and I'm

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.390 
a bit about some of the basics and I'm
going<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> answer<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.439> question<00:00:25.769> I'm<00:00:26.070> getting<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
going to answer a question I'm getting a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.759 
going to answer a question I'm getting a
lot<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.880> my<00:00:26.970> video<00:00:27.210> comments<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.199> anybody<00:00:28.470> who

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
lot in my video comments so anybody who

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.589 
lot in my video comments so anybody who
knows<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> tablet<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.910> who<00:00:30.179> knows<00:00:30.359> what

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
knows what a tablet is who knows what

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.600 
knows what a tablet is who knows what
the<00:00:30.720> GIMP<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.710> skip<00:00:31.920> ahead<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.369> when<00:00:32.489> you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the GIMP is just skip ahead to when you

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.360 
the GIMP is just skip ahead to when you
see<00:00:32.790> me<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.090> through<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> layers<00:00:33.660> here

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
see me going through the layers here

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.500 
see me going through the layers here
because<00:00:35.370> that's<00:00:35.520> ultimately<00:00:35.670> what<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.180> going

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
because that's ultimately what I'm going

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.360 
because that's ultimately what I'm going
to<00:00:36.540> demonstrate<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.260> how<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.620> use<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.070> GIMP<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
to demonstrate is how I use the GIMP to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.450 
to demonstrate is how I use the GIMP to
compose<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:39.629> complete<00:00:40.460> character

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
compose a complete character

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.600 
compose a complete character
illustration<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:43.219> I'm<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> talk

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
illustration so I'm just going to talk

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.880 
illustration so I'm just going to talk
about<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> GIMP<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.300> second<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.230> photo

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
about the GIMP for a second it's photo

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.430 
about the GIMP for a second it's photo
manipulation<00:00:47.370> freeware<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.719> comparable<00:00:49.320> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
manipulation freeware it's comparable to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.400 
manipulation freeware it's comparable to
Adobe<00:00:50.039> Photoshop<00:00:50.610> only<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.600> far<00:00:51.989> simpler

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
Adobe Photoshop only it's far simpler

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.069 
Adobe Photoshop only it's far simpler
and<00:00:52.739> honestly<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> very<00:00:53.969> powerful<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.899> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and honestly it is very powerful if you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
and honestly it is very powerful if you
master<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.710> may<00:00:55.860> never<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.640> need<00:00:56.910> to

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
master it you may never want or need to

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.080 
master it you may never want or need to
go<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.660> more<00:00:57.960> expensive<00:00:58.379> program<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.670> you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
go to a more expensive program so you

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.349 
go to a more expensive program so you
can<00:01:00.239> learn<00:01:00.449> more<00:01:01.410> about<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.829> GIMP<00:01:02.359> by

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
can learn more about the GIMP by

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.789 
can learn more about the GIMP by
following<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.110> link<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.439> gonna<00:01:04.559> put<00:01:04.710> in

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
following just a link I'm gonna put in

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.469 
following just a link I'm gonna put in
the<00:01:04.860> video<00:01:05.070> description<00:01:05.280> cuz<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.210> don't<00:01:06.360> want

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
is how do you get those pencil like

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.440 
is how do you get those pencil like
lines<00:01:14.760> or<00:01:15.150> about<00:01:15.990> issues<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.830> drawing

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
lines or about issues with drawing

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.670 
lines or about issues with drawing
related<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:19.070> using<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.250> mouse<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.500> let<00:01:22.500> me<00:01:22.560> just

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
related to using a mouse so let me just

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.020 
related to using a mouse so let me just
make<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> perfectly<00:01:23.250> clear<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.610> when

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
make it perfectly clear that when

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
make it perfectly clear that when
drawing<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> mouse<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.229> impossible<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
drawing with a mouse it is impossible to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.149 
drawing with a mouse it is impossible to
enable<00:01:27.030> pressure<00:01:27.299> sensitivity<00:01:28.159> pressure

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
enable pressure sensitivity pressure

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.450 
enable pressure sensitivity pressure
sensitivity<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.180> what<00:01:30.869> people<00:01:31.140> are<00:01:31.460> talking

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
sensitivity is what people are talking

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.899 
sensitivity is what people are talking
about<00:01:32.729> when<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:33.750> say<00:01:34.159> you<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.250> pencil<00:01:35.700> like

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
about when they say you know pencil like

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.170 
about when they say you know pencil like
lines<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:37.320> thickness<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> line<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
lines the thickness of the line and the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
lines the thickness of the line and the
opacity<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.140> clearness<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> line<00:01:41.220> will

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
opacity or clearness of the line will

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.969 
opacity or clearness of the line will
change<00:01:41.909> based<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> pressure<00:01:43.380> you're

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
change based on the pressure you're

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.280 
change based on the pressure you're
using<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.490> draw<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.630> look<00:01:45.810> firm<00:01:46.140> or

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
using to draw and it will look firm or

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.639 
using to draw and it will look firm or
organic<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.920> dynamic<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:48.020> yeah<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> couldn't

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
organic and dynamic and yeah I couldn't

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.280 
organic and dynamic and yeah I couldn't
possibly<00:01:49.829> live<00:01:50.820> without<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.299> personally<00:01:52.110> so

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
possibly live without it personally so

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.990 
possibly live without it personally so
umm<00:01:53.130> yeah<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:55.380> beyond<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.369> using<00:01:56.939> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
umm yeah and beyond that it's using a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.929 
umm yeah and beyond that it's using a
mouse<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.360> very<00:01:57.570> difficult<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.079> draw<00:01:58.939> some

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
mouse is very difficult to draw some

might<00:02:39.590> not<00:02:39.800> be<00:02:39.920> working<00:02:40.099> if<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.550> have<00:02:40.730> a

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
might not be working if you have a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.210 
might not be working if you have a
tablet<00:02:41.060> where<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.599> get<00:02:41.690> your<00:02:41.810> drivers<00:02:42.349> to<00:02:43.040> make

tablet where to get your drivers to make

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.940 
tablet where to get your drivers to make
sure<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.580> works<00:02:43.849> because<00:02:44.420> new<00:02:45.260> tablet<00:02:45.680> owners

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
sure it works because new tablet owners

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.120 
sure it works because new tablet owners
they<00:02:46.280> usually<00:02:46.610> fall<00:02:46.940> into<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:47.380> they<00:02:48.380> buy<00:02:49.069> it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
they usually fall into this they buy it

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.170 
they usually fall into this they buy it
they<00:02:49.250> think<00:02:49.430> it's<00:02:49.610> just<00:02:49.640> gonna<00:02:49.850> work<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.120> they

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
they think it's just gonna work and they

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.789 
they think it's just gonna work and they
plug<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.900> they<00:02:51.230> don't<00:02:51.319> realize<00:02:51.650> they

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
plug it in and they don't realize they

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.449 
plug it in and they don't realize they
have<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:51.950> go<00:02:52.100> get<00:02:52.220> software<00:02:52.700> off<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.360> UM<00:02:54.459> the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
have to go get software off the UM the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.820 
have to go get software off the UM the
company<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.090> makes<00:02:56.390> their<00:02:56.630> tablets<00:02:57.110> website

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
gonna get into the layers now talk about

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.589 
gonna get into the layers now talk about
one<00:03:13.130> of<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.310> coolest<00:03:13.730> things<00:03:13.970> in<00:03:14.209> my<00:03:14.330> opinion

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
one of the coolest things in my opinion

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.039 
one of the coolest things in my opinion
about<00:03:15.380> illustrating<00:03:16.359> so<00:03:17.359> I<00:03:17.390> used<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.870> have<00:03:18.019> a

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
about illustrating so I used to have a

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.479 
about illustrating so I used to have a
sketch<00:03:18.680> as<00:03:18.950> my<00:03:19.700> background<00:03:20.510> but<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.560> erased<00:03:22.280> it

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
sketch as my background but I erased it

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.789 
sketch as my background but I erased it
instead<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.209> adding<00:03:23.390> in<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.690> new<00:03:23.870> layer<00:03:24.170> that

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
instead of adding in a new layer that

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.620 
instead of adding in a new layer that
would<00:03:25.010> hide<00:03:25.310> my<00:03:25.340> original<00:03:26.060> sketch<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.420> just

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
would hide my original sketch I just

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.800 
would hide my original sketch I just
erased<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.109> I<00:03:27.350> kind<00:03:28.130> of<00:03:28.160> wish<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.370> hadn't<00:03:28.670> now

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
erased it I kind of wish I hadn't now

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.199 
erased it I kind of wish I hadn't now
because<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:30.220> would<00:03:31.220> have<00:03:31.310> been<00:03:31.489> helpful<00:03:31.730> for<00:03:31.880> my

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
because I would have been helpful for my

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.900 
because I would have been helpful for my
demonstration<00:03:32.959> here<00:03:33.140> but<00:03:33.859> I<00:03:34.190> used<00:03:34.609> to<00:03:34.700> have<00:03:34.880> a

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
demonstration here but I used to have a

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.500 
demonstration here but I used to have a
base<00:03:35.209> sketch<00:03:35.510> on<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.260> background<00:03:36.739> layer<00:03:37.160> and

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
base sketch on this background layer and

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.780 
base sketch on this background layer and
then<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.540> would<00:03:38.870> draw<00:03:40.420> draw<00:03:41.420> lines<00:03:41.660> on<00:03:41.870> top<00:03:42.790> and

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
then I would draw draw lines on top and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.080 
then I would draw draw lines on top and
sometimes<00:03:44.359> instead<00:03:45.319> of<00:03:45.440> doing<00:03:45.709> lines<00:03:46.090> if

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
sometimes instead of doing lines if

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.349 
sometimes instead of doing lines if
you've<00:03:47.329> got<00:03:47.540> a<00:03:47.569> detailed<00:03:48.079> sketch<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:48.739> recommend

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
you've got a detailed sketch I recommend

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.090 
you've got a detailed sketch I recommend
doing<00:03:50.359> a<00:03:50.569> shadow<00:03:50.810> layer<00:03:51.079> next<00:03:51.380> only<00:03:51.829> if<00:03:51.950> you've

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
doing a shadow layer next only if you've

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.900 
doing a shadow layer next only if you've
got<00:03:52.280> a<00:03:52.310> very<00:03:52.609> detailed<00:03:52.910> sketch<00:03:53.739> because<00:03:54.910> it's

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
got a very detailed sketch because it's

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.430 
got a very detailed sketch because it's
gonna<00:03:56.030> be<00:03:56.239> really<00:03:56.389> hard<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.930> do<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:57.079> shadow

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
gonna be really hard to do a shadow

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.800 
gonna be really hard to do a shadow
layer<00:03:57.739> if<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.269> don't<00:03:59.269> really<00:03:59.389> have<00:03:59.569> a<00:03:59.600> good

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
layer if you don't really have a good

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.629 
layer if you don't really have a good
guideline<00:04:00.109> now<00:04:00.410> see<00:04:00.560> these<00:04:00.829> shadows<00:04:01.040> are<00:04:01.310> very

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
guideline now see these shadows are very

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.330 
guideline now see these shadows are very
rough<00:04:01.940> that's<00:04:02.540> because<00:04:02.930> I<00:04:03.200> did<00:04:03.739> my<00:04:03.889> line<00:04:04.130> art

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
rough that's because I did my line art

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.440 
rough that's because I did my line art
first<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:05.560> doing<00:04:06.560> your<00:04:06.739> line<00:04:06.920> art<00:04:07.100> first

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
first and doing your line art first

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.660 
first and doing your line art first
usually<00:04:08.450> compels<00:04:09.049> an<00:04:09.230> artist<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.769> make<00:04:09.799> much

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
usually compels an artist to make much

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.390 
usually compels an artist to make much
heavier<00:04:11.180> lines<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:12.049> that's<00:04:12.230> okay<00:04:12.650> in<00:04:12.920> this<00:04:13.040> in

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
heavier lines and that's okay in this in

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.430 
heavier lines and that's okay in this in
this<00:04:13.549> particular<00:04:14.030> picture<00:04:14.180> but<00:04:14.569> with<00:04:15.260> each

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
this particular picture but with each

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.310 
this particular picture but with each
composition<00:04:16.090> it's<00:04:17.090> good<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.510> consider<00:04:17.959> how

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
composition it's good to consider how

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.650 
composition it's good to consider how
heavy<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.859> want<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.100> be<00:04:19.220> on<00:04:19.400> your<00:04:19.519> line<00:04:19.760> art<00:04:19.940> so

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
heavy you want to be on your line art so

go on and seek out more knowledge so so

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.170 
go on and seek out more knowledge so so
let's<00:04:40.440> see<00:04:40.530> I<00:04:40.590> do<00:04:40.770> my<00:04:40.979> line<00:04:41.190> art<00:04:41.400> layer<00:04:41.460> usually

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
let's see I do my line art layer usually

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.879 
let's see I do my line art layer usually
before<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:43.139> do<00:04:43.199> my<00:04:43.409> shadow<00:04:43.650> layer<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:45.889> then

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
before I do my shadow layer and then

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.360 
before I do my shadow layer and then
you've<00:04:47.819> got<00:04:48.000> color<00:04:48.360> layers<00:04:48.599> as<00:04:48.900> well<00:04:49.250> just<00:04:50.250> the

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
you've got color layers as well just the

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.700 
you've got color layers as well just the
blue<00:04:50.550> color<00:04:50.849> layer<00:04:51.110> in<00:04:52.110> this<00:04:52.259> case<00:04:52.500> I'm

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
blue color layer in this case I'm

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.140 
blue color layer in this case I'm
details<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.990> then<00:04:55.520> clothing<00:04:56.520> and

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
details and then clothing and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.629 
details and then clothing and
accessories<00:04:57.690> so<00:04:58.560> there<00:04:59.159> he<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.639> in<00:04:59.849> flat<00:05:00.180> color

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
accessories so there he is in flat color

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.200 
accessories so there he is in flat color
and<00:05:02.960> now<00:05:03.960> when<00:05:04.590> you're<00:05:04.710> doing<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:05.460> shadow

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
and now when you're doing the shadow

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.969 
and now when you're doing the shadow
layer<00:05:06.419> another<00:05:06.750> thing<00:05:06.990> if<00:05:07.289> you<00:05:07.409> want<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.740> just

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
layer another thing if you want to just

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.709 
layer another thing if you want to just
rush<00:05:08.550> ahead<00:05:08.879> and<00:05:09.060> do<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.780> color<00:05:10.020> layer<00:05:11.719> don't

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
rush ahead and do the color layer don't

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.899 
rush ahead and do the color layer don't
have<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.199> visible<00:05:13.740> when<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:14.699> do<00:05:14.849> the<00:05:14.969> shadows

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
have it visible when you do the shadows

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.439 
have it visible when you do the shadows
because<00:05:17.990> getting<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.319> values<00:05:20.180> knowing<00:05:21.180> how

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
because getting the values knowing how

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.820 
because getting the values knowing how
dark<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:21.990> make<00:05:22.169> a<00:05:22.199> shadow<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:23.400> can<00:05:23.550> be<00:05:23.669> really

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
dark to make a shadow it can be really

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.070 
dark to make a shadow it can be really
it<00:05:25.830> can<00:05:25.949> be<00:05:26.069> really<00:05:26.310> hard<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.580> or<00:05:27.090> it<00:05:27.240> can<00:05:28.020> be

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
it can be really hard to or it can be

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.490 
it can be really hard to or it can be
disrupted<00:05:28.680> by<00:05:29.300> the<00:05:30.300> natural<00:05:30.750> values<00:05:31.169> that

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
disrupted by the natural values that

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.540 
disrupted by the natural values that
these<00:05:31.680> that<00:05:32.009> the<00:05:32.099> colors<00:05:32.400> have<00:05:33.199> so<00:05:34.199> in<00:05:34.949> each<00:05:35.400> of

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
these that the colors have so in each of

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.670 
these that the colors have so in each of
these<00:05:35.639> layers<00:05:35.909> is<00:05:36.210> visible<00:05:36.750> on<00:05:36.930> top<00:05:37.259> of<00:05:37.529> each

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
these layers is visible on top of each

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.170 
these layers is visible on top of each
other<00:05:37.889> so<00:05:37.979> if<00:05:38.279> I<00:05:38.400> put<00:05:38.639> his<00:05:38.819> lines<00:05:40.729> down<00:05:41.729> below

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
other so if I put his lines down below

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.589 
other so if I put his lines down below
oops

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
oops

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.459

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
yeah if I put the lines only below

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.409 
yeah if I put the lines only below
picture<00:05:49.469> then<00:05:49.680> obviously<00:05:50.180> you're<00:05:51.180> not<00:05:51.300> gonna

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
got the color layers then the shadows on

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.839 
got the color layers then the shadows on
top<00:06:03.449> of<00:06:03.569> the<00:06:03.629> colors<00:06:03.960> and<00:06:04.199> the<00:06:05.069> lines<00:06:05.340> on<00:06:05.669> top

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
top of the colors and the lines on top

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
of the shadows and highlights I put in

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.730 
of the shadows and highlights I put in
front<00:06:07.889> of<00:06:08.129> the<00:06:08.219> lines<00:06:08.400> that<00:06:08.729> way<00:06:09.349> they<00:06:10.349> really

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
front of the lines that way they really

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:17.869 
front of the lines that way they really
seem<00:06:11.009> to<00:06:11.039> be<00:06:13.340> you<00:06:14.340> know<00:06:16.219> diffusing<00:06:17.219> everything

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:17.879 
seem to be you know diffusing everything

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.140 
seem to be you know diffusing everything
seem<00:06:18.870> dominant<00:06:19.469> it<00:06:19.650> really<00:06:19.889> gives<00:06:20.190> the<00:06:20.610> image

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
seem dominant it really gives the image

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.930 
seem dominant it really gives the image
more<00:06:21.389> three<00:06:21.690> dimensions<00:06:22.199> if<00:06:22.800> you<00:06:23.039> you<00:06:23.729> don't

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
more three dimensions if you you don't

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.820 
more three dimensions if you you don't
have<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.300> highlights<00:06:24.690> in<00:06:24.960> front<00:06:25.710> of<00:06:25.770> the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
have the highlights in front of the

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.300 
have the highlights in front of the
lines<00:06:26.039> like<00:06:26.340> obviously<00:06:26.879> it<00:06:27.090> just<00:06:27.590> it<00:06:28.590> can<00:06:29.159> look

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
lines like obviously it just it can look

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.769 
lines like obviously it just it can look
cleaner<00:06:29.580> and<00:06:29.879> it<00:06:30.000> can<00:06:30.180> look<00:06:30.330> pretty<00:06:30.509> good<00:06:30.719> in

00:06:30.769 --> 00:06:30.779 
cleaner and it can look pretty good in

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:31.550 
cleaner and it can look pretty good in
its<00:06:30.990> own<00:06:31.110> way

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
its own way

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.060 
its own way
I'm<00:06:32.039> just<00:06:33.029> fond<00:06:33.210> of<00:06:33.330> having<00:06:33.659> the<00:06:34.070> highlights

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
I'm just fond of having the highlights

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
I'm just fond of having the highlights
on<00:06:35.310> top<00:06:36.589> it<00:06:37.589> just<00:06:37.770> really<00:06:37.979> makes<00:06:38.490> it

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
on top it just really makes it

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.200 
on top it just really makes it
3d<00:06:39.919> but<00:06:40.919> then<00:06:41.160> again<00:06:41.250> with<00:06:41.460> these<00:06:41.639> heavy<00:06:41.940> lines

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
3d but then again with these heavy lines

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.610 
3d but then again with these heavy lines
it<00:06:42.449> looks<00:06:42.480> good<00:06:42.780> because<00:06:43.080> it's<00:06:43.230> kind<00:06:43.440> of<00:06:43.500> a

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
it looks good because it's kind of a

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.830 
it looks good because it's kind of a
comic<00:06:43.980> book<00:06:44.010> style<00:06:44.370> so<00:06:44.760> you<00:06:45.510> see<00:06:45.630> a<00:06:45.660> lot<00:06:45.810> of

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
comic book style so you see a lot of

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
comic book style so you see a lot of
detail

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
detail

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.469 
detail
I'll<00:06:47.490> sleeve<00:06:47.790> it<00:06:47.880> like<00:06:48.000> that<00:06:48.120> for<00:06:48.180> the<00:06:48.360> heck<00:06:48.449> of

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
I'll sleeve it like that for the heck of

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.510 
I'll sleeve it like that for the heck of
it<00:06:48.690> but<00:06:50.479> now<00:06:51.479> glow<00:06:51.930> effects<00:06:52.560> these<00:06:53.310> are<00:06:53.430> what

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
it but now glow effects these are what

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.520 
it but now glow effects these are what
you<00:06:53.610> really<00:06:53.790> wanted<00:06:54.180> in<00:06:54.419> the<00:06:54.570> foreground<00:06:54.900> this

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
you really wanted in the foreground this

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.040 
you really wanted in the foreground this
isn't<00:06:55.889> this<00:06:56.520> isn't<00:06:56.729> a<00:06:56.880> highlight<00:06:57.360> or<00:06:57.540> a<00:06:57.780> light

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
isn't this isn't a highlight or a light

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.629 
isn't this isn't a highlight or a light
source<00:06:58.380> as<00:06:59.010> much<00:06:59.070> as<00:06:59.460> it<00:06:59.580> is<00:07:01.010> you<00:07:02.010> know<00:07:02.130> it's<00:07:02.520> an

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 
source as much as it is you know it's an

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.610 
source as much as it is you know it's an
effect<00:07:02.910> whose<00:07:03.120> glowing<00:07:03.510> from<00:07:03.690> within<00:07:03.750> so<00:07:04.530> you

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
effect whose glowing from within so you

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.730 
effect whose glowing from within so you
can<00:07:04.740> see<00:07:05.690> so<00:07:06.690> certain<00:07:07.020> effects<00:07:07.290> you<00:07:07.410> just<00:07:07.620> got

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
can see so certain effects you just got

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.469 
can see so certain effects you just got
a<00:07:07.770> tinker<00:07:08.100> with<00:07:08.220> it<00:07:08.280> because<00:07:09.240> it<00:07:09.449> just

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 
a tinker with it because it just

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.200 
a tinker with it because it just
wouldn't<00:07:09.840> look<00:07:10.520> it<00:07:11.520> just<00:07:11.729> wouldn't<00:07:11.910> look<00:07:12.000> as

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
wouldn't look it just wouldn't look as

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.620 
wouldn't look it just wouldn't look as
it<00:07:12.660> just<00:07:12.930> doesn't<00:07:13.260> seem<00:07:14.130> to<00:07:14.160> glow<00:07:14.400> if<00:07:15.150> you<00:07:15.419> put

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
it just doesn't seem to glow if you put

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.570 
it just doesn't seem to glow if you put
it<00:07:15.720> behind<00:07:15.960> the<00:07:16.200> lines<00:07:17.330> so<00:07:18.330> in<00:07:18.450> this<00:07:18.570> case<00:07:19.580> it's

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
it behind the lines so in this case it's

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.960 
it behind the lines so in this case it's
just<00:07:20.669> a<00:07:20.880> strategy<00:07:21.120> but<00:07:22.490> also<00:07:23.490> you<00:07:23.729> might<00:07:23.910> want

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
just a strategy but also you might want

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.790 
just a strategy but also you might want
more<00:07:24.330> than<00:07:24.479> one<00:07:24.660> highlight<00:07:25.080> layer<00:07:25.290> because<00:07:25.650> if

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 
more than one highlight layer because if

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.200 
more than one highlight layer because if
you've<00:07:25.919> got<00:07:26.070> multiple<00:07:26.220> light<00:07:26.639> sources<00:07:26.669> you

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
you've got multiple light sources you

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.640 
you've got multiple light sources you
don't<00:07:27.389> want<00:07:27.540> and<00:07:27.990> they're<00:07:28.110> like<00:07:28.290> different

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:28.650 
don't want and they're like different

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.170 
don't want and they're like different
color<00:07:28.800> for<00:07:29.010> example<00:07:29.100> one's<00:07:29.520> a<00:07:29.610> green<00:07:29.880> light

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
color for example one's a green light

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.629 
color for example one's a green light
source<00:07:30.450> and<00:07:30.600> the<00:07:30.660> others<00:07:30.810> like<00:07:30.960> a<00:07:31.160> soft<00:07:32.160> yellow

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 
source and the others like a soft yellow

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.640 
source and the others like a soft yellow
light<00:07:32.850> source<00:07:33.150> you'll<00:07:33.750> want<00:07:34.050> to<00:07:34.139> have<00:07:34.410> them<00:07:34.560> on

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650 
light source you'll want to have them on

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.379 
light source you'll want to have them on
separately<00:07:35.010> because<00:07:35.400> they're<00:07:35.910> gonna<00:07:36.030> start

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389 
separately because they're gonna start

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.510 
separately because they're gonna start
blending<00:07:36.630> together<00:07:37.110> if<00:07:37.320> you<00:07:37.440> start<00:07:37.680> messing

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 
blending together if you start messing

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.250 
blending together if you start messing
around<00:07:38.729> with<00:07:38.970> them<00:07:39.090> too<00:07:39.210> much<00:07:39.360> so<00:07:41.660> yeah<00:07:42.660> that's

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:43.260 
around with them too much so yeah that's

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.159 
around with them too much so yeah that's
that's<00:07:43.530> the<00:07:43.740> basics<00:07:44.130> of<00:07:44.280> it<00:07:44.430> I<00:07:44.970> I<00:07:45.330> do<00:07:45.810> plan<00:07:46.110> on

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:46.169 
that's the basics of it I I do plan on

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:48.230 
that's the basics of it I I do plan on
doing<00:07:46.320> an<00:07:46.770> individual<00:07:47.340> video<00:07:47.490> for<00:07:47.910> each<00:07:48.090> of

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
doing an individual video for each of

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.830 
doing an individual video for each of
these<00:07:48.330> stages<00:07:48.990> and<00:07:49.880> get<00:07:50.880> into<00:07:51.120> what<00:07:51.479> details

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 
these stages and get into what details

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.659 
these stages and get into what details
that<00:07:52.020> I<00:07:52.110> I<00:07:52.139> know<00:07:52.470> or<00:07:53.070> can<00:07:53.220> think<00:07:53.400> of<00:07:53.490> off<00:07:53.639> the
