00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so and then you start to reel and you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.510 
so and then you start to reel and you
wrap<00:01:42.090> line<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.409> got<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.799> loop<00:01:44.100> caught

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
wrap line and you got this loop caught

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.480 
wrap line and you got this loop caught
up<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.790> here<00:01:45.110> now<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.250> you
