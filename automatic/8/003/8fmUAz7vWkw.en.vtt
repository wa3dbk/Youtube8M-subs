Kydex<00:00:20.400> clip<00:00:21.050> now<00:00:22.050> what's<00:00:22.230> great<00:00:22.350> about<00:00:22.439> this

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
Kydex clip now what's great about this

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.880 
Kydex clip now what's great about this
is<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.109> move<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.560> clip<00:00:25.740> over

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
is that you can move the the clip over

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.380 
is that you can move the the clip over
so<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.369> access<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.760> screen<00:00:26.970> on<00:00:27.119> playing

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
so you can access the screen on playing

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.960 
so you can access the screen on playing
back<00:00:27.510> video<00:00:27.660> files<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.670> you<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.789> still

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
access all the buttons at the same time

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.510 
access all the buttons at the same time
the<00:00:33.390> middle<00:00:33.630> clip<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.930> same<00:00:36.950> we<00:00:37.950> also<00:00:38.129> have

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the middle clip is the same we also have

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.580 
the middle clip is the same we also have
another<00:00:39.239> version<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> Kydex<00:00:40.020> clip<00:00:40.350> which

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
another version of the Kydex clip which

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.380 
another version of the Kydex clip which
is<00:00:40.620> thinner<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.309> has<00:00:41.700> more<00:00:41.910> holes<00:00:42.120> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
is thinner and has more holes and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180 
is thinner and has more holes and
drilled<00:00:42.809> into<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.070> could

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
drilled into it so that you could

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.819 
drilled into it so that you could
actually<00:00:44.370> adjust<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> height<00:00:45.770> now<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
actually adjust the height now the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.310 
actually adjust the height now the
reason<00:00:47.219> why<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.420> new<00:00:48.420> mounting<00:00:48.780> clips<00:00:48.989> work

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
reason why these new mounting clips work

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.889 
reason why these new mounting clips work
so<00:00:49.500> well<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.399> they<00:00:51.360> distribute

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
so well is because they they distribute

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.450 
so well is because they they distribute
the<00:00:52.050> weight<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> unit<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.860> very<00:00:53.129> top

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the weight of the unit to the very top

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.450 
the weight of the unit to the very top
that<00:00:53.820> way<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.539> hangs<00:00:54.780> down<00:00:54.899> much<00:00:55.800> easier<00:00:56.250> on

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that way it hangs down much easier on

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
that way it hangs down much easier on
your<00:00:56.910> uniform<00:00:57.300> which<00:00:57.600> I'm<00:00:57.719> going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.899> show<00:00:58.050> you

in a moment

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.850 
in a moment
we<00:01:00.539> also<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.850> cable<00:01:02.850> clip<00:01:03.090> now<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.559> cable

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
we also have a cable clip now the cable
