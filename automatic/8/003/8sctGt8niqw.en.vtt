easily<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:54.540> hardness<00:01:54.900> of<00:01:55.230> various<00:01:55.560> blocks

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
easily the hardness of various blocks

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.410 
easily the hardness of various blocks
have<00:01:56.070> been<00:01:56.130> adjusted<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.730> to<00:01:57.030> make<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> bit

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
have been adjusted just to make a bit

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.710 
have been adjusted just to make a bit
more<00:01:57.450> sense<00:01:57.930> within<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.570> relative<00:02:00.570> to

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
more sense within you know relative to

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.970 
more sense within you know relative to
each<00:02:00.750> other<00:02:01.910> okay<00:02:02.910> so<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.530> other<00:02:04.650> major

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
each other okay so the other major

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.970 
each other okay so the other major
change<00:02:05.370> here<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.760> hardcore<00:02:06.240> piles<00:02:06.980> basically

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
change here is hardcore piles basically

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.499 
change here is hardcore piles basically
anything<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.399> would<00:02:08.610> use<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> shovel<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.239> get

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
sand gravel and dirt when you break it

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.350

by hand or with the wrong tool you're

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.280 
by hand or with the wrong tool you're
going<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.540> get<00:02:15.630> three

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
going to get three

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.709 
going to get three
miles<00:02:16.530> instead<00:02:17.129> of<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:18.469> full<00:02:19.469> block<00:02:20.719> these

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
miles instead of a full block these

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.580 
miles instead of a full block these
piles<00:02:22.140> let<00:02:22.950> me<00:02:23.040> grab<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> couple<00:02:23.519> more<00:02:23.909> of<00:02:23.969> these

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
piles let me grab a couple more of these

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.699 
piles let me grab a couple more of these
can<00:02:25.590> be<00:02:25.739> crafted<00:02:26.069> back<00:02:26.609> into<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:28.260> block<00:02:28.530> they

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
can be crafted back into the block they

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.809 
can be crafted back into the block they
represent<00:02:29.930> four<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.049> one<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:32.370> if<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:32.670> don't

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
represent four to one so if you don't

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.690 
represent four to one so if you don't
use<00:02:32.939> a<00:02:32.970> shovel<00:02:33.209> you're<00:02:33.659> not<00:02:33.840> getting<00:02:34.200> back

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
use a shovel you're not getting back

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.740 
use a shovel you're not getting back
everything<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.819> could<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.180> out<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.480> that

everything you could of out of that

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.679 
everything you could of out of that
block<00:02:37.079> basic<00:02:37.709> life<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.269> can<00:02:39.390> see<00:02:39.540> this

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
block basic life and you can see this

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.199 
block basic life and you can see this
works<00:02:39.930> with<00:02:40.200> all<00:02:41.189> three<00:02:41.519> different<00:02:41.670> kinds<00:02:41.909> of

works with all three different kinds of
shovel<00:02:43.200> materials<00:02:44.719> there<00:02:45.719> we<00:02:45.900> go<00:02:46.760> beyond<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
shovel materials there we go beyond that

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.259 
shovel materials there we go beyond that
there's<00:02:48.840> been<00:02:48.989> some<00:02:49.230> tweaking<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.760> insta

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
there's been some tweaking to the insta

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.869 
there's been some tweaking to the insta
breaking<00:02:51.659> bug<00:02:52.250> where<00:02:53.250> with<00:02:55.669> basically<00:02:56.669> there

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
breaking bug where with basically there

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.589 
breaking bug where with basically there
wasn't<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.329> limit<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.459> minimum<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.669> breaking<00:03:00.359> I

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
wasn't a limit a minimum on breaking I

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.059 
wasn't a limit a minimum on breaking I
was<00:03:00.930> taken<00:03:01.200> off<00:03:01.319> at<00:03:01.470> some<00:03:01.650> point<00:03:01.829> I<00:03:01.889> can't

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
was taken off at some point I can't

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.140 
was taken off at some point I can't
believe<00:03:03.049> lightning<00:03:04.370> but<00:03:05.370> uh<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:05.879> been

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
believe lightning but uh that's been

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.929 
believe lightning but uh that's been
added<00:03:06.389> back<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.340> you're<00:03:08.340> going<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.730> start

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
added back so you're going to start

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.179 
added back so you're going to start
noticing<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.450> mostly<00:03:09.840> mainly<00:03:10.470> on<00:03:10.590> netherrack

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
noticing it mostly mainly on netherrack

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.819 
noticing it mostly mainly on netherrack
and<00:03:11.549> things<00:03:11.849> like<00:03:12.090> vegetation<00:03:12.569> but<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.680> does

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
and things like vegetation but it does

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.020 
and things like vegetation but it does
actually<00:03:14.040> affect<00:03:14.459> everything<00:03:14.700> with<00:03:14.909> an

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
actually affect everything with an

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.899 
actually affect everything with an
efficiency<00:03:15.450> for<00:03:16.319> pickaxe<00:03:17.159> I<00:03:17.459> still<00:03:17.700> can't

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
efficiency for pickaxe I still can't

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.890 
efficiency for pickaxe I still can't
just<00:03:18.180> immediately<00:03:18.780> burn<00:03:19.079> through<00:03:19.579> everything

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
just immediately burn through everything

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.140 
just immediately burn through everything
so<00:03:21.900> that's<00:03:22.199> there<00:03:22.650> other<00:03:23.459> than<00:03:23.639> that<00:03:23.819> we<00:03:24.000> have

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
so that's there other than that we have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.319 
so that's there other than that we have
some<00:03:24.389> more<00:03:24.510> bug<00:03:24.750> fixes<00:03:25.379> Oh<00:03:26.010> cut<00:03:26.909> scoured
