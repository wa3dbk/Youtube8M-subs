00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
I upgraded the hard drive on my laptop

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.990 
I upgraded the hard drive on my laptop
and<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.570> did<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.470> did<00:00:32.070> buy<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> bunch<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.790> hard

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
drives for the desktop I built but so

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.639 
drives for the desktop I built but so
this<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> left<00:00:36.930> over<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.590> you

this is for a left over one that you

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.560 
this is for a left over one that you
can't<00:00:37.920> really<00:00:38.070> use<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> ones<00:00:39.420> you

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570

can't really use so for the ones you
can't<00:00:39.809> use<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.680> something<00:00:40.920> with

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
can't use you have to do something with

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.670 
can't use you have to do something with
them<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.399> mean<00:00:41.640> selling<00:00:42.300> them<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.079> ok<00:00:43.620> you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
them I mean selling them is is ok you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.319 
them I mean selling them is is ok you
can<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.489> you're<00:00:44.640> losing<00:00:45.000> some<00:00:45.149> money

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
can do that but you're losing some money

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.479 
can do that but you're losing some money
so<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> way<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.170> can<00:00:46.379> actually<00:00:46.559> get<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.190> full

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
so the way you can actually get the full

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.459 
so the way you can actually get the full
benefit<00:00:47.940> out<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.090> using<00:00:48.629> them<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
benefit out of using them is to use a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.200 
benefit out of using them is to use a
hard<00:00:49.800> drive<00:00:50.010> enclosure<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.879> use<00:00:51.030> them

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
hard drive enclosure so you can use them

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
hard drive enclosure so you can use them
as<00:00:51.329> an<00:00:51.480> external<00:00:51.840> hard<00:00:52.199> drive<00:00:52.260> now<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> already

as an external hard drive now I already
have<00:00:53.370> one<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.940> silver<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> already<00:00:54.930> pre

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
have one in silver that I already pre

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.619 
have one in silver that I already pre
assembled<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.489> tested<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.449> working

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629

gigabyte<00:01:01.109> hard<00:01:01.140> drive<00:01:01.379> from<00:01:02.219> my<00:01:02.430> laptop<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
gigabyte hard drive from my laptop and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.170 
gigabyte hard drive from my laptop and
it's<00:01:04.049> working<00:01:04.260> pretty<00:01:04.500> nicely<00:01:04.670> I<00:01:05.670> love<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it's working pretty nicely I love the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.850 
it's working pretty nicely I love the
fact<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.689> supports<00:01:07.110> multiple<00:01:07.439> devices

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
fact that it supports multiple devices

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.370 
fact that it supports multiple devices
so<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.549> cable<00:01:08.909> itself<00:01:09.240> supports<00:01:09.810> tons<00:01:10.260> of

so the cable itself supports tons of
devices<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.580> very<00:01:11.760> high<00:01:11.939> speed<00:01:12.320> it's<00:01:13.320> not

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.940 
this all you really need is just your
hard<00:01:38.610> drive<00:01:38.869> open<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:39.960> thing<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.320> which

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
hard drive open this thing up which

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.609 
hard drive open this thing up which
takes<00:01:41.280> very<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:42.090> effort<00:01:42.360> screw<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
takes very little effort screw it in and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.020 
takes very little effort screw it in and
then<00:01:43.799> you're<00:01:43.920> done<00:01:44.130> all<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.549> need<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.909> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
then you're done all you need to do is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.460 
then you're done all you need to do is
install<00:01:45.299> their<00:01:45.570> drivers<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.259> works

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
install their drivers and it works

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.230 
install their drivers and it works
really<00:01:46.710> nicely<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.670> box<00:01:47.850> itself<00:01:48.119> is

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
really nicely so the box itself is

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.990 
really nicely so the box itself is
pretty<00:01:48.479> small<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.979> eSATA<00:01:50.549> version

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
pretty small this is the eSATA version

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.260 
pretty small this is the eSATA version
or<00:01:51.680> they<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.369> bunch<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.000> different

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
or they do have a bunch of different

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.700 
or they do have a bunch of different
versions<00:01:54.420> they<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.200> IDE<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.909> so

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
versions they have the IDE one so

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
versions they have the IDE one so
depending<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.799> what<00:01:58.950> you're<00:01:59.100> using<00:01:59.360> not<00:02:00.360> eSATA

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
depending on what you're using not eSATA

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.690 
depending on what you're using not eSATA
but<00:02:01.020> SATA<00:02:01.290> depending<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.009> what's<00:02:02.250> hard<00:02:02.490> drive

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
but SATA depending on what's hard drive

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.310 
but SATA depending on what's hard drive
you<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> one<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.110> buy

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
you have that's the one you have to buy

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.260 
you have that's the one you have to buy
so<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:06.119> had<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.719> use<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.350> proper<00:02:07.829> box

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
so this one I had to use the proper box

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.510 
so this one I had to use the proper box
for<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.569> proper<00:02:10.020> hard<00:02:10.470> drive<00:02:10.739> because<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
for the proper hard drive because if you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.300 
for the proper hard drive because if you
if<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.120> order<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> wrong<00:02:12.840> hard

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
if you order the wrong hard

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.580 
if you order the wrong hard
drive<00:02:13.520> enclosure<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.540> will<00:02:14.720> not<00:02:14.930> support<00:02:15.470> your

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
drive enclosure it will not support your

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.410 
drive enclosure it will not support your
hard<00:02:15.830> drive<00:02:16.099> which<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.670> probably<00:02:17.150> going<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.330> be

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
hard drive which is probably going to be

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.449 
hard drive which is probably going to be
a<00:02:17.750> pretty<00:02:18.170> bad<00:02:18.349> thing<00:02:18.380> you're<00:02:19.099> probably<00:02:19.250> going

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
a pretty bad thing you're probably going

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.800 
a pretty bad thing you're probably going
to<00:02:19.550> spend<00:02:19.790> some<00:02:19.970> money<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.209> then<00:02:20.450> figure<00:02:20.750> out

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
to spend some money and then figure out

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.270 
to spend some money and then figure out
later<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.500> you'll<00:02:21.650> probably<00:02:21.770> have<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.099> hard

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
later and you'll probably have a hard

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.130 
later and you'll probably have a hard
time<00:02:22.400> returning<00:02:22.819> it<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.330> that's<00:02:23.750> just<00:02:23.959> a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
time returning it so that's just a

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.630 
time returning it so that's just a
little<00:02:24.380> heads-up<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.099> probably<00:02:25.400> want

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
little heads-up that you probably want

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.520 
little heads-up that you probably want
to<00:02:25.730> identify<00:02:25.930> type<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.050> your<00:02:27.140> hard<00:02:27.349> drive

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
to identify type of your hard drive

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.650 
to identify type of your hard drive
before<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:27.920> go<00:02:28.130> out<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.310> order<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:28.849> so

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
before you go out and order this so

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.620 
before you go out and order this so
opening<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:30.140> up<00:02:30.230> pretty<00:02:30.830> simple<00:02:31.099> packaging

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
opening it up pretty simple packaging

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.690 
opening it up pretty simple packaging
the<00:02:32.630> box<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:33.200> pretty<00:02:33.650> self-explanatory<00:02:34.010> a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
the box is pretty self-explanatory a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.750 
the box is pretty self-explanatory a
little<00:02:35.180> tab<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.019> bottom<00:02:36.170> right<00:02:36.530> here<00:02:36.800> I'm

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
little tab on the bottom right here I'm

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.740 
little tab on the bottom right here I'm
just<00:02:38.000> going<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.300> pull<00:02:38.660> that<00:02:38.840> out<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
just going to pull that out and the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.970 
just going to pull that out and the
first<00:02:41.959> thing<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.230> notice<00:02:42.349> is<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.620> has<00:02:42.920> a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
first thing you notice is that has a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.220 
first thing you notice is that has a
pretty<00:02:43.340> nice<00:02:43.489> leather<00:02:43.819> case<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:45.019> leather

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
pretty nice leather case the leather

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.940 
pretty nice leather case the leather
enclosure<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.950> always<00:02:46.250> nice<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.580> see<00:02:46.760> also<00:02:47.950> so

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
enclosure is always nice to see also so

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.890 
enclosure is always nice to see also so
I<00:02:48.980> have<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.340> second<00:02:49.790> one<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:50.150> actually<00:02:50.630> have

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
I have a second one I actually have

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.780 
I have a second one I actually have
three<00:02:51.200> because<00:02:51.650> I've<00:02:51.860> built<00:02:52.190> three<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.700> these

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
three because I've built three of these

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.780 
three because I've built three of these
and<00:02:53.120> put<00:02:53.209> them<00:02:53.360> together<00:02:53.480> but<00:02:54.430> they<00:02:55.430> all<00:02:55.580> come

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
and put them together but they all come

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.000 
and put them together but they all come
with<00:02:55.970> leather<00:02:56.180> enclosures<00:02:56.780> which<00:02:57.350> is<00:02:57.620> really

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
with leather enclosures which is really

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.589 
with leather enclosures which is really
nice<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:58.519> can<00:02:58.610> carry<00:02:58.880> this<00:02:59.120> very<00:02:59.390> easily

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
nice so you can carry this very easily

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.559 
nice so you can carry this very easily
so<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.380> black<00:03:00.590> one<00:03:00.860> itself<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.670> practically<00:03:02.540> a

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
so the black one itself is practically a

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.080 
so the black one itself is practically a
fingerprint<00:03:03.230> magnet<00:03:03.440> all<00:03:03.799> tomorr<00:03:04.220> except<00:03:04.970> for

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
fingerprint magnet all tomorr except for

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.789 
fingerprint magnet all tomorr except for
the<00:03:05.150> ones<00:03:05.299> with<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.450> matte<00:03:05.660> finish<00:03:05.690> but<00:03:06.590> if

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
the ones with the matte finish but if

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.170 
the ones with the matte finish but if
you<00:03:06.890> look<00:03:07.040> at<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.250> into<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.580> light<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.880> kind<00:03:08.090> of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
you look at it into the light it kind of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.960 
you look at it into the light it kind of
has<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.360> nice<00:03:08.810> look<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.200> it<00:03:09.640> so<00:03:10.640> it's<00:03:10.819> really

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
has a nice look to it so it's really

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.930 
has a nice look to it so it's really
shiny<00:03:11.239> black<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:12.099> comparison<00:03:13.099> to<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> silver

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
shiny black and comparison to the silver

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.809 
shiny black and comparison to the silver
one<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.810> silver<00:03:15.110> one<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.470> SATA<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.310> black

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
one the silver one is the SATA the black

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.390 
one the silver one is the SATA the black
one<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.269> IDE<00:03:18.109> or<00:03:18.470> I<00:03:18.530> don't<00:03:19.190> remember

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
one is the IDE or I don't remember

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.920 
one is the IDE or I don't remember
specifically<00:03:19.910> but<00:03:20.120> they're<00:03:20.600> one<00:03:20.780> of<00:03:20.810> the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
specifically but they're one of the

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.190 
specifically but they're one of the
they're<00:03:21.410> both<00:03:21.829> different<00:03:22.070> types<00:03:22.459> so<00:03:23.120> they<00:03:23.930> all

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
they're both different types so they all

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.560 
they're both different types so they all
have<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:24.799> silver<00:03:25.400> bezel<00:03:25.670> going<00:03:26.030> across<00:03:26.329> them

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
have that silver bezel going across them

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.880 
have that silver bezel going across them
but<00:03:27.049> essentially<00:03:27.500> they're<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.709> same

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
but essentially they're the same

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.640 
but essentially they're the same
dimensions<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:29.000> same<00:03:29.269> hard<00:03:29.540> drive

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
dimensions and the same hard drive

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.870 
dimensions and the same hard drive
enclosure<00:03:30.650> altogether<00:03:31.310> just<00:03:31.400> different

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
enclosure altogether just different

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.699 
enclosure altogether just different
colors<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.359> supporting<00:03:32.870> different<00:03:32.989> hard

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
colors and supporting different hard

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.800 
colors and supporting different hard
drives<00:03:33.920> so<00:03:34.100> you<00:03:34.489> do<00:03:34.670> get<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:34.910> screw<00:03:35.269> driver<00:03:35.450> so

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
drives so you do get a screw driver so

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.110 
drives so you do get a screw driver so
that<00:03:35.989> you<00:03:36.140> can<00:03:36.319> easily<00:03:36.530> screw<00:03:37.040> in<00:03:37.220> your<00:03:37.730> hard

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
that you can easily screw in your hard

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.460 
that you can easily screw in your hard
drive<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:38.630> it<00:03:38.780> stays<00:03:38.989> put

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
drive so it stays put

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.289 
drive so it stays put
you<00:03:39.890> get<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.340> nice<00:03:40.670> USB<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:42.230> mini-usb<00:03:42.350> cable

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
you get a nice USB to mini-usb cable

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.170 
you get a nice USB to mini-usb cable
you<00:03:44.299> also<00:03:44.450> get<00:03:44.690> screws<00:03:45.069> obviously<00:03:46.069> for<00:03:46.910> screws

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
you also get screws obviously for screws

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.849 
you also get screws obviously for screws
so<00:03:47.510> don't<00:03:47.690> lose<00:03:47.840> one<00:03:48.109> because<00:03:48.470> they're<00:03:48.680> only

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
so don't lose one because they're only

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.849 
so don't lose one because they're only
giving<00:03:49.069> you<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.459> minimum<00:03:49.790> amount<00:03:50.090> required

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
giving you the minimum amount required

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.220 
giving you the minimum amount required
so<00:03:51.859> that<00:03:52.280> cable<00:03:52.910> right<00:03:53.180> there<00:03:53.480> what<00:03:54.049> you<00:03:54.079> see

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
so that cable right there what you see

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.470 
so that cable right there what you see
connected<00:03:54.799> to<00:03:54.889> the<00:03:54.980> silver<00:03:55.280> one<00:03:55.459> is<00:03:55.609> allows

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
connected to the silver one is allows

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.270 
connected to the silver one is allows
you<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.750> split<00:03:56.930> this<00:03:57.079> between<00:03:57.410> multiple

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
you to split this between multiple

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.800 
you to split this between multiple
devices<00:03:58.609> which<00:03:59.030> is<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.299> pretty<00:03:59.510> nice<00:03:59.660> feature

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
devices which is a pretty nice feature

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.330 
devices which is a pretty nice feature
to<00:04:00.019> have<00:04:00.109> and<00:04:00.380> then<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.620> have<00:04:00.709> your<00:04:00.829> driver<00:04:01.069> CD

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
to have and then you have your driver CD

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.430 
to have and then you have your driver CD
which<00:04:01.880> is<00:04:02.000> pretty<00:04:02.209> essential<00:04:02.569> so<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.260> want

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
which is pretty essential so you want

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.500 
which is pretty essential so you want
everything<00:04:03.799> to<00:04:03.829> work<00:04:04.040> properly<00:04:04.340> so<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:05.299> first

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
everything to work properly so the first

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.150 
everything to work properly so the first
thing<00:04:05.660> we're<00:04:05.780> going<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.959> do<00:04:06.079> is<00:04:06.350> we're<00:04:07.010> going

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.449 
thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:04:07.250> first<00:04:07.930> pull<00:04:08.930> on<00:04:09.260> these<00:04:09.620> two<00:04:09.889> tabs<00:04:10.220> at<00:04:10.430> the

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
to first pull on these two tabs at the

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.670 
to first pull on these two tabs at the
bottom<00:04:10.639> so<00:04:11.420> when<00:04:11.600> you<00:04:11.720> pull<00:04:11.930> on<00:04:12.079> them<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.530> can

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
bottom so when you pull on them you can

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.979 
bottom so when you pull on them you can
then<00:04:12.889> slide<00:04:13.280> off<00:04:13.310> these<00:04:13.790> doors<00:04:14.060> so<00:04:14.359> the<00:04:14.750> first

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
then slide off these doors so the first

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.930 
then slide off these doors so the first
door<00:04:15.230> on<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.470> top<00:04:15.590> it's<00:04:16.190> not<00:04:16.310> open<00:04:16.729> which

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
door on the top it's not open which

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.759 
door on the top it's not open which
reveals<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.570> compartment<00:04:18.410> where<00:04:18.500> you<00:04:18.530> put

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
reveals the compartment where you put

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.069 
reveals the compartment where you put
the<00:04:18.859> esses<00:04:19.190> where<00:04:19.700> you<00:04:20.150> put<00:04:20.389> the<00:04:20.570> hard<00:04:20.810> drive

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
the esses where you put the hard drive

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.350 
the esses where you put the hard drive
now<00:04:21.560> this<00:04:22.010> compartment<00:04:22.370> is<00:04:22.700> probably<00:04:23.300> the

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
now this compartment is probably the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.029 
now this compartment is probably the
most<00:04:23.479> crucial<00:04:23.720> one<00:04:23.930> because<00:04:24.380> you<00:04:24.800> want<00:04:24.950> to

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
most crucial one because you want to

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.530 
most crucial one because you want to
make<00:04:25.159> sure<00:04:25.190> everything<00:04:25.700> is<00:04:25.789> aligned<00:04:26.120> if<00:04:26.270> you

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
make sure everything is aligned if you

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.060 
make sure everything is aligned if you
line<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.930> properly<00:04:27.290> is<00:04:27.470> not<00:04:27.680> going<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:27.920> work

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
line it properly is not going to work

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.010 
line it properly is not going to work
and<00:04:28.340> I've<00:04:28.820> had<00:04:28.970> experiences<00:04:29.510> with<00:04:29.690> my<00:04:29.810> other

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
and I've had experiences with my other

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.360 
and I've had experiences with my other
one<00:04:30.290> where<00:04:30.530> I<00:04:30.560> didn't<00:04:30.950> align<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:31.280> properly

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
one where I didn't align it properly

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.980 
one where I didn't align it properly
then<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.150> had<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:32.480> go<00:04:32.570> through<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.840> whole

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
then I had to go through the whole

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.020 
then I had to go through the whole
ordeal<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.650> pushing<00:04:34.160> out<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.610> other<00:04:34.790> end

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
ordeal of pushing out to the other end

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.240 
ordeal of pushing out to the other end
and<00:04:35.300> taking<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.080> out<00:04:36.170> so<00:04:36.470> it's<00:04:36.650> not<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:36.860> nice

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
and taking it out so it's not a nice

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.970 
and taking it out so it's not a nice
process<00:04:37.550> to<00:04:38.240> mess<00:04:38.450> it<00:04:38.600> up<00:04:38.660> on<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.380> first<00:04:39.710> try

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
process to mess it up on the first try

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.770 
process to mess it up on the first try
so<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.460> want<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:40.970> get<00:04:41.060> it<00:04:41.180> right<00:04:41.330> on<00:04:41.390> the<00:04:41.630> first

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
so you want to get it right on the first

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.730 
so you want to get it right on the first
try<00:04:42.020> so<00:04:42.490> here<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.700> back<00:04:43.910> back<00:04:44.720> is<00:04:45.050> where

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
try so here is the back back is where

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.010 
try so here is the back back is where
you<00:04:45.920> just<00:04:46.160> screw<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.640> in<00:04:46.730> if<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.210> push<00:04:47.540> on<00:04:47.720> the

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
you just screw it in if you push on the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.840 
you just screw it in if you push on the
back<00:04:48.200> you'll<00:04:48.530> pop<00:04:48.800> out<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.190> front<00:04:49.490> and<00:04:49.610> allow

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
back you'll pop out the front and allow

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.670 
back you'll pop out the front and allow
you<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.090> take<00:04:50.240> out<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:50.840> hard<00:04:51.050> drive<00:04:51.260> so<00:04:51.500> that's

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
you to take out the hard drive so that's

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.920 
you to take out the hard drive so that's
one<00:04:51.950> thing<00:04:52.160> you'll<00:04:52.340> be<00:04:52.910> able<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.150> do<00:04:53.270> so

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
one thing you'll be able to do so

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.900 
one thing you'll be able to do so
putting<00:04:54.230> in<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.590> hard<00:04:54.800> drive<00:04:55.040> is<00:04:55.280> not<00:04:55.700> too

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
putting in the hard drive is not too

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.250 
putting in the hard drive is not too
hard<00:04:56.150> all<00:04:56.390> you<00:04:56.480> got<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.720> do<00:04:56.810> is<00:04:56.900> just<00:04:57.110> line<00:04:57.230> up

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
hard all you got to do is just line up

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.880 
hard all you got to do is just line up
the<00:04:57.470> ports<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:57.950> it's<00:04:58.940> in<00:04:59.320> it's<00:05:00.320> probably<00:05:00.770> not

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
the ports and it's in it's probably not

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.520 
the ports and it's in it's probably not
going<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.340> shake<00:05:01.550> if<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:02.150> are<00:05:02.420> if<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:02.930> don't

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
going to shake if you are if you don't

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.230 
going to shake if you are if you don't
screw<00:05:03.830> it<00:05:03.860> in<00:05:04.040> but<00:05:04.460> just<00:05:04.670> as<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.030> precaution

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
screw it in but just as a precaution

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.560 
screw it in but just as a precaution
it's<00:05:05.810> a<00:05:05.930> good<00:05:06.110> idea<00:05:06.230> to<00:05:06.410> screw<00:05:06.710> it<00:05:06.800> in<00:05:07.570> these

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
it's a good idea to screw it in these

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.190 
it's a good idea to screw it in these
screws<00:05:08.990> are<00:05:09.260> pretty<00:05:09.740> simple<00:05:09.950> so<00:05:10.670> at<00:05:11.510> first<00:05:11.840> I

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
screws are pretty simple so at first I

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.320 
screws are pretty simple so at first I
originally<00:05:13.100> wasn't<00:05:13.370> able<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.730> get<00:05:13.940> this<00:05:14.120> in

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
originally wasn't able to get this in

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.170 
originally wasn't able to get this in
because<00:05:14.920> it<00:05:15.920> just<00:05:15.980> wouldn't<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.970> wouldn't

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
because it just wouldn't it wouldn't

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.690 
because it just wouldn't it wouldn't
line<00:05:17.390> up<00:05:17.420> these<00:05:18.200> holes<00:05:18.440> will<00:05:18.740> not<00:05:18.890> line<00:05:19.100> up<00:05:19.130> but

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
line up these holes will not line up but

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.750 
line up these holes will not line up but
then<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:19.880> had<00:05:20.060> to<00:05:20.090> do<00:05:20.840> some<00:05:21.520> realignment<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:22.670> it

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
then I had to do some realignment and it

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.820 
then I had to do some realignment and it
did<00:05:22.910> work<00:05:23.030> eventually<00:05:23.690> and<00:05:23.900> now<00:05:24.320> if<00:05:24.500> I<00:05:24.590> shake

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
did work eventually and now if I shake

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.640 
did work eventually and now if I shake
it<00:05:25.010> it<00:05:25.130> won't<00:05:25.250> pop<00:05:25.790> out<00:05:26.000> which<00:05:26.330> is<00:05:26.650> something

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
it it won't pop out which is something

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.410 
it it won't pop out which is something
that<00:05:27.800> you<00:05:28.040> probably<00:05:28.370> want<00:05:28.640> to<00:05:28.790> make<00:05:29.060> sure<00:05:29.240> that

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
that you probably want to make sure that

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.810 
that you probably want to make sure that
happens<00:05:29.720> because<00:05:30.050> if<00:05:30.440> you<00:05:30.650> don't<00:05:31.520> do<00:05:31.700> that

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
happens because if you don't do that

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.250 
happens because if you don't do that
properly<00:05:32.150> it's<00:05:32.480> probably<00:05:32.780> gonna<00:05:32.900> screw<00:05:33.110> some

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
properly it's probably gonna screw some

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.320 
properly it's probably gonna screw some
stuff<00:05:33.470> up<00:05:33.680> so<00:05:34.630> slide<00:05:35.630> on<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:36.560> front<00:05:37.370> panel<00:05:38.000> I

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
stuff up so slide on the front panel I

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.600 
stuff up so slide on the front panel I
guess<00:05:38.480> you<00:05:38.600> could<00:05:38.750> call<00:05:38.780> it<00:05:39.140> and<00:05:39.680> you<00:05:39.710> got<00:05:40.580> to

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
guess you could call it and you got to

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.300 
guess you could call it and you got to
push<00:05:41.000> on<00:05:41.240> those<00:05:41.510> two<00:05:41.750> prongs<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:42.500> then<00:05:43.040> it

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
push on those two prongs and then it

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.100 
push on those two prongs and then it
will<00:05:43.430> slide<00:05:43.640> back<00:05:43.850> into<00:05:44.090> place<00:05:44.270> you'll<00:05:44.810> hear<00:05:45.080> a

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
will slide back into place you'll hear a

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.350 
will slide back into place you'll hear a
click<00:05:45.770> or<00:05:46.010> a<00:05:46.040> snap<00:05:46.370> and<00:05:46.610> then<00:05:46.880> that<00:05:47.030> means<00:05:47.210> it's

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
click or a snap and then that means it's

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.530 
click or a snap and then that means it's
secured<00:05:47.720> so<00:05:48.350> then<00:05:48.440> slide<00:05:48.740> on<00:05:48.920> the<00:05:49.070> other<00:05:49.250> one

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
secured so then slide on the other one

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.390 
secured so then slide on the other one
they<00:05:50.540> kind<00:05:50.780> of<00:05:50.870> make<00:05:51.020> it<00:05:51.050> a<00:05:51.200> metal<00:05:51.980> a<00:05:52.220> metal

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
they kind of make it a metal a metal

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.300 
they kind of make it a metal a metal
screeching<00:05:53.270> sound<00:05:53.540> when<00:05:53.750> they<00:05:53.930> slide<00:05:54.830> on<00:05:55.010> so

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
screeching sound when they slide on so

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.390 
screeching sound when they slide on so
it's<00:05:55.460> kind<00:05:55.730> of<00:05:55.790> weird<00:05:56.380> but<00:05:57.380> same<00:05:58.130> thing<00:05:58.280> with

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
it's kind of weird but same thing with

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.580 
it's kind of weird but same thing with
this<00:05:58.490> one<00:05:58.550> pull<00:05:59.510> on<00:05:59.570> those<00:05:59.690> two<00:05:59.840> prongs<00:06:00.170> and

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
this one pull on those two prongs and

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.830 
this one pull on those two prongs and
that<00:06:01.190> should<00:06:01.370> snap<00:06:01.640> into<00:06:01.790> place<00:06:01.970> and<00:06:02.420> that's

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
that should snap into place and that's

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.000 
that should snap into place and that's
kind<00:06:03.080> of<00:06:03.110> how<00:06:03.410> it's<00:06:03.650> going<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:03.890> work

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
kind of how it's going to work

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.810 
kind of how it's going to work
essentially<00:06:04.490> and<00:06:06.100> that's<00:06:07.100> the<00:06:07.400> hard<00:06:07.640> drive

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
essentially and that's the hard drive

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.930 
essentially and that's the hard drive
itself<00:06:08.290> so<00:06:09.290> now<00:06:09.830> you<00:06:09.890> have<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.280> DVD<00:06:10.670> you

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
itself so now you have the DVD you

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.550 
itself so now you have the DVD you
probably<00:06:11.330> want<00:06:11.480> to<00:06:11.540> install<00:06:11.780> this<00:06:11.990> sometime

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
probably want to install this sometime

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.230 
probably want to install this sometime
around<00:06:12.890> now<00:06:13.100> so<00:06:13.490> that<00:06:13.670> everything<00:06:14.090> works

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
around now so that everything works

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.030 
around now so that everything works
because<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.020> next<00:06:15.290> step<00:06:15.380> is<00:06:15.620> obviously<00:06:15.710> going

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
because the next step is obviously going

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.310 
because the next step is obviously going
to<00:06:16.100> be<00:06:16.190> loading<00:06:16.490> all<00:06:16.580> your<00:06:16.700> content<00:06:17.090> on<00:06:17.240> it<00:06:17.390> so

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
to be loading all your content on it so

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.970 
to be loading all your content on it so
after<00:06:18.950> this<00:06:19.070> you<00:06:19.340> have<00:06:19.610> these<00:06:19.940> USB<00:06:20.840> cable<00:06:21.260> this

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
after this you have these USB cable this

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.040 
after this you have these USB cable this
cable<00:06:22.040> is<00:06:22.730> really<00:06:23.150> nice<00:06:23.300> it's<00:06:23.600> pretty<00:06:23.870> lengthy

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
cable is really nice it's pretty lengthy

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.260 
cable is really nice it's pretty lengthy
actually<00:06:24.680> all<00:06:25.490> the<00:06:25.610> thing<00:06:25.760> I<00:06:25.850> have<00:06:25.940> to<00:06:26.000> say<00:06:26.090> is

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
actually all the thing I have to say is

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.090 
actually all the thing I have to say is
the<00:06:26.780> splinter<00:06:27.200> part<00:06:27.440> is<00:06:27.620> actually<00:06:27.950> really

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
the splinter part is actually really

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.820 
the splinter part is actually really
sharp<00:06:28.600> the<00:06:29.600> part<00:06:29.870> that<00:06:30.200> is<00:06:30.410> the<00:06:31.060> USB<00:06:32.830> splitter

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
sharp the part that is the USB splitter

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.159 
sharp the part that is the USB splitter
is<00:06:34.070> extremely<00:06:34.820> sharp<00:06:35.000> to<00:06:35.240> touch<00:06:35.419> I've<00:06:35.840> cut

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
is extremely sharp to touch I've cut

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.800 
is extremely sharp to touch I've cut
myself<00:06:36.320> numerous<00:06:37.190> times<00:06:37.430> on<00:06:37.640> it<00:06:37.760> it's<00:06:38.419> just<00:06:38.630> I

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
myself numerous times on it it's just I

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.390 
myself numerous times on it it's just I
don't<00:06:38.960> even<00:06:39.260> know<00:06:39.440> why<00:06:39.620> they<00:06:39.650> make<00:06:39.980> it

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
don't even know why they make it

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.969 
don't even know why they make it
sharp<00:06:40.669> but<00:06:41.270> the<00:06:41.360> splitter<00:06:41.660> is<00:06:41.750> not<00:06:42.410> too<00:06:42.800> bad

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
sharp but the splitter is not too bad

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:46.540 
sharp but the splitter is not too bad
and<00:06:43.340> the<00:06:44.060> USB<00:06:44.449> is<00:06:44.840> just<00:06:45.110> USB<00:06:45.410> 2.0<00:06:45.800> so<00:06:46.310> it's<00:06:46.460> just

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
and the USB is just USB 2.0 so it's just

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.550 
and the USB is just USB 2.0 so it's just
regular<00:06:46.970> USB<00:06:47.270> 2.0<00:06:47.780> and<00:06:47.990> it's<00:06:48.080> going<00:06:48.350> to<00:06:48.440> work

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
regular USB 2.0 and it's going to work

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.180 
regular USB 2.0 and it's going to work
just<00:06:49.460> exactly<00:06:50.240> how<00:06:50.539> USB<00:06:51.050> 2.0<00:06:51.440> works<00:06:51.650> same

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
just exactly how USB 2.0 works same

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.409 
just exactly how USB 2.0 works same
speed<00:06:52.520> on<00:06:53.240> indication<00:06:54.229> that<00:06:54.470> it's<00:06:55.070> on<00:06:55.419> is

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
speed on indication that it's on is

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.270 
speed on indication that it's on is
first<00:06:56.720> of<00:06:56.870> all<00:06:56.960> the<00:06:57.139> LED<00:06:57.500> which<00:06:57.770> I'll<00:06:57.949> turn<00:06:58.160> on

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
first of all the LED which I'll turn on

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.700 
first of all the LED which I'll turn on
right<00:06:58.460> now<00:06:58.699> you<00:06:59.600> flip<00:06:59.840> that<00:06:59.990> to<00:07:00.139> the<00:07:00.229> left<00:07:00.440> and

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710 
right now you flip that to the left and

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.640 
right now you flip that to the left and
it's<00:07:01.130> on<00:07:01.400> it<00:07:01.729> has<00:07:02.030> also<00:07:02.419> letters<00:07:03.289> there<00:07:03.470> that

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
it's on it has also letters there that

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.860 
it's on it has also letters there that
tell<00:07:03.800> you<00:07:03.889> that<00:07:03.919> it's<00:07:04.100> on<00:07:04.419> but<00:07:05.419> you<00:07:05.539> can<00:07:05.690> also

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
tell you that it's on but you can also

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.540 
tell you that it's on but you can also
feel<00:07:06.199> the<00:07:06.350> hard<00:07:06.530> drive<00:07:06.710> spinning<00:07:07.039> if<00:07:07.310> you<00:07:07.430> have

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
feel the hard drive spinning if you have
