00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.370
 Hi, hello, folks, folks, today we are.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.309

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:15.049
 In the middle of dealing with you love me one people

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.800
 arrives at the school now has eaten so much 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.860
 people and I'm going to call them good wine 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.040
 site ta us for light lines because 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.620
 light ground beef dumplings first is 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.040
 I'll show you prepared here for you. 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.740
 The mixture is left to a more or less 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.680
 50 grams of prime beef 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:44.110
 here or sharing is fat free 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.960
 no advantage for it is light and 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:52.190
 It is here he gave more or less than 1 2 3 4 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.930
 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 the 12 cookies here I think 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.630
 which yields the 36 plus I made some 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.540
 cookies well accompanied by people well 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.670
 topping is to see how you did 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.710
 Here let people prepare for 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.280
 show you and how it did not fit all 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.659
 in a refractory I put it here 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.920
 quickie to people that I think is 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.439
 It took a long time and a lot of video and I 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.780
 do show it like that to you I got it 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.429
 that same job here or I started 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.740
 firstly another smaller size but 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:22.219
 did not work very well and I put two eggs 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.499
 two eggs here the 500 grams of meat 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:28.100
 ground putting all of us know 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:30.799
 beautiful ground beef is zucchini 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.990
 I cut anxiously in half of the 500 grams 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.560
 I think it 's enough 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.450
 I got all this from the mincemeat, I did. 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.459
 so these sizes here but I think 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.509
 that you can decrease or even roll 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:47.090
 it okay 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:49.729
 you can also use it is grated carrot 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.679
 and everything capriche in the onion that I adore 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.679
 everything with lots of onion walking 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.859
 I used dehydrated chives but can use 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.959
 chives and natura that I mark the bruna 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.079
 already stole another cookie to do 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:06.679
 in silva stole three Guris we are 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.920
 returning here the 509 km of the two eggs 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.329
 I was putting on a simulator too. 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.500
 I chopped the onion 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:16.070
 I returned the chives 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.390
 the line is salt to taste cumin I used 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.670
 I'm really enjoying the cumin 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.730
 lately but the seasoning is 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.290
 criterion rather little salt pepper that 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.300
 is not to retain liquid are the people 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.870
 so the pepper will help yes 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.340
 to give a bad temper well well avoid it 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.959
 Putting too much so you're not holding back. 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.840
 Net tage and more I'll have 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.000
 What is it and what do I do to finish it? 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.040
 I made to mix I mixed with spoon 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.989
 spoon that I used just to get the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.690
 Cookie and knead in hand 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:52.100
 What I did I did not use flour 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:55.520
 wheat with the friend I used is the bran of 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.739
 I have not used the oat bran we will 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.739
 to have that is great works very well 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.470
 with the gut and the super super right 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.260
 of the league and the same with the hand 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.660
 properly sanitized people I went 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.120
 kneading all this here is a sandro 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.530
 left doing doing so with his hands 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.330
 He got a very good league, it 's after 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.030
 So I thought it cool and put a 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.610
 olive oil despite the fact that 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.209
 the olive oil at a temperature 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.760
 very high to greater than 80 degrees 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.709
 it already loses much of its nutrients and 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.299
 wasteful friend but even so I 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.230
 I used it because I'm addicted to olive oil. 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:38.600
 Olive and I put a spoon so devastates 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.030
 what the margarine people are light is 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.100
 Yes I thought better after landing 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.620
 use year to fight sticking that he does not 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.709
 guilt in the hand, if you do not 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.989
 now it 's after that I just me 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.100
 I do not have a refractory. 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.780
 I took the spoon there so I made the massey 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.290
 it was a shadow that was not changing a 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.180
 Your cardiff's ass is your cookie. 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.590
 I put it here in the refractory as you 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.780
 See here 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.480
 you do not have to put it apart from the other 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.360
 not 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.650
 and then I came back in the oven people renders 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.810
 very 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.780
 Now I'm going to eat a sweet potato and 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.120
 This is the recipe I invented. 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.660
 the people I like in my head I 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.230
 was 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.670
 and in the afternoon play without having lunch the monster 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.990
 instance said 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.690
 I'll get that meat and money. 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.170
 First of all, I paid dearly for $ 25 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.060
 one pound and 400 I found a lot of people 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.130
 but if you do not have lamb first 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.960
 You can use the same girl walks alone. 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.520
 that it will contain fat then cookie 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.100
 It will not be so light, we are. 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.500
 so this is any doubt of you 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.640
 to tie up reminding us I voted here 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.850
 the cookies and then left for 35 to 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:58.040
 45 minutes at 200 degrees in the oven 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:02.480
 okay if put in the microwave just who will 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:05.960
 recycle more and I did it in my forninho 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.280
 Here it is in this oven. 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.750
 It's not on what I'm going to do. 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.850
 rest of the cookies that you are 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.860

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.170

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.590
 Light tips there for you 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.400

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.400
