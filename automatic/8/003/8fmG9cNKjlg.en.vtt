hi<00:00:00.780> my<00:00:00.989> name<00:00:01.110> is<00:00:01.140> Joe<00:00:01.319> humans<00:00:01.680> and<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:01.890> am<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.070> sort

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hi my name is Joe humans and I am a sort

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.010 
hi my name is Joe humans and I am a sort
of<00:00:02.490> sleeper<00:00:02.820> and<00:00:03.120> today<00:00:03.480> we<00:00:03.659> can<00:00:03.750> look<00:00:03.929> at

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
of sleeper and today we can look at

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.599 
of sleeper and today we can look at
testing<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.470> peripheral<00:00:04.859> nerves<00:00:05.040> but

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
testing the peripheral nerves but

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.610 
testing the peripheral nerves but
originated<00:00:06.180> from<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.450> breaker<00:00:06.750> plexus<00:00:07.290> between

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
originated from a breaker plexus between

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.490 
originated from a breaker plexus between
c5<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.400> t1<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.660> were<00:00:09.780> first<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.139> all<00:00:10.260> over

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
c5 and t1 we were first of all over

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.209 
c5 and t1 we were first of all over
regular<00:00:11.190> which<00:00:11.460> comes<00:00:11.670> from<00:00:11.820> c5<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.509> t1<00:00:12.929> and

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
regular which comes from c5 to t1 and

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.220 
regular which comes from c5 to t1 and
typically<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.820> gives<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.269> power<00:00:15.540> for<00:00:15.750> wrist

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
typically this gives you power for wrist

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.140 
typically this gives you power for wrist
extension<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.250> test<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.609> power<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
extension so we can test the power of a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.359 
extension so we can test the power of a
regular<00:00:18.690> by<00:00:18.930> extending<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> wrist<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:20.340> so

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
regular by extending the wrist like so

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.730 
regular by extending the wrist like so
we<00:00:21.090> can<00:00:21.240> also<00:00:21.390> ask<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.840> patient<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.289> push<00:00:22.529> up

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
we can also ask the patient to push up

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.450 
we can also ask the patient to push up
on<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> forex<00:00:24.350> so<00:00:25.350> by<00:00:25.619> activating<00:00:26.099> the
