00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
pounds and what were their profits when

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.260 
pounds and what were their profits when
you<00:02:06.780> join<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> company<00:02:07.320> when<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> became<00:02:08.729> chief

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
you join the company when I became chief

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.859 
you join the company when I became chief

executive and share
two<00:02:11.200> years<00:02:11.440> before<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:11.920> they<00:02:12.640> were<00:02:12.700> 2.8

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
two years before that they were 2.8

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.780 
two years before that they were 2.8
billion<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:17.170> effect<00:02:17.500> in<00:02:17.739> just<00:02:17.950> over<00:02:18.069> two

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
billion so in effect in just over two

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.170 
billion so in effect in just over two
years<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:19.720> lost<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.349> company<00:02:20.970> two<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.120> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
years you lost the company two and a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.170 
years you lost the company two and a
half<00:02:22.330> billion<00:02:22.750> parts<00:02:23.790> well<00:02:24.790> I'm<00:02:24.940> not<00:02:25.030> very

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
half billion parts well I'm not very

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.570 
half billion parts well I'm not very
good<00:02:25.330> at<00:02:25.420> figures<00:02:25.690> but<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.580> probably

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
good at figures but it probably

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.160 
good at figures but it probably
something<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.060> order<00:02:28.209> but<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:28.690> did<00:02:28.930> make<00:02:29.110> a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
something of that order but I did make a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.630 
something of that order but I did make a
difference<00:02:30.420> yes<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:31.930> some<00:02:32.470> some<00:02:32.980> senses<00:02:33.430> yeah

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
difference yes in some some senses yeah

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.240 
difference yes in some some senses yeah
yeah<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.870> then<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.319> course<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.800> were<00:02:35.980> asked

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
yeah and then of course you were asked

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.780 
yeah and then of course you were asked

perhaps<00:06:51.390> the<00:06:52.390> government<00:06:52.900> who<00:06:53.050> are

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
perhaps the government who are

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.460 
perhaps the government who are
notoriously<00:06:53.740> anti<00:06:54.430> rail<00:06:54.670> hmm<00:06:55.390> headhunted<00:06:56.200> you

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
notoriously anti rail hmm headhunted you

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.240 
notoriously anti rail hmm headhunted you
because<00:06:56.980> of<00:06:57.100> your<00:06:57.250> track<00:06:58.000> record<00:06:58.480> hmm<00:06:59.250> and

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250 
because of your track record hmm and

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.740 
because of your track record hmm and
thought<00:07:00.760> that<00:07:01.000> if<00:07:01.090> they<00:07:01.240> left<00:07:01.450> you<00:07:01.600> in<00:07:01.720> charge

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
thought that if they left you in charge

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.170 
thought that if they left you in charge
of<00:07:02.230> it<00:07:02.380> the<00:07:02.860> railway<00:07:03.520> system<00:07:03.790> would

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
of it the railway system would

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.210 
of it the railway system would
eventually<00:07:04.390> come<00:07:04.660> to<00:07:04.780> its<00:07:04.930> knees<00:07:05.110> and<00:07:06.040> then

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220 
eventually come to its knees and then

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.890 
eventually come to its knees and then
they<00:07:06.370> could<00:07:06.550> say<00:07:06.760> we<00:07:07.150> can't<00:07:07.360> go<00:07:07.480> on<00:07:07.570> pouring

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
they could say we can't go on pouring

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.630 
they could say we can't go on pouring
money<00:07:07.990> into<00:07:08.140> this<00:07:08.470> it's<00:07:08.740> not<00:07:08.920> working<00:07:09.460> and

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:09.640 
money into this it's not working and

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.750 
money into this it's not working and
then<00:07:10.360> they<00:07:10.540> could<00:07:10.750> sell<00:07:11.740> off<00:07:11.890> the<00:07:12.100> assets<00:07:12.430> the

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760 
then they could sell off the assets the

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.520 
then they could sell off the assets the
land<00:07:12.970> the<00:07:13.240> stations<00:07:13.750> and<00:07:14.050> everything<00:07:14.380> else

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
land the stations and everything else

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.710 
land the stations and everything else
for<00:07:14.950> a<00:07:14.980> knockdown<00:07:15.460> price<00:07:15.940> of<00:07:16.240> a<00:07:16.300> few<00:07:16.330> billion

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 
for a knockdown price of a few billion

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.470 
for a knockdown price of a few billion
pounds<00:07:17.290> and<00:07:17.440> then<00:07:17.560> and<00:07:18.220> add<00:07:18.550> some<00:07:18.850> tax<00:07:19.150> cuts

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480 
pounds and then and add some tax cuts

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.860 
pounds and then and add some tax cuts

with the bishops yes I suppose that's

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.010 
with the bishops yes I suppose that's
possible<00:07:23.760> yes<00:07:24.760> but<00:07:25.360> I<00:07:25.480> don't<00:07:25.540> think<00:07:25.720> there's

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.020 
possible yes but I don't think there's

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.980 
possible yes but I don't think there's
ever<00:07:26.380> that<00:07:28.260> bottom<00:07:29.260> thank<00:07:29.470> you<00:07:29.560> very<00:07:29.800> much
