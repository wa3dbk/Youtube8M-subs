00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
good morning this is Dwayne and today

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.539 
good morning this is Dwayne and today
I'd<00:00:02.399> like<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.610> talk<00:00:02.879> about<00:00:03.090> suspensions

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:04.549 
I'd like to talk about suspensions

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.889 
I'd like to talk about suspensions
there's<00:00:05.549> several<00:00:05.790> kinds<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.240> suspensions<00:00:06.779> but

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
there's several kinds of suspensions but

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.150 
there's several kinds of suspensions but
the<00:00:07.020> one<00:00:07.140> we're<00:00:07.290> going<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.500> talk<00:00:07.620> about<00:00:07.649> today

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
the one we're going to talk about today

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.120 
the one we're going to talk about today
and<00:00:08.820> what<00:00:09.150> musicians<00:00:09.690> generally<00:00:10.110> pharmacists

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
and what musicians generally pharmacists

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.980 
and what musicians generally pharmacists
I<00:00:11.160> refer<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.730> as<00:00:12.000> suspension<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.660> where<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
I refer to as suspension is where the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.010 
I refer to as suspension is where the
fourth<00:00:13.400> in<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.639> chord<00:00:15.179> takes<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> place<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
fourth in a chord takes the place of the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.279 
fourth in a chord takes the place of the
third<00:00:16.289> for<00:00:17.100> example<00:00:17.490> here's<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.730> F<00:00:17.940> chord<00:00:18.289> so

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
third for example here's the F chord so

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.769 
third for example here's the F chord so
if<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.500> had<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> suspension<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> third<00:00:21.570> I

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
if I had a suspension this is a third I

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.400 
if I had a suspension this is a third I
use<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> fourth<00:00:22.710> instead<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.400> that's<00:00:23.580> an<00:00:23.789> F

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
use a fourth instead so that's an F

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.380 
use a fourth instead so that's an F
suspension<00:00:25.439> okay<00:00:25.710> now<00:00:26.490> suspensions<00:00:27.210> are

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
suspension okay now suspensions are

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.419 
suspension okay now suspensions are
usually<00:00:27.840> combined<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.529> seventh<00:00:28.890> chords<00:00:29.250> so

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
usually combined with seventh chords so

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.319 
usually combined with seventh chords so
you<00:00:29.460> usually<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> an<00:00:30.779> F<00:00:31.080> 7th<00:00:31.610> a<00:00:32.610> sus<00:00:33.120> would

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
you usually have it an F 7th a sus would

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.180 
you usually have it an F 7th a sus would
be<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.200> saw<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.440> notation

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
be like that so if you saw that notation

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.209 
be like that so if you saw that notation
F<00:00:35.430> sus<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.380> would<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:37.890> what

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
F sus that was that would be what what

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:38.660 
F sus that was that would be what what
it<00:00:38.340> means

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it means

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.270 
it means
don't<00:00:39.120> play<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> 3rd<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:39.930> play<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> 4th<00:00:40.980> in

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
don't play the 3rd but play the 4th in

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.660 
don't play the 3rd but play the 4th in
place<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> 3rd<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.829> 7th<00:00:44.219> you

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
place of the 3rd and then the 7th you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.549 
place of the 3rd and then the 7th you
play<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> fifth<00:00:45.180> two<00:00:45.390> words<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:48.379> quite<00:00:49.379> often

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
play the fifth two words and quite often

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.060 
play the fifth two words and quite often
you<00:00:49.770> can<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.460> harmonize<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.059> fourth<00:00:52.070> by

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you can you can harmonize that fourth by

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.520 
you can you can harmonize that fourth by
putting<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:54.270> second<00:00:54.719> under<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.410> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
putting the second under it then you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.549 
putting the second under it then you
have<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> kind<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.129> complex<00:00:56.930> like<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.199> kind

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
have a kind of a complex like that kind

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.260 
have a kind of a complex like that kind
of<00:00:58.789> complex<00:00:59.789> chord<00:01:00.859> suspension<00:01:02.270> suspensions

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
of complex chord suspension suspensions

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.679 
of complex chord suspension suspensions
are<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> wonderful<00:01:03.870> animal<00:01:05.450> because<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.570> can

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
are a wonderful animal because you can

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.830 
are a wonderful animal because you can
use<00:01:06.900> them<00:01:07.340> not<00:01:08.340> only<00:01:08.580> by<00:01:09.060> themselves<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.689> also

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
use them not only by themselves but also

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350 
use them not only by themselves but also
to<00:01:10.049> resolve<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.250> seventh<00:01:11.729> chord<00:01:11.939> ok

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
to resolve to the seventh chord ok

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.630 
to resolve to the seventh chord ok
let<00:01:12.630> me<00:01:12.750> give<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.229> an<00:01:13.380> example<00:01:13.710> let's<00:01:14.520> say

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
let me give you an example let's say

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.380 
let me give you an example let's say
you're<00:01:14.790> playing<00:01:14.820> misty<00:01:19.580> that's<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.759> major<00:01:20.939> 7th

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
you're playing misty that's a major 7th

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.630 
you're playing misty that's a major 7th
that's<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.260> suspension<00:01:24.860> right<00:01:25.070> there<00:01:25.310> you

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
that's the suspension right there you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.240 
that's the suspension right there you
see<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.000> court<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.960> court<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.320> C<00:01:27.500> 7th<00:01:27.950> but<00:01:28.130> I'm

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
see the court the court is C 7th but I'm

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.750 
see the court the court is C 7th but I'm
using<00:01:29.080> F<00:01:30.080> instead<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.650> the<00:01:30.740> e<00:01:30.770> here<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.460> I'm

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
using F instead of the e here and I'm

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.070 
using F instead of the e here and I'm
harmonizing<00:01:32.450> with<00:01:32.480> with<00:01:33.440> with<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.010> D<00:01:35.080> let's

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
harmonizing with with with the D let's

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:44.770 
harmonizing with with with the D let's
take<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:36.410> far

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.210 

now<00:01:45.350> I<00:01:45.380> resolve<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:45.950> there

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
now I resolve it there

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.750 
now I resolve it there
that's<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.970> suspension<00:01:51.050> resolution<00:01:52.050> you<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.380> I

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
that's a suspension resolution you see I

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.520 
that's a suspension resolution you see I
I<00:01:53.790> had<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.300> fourth<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.900> I<00:01:54.930> moved<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.410> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
I had the fourth but I moved to the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.510 
I had the fourth but I moved to the
third<00:01:55.560> once<00:01:56.340> more

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:12.440 

Shh<00:02:02.540> that<00:02:03.079> was<00:02:03.200> lovey

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.440 

you<00:02:13.440> see<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.770> okay<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.879> simply<00:02:15.180> where

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
you see that okay so it's simply where

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.630 
you see that okay so it's simply where
the<00:02:15.629> fourth<00:02:15.930> tip<00:02:16.560> takes<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.160> place<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the fourth tip takes the place of the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.729 
the fourth tip takes the place of the
third<00:02:17.910> sometimes<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:19.080> use<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.410> right<00:02:19.620> at

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
third sometimes you can use it right at

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.040 
third sometimes you can use it right at
the<00:02:19.800> beginning<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.370> song<00:02:20.580> like<00:02:21.050> here

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050

the beginning of a song like here
there's<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.709> song<00:02:22.890> called<00:02:23.069> here's<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.430> rainy

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.670 

there's<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.450> suspension<00:02:36.900> right<00:02:37.200> there<00:02:37.470> I'm

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680

there's a suspension right there I'm
playing<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.370> c7<00:02:39.180> but<00:02:39.660> I'm<00:02:39.810> using<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.200> fourth

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
playing a c7 but I'm using a fourth

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.790 
playing a c7 but I'm using a fourth
instead<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.950> third<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.440> make<00:02:43.650> it

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
instead of the third and to make it

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.120 
instead of the third and to make it
sound<00:02:43.980> even<00:02:44.160> four<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:44.580> just<00:02:45.000> used<00:02:45.240> G<00:02:45.510> as<00:02:45.660> ilona

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
sound even four I just used G as ilona

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.280 
sound even four I just used G as ilona
so<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.280> essence<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:47.940> it's<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.600> G<00:02:49.050> minor

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
so in essence it's it's a G minor

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.670 
so in essence it's it's a G minor
seventh<00:02:49.800> but<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:51.390> then<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.780> resolve<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.380> C

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
seventh but and then you resolve it to C

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.540 
seventh but and then you resolve it to C
seventh<00:02:53.130> before<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.610> go<00:02:53.760> on

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.150 

okay<00:02:58.550> how<00:02:59.450> about<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.110> ham<00:03:00.650> let's<00:03:00.860> take<00:03:00.980> what

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
okay how about in a ham let's take what

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.340 
okay how about in a ham let's take what
a<00:03:01.190> friend<00:03:01.400> we<00:03:01.520> have<00:03:01.550> in<00:03:01.700> Jesus<00:03:01.900> if<00:03:02.900> we're<00:03:03.230> in

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
a friend we have in Jesus if we're in

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.430 
a friend we have in Jesus if we're in
the<00:03:03.440> key<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.650> F<00:03:05.050> how<00:03:06.050> would<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.290> make

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
the key of F how would you make

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.420 
the key of F how would you make
suspension<00:03:07.130> there

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
suspension there

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.790 
suspension there
that's<00:03:08.420> right<00:03:08.720> replace<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.290> third<00:03:09.530> with<00:03:09.770> the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
that's right replace the third with the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.790 
that's right replace the third with the
fourth<00:03:10.630> harmonize<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.840> with<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.140> second<00:03:12.620> and

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
fourth harmonize it with the second and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.370 
fourth harmonize it with the second and
you<00:03:13.490> get<00:03:13.640> out<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:14.030> seventh<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:14.660> we<00:03:14.959> can<00:03:15.110> start

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
you get out of seventh so we can start

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:28.730 
you get out of seventh so we can start
what<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.740> friend<00:03:15.980> we<00:03:16.070> have<00:03:16.100> in<00:03:16.220> Jesus<00:03:16.310> like<00:03:16.610> this

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.180 

that's<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.430> suspension<00:03:30.120> resolution<00:03:31.190> see

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
that's the suspension resolution see

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.550 
that's the suspension resolution see
that<00:03:32.940> sassy<00:03:33.240> 7th<00:03:33.600> chord<00:03:33.810> but<00:03:33.990> I'm<00:03:34.080> playing<00:03:34.290> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
that sassy 7th chord but I'm playing the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.220 
that sassy 7th chord but I'm playing the
4th<00:03:34.860> set<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.370> 3rd<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.960> harmonizing<00:03:36.960> it

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
4th set of the 3rd and harmonizing it

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.350 
4th set of the 3rd and harmonizing it
with<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:39.450> 2nd<00:03:39.840> there<00:03:40.020> or<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.470> 9th<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:42.120> then<00:03:42.300> I

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
with the 2nd there or the 9th and then I

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.400 
with the 2nd there or the 9th and then I
resolve<00:03:42.930> it

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:58.170 

that's<00:03:46.410> another<00:03:46.680> suspension

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.730 

or<00:03:59.180> we<00:03:59.420> could<00:03:59.599> enter<00:03:59.870> with<00:04:00.019> it

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.620 

that's<00:04:07.740> the<00:04:07.920> suspension<00:04:08.580> because<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.420> force

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
that's the suspension because the force

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.000 
that's the suspension because the force
taking<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.930> place<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.320> third<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.800> then<00:04:10.920> I

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
taking the place to the third and then I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.680 
taking the place to the third and then I
resolve<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.520> so<00:04:11.640> it's<00:04:11.760> kind<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:11.970> it's<00:04:12.450> kind<00:04:12.660> of

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
resolve it so it's kind of it's kind of

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.760 
resolve it so it's kind of it's kind of
like<00:04:12.900> an<00:04:13.020> amen

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
like an amen

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.580 
like an amen
Kate<00:04:14.310> it's<00:04:14.490> the<00:04:14.610> play<00:04:14.790> goal<00:04:14.970> cadence<00:04:15.420> but<00:04:16.110> it's

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
Kate it's the play goal cadence but it's

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.470 
Kate it's the play goal cadence but it's
not<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.830> full<00:04:17.100> play<00:04:17.310> group<00:04:17.489> cadence<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.000> just<00:04:18.239> is

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
not a full play group cadence it just is

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.979 
not a full play group cadence it just is
a<00:04:18.510> suspension<00:04:19.340> resolving<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.580> the<00:04:20.730> third<00:04:21.000> okay

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
a suspension resolving to the third okay

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.900 
a suspension resolving to the third okay
so<00:04:22.740> that's<00:04:22.950> really<00:04:23.130> all<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.460> need<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.730> know

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
so that's really all you need to know

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.530 
so that's really all you need to know
about<00:04:24.110> suspensions<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.320> just<00:04:25.500> need<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.800> find

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
about suspensions you just need to find

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.180 
about suspensions you just need to find
places<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.810> use<00:04:27.840> them<00:04:28.080> any<00:04:28.410> anytime<00:04:28.980> you<00:04:29.100> have

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
places to use them any anytime you have

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.460 
places to use them any anytime you have
a<00:04:29.250> dominant<00:04:29.670> seventh<00:04:30.030> chord<00:04:30.330> then<00:04:31.080> you<00:04:31.290> can

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
a dominant seventh chord then you can

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.410 
a dominant seventh chord then you can
probably<00:04:31.830> use<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.460> suspension<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.180> kind<00:04:33.390> of

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
probably use the suspension it kind of

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.060 
probably use the suspension it kind of
it<00:04:33.630> depends<00:04:33.990> on<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.140> melody<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.500> course<00:04:34.800> but

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
it depends on the melody of course but

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.790 
it depends on the melody of course but
most<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.730> time<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.120> can<00:04:36.300> do<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.620> so<00:04:37.620> let's

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
most of the time you can do it so let's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.260 
most of the time you can do it so let's
play<00:04:37.980> through<00:04:38.250> some<00:04:38.310> chords<00:04:38.850> and<00:04:38.940> figure<00:04:39.180> out

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
play through some chords and figure out

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.670 
play through some chords and figure out
what<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.480> suspensions<00:04:40.140> are<00:04:40.410> for<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.310> C<00:04:41.700> chord

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
what the suspensions are for a C chord

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.980 
what the suspensions are for a C chord
that<00:04:43.680> would<00:04:43.890> be<00:04:43.980> a<00:04:44.010> suspension<00:04:44.730> for<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.330> C<00:04:45.570> 7th

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
that would be a suspension for a C 7th

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.160 
that would be a suspension for a C 7th
chord<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:46.860> would<00:04:46.980> be<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.130> c7<00:04:47.730> suspension<00:04:48.420> and

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
chord that would be a c7 suspension and

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.660 
chord that would be a c7 suspension and
remember<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.740> can<00:04:49.860> harmonize<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.430> if<00:04:50.550> you

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
remember you can harmonize it if you

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.260 
remember you can harmonize it if you
want<00:04:50.880> okay

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
want okay

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.460 
want okay
