00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.700
 today 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.589
 Once again irritating both action and pride that the owner 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.959
 their doctors called losing on the contrary, but I'm sure 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.259
 is now announcing that he is himself 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.269
 Michael is open b and that's why 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.569
 start mystical for the first time 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.960
 we catch very slowly 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.869
 with the electorate will 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.390
 followed by something 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.390
 Alright 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.239
 but all that has been done has been done by the Islamic countries 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.610
 but that was not the case 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.610
 Of course that's also parents because it is unnecessary here now 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.370
 and therefore 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.860
 Start number the lifts go out snow bothered 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.420
 front 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.330
 Get started in December 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
 Year's winner already much better 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.770
 the manager 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.770
 a simple one way or the other easy to tax 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.340
 her theory always given 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.340
 unfortunately no more electricity 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.829
 Why 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.709
 Of course we also have sometime each year we have to be very accurate 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.580
 above and below 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.899
 more under 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.110
 to be done somewhere » 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.070
 at the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.070
 the Google 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.390
 the means 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.390
 No 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.640
 and one or the other camera settings 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.640
 we had to see what it looks like 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
 the abbot of the pen and fruit 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.149
 "If we do not act 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.009
 &amp; Cie after that should be the manager 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.499
 I did not know yet 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.659
 the situation in Japan continuously 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.519
 So what should stay 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.049
 yes i can not officially see not only now in the situation in the city 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.529
 never seen before 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.529
 who wants everything to go so well 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.399
 Lenovo does not want to lose on both the water again 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:47.420
 okay I can do that 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.440
 the little Lyons failed because of the owner 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.090
 "We can not say anything about that, but I can say that it's a" to the end 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.090
 of the month » 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.179
 Millions saw taxation in Gaza City 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.200
 especially tense the situation much more difficult 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.480

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.140
 and 4 that was so far percent 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.340
 I think I do not like this Werner about the building yard 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.409
 unless 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.269

 that was super compensate for their favorite 2 percent of all 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.839
 prescribed percent 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.339
 be perfect 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:42.480
 because there are very many ways to search over time 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.079
 get that way 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.729
 Bank data the critical mass 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:48.499
