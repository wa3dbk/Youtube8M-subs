00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.370 
and has a clicking mechanism this one is
completely<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.910> opposite<00:02:22.330> well<00:02:22.900> in<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
completely the opposite well in the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.350 
completely the opposite well in the
place<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:23.800> bought<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.190> for<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.610> bought<00:02:25.210> this

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
place that I bought it for I bought this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.960 
place that I bought it for I bought this
one<00:02:25.570> from<00:02:25.780> puzzled<00:02:26.200> aqua<00:02:26.470> dot<00:02:26.650> u<00:02:26.770> K<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.220> this

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
one from puzzled aqua dot u K and this

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.690 
one from puzzled aqua dot u K and this
one<00:02:28.210> has<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:28.590> been<00:02:29.590> broken<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.190> broken<00:02:30.520> in

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
one has like been broken it broken in

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.730 
one has like been broken it broken in
very<00:02:30.910> well<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:31.570> it's<00:02:31.690> very<00:02:31.840> loose<00:02:32.110> but<00:02:32.350> in

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
very well so it's very loose but in

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.560 
very well so it's very loose but in
other<00:02:33.070> videos<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.640> think<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.270> they<00:02:34.360> can<00:02:34.480> be

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
other videos I think that they can be

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.060 
other videos I think that they can be
quite<00:02:34.750> tight<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:37.570> this<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.230> comparison

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
quite tight but and this is a comparison

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.620 
quite tight but and this is a comparison
between<00:02:39.310> my<00:02:39.610> two<00:02:39.790> experiences

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
between my two experiences

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.460 
between my two experiences
estheban<00:02:41.140> mosey<00:02:42.100> down<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.510> one<00:02:43.750> doesn't

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
estheban mosey down so this one doesn't

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.980 
estheban mosey down so this one doesn't
have<00:02:44.560> taking<00:02:44.920> my<00:02:45.010> things<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.340> at<00:02:45.430> all<00:02:45.990> very

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
have taking my things in at all very

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.290 
have taking my things in at all very
very<00:02:48.240> not<00:02:49.240> necessarily<00:02:49.690> loose<00:02:49.960> just<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:51.300> don't

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
very not necessarily loose just I don't

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.950 
very not necessarily loose just I don't
know<00:02:52.480> it's<00:02:52.840> just<00:02:53.640> easier<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.670> turn<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.420> naked

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
know it's just easier to turn so naked

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.160 
know it's just easier to turn so naked
there's<00:02:56.260> no<00:02:56.380> cooking<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.920> easy<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:58.170> stop

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
there's no cooking that easy to stop

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.430 
there's no cooking that easy to stop
that<00:02:59.290> overturn<00:02:59.770> anything<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:01.060> I

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that overturn anything like that so I

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.670 
that overturn anything like that so I
like<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:03.090> but<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.240> course<00:03:04.540> with<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.020> mechanism

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
like it but of course with the mechanism

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.250 
like it but of course with the mechanism
being<00:03:06.100> how<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.460> is<00:03:06.610> this<00:03:07.090> puzzle<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.930> very

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
being how it is this puzzle is very

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.070 
being how it is this puzzle is very
vulnerable<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:09.130> popping<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:10.060> lot<00:03:10.720> because<00:03:10.840> it

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
vulnerable to popping a lot because it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.740 
vulnerable to popping a lot because it
can<00:03:11.260> cut<00:03:11.890> forms<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.400> little<00:03:12.640> bit<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.540> can

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
can cut forms a little bit and it can

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.960 
can cut forms a little bit and it can
break<00:03:14.050> many<00:03:14.590> people<00:03:14.920> have<00:03:15.100> had<00:03:15.280> their<00:03:15.520> paws

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
break many people have had their paws

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.510 
break many people have had their paws
break<00:03:16.360> when<00:03:17.260> they<00:03:17.500> like<00:03:17.800> try<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.040> lubricate

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
break when they like try and lubricate

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.360 
break when they like try and lubricate
it<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:19.230> therefore<00:03:20.230> just<00:03:20.530> come<00:03:20.710> so<00:03:20.920> losing<00:03:21.220> it

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
it and therefore just come so losing it

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.140 
it and therefore just come so losing it
falls<00:03:21.580> apart<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:23.280> yeah<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.580> powder<00:03:24.880> will

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
falls apart so yeah this powder will

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.700 
falls apart so yeah this powder will
also<00:03:25.360> really<00:03:25.690> annoying<00:03:25.990> to<00:03:26.230> reassemble

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
also really annoying to reassemble

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.060 
also really annoying to reassemble
because<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.670> core<00:03:27.850> is<00:03:27.880> so<00:03:28.120> loose

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
because the core is so loose

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.440 
because the core is so loose
alright<00:03:30.070> so<00:03:30.280> onto<00:03:30.430> now<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.120> corner

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
alright so onto now is the corner

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.480 
alright so onto now is the corner
cutting<00:03:31.660> now<00:03:32.170> as<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.590> just<00:03:32.800> said<00:03:32.950> this<00:03:33.130> pot<00:03:33.340> of

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
cutting now as I just said this pot of

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.270 
cutting now as I just said this pot of
hand<00:03:33.700> cut<00:03:33.880> corners<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.510> moji<00:03:34.690> done<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:36.100> bit

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
hand cut corners the moji done just bit

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.520 
hand cut corners the moji done just bit
a<00:03:36.310> little<00:03:36.400> bit<00:03:36.550> but<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:40.150> cuts<00:03:40.690> corners<00:03:41.110> well

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
a little bit but it cuts corners well

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.550 
a little bit but it cuts corners well
for<00:03:41.740> what<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.190> I'd<00:03:43.090> say<00:03:43.980> another<00:03:44.980> Scoob

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
for what it is I'd say another Scoob

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.370 
for what it is I'd say another Scoob
still<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.620> could<00:03:47.800> cut<00:03:48.010> corners<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.460> little<00:03:48.580> bit

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
still I could cut corners a little bit

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.430 
still I could cut corners a little bit
don't<00:03:50.380> want<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.680> pop<00:03:50.920> but<00:03:51.990> go<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.000> can

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
don't want to pop but go so that it can

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.210 
don't want to pop but go so that it can
cut<00:03:56.440> corners<00:03:56.890> just<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.760> little<00:03:58.030> bit<00:03:59.220> but

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
cut corners just a little bit but

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.710 
cut corners just a little bit but
because<00:04:00.520> of<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.730> way<00:04:00.820> you<00:04:00.880> use<00:04:01.090> clear<00:04:01.480> with<00:04:01.600> it

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
because of the way you use clear with it

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.020 
because of the way you use clear with it
you<00:04:01.840> just<00:04:01.870> move<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.740> completely<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.820> end<00:04:03.940> of

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
you just move it completely the end of

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.230 
you just move it completely the end of
Lionel's<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:04.840> that<00:04:05.520> so<00:04:06.520> now<00:04:06.670> to<00:04:06.730> tolerance

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
Lionel's like that so now to tolerance

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.460 
Lionel's like that so now to tolerance
like<00:04:07.540> I've<00:04:07.690> already<00:04:07.960> mentioned

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
like I've already mentioned

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.410 
like I've already mentioned
now<00:04:08.680> this<00:04:08.830> puzzle<00:04:09.190> is<00:04:09.370> vulnerable<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.060> popping

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
now this puzzle is vulnerable to popping

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.300 
now this puzzle is vulnerable to popping
so<00:04:10.810> they<00:04:10.870> can<00:04:11.080> pop<00:04:11.230> all<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.500> time<00:04:11.680> like<00:04:11.950> with

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
so they can pop all the time like with

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.550 
so they can pop all the time like with
my<00:04:12.550> skew<00:04:13.060> because<00:04:13.660> I've<00:04:13.810> stretched<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.350> core

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
my skew because I've stretched the core

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.500 
my skew because I've stretched the core
so<00:04:14.770> much<00:04:15.010> because<00:04:15.520> I<00:04:15.760> mixed<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.120> with<00:04:16.210> a<00:04:16.270> mozi

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
so much because I mixed it with a mozi

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.270 
so much because I mixed it with a mozi
diamond<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.109> this<00:04:17.590> cause<00:04:17.830> bigger<00:04:18.100> than

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
diamond and this cause bigger than

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.370 
diamond and this cause bigger than
Scooby<00:04:18.760> stretched<00:04:19.210> the<00:04:19.480> core<00:04:19.660> out

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
Scooby stretched the core out

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.220 
Scooby stretched the core out
and<00:04:20.740> so<00:04:21.190> now<00:04:21.340> it's<00:04:21.490> very<00:04:21.700> loose<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.840> can<00:04:23.020> so

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
and so now it's very loose and it can so

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.140 
and so now it's very loose and it can so
easily<00:04:23.260> just<00:04:23.970> pop<00:04:24.970> out<00:04:25.270> I'll<00:04:25.720> show<00:04:25.960> you

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
easily just pop out I'll show you

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.560 
easily just pop out I'll show you
playing<00:04:28.150> around<00:04:28.270> with<00:04:31.920> your<00:04:32.920> eyes<00:04:33.040> pops<00:04:33.570> and
