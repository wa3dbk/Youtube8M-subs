00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
one theory at you I know you were at the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.750 
one theory at you I know you were at the
the<00:02:15.960> heat<00:02:16.170> game<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.590> game<00:02:16.740> seven<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:17.730> I

the heat game the game seven but I

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.060 
the heat game the game seven but I
watched<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.330> whole<00:02:18.510> pre<00:02:18.990> fight<00:02:19.290> when

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
watched the whole pre fight when

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.520 
watched the whole pre fight when
Pacquiao<00:02:20.880> disappeared<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> while<00:02:22.110> from

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
Pacquiao disappeared for a while from

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.900 
Pacquiao disappeared for a while from
his<00:02:22.620> dressing<00:02:22.980> room<00:02:23.250> because<00:02:23.700> he<00:02:23.880> was

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
his dressing room because he was

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.900 
his dressing room because he was
watching<00:02:24.240> his<00:02:24.990> Boston<00:02:25.410> Celtics<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.700> game

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
watching his Boston Celtics the game

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.850 
watching his Boston Celtics the game
went<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> little<00:02:27.390> later<00:02:27.600> than<00:02:27.870> he<00:02:28.050> expected

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
went a little later than he expected

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.400 
went a little later than he expected
then<00:02:29.310> he<00:02:29.730> needed<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> go<00:02:30.180> find<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.720> treadmill<00:02:31.050> to

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
then he needed to go find a treadmill to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.320 
then he needed to go find a treadmill to
warm<00:02:31.620> up<00:02:31.740> his<00:02:31.950> calves<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.670> bother<00:02:32.880> him<00:02:33.180> I

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
warm up his calves that bother him I

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.870 
warm up his calves that bother him I
think<00:02:34.110> maybe<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.620> judges<00:02:35.070> were<00:02:35.280> miffed<00:02:35.670> at

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
think maybe the judges were miffed at

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.850 
think maybe the judges were miffed at
him<00:02:36.090> for<00:02:36.300> holding<00:02:36.690> up<00:02:36.780> their<00:02:37.080> fight<00:02:37.470> their

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
him for holding up their fight their

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.550 
him for holding up their fight their
sports<00:02:38.220> event<00:02:38.580> for<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.330> long<00:02:39.570> that<00:02:39.900> maybe<00:02:40.320> they

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
sports event for so long that maybe they

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.770 
sports event for so long that maybe they
just<00:02:40.740> took<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.190> out<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.370> him<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:42.240> they<00:02:42.420> they

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
just took it out on him that they they

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.260 
just took it out on him that they they
judged<00:02:43.170> round<00:02:43.650> by<00:02:43.860> round<00:02:44.040> way<00:02:44.400> too<00:02:44.460> harshly

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
judged round by round way too harshly

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.090 
judged round by round way too harshly
that's<00:02:45.660> my<00:02:45.870> only<00:02:46.400> longshot<00:02:48.950> reason<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.040> I

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
that's my only longshot reason that I

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.980 
that's my only longshot reason that I
can<00:02:50.340> read<00:02:50.610> into<00:02:50.850> what<00:02:51.030> happened<00:02:51.630> on<00:02:51.750> Saturday

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
can read into what happened on Saturday

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.290 
can read into what happened on Saturday
night<00:02:52.380> because<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:53.160> rest<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> judging

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
night because the rest of the judging

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.860 
night because the rest of the judging
from<00:02:54.450> all<00:02:54.570> three<00:02:54.840> are<00:02:54.990> just<00:02:55.200> mystifying<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.010> me

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
from all three are just mystifying to me

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.780 
from all three are just mystifying to me
