of like signature 70s town then maybe

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.090 
of like signature 70s town then maybe
just<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.580> little<00:04:08.730> more<00:04:08.910> oomph<00:04:09.180> on<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.510> top<00:04:10.100> and

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
you you find some em simulation that's

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.580 
you you find some em simulation that's
kind<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:27.210> organic<00:04:27.810> sounding<00:04:28.290> so<00:04:28.440> to
