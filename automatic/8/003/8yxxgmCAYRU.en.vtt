00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
top of now I get enough height to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.840 
top of now I get enough height to
actually<00:01:23.780> walk<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.229> here<00:01:24.499> and<00:01:24.649> I'm<00:01:25.310> able<00:01:25.670> to

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
feet are right here so not all the way

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.469 
feet are right here so not all the way
to<00:01:30.979> the<00:01:31.039> middle<00:01:31.280> but<00:01:31.369> pretty<00:01:31.579> close<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.450> can

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
to the middle but pretty close and I can

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.270 
to the middle but pretty close and I can
definitely<00:01:33.079> even<00:01:33.590> step<00:01:33.859> all<00:01:33.979> your<00:01:34.100> hair<00:01:34.219> to

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
definitely even step all your hair to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.590 
definitely even step all your hair to
the<00:01:34.310> side<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.729> be<00:01:34.850> hunched<00:01:35.119> over<00:01:35.210> slightly

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
the side and be hunched over slightly

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.529 
the side and be hunched over slightly
with<00:01:36.259> not<00:01:36.409> much<00:01:36.590> problem<00:01:36.859> so<00:01:37.340> what<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:38.240> needed

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
with not much problem so what I needed

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.459 
with not much problem so what I needed
to<00:01:38.749> do<00:01:38.929> after<00:01:39.619> that<00:01:39.649> was<00:01:40.100> I<00:01:40.399> needed<00:01:40.789> to<00:01:41.469> mount

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
to do after that was I needed to mount

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.679 
to do after that was I needed to mount
these<00:01:42.619> top<00:01:42.979> boards<00:01:43.310> running<00:01:43.700> down<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.149> the

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
these top boards running down and the

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:45.999 
these top boards running down and the
problem<00:01:44.869> with<00:01:45.109> that<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.499> fact<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:45.859> if

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
problem with that is the fact that if

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.679 
problem with that is the fact that if
you<00:01:46.100> look<00:01:46.280> up<00:01:46.459> here<00:01:46.759> I'm<00:01:47.240> not<00:01:47.299> sure<00:01:47.389> it's<00:01:47.600> going

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
you look up here I'm not sure it's going

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:48.910 
you look up here I'm not sure it's going
to<00:01:47.810> show<00:01:47.929> up<00:01:48.049> or<00:01:48.139> not<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.380> can't<00:01:48.590> even<00:01:48.649> reach<00:01:48.889> it

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
to show up or not I can't even reach it

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.469 
to show up or not I can't even reach it
with<00:01:49.340> my<00:01:49.369> hand<00:01:49.729> I'm<00:01:49.909> going<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.090> get<00:01:50.209> a<00:01:50.240> step

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
with my hand I'm going to get a step

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.590 
with my hand I'm going to get a step
stool<00:01:50.509> out<00:01:50.810> but<00:01:51.850> what<00:01:52.850> I'm<00:01:52.969> doing<00:01:53.299> is<00:01:53.420> there's

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
stool out but what I'm doing is there's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.480 
stool out but what I'm doing is there's
not<00:01:53.719> much<00:01:53.990> room<00:01:54.439> up<00:01:54.530> there<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.950> nail<00:01:55.219> a<00:01:55.249> thing

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
not much room up there to nail a thing

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.160 
not much room up there to nail a thing
to<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:55.999> what<00:01:56.179> I<00:01:56.209> decided<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:56.749> was<00:01:56.840> going<00:01:56.959> to<00:01:57.049> do

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
to so what I decided I was going to do

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.999 
to so what I decided I was going to do
is<00:01:57.350> instead<00:01:57.679> is<00:01:57.950> take<00:01:58.639> another<00:01:59.030> 1<00:01:59.840> by<00:02:00.049> 4<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:00.950> I

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
is instead is take another 1 by 4 and I

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.129 
is instead is take another 1 by 4 and I
was<00:02:01.130> going<00:02:01.399> to<00:02:01.549> cut<00:02:01.939> it<00:02:02.090> now<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.719> lights<00:02:02.929> in<00:02:03.079> the

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:03.139 
was going to cut it now it lights in the

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:04.419 
was going to cut it now it lights in the
horrible<00:02:03.560> position<00:02:03.649> let's<00:02:04.039> see<00:02:04.159> if<00:02:04.249> I<00:02:04.310> can

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
horrible position let's see if I can

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.719 
horrible position let's see if I can
move<00:02:04.549> over<00:02:04.729> here<00:02:05.079> so<00:02:06.079> anyway<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.950> decided<00:02:07.490> to

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
move over here so anyway I decided to

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.270 
move over here so anyway I decided to
cut<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.240> board<00:02:08.450> at<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.959> 45<00:02:09.319> actually<00:02:10.160> it's

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
cut the board at that 45 actually it's

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.670 
cut the board at that 45 actually it's
about<00:02:10.340> 31<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.240> half<00:02:11.270> degrees<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.140> how<00:02:12.650> I

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
about 31 and a half degrees and how I

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.530 
about 31 and a half degrees and how I
came<00:02:12.830> up<00:02:13.040> with<00:02:13.099> that<00:02:13.400> is<00:02:13.549> I<00:02:13.580> actually<00:02:13.730> ran<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.360> I

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
came up with that is I actually ran it I

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.930 
came up with that is I actually ran it I
want<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.590> border<00:02:16.010> here<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.220> move<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.519> over

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
want a border here I move it over

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.870 
want a border here I move it over
and<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.660> ran<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:17.990> up<00:02:18.140> above<00:02:18.470> clearly<00:02:19.460> took<00:02:19.730> my

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
and I ran it up above clearly took my

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.120 
and I ran it up above clearly took my
pen<00:02:20.150> marked<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.840> went<00:02:21.050> over<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:21.500> my<00:02:21.650> chop<00:02:22.100> saw

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
pen marked it went over to my chop saw

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.730 
pen marked it went over to my chop saw
over<00:02:22.640> there<00:02:22.760> which<00:02:23.540> we<00:02:23.690> can<00:02:23.810> see<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:24.320> just

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
over there which we can see and just

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.010 
over there which we can see and just
started<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.880> know<00:02:26.000> moved<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.810> little<00:02:26.900> bit

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
started you know moved a little bit

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.020 
started you know moved a little bit
start<00:02:27.200> at<00:02:27.350> 45<00:02:27.620> cut<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.220> down<00:02:28.370> moved<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.820> little

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
start at 45 cut it down moved a little

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.230 
start at 45 cut it down moved a little
more<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.300> kept<00:02:29.830> my<00:02:30.830> line<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.370> it<00:02:31.970> worked<00:02:32.120> out

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
more to kept my line and it worked out

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.050 
more to kept my line and it worked out
perfect<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.140> what<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:33.380> came<00:02:33.620> up<00:02:33.800> with<00:02:33.830> was<00:02:34.790> a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
perfect and so what I came up with was a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.170 
perfect and so what I came up with was a
handful<00:02:35.570> of<00:02:35.810> these<00:02:36.530> here<00:02:37.150> they're<00:02:38.150> just

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
handful of these here they're just

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.690 
handful of these here they're just
little<00:02:38.990> scrap<00:02:39.320> one<00:02:39.560> by<00:02:39.710> four<00:02:39.950> pallet<00:02:40.340> cut-offs

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
little scrap one by four pallet cut-offs

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.510 
little scrap one by four pallet cut-offs
and<00:02:40.960> they<00:02:41.960> line<00:02:42.260> right<00:02:42.590> up<00:02:42.710> against<00:02:43.040> here<00:02:43.220> so

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
and they line right up against here so

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.870 
and they line right up against here so
what<00:02:44.360> I'm<00:02:44.480> going<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.660> do<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:45.110> next<00:02:45.950> I'm<00:02:46.310> decided

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
what I'm going to do is next I'm decided

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.150 
what I'm going to do is next I'm decided
to<00:02:46.940> come<00:02:47.060> out<00:02:47.180> here<00:02:47.240> and<00:02:47.630> I've<00:02:48.380> got<00:02:48.620> half<00:02:48.950> of

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
to come out here and I've got half of

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.340 
to come out here and I've got half of
them<00:02:49.250> cut<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:49.670> far<00:02:49.700> I'm<00:02:50.120> getting<00:02:50.960> my<00:02:51.050> wall

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
them cut so far I'm getting my wall

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.410 
them cut so far I'm getting my wall
virtually<00:02:52.070> straight<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.640> little<00:02:52.970> bit<00:02:53.150> a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
virtually straight just a little bit a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.190 
virtually straight just a little bit a
little<00:02:53.960> bit<00:02:54.610> leaning<00:02:55.610> out<00:02:55.970> because<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.930> figure

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
little bit leaning out because I figure

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.630 
little bit leaning out because I figure
over<00:02:57.530> pressure<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.040> time<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.400> going<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:58.550> my

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
over pressure and time it's going to my

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.220 
over pressure and time it's going to my
lean<00:02:58.850> in<00:02:59.030> so<00:02:59.300> I've<00:02:59.360> got<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.510> little<00:02:59.750> bit<00:02:59.930> leaning

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
lean in so I've got a little bit leaning

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.320 
lean in so I've got a little bit leaning
out<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.590> what<00:03:01.190> I've<00:03:01.310> done<00:03:01.520> if<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.940> notice

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
out and what I've done if you notice

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.960 
out and what I've done if you notice
probably<00:03:02.720> will<00:03:02.900> not<00:03:03.050> show<00:03:03.260> up<00:03:03.290> here<00:03:03.970> there's

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
probably will not show up here there's

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.260 
probably will not show up here there's
actually<00:03:05.240> a<00:03:05.780> pin<00:03:06.230> line<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:06.830> board<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:08.060> I

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
actually a pin line on that board and I

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.180 
actually a pin line on that board and I
got<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.690> by<00:03:08.930> just<00:03:09.170> letting<00:03:09.380> this<00:03:09.590> rough<00:03:09.950> rest

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
got that by just letting this rough rest

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.160 
got that by just letting this rough rest
there<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.670> drawn<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> line<00:03:11.150> on<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:11.450> then<00:03:11.990> what

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
there and drawn a line on it then what

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.530 
there and drawn a line on it then what
I'll<00:03:12.320> do<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.800> I'll<00:03:13.400> get<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:13.850> back<00:03:14.030> over<00:03:14.210> onto

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
I'll do is I'll get this back over onto

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.220 
I'll do is I'll get this back over onto
the<00:03:14.900> actual<00:03:15.470> workbench<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.760> by<00:03:17.630> workbench<00:03:18.080> I

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
the actual workbench and by workbench I

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.010 
the actual workbench and by workbench I
mean<00:03:18.410> a<00:03:18.620> pallet<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.220> have<00:03:19.400> laying<00:03:19.610> around

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
mean a pallet that I have laying around

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.050 
mean a pallet that I have laying around
that's<00:03:21.020> actually<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> crate<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.100> I'm<00:03:22.700> going<00:03:22.910> to

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
that's actually a crate and I'm going to

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.660 
that's actually a crate and I'm going to
line<00:03:23.330> these<00:03:23.570> boards<00:03:23.959> right<00:03:24.260> here<00:03:24.620> up<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.520> that

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
line these boards right here up to that

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.960 
line these boards right here up to that
line<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.320> then<00:03:27.320> I'm<00:03:27.440> going<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.740> glue<00:03:28.580> these

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
line and then I'm going to glue these

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.270 
line and then I'm going to glue these
and<00:03:29.390> actually<00:03:29.540> Brad<00:03:30.110> nail<00:03:30.350> these<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.800> off<00:03:31.070> your

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
and actually Brad nail these in off your

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.210 
and actually Brad nail these in off your
output<00:03:31.520> probably<00:03:31.820> five<00:03:32.000> nails<00:03:32.270> per<00:03:32.630> board<00:03:32.870> and

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
output probably five nails per board and

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.560 
output probably five nails per board and
that'll<00:03:34.220> secure<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.820> so<00:03:35.060> then<00:03:35.209> when<00:03:35.300> I<00:03:35.330> come

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
that'll secure that so then when I come

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.560 
that'll secure that so then when I come
back<00:03:35.750> over<00:03:35.990> I'll<00:03:36.320> be<00:03:36.890> able<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.130> actually<00:03:37.790> mount

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
back over I'll be able to actually mount

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.890 
back over I'll be able to actually mount
these<00:03:39.430> this<00:03:40.430> board<00:03:40.760> will<00:03:40.850> be<00:03:40.880> free<00:03:41.510> actually

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
these this board will be free actually

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.260 
these this board will be free actually
it's<00:03:42.200> going<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.380> be<00:03:42.740> I<00:03:42.950> guess<00:03:43.820> I'll<00:03:44.120> buy<00:03:44.240> it

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
it's going to be I guess I'll buy it

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.510 
it's going to be I guess I'll buy it
it's<00:03:44.420> going<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.720> actually<00:03:45.050> end<00:03:45.170> up<00:03:45.230> mean<00:03:45.520> like

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
it's going to actually end up mean like

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.670 
it's going to actually end up mean like
this<00:03:46.790> is<00:03:46.850> what<00:03:47.209> it's<00:03:47.330> going<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.480> doing<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:48.410> this

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
this is what it's going to doing so this

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.320 
this is what it's going to doing so this
board<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.010> going<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.250> be<00:03:49.370> mounted<00:03:49.520> just<00:03:50.150> like

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
board is going to be mounted just like

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.850 
board is going to be mounted just like
that<00:03:50.570> it's<00:03:51.260> what's<00:03:51.470> going<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.620> happen<00:03:51.800> is

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
that it's what's going to happen is

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.380 
that it's what's going to happen is
going<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.010> Brad<00:03:52.250> nailed<00:03:52.489> in<00:03:52.670> from<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:52.970> top<00:03:53.180> I

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
going to Brad nailed in from the top I

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.570 
going to Brad nailed in from the top I
completely<00:03:53.750> screwed<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.110> up<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:54.470> anyway<00:03:54.860> okay

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
completely screwed it up so anyway okay

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.010 
completely screwed it up so anyway okay
Brad<00:03:55.790> melody<00:03:56.090> in<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:56.330> then<00:03:56.420> what<00:03:56.570> happen<00:03:56.930> is

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
Brad melody in and then what happen is

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.229 
Brad melody in and then what happen is
this<00:03:57.170> will<00:03:57.230> actually<00:03:57.830> rest<00:03:58.280> right<00:03:58.640> up<00:03:58.790> against

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
this will actually rest right up against

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.750 
this will actually rest right up against
that<00:03:59.900> pallet<00:04:00.290> so<00:04:00.590> once<00:04:01.160> I<00:04:01.280> get<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.580> put

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
that pallet so once I get that put

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.040 
that pallet so once I get that put
together<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:02.300> night<00:04:02.420> coming<00:04:02.690> here<00:04:02.810> I<00:04:02.840> can

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
together the night coming here I can

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.890 
together the night coming here I can
screw<00:04:03.290> this<00:04:03.530> board<00:04:03.830> into<00:04:04.550> this<00:04:04.760> actual<00:04:05.510> pallet

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
screw this board into this actual pallet

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.500 
screw this board into this actual pallet
board<00:04:06.110> right<00:04:06.320> here<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:06.890> my<00:04:07.850> goal<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.360> get

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
board right here so my goal is to get

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.180 
board right here so my goal is to get
mark<00:04:08.750> I'm<00:04:09.080> going<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.320> do<00:04:09.410> three<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.709> these<00:04:09.860> test

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
mark I'm going to do three of these test

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.920 
mark I'm going to do three of these test
fit<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.489> see<00:04:10.640> how<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:10.820> does<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:11.300> then<00:04:11.810> I'll

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
fit it see how it does and then I'll

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.990 
fit it see how it does and then I'll
come<00:04:12.230> down<00:04:12.350> here<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.739> this<00:04:12.860> end<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.370> if<00:04:13.880> you

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
come down here to this end and if you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.599 
come down here to this end and if you
notice<00:04:14.330> it's<00:04:14.989> not<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.590> same<00:04:15.800> angle<00:04:16.190> not<00:04:16.400> even

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
notice it's not the same angle not even

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.949 
notice it's not the same angle not even
close<00:04:16.820> over<00:04:17.150> here<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:17.480> I'm<00:04:17.540> going<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.750> come<00:04:17.930> up

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
close over here so I'm going to come up

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.349 
close over here so I'm going to come up
with<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.200> different<00:04:18.380> mount<00:04:19.370> at<00:04:19.609> this<00:04:19.880> end<00:04:20.120> and

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
with a different mount at this end and

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.360 
with a different mount at this end and
go<00:04:20.870> from<00:04:21.020> there<00:04:21.230> so<00:04:21.290> right<00:04:21.709> now<00:04:21.919> I<00:04:21.950> just<00:04:22.190> got

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
go from there so right now I just got

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.040 
go from there so right now I just got
them<00:04:22.520> resting<00:04:22.850> right<00:04:23.000> here<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.419> this<00:04:23.900> is

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
them resting right here and this is

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.390 
them resting right here and this is
going<00:04:24.140> to<00:04:24.200> have<00:04:24.350> enough<00:04:24.650> meat<00:04:24.890> I<00:04:25.039> think<00:04:25.100> I<00:04:25.250> can

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
going to have enough meat I think I can

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.800 
going to have enough meat I think I can
probably<00:04:25.610> go<00:04:25.820> ahead<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.150> just<00:04:26.240> tack<00:04:26.479> them<00:04:26.630> in

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
probably go ahead and just tack them in

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.600 
probably go ahead and just tack them in
but

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
but

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.520 
but
we'll<00:04:27.729> cut<00:04:27.909> a<00:04:27.939> new<00:04:28.120> board<00:04:28.389> that<00:04:28.900> fits<00:04:29.139> up<00:04:29.349> in

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
we'll cut a new board that fits up in

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.990 
we'll cut a new board that fits up in
there<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:29.860> know<00:04:29.949> it's<00:04:30.129> just<00:04:30.250> an<00:04:30.460> inch<00:04:30.699> wider

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
there you know it's just an inch wider

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.779 
there you know it's just an inch wider
so<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.659> helps<00:04:31.870> secure<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.349> into<00:04:32.680> this<00:04:33.400> wall

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
so it helps secure that into this wall

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.059 
so it helps secure that into this wall
we'll<00:04:33.939> probably<00:04:34.180> also<00:04:34.539> have<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:35.259> board<00:04:35.590> coming

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
we'll probably also have a board coming

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:37.830 
we'll probably also have a board coming
up<00:04:36.250> I'll<00:04:36.520> put<00:04:37.000> one<00:04:37.150> up<00:04:37.300> here<00:04:37.479> a<00:04:37.509> little<00:04:37.569> bit<00:04:37.689> to

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
up I'll put one up here a little bit to

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.200 
up I'll put one up here a little bit to
kind<00:04:38.020> of<00:04:38.050> rest<00:04:38.289> against<00:04:38.650> that<00:04:38.800> so<00:04:39.159> like<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.030> lot

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
kind of rest against that so like a lot

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.640 
kind of rest against that so like a lot
of<00:04:40.360> these<00:04:40.449> here<00:04:40.900> like<00:04:41.139> this<00:04:41.319> one<00:04:41.469> right<00:04:41.590> here

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
of these here like this one right here

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.520 
of these here like this one right here
and<00:04:41.979> stuff<00:04:42.189> are<00:04:42.430> actually<00:04:43.199> sticking<00:04:44.199> up<00:04:44.379> high

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
and stuff are actually sticking up high

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.959 
and stuff are actually sticking up high
enough<00:04:44.710> they're<00:04:44.979> resting<00:04:45.310> against<00:04:45.580> that<00:04:45.759> so

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:45.969 
enough they're resting against that so

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.070 
enough they're resting against that so
not<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.180> big<00:04:46.330> deal<00:04:46.509> so<00:04:46.689> I'll<00:04:46.750> frightened

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
not a big deal so I'll frightened

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.050 
not a big deal so I'll frightened
hearing<00:04:47.319> is<00:04:47.409> extended<00:04:48.370> board<00:04:48.550> this<00:04:48.699> way<00:04:48.849> just

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
hearing is extended board this way just

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.309 
hearing is extended board this way just
a<00:04:49.120> little<00:04:49.330> bit<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.599> give<00:04:49.719> that<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:49.900> lot<00:04:50.080> more

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
a little bit to give that a lot more

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.719 
a little bit to give that a lot more
strength<00:04:50.590> so<00:04:51.030> that's<00:04:52.030> what<00:04:52.180> I<00:04:52.240> got<00:04:52.389> for<00:04:52.599> now

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
strength so that's what I got for now
