since<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.320> already<00:00:43.500> pulling<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.070> it's

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
since it's already pulling it and it's

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.319 
since it's already pulling it and it's
already<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> plant<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.910> doesn't<00:00:45.149> need<00:00:45.239> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
already a plant it doesn't need to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.240 
already a plant it doesn't need to
reproduce<00:00:45.570> over<00:00:45.960> itself<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.920> remove

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
reproduce over itself so you can remove

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.790 
reproduce over itself so you can remove
the<00:00:47.430> flowers<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.140> would<00:00:49.140> suggest<00:00:49.289> doing<00:00:49.649> this

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the flowers I would suggest doing this

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.020 
the flowers I would suggest doing this
when<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> bees<00:00:50.190> are<00:00:50.219> sleeping<00:00:50.730> maybe<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
when the bees are sleeping maybe a

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.279 
when the bees are sleeping maybe a
little<00:00:51.239> later<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.629> night<00:00:51.809> when<00:00:52.020> they're<00:00:52.140> not

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
little later at night when they're not

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.229 
little later at night when they're not
buzzing<00:00:52.530> around<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.070> collecting<00:00:53.760> pollen<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
buzzing around and collecting pollen is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.310 
buzzing around and collecting pollen is
a<00:00:54.270> good<00:00:54.510> time<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
a good time to do it

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.529 
a good time to do it
another<00:00:56.309> way<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.879> get<00:00:57.000> sugar<00:00:57.239> water

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
another way is you can get sugar water

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.720 
another way is you can get sugar water
and<00:00:57.750> place<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> dish<00:00:58.590> farther<00:00:59.129> away<00:00:59.309> from<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
and place a dish farther away from the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.790 
and place a dish farther away from the
rosemary<00:01:00.090> bush<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.260> need<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> kill<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
rosemary bush if you need to kill the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
rosemary bush if you need to kill the
bees<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.520> add<00:01:02.670> laundry<00:01:03.090> soap<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
bees you can add laundry soap to the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.390 
bees you can add laundry soap to the
sugar<00:01:03.989> water<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.739> will<00:01:04.920> kill<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.159> bees

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
sugar water and this will kill the bees

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.580 
sugar water and this will kill the bees
attract<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.510> kill<00:01:06.689> them<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.350> not
