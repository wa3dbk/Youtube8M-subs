00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.740
 today I will tell you the amazing story 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.860
 of a python of three meters 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.379
 that grabbed the wing of an airplane and 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.110
 He spent more than two hours fighting for 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.660
 survive was on a flight that was 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.410
 established between australia and new papua 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.920
 Guinea 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.020
 an airplane called the plane 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.630
 191 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.150
 I was transporting tourists 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.310
 towards your new destination the flight will last 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.610
 approximately two hours already 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.160
 20 minutes to take off at 20 minutes 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.220
 the passengers realized that 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.280
 a python was snagged and 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.270
 struggling as best he could to not fall into the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.210
 wing of an airplane 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.610
 the python in case you did not know 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.000
 It is one of the largest snakes in the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.850
 world together with the anaconda is capable of 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.280
 gobble up large prey like deer and 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.100
 boars are capable of 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.320
 extend your mouth to limits 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.799
 unsuspected are able to swallow a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.619
 human being perfectly and good have 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.080
 a great strength in all its in all its 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.750
 anatomy throughout your body because of this 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.670
 great strength was able to hold on to 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.340
 despite the strong winds and the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.710
 enormous speed at which the plane was going and 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.380
 was able to hold for two hours 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.259
 of flight unfortunately when the plane 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.440
 landed this snake was already dead 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.470
 There were bloodstains all over the wing 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.640
 of the plane and well at least let's say 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.460
 he died just when he landed that is 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.619
 he fought until the last moment until 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.569
 obviously then already due to two hours 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.780
 throwing blood because this snake died 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:53.460
 incredible not incredible the event and then 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.000
 to me at least I feel very sorry 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.390
 know that the python was there for 22 hours 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.460
 struggling without knowing what was happening 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.890
 because it's not like you'll stay in 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.490
 the wing of a plane at the end of the day your 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.069
 you know 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.830
 it's an airplane and you know the risk that 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.190
 you are exposed but imagine what a 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.260
 living being must feel when 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.060
 find in such a situation a 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.800
 situation where he does not understand 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.950
 absolutely nothing that is 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.860
 happening they have to feel a panic a 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.920
 terror that can not be explained from 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.770
 no way 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.290
 amazing case of a python 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.489
 three meters that he did not manage to survive a 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.489
 flight of more than two hours
