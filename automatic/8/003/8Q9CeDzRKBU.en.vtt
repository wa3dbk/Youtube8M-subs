particular challenge let's look at the

attacker attempts to knife a target from
the<00:00:34.890> front<00:00:35.250> 90<00:00:35.640> degrees<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.450> counter<00:00:36.809> knife

the front 90 degrees the counter knife

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.720 
the front 90 degrees the counter knife
option<00:00:37.410> appears<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> defender<00:00:38.460> this

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
option appears for the defender this

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.400 
option appears for the defender this
usually<00:00:39.120> results<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> free<00:00:39.899> kill<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
usually results in a free kill for the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.619 
usually results in a free kill for the
defender<00:00:40.800> closing<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> range<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.090> any<00:00:42.210> target

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
defender closing the range to any target

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.720 
defender closing the range to any target
can<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.899> very<00:00:43.140> dangerous<00:00:43.320> most<00:00:44.160> every<00:00:44.489> player

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
can be very dangerous most every player

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.639 
can be very dangerous most every player
of<00:00:44.969> any<00:00:45.210> skill<00:00:45.539> level<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.320> kill<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
of any skill level is going to kill you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.290 
of any skill level is going to kill you
if<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.950> charge<00:00:47.219> straight<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.760> them<00:00:47.969> there's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
if you charge straight at them there's

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.819 
if you charge straight at them there's
always<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.600> chance<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.410> target<00:00:49.739> will

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
always a chance that the target will

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
always a chance that the target will
turn<00:00:50.010> around<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.579> before<00:00:50.700> an<00:00:51.000> attack<00:00:51.120> lead

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
turn around just before an attack lead

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.290 
turn around just before an attack lead
into<00:00:51.840> some<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.199> vexing<00:00:52.649> situations<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.730> even

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
into some very vexing situations so even

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000 
into some very vexing situations so even
if<00:00:54.449> an<00:00:54.539> attacker<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:55.170> close<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> distance<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
if an attacker can close the distance to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.770 
if an attacker can close the distance to
a<00:00:56.070> target<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> coin<00:00:57.210> flip<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:57.629> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
a target it can be a coin flip as to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.260 
a target it can be a coin flip as to
whether<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.170> attacker<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.680> succeed

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
whether the attacker will succeed

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.729 
whether the attacker will succeed
because<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.539> don't<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.870> coin<00:01:01.079> flips<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.530> most

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
because I don't like coin flips in most

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.650 
because I don't like coin flips in most
situations<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.850> shoot<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> target

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
situations I have to shoot the target

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.020 
situations I have to shoot the target
but<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.199> today<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.159> my<00:01:05.250> first<00:01:05.430> few<00:01:05.670> attempts

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
but not today for my first few attempts

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.700 
but not today for my first few attempts
I<00:01:06.150> simply<00:01:06.540> ran<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.869> any<00:01:07.020> loadout<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.409> felt

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
I simply ran with any loadout I felt

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.260 
I simply ran with any loadout I felt
like<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.100> tried<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.670> close<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.150> those

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
like and tried to get in close for those

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
like and tried to get in close for those
knife<00:01:09.510> kills<00:01:09.780> ultimately<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.740> had<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> few

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
knife kills ultimately I had a few

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.399 
knife kills ultimately I had a few
successes<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.270> any<00:01:12.420> time<00:01:12.659> an<00:01:12.810> enemy<00:01:12.960> spotted

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
successes but any time an enemy spotted

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.810 
successes but any time an enemy spotted
me<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.560> my<00:01:13.799> way<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> them<00:01:14.340> they<00:01:14.549> would<00:01:14.700> either

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
me on my way to them they would either

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.520 
me on my way to them they would either
put<00:01:15.119> me<00:01:15.210> down<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.630> I'd<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.049> resort<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
put me down or I'd have to resort to a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.380 
put me down or I'd have to resort to a
different<00:01:16.890> weapon<00:01:17.220> obviously<00:01:17.970> frontal

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
different weapon obviously frontal

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.940 
different weapon obviously frontal
attacks<00:01:18.689> are<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.200> challenging<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.710> I

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
attacks are going to be challenging so I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.320 
attacks are going to be challenging so I
needed<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> figure<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> way<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> either

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
needed to figure out a way to either

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.450 
needed to figure out a way to either
safely<00:01:21.869> close<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.229> distance<00:01:22.619> or<00:01:22.799> work<00:01:23.070> my<00:01:23.280> way

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
safely close the distance or work my way

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
safely close the distance or work my way
around<00:01:23.720> since<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.020> doing<00:01:25.229> most<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.560> my

rise<00:01:29.970> shield<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.479> first<00:01:30.750> time<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.320> had

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
rise shield for the first time and I had

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.090 
rise shield for the first time and I had
mixed<00:01:31.740> results<00:01:33.200> for<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> most<00:01:34.409> part<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.890> riot

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
mixed results for the most part the riot

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.710 
mixed results for the most part the riot
shield<00:01:35.220> simply<00:01:35.850> made<00:01:36.060> me<00:01:36.210> an<00:01:36.299> even<00:01:36.540> more

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
shield simply made me an even more

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.510 
shield simply made me an even more
obvious<00:01:37.110> target<00:01:37.530> though<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.860> did<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.250> some

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
obvious target though I did have some

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.730 
obvious target though I did have some
success<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> riot<00:01:39.450> shield<00:01:39.740> ultimately

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
success with the riot shield ultimately

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.140 
success with the riot shield ultimately
I<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.250> would<00:01:41.430> have<00:01:41.549> been<00:01:41.700> better<00:01:41.909> served

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
I think I would have been better served

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.090 
I think I would have been better served
by<00:01:42.360> simply<00:01:42.780> bashing<00:01:43.290> my<00:01:43.439> opponents<00:01:43.890> with<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
by simply bashing my opponents with the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.710 
by simply bashing my opponents with the
riot<00:01:44.310> shield<00:01:44.430> rather<00:01:44.909> than<00:01:45.180> trying<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.570> get

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
riot shield rather than trying to get

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.969 
riot shield rather than trying to get
into<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.960> position<00:01:46.409> where<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> could<00:01:46.710> Knight

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
into a position where I could Knight

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.069 
into a position where I could Knight
them<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.880> fact<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> riot<00:01:48.570> shield<00:01:48.840> made

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
them the fact that the riot shield made

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.899 
them the fact that the riot shield made
me<00:01:49.290> an<00:01:49.380> even<00:01:49.649> slower<00:01:49.799> target<00:01:50.399> made<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
me an even slower target made this a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.240 
me an even slower target made this a
no-go<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.140> addition<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.500> safety<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.130> order

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
no-go so in addition to safety in order

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.219 
no-go so in addition to safety in order
to<00:01:53.460> close<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.700> distance<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.360> needed<00:01:54.720> speed<00:01:54.990> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
to close the distance I needed speed I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.380 
to close the distance I needed speed I
figured<00:01:55.950> my<00:01:56.100> next<00:01:56.430> best<00:01:56.610> step<00:01:56.909> would<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.149> to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
figured my next best step would be to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.719 
figured my next best step would be to
pick<00:01:57.540> recon<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.229> switched<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> offensive

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
pick recon I switched to the offensive

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.399 
pick recon I switched to the offensive
perk<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.119> order<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> faster<00:02:01.079> sprint

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
perk in order to get the faster sprint

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.380 
perk in order to get the faster sprint
additionally<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.430> needed<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:03.090> where<00:02:03.210> my

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
additionally I needed to know where my

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.240 
additionally I needed to know where my
enemies<00:02:03.659> were<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> equipped<00:02:04.710> sensors<00:02:05.100> in

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
enemies were so I equipped sensors in

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.859 
enemies were so I equipped sensors in
order<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> better<00:02:05.759> spot<00:02:06.060> my<00:02:06.240> enemies<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
order to better spot my enemies on the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.719 
order to better spot my enemies on the
mini-map<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.500> started<00:02:08.250> having<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.610> little

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
mini-map I started having a little

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.249 
mini-map I started having a little
better<00:02:09.000> luck<00:02:09.209> finding<00:02:09.420> targets<00:02:09.959> but<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
better luck finding targets but the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.970 
better luck finding targets but the
problem<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.709> would<00:02:10.770> continually<00:02:11.400> run<00:02:11.730> in

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
problem I would continually run in

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.440 
problem I would continually run in
-<00:02:12.069> is<00:02:12.310> that<00:02:12.459> there<00:02:12.640> were<00:02:12.730> simply<00:02:13.090> too<00:02:13.330> many

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
- is that there were simply too many

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.390 
- is that there were simply too many
enemies<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.020> overcome<00:02:14.440> more<00:02:14.890> than<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.160> single

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
enemies to overcome more than a single

enemies to overcome more than a single

that could see me
I<00:02:18.580> might<00:02:18.910> get<00:02:19.030> my<00:02:19.239> kill<00:02:19.480> but<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.780> would<00:02:19.959> be

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
I might get my kill but I would be

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.869 
I might get my kill but I would be
immediately<00:02:20.590> taken<00:02:20.950> down<00:02:21.099> by<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.340> nearby<00:02:21.640> enemy

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
speed and good tactical choices I was

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.850 
speed and good tactical choices I was
able<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.510> get<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.720> sense<00:02:53.079> of<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.380> best<00:02:53.590> time

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
able to get a sense of the best time

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.830 
able to get a sense of the best time
tonight<00:02:54.069> this<00:02:54.790> worked<00:02:55.030> even<00:02:55.329> when<00:02:55.450> an<00:02:55.569> enemy

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
tonight this worked even when an enemy

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.449 
tonight this worked even when an enemy
had<00:02:55.989> detected<00:02:56.410> me<00:02:56.500> at<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.680> last<00:02:56.860> moment<00:02:57.310> I

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
had detected me at the last moment I

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.009 
had detected me at the last moment I
figured<00:02:58.060> out<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.329> if<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.540> could<00:02:58.690> get<00:02:58.840> into

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
figured out that if I could get into

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.780 
figured out that if I could get into
that<00:02:59.170> sweet<00:02:59.470> spot<00:02:59.739> on<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.069> side<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.430> an<00:03:00.519> enemy

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
that sweet spot on the side of an enemy

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.670 
that sweet spot on the side of an enemy
taking<00:03:01.239> them<00:03:01.390> down<00:03:01.569> is<00:03:01.780> relatively<00:03:02.319> simple

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
taking them down is relatively simple

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.800 
taking them down is relatively simple
since<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.459> play<00:03:03.640> aggressively<00:03:04.120> most<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.690> my

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
since I play aggressively most of my

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.240 
since I play aggressively most of my
knife<00:03:04.989> kills<00:03:05.290> came<00:03:05.530> from<00:03:05.739> me<00:03:05.890> simply

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
knife kills came from me simply

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.069 
knife kills came from me simply
outmaneuvering<00:03:06.849> an<00:03:07.030> enemy<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.660> frontal

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
outmaneuvering an enemy and a frontal

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.930 
outmaneuvering an enemy and a frontal
assault<00:03:08.170> then<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.130> would<00:03:09.250> juke<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.730> side

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
assault then I would juke to the side

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.610 
assault then I would juke to the side
and<00:03:10.209> grab<00:03:10.360> their<00:03:10.599> dog<00:03:10.780> tags<00:03:11.019> from<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.380> last

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
and grab their dog tags from a last

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.500 
and grab their dog tags from a last
second<00:03:12.010> side<00:03:12.190> attack<00:03:12.519> but<00:03:13.209> there<00:03:13.360> is<00:03:13.420> an

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
second side attack but there is an

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.600 
second side attack but there is an
alternate<00:03:13.870> strategy<00:03:14.019> I<00:03:14.319> noticed<00:03:14.739> as<00:03:14.860> well<00:03:15.010> if

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
alternate strategy I noticed as well if

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.550 
alternate strategy I noticed as well if
you're<00:03:15.849> very<00:03:16.090> patient<00:03:16.569> and<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:16.900> find<00:03:17.200> corners

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
you're very patient and you find corners

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.140 
you're very patient and you find corners
and<00:03:17.739> doorways<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.069> enemies<00:03:18.579> frequent<00:03:19.000> you

and doorways that enemies frequent you

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.210 
and doorways that enemies frequent you
can<00:03:19.299> easily<00:03:19.510> grab<00:03:19.870> dog<00:03:20.170> tag<00:03:20.410> after<00:03:20.739> dog<00:03:20.950> tag

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
can easily grab dog tag after dog tag
