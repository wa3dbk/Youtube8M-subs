00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
part but it's actually not and you just

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.270 
part but it's actually not and you just
slide<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:37.520> on<00:00:39.469> always<00:00:40.469> make<00:00:40.980> sure

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
slide this on and on always make sure

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.110

the<00:00:45.989> holes<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.410> between<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.860> two<00:00:47.039> bars<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
the holes in between the two bars and

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.420 
the holes in between the two bars and
then<00:00:49.100> you<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:50.219> apply<00:00:51.410> back<00:00:52.410> screw<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.250> you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
then you would apply back screw as you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.600 
then you would apply back screw as you
see<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.320> front<00:00:55.320> screw<00:00:55.649> right<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:55.890> make

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
see here and front screw right here make

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.900 
see here and front screw right here make
sure<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:57.420> side<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.590> facing<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.489> just

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
sure this side is facing up and it just

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.880 
sure this side is facing up and it just
hooks<00:01:00.120> onto<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.660> bar<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.289> then<00:01:02.300> you<00:01:03.300> would

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
hooks onto that bar and then you would

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:12.460 
hooks onto that bar and then you would
want<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:07.640> screw<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:08.939> by<00:01:09.270> hands<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:11.090> um

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
want to screw it in by hands and um

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.100 
want to screw it in by hands and um
people<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.310> most<00:01:14.600> like<00:01:15.600> non

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
people think this is the most like non

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.399 
people think this is the most like non
protective<00:01:17.119> visor<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.110> screw

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
protective visor because it's you screw

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.120 
protective visor because it's you screw
it<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.530> by<00:01:19.710> hand<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.150> it's<00:01:21.150> pretty<00:01:21.299> solid

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
it in by hand but it's pretty solid

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.649 
it in by hand but it's pretty solid
but<00:01:23.130> most<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> visors<00:01:24.030> will<00:01:24.270> come<00:01:24.450> with

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
but most of the visors will come with

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.380 
but most of the visors will come with
screws<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.430> would<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.700> screw<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.299> in

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
screws but you would have to screw it in

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.580 
screws but you would have to screw it in
like<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> screwdriver<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.540> on<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:31.350> make

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
like with a screwdriver and on just make

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.789 
like with a screwdriver and on just make
this<00:01:32.509> nice<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.250> tight<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:36.409> make<00:01:37.409> sure<00:01:37.650> it's

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
this nice and tight and make sure it's

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.810 
this nice and tight and make sure it's
straight<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.400> tighten<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:41.700> what

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
straight and tighten it so that's what

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
straight and tighten it so that's what
one<00:01:42.060> side<00:01:42.270> would<00:01:42.420> look<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> visor

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
one side would look like with the visor

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.980 
one side would look like with the visor
on<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.899> then<00:01:45.899> we'll<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.829> same<00:01:47.220> thing<00:01:47.990> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
on and then we'll do the same thing to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.030 
on and then we'll do the same thing to
the<00:01:49.490> next<00:01:50.490> side<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.869> make<00:01:52.320> sure<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.590> Baxter

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
the next side and make sure the Baxter

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.880 
the next side and make sure the Baxter
is<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.770> clip<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:57.890> pretty

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
is in and clip it on and then pretty

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.910 
is in and clip it on and then pretty
much<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.420> don't<00:02:04.170> heal<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:04.680> bit<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> if

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
much so don't heal a little bit so if

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.719 
much so don't heal a little bit so if
you<00:02:07.920> need<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729
