and output raises a lot of talk about
effort<00:01:23.560> raise<00:01:23.710> it's<00:01:23.860> not<00:01:24.009> really<00:01:24.369> that

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
effort raise it's not really that

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.690 
effort raise it's not really that
important<00:01:24.969> to<00:01:25.030> be<00:01:25.090> honest<00:01:25.450> most<00:01:25.899> people<00:01:26.700> for

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
important to be honest most people for

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.480 
important to be honest most people for
most<00:01:27.729> uses<00:01:28.320> live<00:01:29.320> on<00:01:29.500> limited<00:01:29.920> range<00:01:30.130> because

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
most uses live on limited range because

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.580 
most uses live on limited range because
that's<00:01:30.670> most<00:01:31.180> compatible<00:01:31.540> with<00:01:31.990> most

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
that's most compatible with most

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.920 
that's most compatible with most
monitors<00:01:33.420> recorders<00:01:34.420> all<00:01:34.539> that<00:01:34.689> sort<00:01:34.899> of

monitors recorders all that sort of

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.480 
monitors recorders all that sort of
thing<00:01:35.110> so<00:01:35.259> generally<00:01:35.680> leave<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:35.979> unlimited

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
thing so generally leave it unlimited

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.889 
thing so generally leave it unlimited
range<00:01:36.670> if<00:01:36.969> you<00:01:37.329> really<00:01:37.600> know<00:01:37.689> what<00:01:37.810> you're

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
range if you really know what you're

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.719 
range if you really know what you're
going<00:01:38.020> to<00:01:38.110> do<00:01:38.320> what<00:01:38.710> you're<00:01:38.860> doing<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.340> you're

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
going to do what you're doing and you're

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.880 
going to do what you're doing and you're
definitely<00:01:40.060> going<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.450> grade<00:01:40.689> but<00:01:40.990> on<00:01:41.710> full

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
definitely going to grade but on full

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.380 
definitely going to grade but on full
range<00:01:42.130> but<00:01:42.369> otherwise<00:01:42.759> believe<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.299> was

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
range but otherwise believe it was

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.560 
range but otherwise believe it was
limited<00:01:43.810> should<00:01:44.710> be<00:01:44.829> fine<00:01:45.149> okay<00:01:46.180> output

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
limited should be fine okay output

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.380 
limited should be fine okay output
display<00:01:46.899> size<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:48.789> up<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.030> 100%

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390

specially<00:01:50.109> if<00:01:50.170> you're<00:01:50.320> recording<00:01:50.590> externally

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
specially if you're recording externally

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.639 
specially if you're recording externally
rather<00:01:51.579> than<00:01:51.729> just<00:01:51.909> monitoring<00:01:52.270> live<00:01:53.170> view<00:01:53.500> on

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
rather than just monitoring live view on

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.660 
rather than just monitoring live view on
screen<00:01:54.039> off<00:01:55.710> okay<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:56.770> now<00:01:57.100> that's<00:01:57.219> all<00:01:57.460> set

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
screen off okay so now that's all set

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.510 
screen off okay so now that's all set
let's<00:01:58.060> go<00:01:58.240> back<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.539> live<00:01:58.719> view<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:59.520> hey

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
let's go back to live view and hey

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.719 
let's go back to live view and hey
presto<00:02:01.590> yes<00:02:03.450> full<00:02:04.450> 1080<00:02:05.200> output<00:02:06.130> that's<00:02:06.490> your
