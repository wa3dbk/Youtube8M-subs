00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.530 
wet or has a lot of in this case it's a
gel<00:01:51.299> liner<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:53.220> more<00:01:53.549> emollient<00:01:54.390> in

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
gel liner so it's more emollient in

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.410 
gel liner so it's more emollient in
nature<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.710> want<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.030> set

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
nature you want to go back in and set

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.539 
nature you want to go back in and set
that<00:01:57.860> with<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.630> nice<00:02:00.680> matte<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.280> case

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that with a nice matte and in this case

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.380 
that with a nice matte and in this case
we're<00:02:02.759> using<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.090> matte<00:02:03.360> eye<00:02:03.630> shadow<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:05.670> that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
we're using a matte eye shadow and that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.600 
we're using a matte eye shadow and that
will<00:02:06.540> eliminate<00:02:06.689> any<00:02:07.110> shine<00:02:07.530> it'll<00:02:08.220> also<00:02:08.340> give

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
will eliminate any shine it'll also give

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.100 
will eliminate any shine it'll also give
it<00:02:08.729> longevity<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.720> make<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.989> look<00:02:10.170> nice<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
it longevity and make it look nice and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.149 
it longevity and make it look nice and
I<00:02:14.079> think<00:02:15.079> this<00:02:15.170> would<00:02:15.319> be<00:02:15.349> a<00:02:15.469> great<00:02:15.829> look<00:02:16.099> for

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
I think this would be a great look for

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.289 
I think this would be a great look for
an<00:02:16.489> Asian<00:02:16.670> girl<00:02:16.969> if<00:02:17.209> she<00:02:17.359> was<00:02:17.390> going<00:02:17.599> out<00:02:18.189> or<00:02:19.299> if

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
an Asian girl if she was going out or if

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.030 
an Asian girl if she was going out or if
she<00:02:20.420> just<00:02:20.569> wanted<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.900> more<00:02:21.049> high-fashion<00:02:21.290> look

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
she just wanted a more high-fashion look

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.229 
she just wanted a more high-fashion look
say<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.060> stage<00:02:23.390> performance<00:02:24.049> or<00:02:24.469> a<00:02:25.239> modeling

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
say a stage performance or a modeling

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.179 
say a stage performance or a modeling
shoot<00:02:26.269> of<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:27.109> nature<00:02:27.319> or<00:02:27.650> something<00:02:27.980> like

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
shoot of that nature or something like

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.830 
shoot of that nature or something like
that<00:02:28.250> would<00:02:28.640> be<00:02:28.700> perfect<00:02:29.359> with<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:31.659> we<00:02:32.659> did

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
that would be perfect with this we did

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.940 
that would be perfect with this we did
highlight<00:02:33.140> just<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.680> little<00:02:33.950> above<00:02:34.629> with<00:02:35.629> a
