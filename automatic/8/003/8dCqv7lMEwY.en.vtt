whether it's just for for storage or for

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.030 
whether it's just for for storage or for
extra<00:02:05.420> maneuverability<00:02:06.350> which<00:02:06.530> i<00:02:06.710> think<00:02:06.770> is

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
extra maneuverability which i think is

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.119

what the package says on the bottom you

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:19.780 
what the package says on the bottom you
have<00:02:15.340> tuna<00:02:16.340> tiles<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:18.230> missile<00:02:19.159> holes<00:02:19.340> go<00:02:19.580> all

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
have tuna tiles the missile holes go all

have tuna tiles the missile holes go all
the<00:02:19.909> way<00:02:19.940> through<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.569> can<00:02:20.659> put<00:02:20.930> them<00:02:21.050> on

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140

where<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:32.139> peg<00:02:33.139> is<00:02:33.469> worth<00:02:34.159> you<00:02:34.340> figure<00:02:35.980> if<00:02:36.980> you

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
where the peg is worth you figure if you

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.800 
where the peg is worth you figure if you
put<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.370> bottom<00:02:37.609> on<00:02:37.700> there<00:02:37.939> all<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:38.540> sudden

the original

on the original prototype portal on the

on the original prototype portal on the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
box they don't have those tabs at all so

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.690 
box they don't have those tabs at all so
I<00:04:54.680> guess<00:04:55.160> they<00:04:55.310> were<00:04:55.340> assuming<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:57.700> they

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
I guess they were assuming that they

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.620 
I guess they were assuming that they
could<00:04:58.880> make<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.210> front<00:04:59.840> forks<00:05:00.280> good<00:05:01.280> enough

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
could make the front forks good enough

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.810 
could make the front forks good enough
for<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.750> hands<00:05:02.960> but<00:05:03.320> obviously<00:05:04.250> they<00:05:04.430> didn't

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
for the hands but obviously they didn't

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.320 
for the hands but obviously they didn't
bother<00:05:04.940> doing<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:05.650> so<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.880> hands<00:05:08.120> don't

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
bother doing that so the hands don't

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.200 
bother doing that so the hands don't

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
would have been better if they had just

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
made these fun Forks a little thinner

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
no interesting thing like I've found out

sticker<00:06:14.140> on<00:06:14.260> there<00:06:14.470> which<00:06:14.620> I<00:06:14.770> believe<00:06:15.010> is<00:06:15.130> a

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
sticker on there which I believe is a

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.230 
sticker on there which I believe is a
reuse<00:06:15.550> of<00:06:15.730> the<00:06:15.880> snake<00:06:16.630> armors<00:06:17.220> stickers<00:06:18.240> or

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
reuse of the snake armors stickers or

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.570 
reuse of the snake armors stickers or
officially<00:06:19.930> what<00:06:20.890> they<00:06:20.980> had<00:06:21.130> is<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.340> number

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
officially what they had is the number

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:30.990 
officially what they had is the number
eight<00:06:21.730> here<00:06:28.020> and<00:06:29.020> that<00:06:29.350> was<00:06:29.560> my<00:06:29.770> review<00:06:30.280> of<00:06:30.430> the
