just<00:06:21.469> move<00:06:21.649> out<00:06:21.800> of<00:06:21.949> it<00:06:22.099> he<00:06:22.729> will<00:06:22.849> then<00:06:22.879> begin

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:23.149 
just move out of it he will then begin

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.029 
just move out of it he will then begin

so<00:07:15.259> I'm<00:07:15.349> assuming<00:07:15.649> it's<00:07:15.949> similar<00:07:16.189> here<00:07:16.519> since

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:16.699 
so I'm assuming it's similar here since

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.029 
so I'm assuming it's similar here since
I've<00:07:16.819> never<00:07:16.939> hit<00:07:17.269> it<00:07:17.300> in<00:07:17.509> the<00:07:17.629> duty<00:07:17.839> finder

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 
I've never hit it in the duty finder

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.170 
I've never hit it in the duty finder
honestly<00:07:19.039> it<00:07:19.219> seems<00:07:19.550> like<00:07:19.819> a<00:07:19.849> lot<00:07:20.059> of

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
honestly it seems like a lot of

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.059 
honestly it seems like a lot of
mechanics<00:07:20.629> but<00:07:20.959> even<00:07:21.229> with<00:07:21.379> tons<00:07:21.680> of<00:07:21.889> mistakes

you<00:07:22.459> can<00:07:22.789> net<00:07:22.969> a<00:07:22.999> win<00:07:23.240> here<00:07:23.419> pretty<00:07:23.629> easily<00:07:23.869> as

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:24.139 
you can net a win here pretty easily as

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.959 
you can net a win here pretty easily as
