00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
a half inch base and then they're sewn

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.119 
a half inch base and then they're sewn
together<00:00:34.750> at<00:00:35.080> the<00:00:35.199> sides<00:00:35.470> after<00:00:35.739> they've<00:00:36.010> been

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
together at the sides after they've been

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.820 
together at the sides after they've been
turned<00:00:36.400> to<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.640> base<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:38.500> gives<00:00:38.739> you

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
turned to the base and that gives you

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.380 
turned to the base and that gives you
quite<00:00:39.010> a<00:00:39.070> useful<00:00:39.250> little<00:00:39.729> holder<00:00:39.970> if<00:00:40.089> you<00:00:40.210> see

was<00:01:21.520> just<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:21.820> show<00:01:21.999> you<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.299> when<00:01:22.420> I<00:01:22.450> sewed

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
was just to show you that when I sewed

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.459 
was just to show you that when I sewed
on<00:01:22.990> these<00:01:23.259> a<00:01:23.939> couple<00:01:24.939> of<00:01:25.149> pairs<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.539> the<00:01:25.840> top

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
on these a couple of pairs of the top

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:27.120 
on these a couple of pairs of the top
and<00:01:26.649> bottom

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
and bottom

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.480 
and bottom
I've<00:01:27.579> only<00:01:27.850> stitched<00:01:28.630> from<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.560> stitch<00:01:30.130> line

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
I've only stitched from the stitch line

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.639 
I've only stitched from the stitch line
of<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:31.299> seam<00:01:31.600> going<00:01:31.840> up<00:01:32.049> and<00:01:32.229> down<00:01:32.350> I

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
of that seam going up and down I

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.739 
of that seam going up and down I
stitched<00:01:33.219> from<00:01:33.369> there<00:01:33.640> across<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.420> seam

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749 
stitched from there across to that seam

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:36.870 
stitched from there across to that seam
line<00:01:34.780> rather<00:01:35.560> than<00:01:35.890> going<00:01:36.069> right<00:01:36.369> through<00:01:36.399> to

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
line rather than going right through to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.190 
line rather than going right through to
the<00:01:36.909> end<00:01:37.409> now<00:01:38.409> what<00:01:38.679> I<00:01:38.710> plan<00:01:39.069> to<00:01:39.100> do<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:40.200> sew

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
the end now what I plan to do is sew

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.459 
the end now what I plan to do is sew
that<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.130> that<00:01:42.490> together<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.810> if<00:01:43.899> I<00:01:44.020> pick<00:01:44.259> that

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
that and that together so if I pick that

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.200 
that and that together so if I pick that
up<00:01:45.539> I'll<00:01:46.539> line<00:01:47.259> these<00:01:47.799> two<00:01:47.859> together<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.850> sew

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
up I'll line these two together and sew

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.639 
up I'll line these two together and sew
along<00:01:49.359> that<00:01:49.780> seam<00:01:50.139> now<00:01:50.469> so<00:01:51.189> that<00:01:51.369> I'm<00:01:51.520> creating

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
along that seam now so that I'm creating

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.590 
along that seam now so that I'm creating
in<00:01:53.649> effect<00:01:54.039> I'll<00:01:54.219> end<00:01:54.490> up<00:01:54.639> with<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.880> square<00:01:55.329> and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
in effect I'll end up with a square and

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.959 
in effect I'll end up with a square and
then<00:01:55.929> those<00:01:56.170> sides<00:01:56.859> will<00:01:57.460> all<00:01:57.609> be<00:01:57.759> joined

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
then those sides will all be joined

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.349 
then those sides will all be joined
together<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:59.530> seam<00:01:59.950> will<00:02:00.130> be<00:02:00.249> sewn<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.850> that

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
together the seam will be sewn and that

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.929 
together the seam will be sewn and that
one<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.869> one<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.350> then<00:02:03.189> that<00:02:03.579> will<00:02:03.789> be

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
one and that one and then that will be

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.969 
one and that one and then that will be
the<00:02:03.969> front<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:04.749> the<00:02:04.899> sides<00:02:05.139> of<00:02:05.409> the<00:02:05.499> cube<00:02:05.709> and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the front and the sides of the cube and

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.770 
the front and the sides of the cube and
I<00:02:06.549> can<00:02:06.729> then<00:02:06.850> put<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.149> square<00:02:07.329> on<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.630> back

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
I can then put the square on the back

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.930 
I can then put the square on the back
I've<00:02:08.500> turned<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.860> seams<00:02:09.100> down<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.520> corners

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
I've turned the seams down the corners

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.130 
I've turned the seams down the corners
now<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.450> I've<00:02:10.780> got<00:02:11.190> two<00:02:12.190> cubes<00:02:12.700> or<00:02:13.030> two<00:02:13.240> mostly

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
now and I've got two cubes or two mostly

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.050 
now and I've got two cubes or two mostly
cubes<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:15.130> one<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.490> right<00:02:15.640> side<00:02:15.850> out<00:02:16.030> and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
cubes that one is the right side out and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.210 
cubes that one is the right side out and
that<00:02:16.270> one<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.540> still<00:02:16.780> wrong<00:02:17.020> side<00:02:17.260> out<00:02:17.290> now<00:02:17.950> I'm

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
that one is still wrong side out now I'm

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.490 
that one is still wrong side out now I'm
going<00:02:18.460> to<00:02:18.580> sew<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:19.120> four<00:02:19.330> inch<00:02:19.480> square<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
going to sew a four inch square to the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.520 
going to sew a four inch square to the
to<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.190> bottom<00:02:21.550> here<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:21.880> each<00:02:22.450> cube<00:02:22.870> but<00:02:23.410> I'm

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
to the bottom here of each cube but I'm

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.490 
to the bottom here of each cube but I'm
going<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.800> leave<00:02:24.100> one<00:02:24.520> seam<00:02:24.880> open<00:02:25.300> which<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.320> can

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
going to leave one seam open which I can

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.040 
going to leave one seam open which I can
use<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.920> fill<00:02:27.220> up<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.720> put<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.840> stuffing

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
use to fill up the put the stuffing

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.930 
use to fill up the put the stuffing
inside<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.760> I've<00:02:30.760> certainly<00:02:31.090> Square<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:32.200> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
inside it I've certainly Square to the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.430 
inside it I've certainly Square to the
the<00:02:33.940> three<00:02:34.270> parts<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.840> cube<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.170> are

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
the three parts of the cube that are

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.530 
the three parts of the cube that are
down<00:02:35.620> there<00:02:35.700> I've<00:02:36.700> got<00:02:36.880> right<00:02:37.060> sides<00:02:37.360> together

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
down there I've got right sides together

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.620 
down there I've got right sides together
and<00:02:38.020> I've<00:02:38.200> gone<00:02:38.410> round<00:02:38.680> on<00:02:39.070> three<00:02:39.550> edges<00:02:40.030> which

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
and I've gone round on three edges which

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.590 
and I've gone round on three edges which
now<00:02:40.930> leaves<00:02:41.200> for<00:02:41.440> me<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> gap<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.850> if<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.450> look

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
now leaves for me a gap and if you look

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.780 
now leaves for me a gap and if you look
inside<00:02:43.750> there<00:02:44.140> there's<00:02:44.709> plenty<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.130> space<00:02:45.430> now

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
inside there there's plenty of space now

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.140 
inside there there's plenty of space now
so<00:02:46.360> I<00:02:46.720> can<00:02:46.990> turn<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.970> right<00:02:48.970> side<00:02:49.030> out<00:02:51.150> which

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
so I can turn this right side out which

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.170 
so I can turn this right side out which
is<00:02:52.420> not<00:02:52.630> very<00:02:52.840> easy<00:02:53.400> one-handed<00:02:54.400> but<00:02:54.940> when

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
is not very easy one-handed but when

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.490 
is not very easy one-handed but when
I've<00:02:55.330> turned<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.660> right<00:02:55.810> side<00:02:55.870> out<00:02:56.140> then<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:57.190> can

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
I've turned it right side out then I can

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.870 
I've turned it right side out then I can
fill<00:02:59.790> that<00:03:00.790> whole<00:03:01.510> cube<00:03:01.930> with<00:03:02.580> some<00:03:03.580> kind<00:03:03.790> of

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
fill that whole cube with some kind of

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.470 
fill that whole cube with some kind of
filling<00:03:04.180> toy<00:03:04.390> stuffing<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.020> then<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:05.980> will

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
filling toy stuffing and then I will

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.449 
filling toy stuffing and then I will
slip<00:03:07.480> stitch<00:03:07.720> across<00:03:07.900> there<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.890> close<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.280> up

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
slip stitch across there to close it up

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.460 
slip stitch across there to close it up
so<00:03:09.670> it's<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.940> completely<00:03:10.300> self-contained<00:03:10.690> cube

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
so it's a completely self-contained cube

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.640 
so it's a completely self-contained cube
I<00:03:11.739> filled<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.790> cube<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.330> now<00:03:13.600> I'm<00:03:13.959> just<00:03:14.410> slip

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
I filled the cube and now I'm just slip

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.580 
I filled the cube and now I'm just slip
stitching<00:03:15.040> across<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.610> gap<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.350> close<00:03:17.350> it

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
stitching across that gap to close it

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.979 
stitching across that gap to close it
off<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.950> for<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.700> base<00:03:18.880> I'm<00:03:19.150> using<00:03:19.390> four<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:19.959> a

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
off to for the base I'm using four and a

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.740 
off to for the base I'm using four and a
half<00:03:20.020> inch<00:03:20.380> squares<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:21.430> I've<00:03:21.790> got<00:03:22.000> four<00:03:22.570> half

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
half inch squares so I've got four half

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.320 
half inch squares so I've got four half
inch<00:03:22.930> square<00:03:23.200> rewarding<00:03:23.680> first<00:03:24.040> then<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:25.030> one

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
inch square rewarding first then of one

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.660 
inch square rewarding first then of one
fabric<00:03:25.810> with<00:03:26.019> right<00:03:26.049> side<00:03:26.380> up<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.160> another

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
fabric with right side up and another

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.770 
fabric with right side up and another
fabric<00:03:27.940> with<00:03:28.239> right<00:03:28.269> side<00:03:28.480> down<00:03:30.209> I'm<00:03:31.209> going<00:03:31.540> to

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
fabric with right side down I'm going to

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.520 
fabric with right side down I'm going to
sew<00:03:32.019> these<00:03:32.320> now<00:03:32.739> around<00:03:33.250> three-and-a-half

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
sew these now around three-and-a-half

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.509 
sew these now around three-and-a-half
sides<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:36.340> that<00:03:36.370> I'll<00:03:36.820> just<00:03:37.239> have<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.450> gap<00:03:37.840> there

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
sides so that I'll just have a gap there

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.640 
sides so that I'll just have a gap there
that<00:03:39.519> I<00:03:39.610> can<00:03:39.820> turn<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.299> squares<00:03:41.140> right<00:03:41.380> side

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
that I can turn the squares right side

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.610 
that I can turn the squares right side
out<00:03:42.510> I've<00:03:43.510> sewn<00:03:43.780> around<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.140> edge<00:03:44.260> now

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
out I've sewn around the edge now

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.920 
out I've sewn around the edge now
everywhere<00:03:45.250> except<00:03:45.700> this<00:03:45.910> gap<00:03:46.209> across<00:03:46.600> here

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
everywhere except this gap across here

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.680 
everywhere except this gap across here
so<00:03:47.080> I'm<00:03:47.830> now<00:03:48.250> going<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.580> clip<00:03:49.209> across<00:03:49.450> the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
so I'm now going to clip across the

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.500 
so I'm now going to clip across the
corners<00:03:50.110> just<00:03:50.140> to<00:03:50.440> reduce<00:03:50.620> bulk<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.370> then<00:03:52.299> I

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
corners just to reduce bulk and then I

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.420 
corners just to reduce bulk and then I
can<00:03:52.930> turn<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.530> whole<00:03:53.680> thing<00:03:53.920> right<00:03:54.070> side<00:03:54.130> out

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
can turn the whole thing right side out

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.810 
can turn the whole thing right side out
through<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.239> gap<00:03:56.130> I've<00:03:57.130> turned<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.579> squares

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
through this gap I've turned the squares

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.759 
through this gap I've turned the squares
right-side<00:03:58.420> out<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.690> now<00:03:59.140> I'm<00:03:59.320> just<00:03:59.350> slip

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
right-side out and now I'm just slip

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.470 
right-side out and now I'm just slip
stitching<00:04:00.190> across<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.700> gap<00:04:00.880> just<00:04:01.239> to

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
stitching across the gap just to

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.069 
stitching across the gap just to
complete<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.380> square<00:04:03.540> I've<00:04:04.540> pressed<00:04:04.900> the

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
complete the square I've pressed the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
base and I've run a few lines of

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.460 
base and I've run a few lines of
stitching<00:04:07.150> around<00:04:07.420> just<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.930> hold<00:04:08.170> it<00:04:08.320> all

together now I'm going to sew the cubes
onto<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.459> base<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.480> that<00:04:14.350> one<00:04:14.590> will<00:04:14.799> be<00:04:14.980> sewn

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
onto the base so that one will be sewn

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.490

squares<00:04:52.320> onto<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.830> base<00:04:53.010> just<00:04:53.760> using

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
squares onto the base just using

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.780 
squares onto the base just using
ordinary<00:04:54.570> thread<00:04:55.190> perhaps<00:04:56.190> with<00:04:56.370> hands<00:04:56.580> out<00:04:56.760> I

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
ordinary thread perhaps with hands out I

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.670 
ordinary thread perhaps with hands out I
could<00:04:57.090> have<00:04:57.210> used<00:04:57.390> a<00:04:57.630> brighter<00:04:58.140> thread<00:04:58.500> and

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
could have used a brighter thread and

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.620 
could have used a brighter thread and
done<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:58.920> blanket<00:04:59.340> stitch<00:04:59.550> or<00:04:59.760> something<00:05:00.150> but

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
done a blanket stitch or something but

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.390 
done a blanket stitch or something but
the<00:05:01.170> important<00:05:01.560> thing<00:05:01.590> is<00:05:01.770> just<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:02.070> get<00:05:02.160> them

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
the important thing is just to get them

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.940 
the important thing is just to get them
showing<00:05:02.700> on<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:03.090> each<00:05:03.210> other<00:05:03.470> I've<00:05:04.470> shown<00:05:04.710> both

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
showing on to each other I've shown both

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.490 
showing on to each other I've shown both
squares<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.790> base<00:05:05.970> now<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.570> all<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:07.350> have

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
squares to the base now and all I have

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.190 
squares to the base now and all I have
to<00:05:07.530> do<00:05:07.770> now<00:05:08.100> is<00:05:08.130> just<00:05:08.340> sew<00:05:09.150> up<00:05:09.420> the<00:05:09.660> sides<00:05:09.930> and

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
to do now is just sew up the sides and

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.490 
to do now is just sew up the sides and
sew<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.500> two<00:05:10.650> squares<00:05:10.950> to<00:05:11.130> each<00:05:11.280> other
