stick<00:00:22.859> otherwise<00:00:23.310> we've<00:00:23.640> got<00:00:23.850> our<00:00:24.210> usual

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
stick otherwise we've got our usual

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.359 
stick otherwise we've got our usual
attack<00:00:25.910> jump<00:00:27.619> I'm<00:00:28.619> not<00:00:28.769> sure<00:00:28.830> exactly<00:00:29.220> what

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
attack jump I'm not sure exactly what

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.890 
attack jump I'm not sure exactly what
everything<00:00:29.640> does<00:00:29.670> but<00:00:30.210> it's<00:00:30.330> over<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.779> it

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
everything does but it's over here so it

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.540 
everything does but it's over here so it
bought<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.289> think<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.160> bomb<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
bought I think this is this is bomb and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
bought I think this is this is bomb and
this<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.759> rope<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:33.809> essentially<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.260> an

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
this is rope so it's essentially like an

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.250 
this is rope so it's essentially like an
X<00:00:35.250> Y<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.910> B<00:00:36.500> control<00:00:37.500> setup<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.170> we've

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
X Y a B control setup so now that we've

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.889 
X Y a B control setup so now that we've
got<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.440> let's<00:00:41.399> go<00:00:41.850> into<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> daily

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
got that let's go into the daily

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.330 
got that let's go into the daily
challenge<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.410> as<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.890> see<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.129> move

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
challenge so as you can see I can move

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.190 
challenge so as you can see I can move
around<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.610> most<00:00:44.789> only<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.360> doing<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
around the most only if I'm doing that

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.000 
around the most only if I'm doing that
otherwise<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.739> need<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> click<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:49.649> we<00:00:49.920> are

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
otherwise I need to click so we are

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.150 
otherwise I need to click so we are
going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.309> play<00:00:50.579> we're<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> place<00:00:51.120> her

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
going to play we're going to place her

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.240 
going to play we're going to place her
and<00:00:53.270> I<00:00:54.379> think<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> hit<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> daily<00:00:55.860> challenge<00:00:56.129> I

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and I think I hit the daily challenge I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.130 
and I think I hit the daily challenge I
always<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:57.000> zone<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.570> what<00:00:57.690> I'm<00:00:57.780> doing<00:00:57.809> that

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
always just zone out what I'm doing that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.549 
always just zone out what I'm doing that
so<00:00:58.649> okay<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.520> jump<00:00:59.820> there's<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so okay so this is jump there's the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.910 
so okay so this is jump there's the
bottom<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:01.949> attack<00:01:02.309> got<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.120> I've<00:01:03.920> played

but for the most part I'm feeling okay I
don't<00:02:01.100> think<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.510> this<00:02:02.510> game<00:02:02.600> doesn't<00:02:02.960> have

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200

don't think that this game doesn't have
it<00:02:03.350> I<00:02:03.560> don't<00:02:04.460> want<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.640> say<00:02:04.730> it<00:02:04.820> doesn't<00:02:04.970> have

it I don't want to say it doesn't have
really<00:02:05.420> twitchy<00:02:06.410> controls<00:02:07.250> because<00:02:07.490> you<00:02:08.090> do

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
really twitchy controls because you do

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.690

comfortable position with really quickly

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.840

so<00:02:41.590> one<00:02:42.590> of<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.739> things<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.459> know<00:02:43.520> that

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
so one of the things that I know that

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.290 
so one of the things that I know that
one<00:02:44.480> developer<00:02:45.260> had<00:02:45.380> talked<00:02:45.620> about<00:02:45.739> was

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
one developer had talked about was

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.300 
one developer had talked about was
pressing<00:02:47.300> down<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.230> left<00:02:48.620> pad<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:49.100> move

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
pressing down on the left pad to move

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.729 
pressing down on the left pad to move
and<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.850> don't<00:02:50.120> like<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.360> I've<00:02:50.690> tried<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.650> at

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
and I don't like that I've tried it at

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.030 
and I don't like that I've tried it at
this<00:02:51.830> point<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.340> what<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.000> find<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.510> I'll

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
this point and what I find is that I'll

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.400 
this point and what I find is that I'll
accidentally<00:02:55.040> hit<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.400> left<00:02:55.550> pad<00:02:55.730> but<00:02:56.720> having

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
accidentally hit the left pad but having

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.229 
accidentally hit the left pad but having
to<00:02:57.530> hold<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.860> down<00:02:57.980> does<00:02:58.310> feel<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.670> little<00:02:58.850> bit

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
to hold it down does feel a little bit

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.009 
to hold it down does feel a little bit
too<00:02:59.510> cumbersome<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:01.640> for<00:03:02.030> right<00:03:02.120> now<00:03:02.180> I'm<00:03:02.600> just

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
feel like i might be going on a slightly

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.800 
feel like i might be going on a slightly
slower<00:04:30.340> pace<00:04:30.849> which<00:04:31.180> seems<00:04:31.419> to<00:04:31.479> be<00:04:31.570> an<00:04:31.720> issue

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
slower pace which seems to be an issue

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.260 
slower pace which seems to be an issue
and<00:04:32.169> also<00:04:32.380> occasionally<00:04:33.370> miss<00:04:33.970> clicking

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
and also occasionally miss clicking

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.689 
and also occasionally miss clicking
buttons<00:04:34.660> miss<00:04:35.139> clicking<00:04:35.440> buttons<00:04:35.800> i<00:04:36.009> think<00:04:36.490> is

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
buttons miss clicking buttons i think is

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.520 
buttons miss clicking buttons i think is
mostly<00:04:37.030> caused<00:04:37.270> by<00:04:37.509> the<00:04:37.570> fact<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.199> I've<00:04:38.349> got

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
mostly caused by the fact that I've got

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:46.430 
mostly caused by the fact that I've got
multiple<00:04:40.229> bindings<00:04:41.430> for<00:04:42.430> any<00:04:42.760> given<00:04:44.820> spa

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
multiple bindings for any given spa

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.960 
multiple bindings for any given spa
control<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:47.740> I'm<00:04:48.099> accidentally<00:04:48.789> hitting

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
control so I'm accidentally hitting

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.830 
control so I'm accidentally hitting
throwing<00:04:49.479> a<00:04:49.659> bomb<00:04:50.099> occasionally<00:04:51.099> but<00:04:51.750> for<00:04:52.750> the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
throwing a bomb occasionally but for the

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.170 
throwing a bomb occasionally but for the
most<00:04:52.960> part<00:04:53.080> this<00:04:53.710> is<00:04:53.770> essentially<00:04:54.400> just<00:04:54.430> play

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
most part this is essentially just play

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.550 
most part this is essentially just play
in<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.419> game<00:04:55.599> oh<00:04:57.690> my<00:04:58.690> gosh<00:04:58.900> I<00:04:59.080> did<00:04:59.229> it<00:04:59.320> again

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
in the game oh my gosh I did it again

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.700 
in the game oh my gosh I did it again
I'm<00:05:00.460> gonna<00:05:00.639> I<00:05:00.940> can't<00:05:01.419> switch<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:01.810> okay<00:05:02.620> I'm

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
I'm gonna I can't switch it okay I'm

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.870 
I'm gonna I can't switch it okay I'm
going<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:02.860> pause<00:05:03.099> and<00:05:03.550> then<00:05:03.639> I'm<00:05:03.729> going<00:05:03.849> to

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
going to pause and then I'm going to

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.140 
going to pause and then I'm going to
turn<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.090> off<00:05:04.360> because<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:04.840> just<00:05:05.050> want<00:05:05.500> to

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
turn that off because I just want to

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.129 
turn that off because I just want to
that's<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.330> one<00:05:07.449> that<00:05:07.539> I'm<00:05:07.659> having<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.050> most

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
that's the one that I'm having the most

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.420 
that's the one that I'm having the most
issues<00:05:08.500> with<00:05:08.680> so<00:05:08.830> I'm<00:05:08.919> just<00:05:09.039> going<00:05:09.159> to<00:05:09.220> clear

what's<00:05:56.520> the<00:05:56.610> mapping<00:05:56.970> on<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.240> 360<00:05:58.020> controller

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
what's the mapping on the 360 controller

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.290 
what's the mapping on the 360 controller
is<00:05:58.500> it<00:05:58.680> the<00:05:59.010> other<00:05:59.040> way<00:05:59.250> like<00:05:59.730> is<00:05:59.850> that<00:06:00.000> why<00:06:00.150> I'm

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
is it the other way like is that why I'm

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:13.750 
is it the other way like is that why I'm
screwing<00:06:00.750> up

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.170 

ok

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
ok

ok
oh<00:06:16.320> shoot

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:33.920 

and<00:06:28.970> that<00:06:29.970> was<00:06:30.380> the<00:06:31.380> game<00:06:32.420> dying<00:06:33.420> because<00:06:33.720> I

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
and that was the game dying because I

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.070 
and that was the game dying because I
was<00:06:34.260> being<00:06:34.500> silly<00:06:34.770> and<00:06:35.900> making<00:06:36.900> a<00:06:36.930> few

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
was being silly and making a few

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.500 
was being silly and making a few
mistakes<00:06:37.260> early<00:06:37.500> on<00:06:37.880> but<00:06:38.880> definitely<00:06:39.390> not

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
mistakes early on but definitely not

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.330 
mistakes early on but definitely not
having<00:06:40.290> significant<00:06:40.890> issues<00:06:41.100> of<00:06:41.250> the

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
having significant issues of the

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.630 
having significant issues of the
controller<00:06:41.670> as<00:06:41.850> I<00:06:42.690> improve<00:06:43.260> and<00:06:43.740> start

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
controller as I improve and start

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.040 
controller as I improve and start
getting<00:06:45.450> more<00:06:45.540> comfortable<00:06:45.720> with<00:06:45.930> the

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
getting more comfortable with the

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.570 
getting more comfortable with the
controller<00:06:46.350> I<00:06:46.560> think<00:06:47.070> that<00:06:47.130> this<00:06:47.280> is<00:06:47.340> a

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
controller I think that this is a

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.850 
controller I think that this is a
completely<00:06:48.270> reasonable<00:06:48.840> way<00:06:49.290> to<00:06:49.320> play

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
completely reasonable way to play

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.920 
completely reasonable way to play
spelunky<00:06:50.180> definitely<00:06:51.180> not<00:06:51.300> I<00:06:51.540> don't<00:06:51.780> feel

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
spelunky definitely not I don't feel

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.170 
spelunky definitely not I don't feel
like<00:06:52.050> it<00:06:52.170> added<00:06:52.500> anything<00:06:52.740> over<00:06:53.280> the<00:06:53.430> 360

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
like it added anything over the 360

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.940 
like it added anything over the 360
controller<00:06:54.480> at<00:06:54.630> least<00:06:54.780> right<00:06:54.930> now<00:06:54.960> but<00:06:55.740> it's

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
controller at least right now but it's

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.210 
controller at least right now but it's
not<00:06:56.400> at<00:06:56.520> all<00:06:56.610> an<00:06:56.880> issue<00:06:57.440> so<00:06:58.440> thank<00:06:58.890> you<00:06:58.980> so<00:06:59.100> much
