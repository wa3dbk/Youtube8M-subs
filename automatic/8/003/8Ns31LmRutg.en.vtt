don't judge it by its outside
I<00:00:11.509> mean<00:00:12.509> exterior<00:00:13.259> whatever<00:00:13.650> now<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.880> get

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
I mean exterior whatever now I get

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.540 
I mean exterior whatever now I get
inside<00:00:15.780> here<00:00:16.789> becomes<00:00:17.789> bigger<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.990> see<00:00:19.140> this

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
inside here becomes bigger you see this

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.720 
inside here becomes bigger you see this
yeah<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.939> house<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.420> very<00:00:21.960> awesome<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.730> fit

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
yeah this house is very awesome and fit

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.570 
yeah this house is very awesome and fit
see<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.000> very<00:00:24.330> awesome<00:00:24.689> statue<00:00:25.019> there<00:00:25.580> now

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
see that very awesome statue there now

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.269 
see that very awesome statue there now
let<00:00:26.820> me<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.119> get<00:00:27.750> back<00:00:27.810> outside<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:31.279> beat

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
let me just get back outside and beat

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.389 
let me just get back outside and beat
you<00:00:32.489> how<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.880> works<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.890> way<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.070> works

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
you how this works so the way this works

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.310 
you how this works so the way this works
is<00:00:35.870> there's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.370> very<00:00:38.370> fast<00:00:38.700> clock<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.390> see

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
is there's a very fast clock here see

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.869 
is there's a very fast clock here see
this<00:00:40.469> -<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:43.350> act<00:00:43.590> as

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
this - this one and this one they act as

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.290 
this - this one and this one they act as
very<00:00:44.879> fast<00:00:45.180> clock<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.039> then<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.370> clan

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
very fast clock and then this clan

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.240 
very fast clock and then this clan
blocks<00:00:48.570> are<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.770> ones<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.160> test<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:51.000> if

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
blocks are the ones that test for if

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.910 
blocks are the ones that test for if
there's<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.660> player<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.899> steps<00:00:55.230> either<00:00:55.649> in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
there's a player that steps either in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.639 
there's a player that steps either in
this<00:00:56.100> block<00:00:56.340> or<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:57.059> book<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.649> teleports

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
this block or this book and teleports

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:07.340 
this block or this book and teleports
them<00:00:58.829> relatively<00:01:00.320> into<00:01:02.780> here<00:01:04.280> see<00:01:06.350> there's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
them relatively into here see there's

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.710 
them relatively into here see there's
actually<00:01:07.590> two<00:01:08.070> houses<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:09.240> actually

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
actually two houses and what actually

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.380 
actually two houses and what actually
happens<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.260> when<00:01:12.080> I<00:01:13.670> step<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> block<00:01:15.150> in

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
happens is when I step on a block in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.260 
happens is when I step on a block in
here<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:17.159> della<00:01:17.400> points<00:01:17.700> me<00:01:17.820> there

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
here it della points me there

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.080 
here it della points me there
so<00:01:18.420> making<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.080> seem<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.740> bigger<00:01:20.090> but

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so making it seem like it's bigger but

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.859 
so making it seem like it's bigger but
the<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.409> clock<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.920> very<00:01:23.250> fast<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.570> seems

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the the clock is very fast so it seems

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.780 
the the clock is very fast so it seems
like<00:01:24.990> I'm<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:26.130> actually<00:01:26.340> teleported<00:01:28.640> let<00:01:29.640> me

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
like I'm not actually teleported let me

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.499 
like I'm not actually teleported let me
show<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.150> commands<00:01:30.799> see<00:01:31.820> I'm<00:01:32.820> teleported

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
show you the commands see I'm teleported

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.410 
show you the commands see I'm teleported
relatively<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:35.310> parameters<00:01:35.970> that's

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
relatively and these parameters that's

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:45.450 
relatively and these parameters that's
for<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.200> step<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> block

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.740 

now<00:01:45.970> let<00:01:46.150> me<00:01:46.270> show<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.450> again<00:01:46.780> how<00:01:47.770> it<00:01:47.920> works

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
now let me show you again how it works

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.240 
now let me show you again how it works
hey<00:01:49.750> get<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.530> here<00:01:51.210> step<00:01:52.210> somewhere<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:54.130> it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
hey get in here step somewhere and it

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.370 
hey get in here step somewhere and it
gets<00:01:54.490> bigger<00:01:54.760> see<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:56.850> now<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.930> this<00:01:59.140> bigger

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
gets bigger see that now in this bigger

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.240 
gets bigger see that now in this bigger
one<00:01:59.700> simply<00:02:00.700> I<00:02:00.729> just<00:02:01.120> step<00:02:01.450> in<00:02:01.600> here<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.250> I'm

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
one simply I just step in here and I'm

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.840 
one simply I just step in here and I'm
teleported<00:02:03.850> back<00:02:04.000> out<00:02:04.210> here<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.040> smaller

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
teleported back out here to the smaller

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.530 
teleported back out here to the smaller
one<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.709> also<00:02:08.709> have<00:02:09.039> something<00:02:09.580> here<00:02:11.310> another

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
one I also have something here another

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.770 
one I also have something here another
command<00:02:13.540> center<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.530> seems<00:02:14.830> small<00:02:14.980> but<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.780> get

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
command center it seems small but I get

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.140 
command center it seems small but I get
inside<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:19.530> becomes<00:02:20.530> bigger<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:22.030> what

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
inside here becomes bigger see what

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.110 
inside here becomes bigger see what
happens<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.650> very<00:02:23.980> fast<00:02:24.280> teleportation

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
happens it's a very fast teleportation

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.400 
happens it's a very fast teleportation
caused<00:02:26.050> by<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.320> very<00:02:26.709> fast<00:02:27.040> clock<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:29.230> this

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
caused by a very fast clock and this

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.260 
caused by a very fast clock and this
guy's<00:02:29.709> thanks<00:02:30.100> for<00:02:30.370> watching<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.970> hope<00:02:31.000> you
