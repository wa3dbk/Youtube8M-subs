00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.960
 we are well aware of one of the main 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.050
 laws of nature conservation law 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.810
 energy conversion 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.089
 according to this energy law hell 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.719
 can not arise without anything else there 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.769
 one more without a trace she can only 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.270
 transform from one species to another 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.740
 at the same time in equivalent 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.359
 quantities 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.789
 mechanical energy can turn into 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.669
 thermal heat energy can 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.109
 turn into mechanical but 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.710
 there is still 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.179
 1 law 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.230
 thermodynamics is another law of nature 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.420
 mechanical energy 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.510
 you can completely turn it into heat 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.020
 energy while the reverse process 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.660
 complete conversion of heat energy to 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.540
 mechanical impossible 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.980
 so in any heat engine in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.860
 any heat engine in which 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.430
 transformation occurs 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.770
 mechanical 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.630
 turning heat energy heaters into 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.110
 mechanical 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.630
 the energy 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.700
 m necessarily present except 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.850
 ag heater which gives its heat 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.630
 working substance 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.580
 sure there is another one 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.600
 element is another part of the engine so 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630
 called refrigerator 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.700
 refrigerators g working stuff 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.330
 gives away 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.690
 its thermal 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.410
 energy 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.380
 which she received from the heating 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.920
 that way any 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.570
 thermal engine have heaters 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.890
 working substance their refrigerator 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.800
 we will show you straight daily 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.730
 engines 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.110
 in the first model 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.110
 heater is 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.470
 electric lamp 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.659
 incandescent 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.530
 which shines below 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.920
 she heats while in the vessel 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.479
 the vessel is a bone share 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.390
 pasty substance 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.820
 matter of gas supply but substance 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.200
 almost equal to fluid density 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.890
 and when the lamp heats it 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.409
 pasty substances but 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.060
 expanding becomes 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.380
 less dense 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.230
 what are those who are 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.769
 here for buoyancy 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.149
 Archimedes Vasily rises 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.979
 when she rises 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.829
 but but getting into the colder ones of your soul and 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:17.869
 to let 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:20.039
 and gives here 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.699
 thermal energy 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.689
 comes top layers 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.680
 fluid in contact with 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.869
 the atmosphere 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.419
 so in this thermal model 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:31.799
 engine heater 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.660
 is incandescent 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.900
 the fridge is airy 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.839
 atmosphere 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.679
 and the working substance of the working body 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.819
 is the payment so pasty 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.259
 substance 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:44.719
 heater 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.699
 commits 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.960
 work to move the base of matter has risen 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.840
 turning 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.750
 heat count by turning 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.549
 thermal energy to mechanical on the part 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:56.669
 thermal 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.590
 parts of the board are required 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.269
 given is transmitted from the surrounding 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.829
 air fridge 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.669
 second model of heat engine 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.829
 is this swing 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.299
 this vessel 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.150
 Turin Greek poured warm water and 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.439
 warm water here is 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.399
 heater 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:17.509
 the refrigerator as before is 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.589
 air atmosphere 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:23.429
 yourself wanted are arranged like this 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:24.679
 two cameras 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.619
 top current moment 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:28.209
 this is the bottom 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.599
 now these two will not be swapped 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.269
 cameras with these tubes 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.889
 from chambers to petra their way is baked air and me 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.969
 camera and tube camera tube 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.859
 filled evaporating 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.349
 liquid to pensioners 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.680
 when the camera 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.739
 getting into 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.710
 hot water to warm water 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.619
 kefir heats up quickly evaporates 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:52.679
 and damaging the world 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:55.549
 evaporated crushes on liquid firms 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.599
 pushing the bugs broadcast from the bottom camera 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.799
 top 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.479
 as fluid is pressed through the ring 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.010
 chamber liquid mass upper chamber 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.810
 is increasing 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.849
 and at some point the investigation camera 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.069
 outweighs whether to solve any 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.069
 the camera goes down the process repeats 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.629
 in this model of heat engine 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:20.259
 as I already said 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.809
 watering imim is hot water 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.080
 fridge airy atmosphere 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.880
 as a working substance 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.350
 is kefir 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.340
 filling out
