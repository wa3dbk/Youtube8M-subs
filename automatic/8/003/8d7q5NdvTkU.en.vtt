00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.199 
fingers so I don't know where this is
often<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:14.250> sometimes<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.700> just<00:03:14.879> want<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.090> wear

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
often but sometimes I just want to wear

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.199 
often but sometimes I just want to wear
a<00:03:15.239> ring<00:03:15.419> there<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.639> just<00:03:17.639> because<00:03:17.879> I<00:03:17.970> think<00:03:18.030> it

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
a ring there and just because I think it

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.420 
a ring there and just because I think it
looks<00:03:18.359> good<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.229> there's<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.829> ring<00:03:20.220> too

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
looks good and so there's that ring too

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.460 
looks good and so there's that ring too
that<00:03:20.699> has<00:03:20.819> this<00:03:21.030> called<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.479> wave<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.379> you

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
that has this called the wave and you

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.629 
that has this called the wave and you
kind<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.680> see<00:03:22.859> that<00:03:22.889> there's<00:03:23.159> little<00:03:23.400> wave

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
kind of see that there's little wave

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.750 
kind of see that there's little wave
things<00:03:23.940> going<00:03:24.299> on<00:03:24.440> then<00:03:25.440> rings<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.430> have<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> hard
