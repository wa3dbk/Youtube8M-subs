00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.530
 actually, classic roadsters come from just one country wenglor 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.110
 but in the late thirties 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.940
 a sporty monster from Bavaria taught the competition from the island 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.689
 to fear 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.689
 the BMW i3 28 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.770
 Never let go for teens car so choose or nasty little one 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:35.690
 Lanes of Moerser rank 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.540
 that can give a nice feeling that you have sent your car the whole 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.190
 to undermine was very exhausting though 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.970
 none of these at these three 28 years he gave the defense she decides 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.560
 now they all have come 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.820
 take part in the company 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.820
 and after pre-war models feels nothing here 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.930
 not the efforts of marketing strategists for one 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.500
 werwerächtchtige draft horse 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 So racing is inspired by the powerful 3 28 80 hp from 2 liters 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.430
 Displacement that was a real sensation back then 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.960
 otherwise the liters are between 20 and 30 HP 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.350
 The 6-cylinder power line racing cars will even reach up to 135 hp Kitchen 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.340
 with the 3 28 Schleck BMW 1936 a new sports car chapter on 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.980
 The compact two-seater sets standards in terms of road holding 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.320
 Handiness and temperament 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.939
 The two-fold sports cars of the competition have the disadvantage 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.340
 the 3 28 dominates its motorsport class so much that this 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.250
 Race to real BMW makes cups advised 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.250
 who does not drive 3 28 has lost from the outset 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.760
 in the Mille Miglia, too, Huschke von Hanstein and elsewhere were added 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.760
 in the middle of 1940 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.539
 the övp car market is just fun 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.800
 one notices that we the athletes with the cities engines twenties on the 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.769
 Racetrack Reus is successful 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.680
 However, a little different from different convertible body with 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.770
 this value supernaturally you pass away 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.890
 how do you think today consumer area thought the youngest 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.350
 was very small and if you look at these forms of the Kepler my so 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.020
 Zechner the Englishman was far from lacking this body comes to 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.269
 Example of Ute Klein Berger from Munich so also in terms of he 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.589
 you could build beautiful cars 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:50.319
 The Bavarian bodywork vineyards succeed in creating an attractive mix 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.759
 Sports cars and luxury cars Mio 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:56.649
 Once again in the standard roadster, the bonnet is secured by leather straps 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.919
 and the rear wheels clad by sheet metal inserts 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:07.009
 464 times he will build three 28 only 59 get with external body Dengler 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.949
 and its structure like our model from the time house of the Autostadt in Wolfsburg 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.339
 Ergonomics was at that time a widely unknown foreign word the flat doors 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:19.339
 and the huge stone standing steering wheel tight like a corset 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.930
 The beautiful Bayer Mobile is the incarnation of the Roadster Thought 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.729
 View of the magnificent six-cylinder in-line engine a single 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.059
 Provisional for the Fritz Schleicher head of development of BMW motorcycles 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.729
 Papering in the early thirties is a pure trigger as well 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:46.029
 The engines base provides the 50 hp BMW 3 26 through the complex 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.559
 Aluminum cylinder head with hemispherical combustion chambers and the 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:51.980
 unusual control of the exhaust valves 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.180
 tickle define proud 80 hp from the 3 28 a six-cylinder 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:01.829
 So the BMW 3 Series has 28 records 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.829
 By no means set up just four times 64 pieces were built 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.119
 but in his motorsport class he was in the 30s battling 4 Kahle 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.920
 überflieger 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.129
 and has clearly sunk its competition 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.039
 and this has to do with a technical masterpiece that shows 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.930
 even today if you drive this car 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.099
 so far this car is 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.099
 definitely a milestone 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.379
 the BMW i3 28 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:29.839
 motorsport can be so beautiful
