00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.750
 ah 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.289
 very good everyone here we are in a 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.470
 new delivery of texture packages 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.060
 for our minecraft in its version 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:26.630
 0.10 point 5 this version is called the 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.630
 dan de lyon well this texture has 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.669
 looked like it 's a very pretty texture and 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.570
 to see what we are going to do a review 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.910
 quickly and then nothing here I leave 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.100
 with this I will not talk much so 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.110
 I leave you a little music so that 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.110
 see how this texture package goes 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.490
 i 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.590
 very well and the truth this package of 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.540
 textures I think it's very very 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.200
 well the truth is very beautiful very 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.300
 picturesque and I really liked the style 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.180
 that has as I do not know of wrapping 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.540
 Candy is pretty the finishes 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.070
 they are very good and then I simply 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.300
 love I love it is a texture that 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.970
 it is very well achieved 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.509
 graphically so that it was a texture 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.280
 hd but it is not 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.959
 and well here we have the section the 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.819
 flowers that are very cool seriously 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.090
 Pretty nice for but I liked 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.090
 quite 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.760
 very good on that side we have the guys 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.939
 of wool as you can see they have a 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.010
 very beautiful texture which does not stop 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.450
 decorating a house inside would be very 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.330
 all right 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:45.239
 here the part of the rails and good for 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.239
 last here what would be the crops 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.070
 the area of â€‹â€‹crops and quickly 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.810
 now what would be the most downloaded 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.250
 well it does not matter then I'm going to 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.170
 show what a modality would be 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.200
 survival here as you can see a map 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.670
 loaded it looks very nice to the map and it 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.450
 I'm going to show some little things that 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.450
 they come here quickly 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.860
 we did not want the sword 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.000
 these are the different types of 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.000
 swords as you can see 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.950
 well now I 'm going to show you here what 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.950
 the compass would be the compass and the arrow 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.960
 the compass 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.390
 and the clock 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.160
 ready to finish I'll show you 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.800
 what would the mods be 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.720
 as you can see no way they change for 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.730
 nothing your textures package that does not have 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.150
 never any change in what would be the 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.299
 ways 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.069
 If I made a small change, it's here 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.090
 in the leander man that is where I am 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.090
 fascinates how it looks 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.950
 and the spider I think it will damage 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.950
 Spider 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.459
 and the yellow-eyed spider and good that 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.319
 yes all for that package of textures the 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.569
 I hope in the next one and if you liked it already

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.239
