groups<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.160> far<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> get<00:00:35.850> an<00:00:35.969> idea<00:00:36.059> for

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
groups so far just to get an idea for

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.600 
groups so far just to get an idea for
how<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.719> feels<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> little<00:00:37.980> buggy<00:00:38.280> right

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.780 
how it feels it is a little buggy right
now<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.059> hopefully<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.989> will<00:00:40.079> work<00:00:40.140> through

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
now so hopefully it will work through

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.979 
now so hopefully it will work through
but<00:00:41.790> let's<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.149> ahead<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.870> come
