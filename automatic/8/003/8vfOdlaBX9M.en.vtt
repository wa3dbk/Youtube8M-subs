00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.890 
it kind of looks messy and dirty even
though<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.400> often<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.270> should<00:01:36.450> take<00:01:36.630> off<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900

though and often you should take off the
outside<00:01:37.020> leaf<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:39.090> could<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
outside leaf because that could be the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.230 
outside leaf because that could be the
dirtiest<00:01:39.930> one<00:01:40.140> could<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.530> most<00:01:41.400> probably<00:01:41.700> it's

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
dirtiest one could it most probably it's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.399 
dirtiest one could it most probably it's
dirtier<00:01:42.600> than<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> inside<00:01:43.229> ones<00:01:44.270> just<00:01:45.270> like

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
dirtier than the inside ones just like

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.620 
dirtier than the inside ones just like
your<00:01:46.409> clothes<00:01:46.649> oh<00:01:47.210> maybe<00:01:48.210> not

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
your clothes oh maybe not

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.569 
your clothes oh maybe not
you're<00:01:49.259> dirty<00:01:49.380> from<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> inside<00:01:50.009> out<00:01:50.189> well

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you're dirty from the inside out well

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.580 
you're dirty from the inside out well
anyway<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.509> lettuce<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> outsides<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
anyway with lettuce the outsides the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.969 
anyway with lettuce the outsides the
dirtiest<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.549> take<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.970> one<00:01:54.119> off<00:01:54.799> put<00:01:55.799> water

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
dirtiest so take that one off put water

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.469 
dirtiest so take that one off put water
in<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.659> get<00:01:57.659> water<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:02:00.000> rinse<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.329> for

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
in it get water out you can rinse it for

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.840 
in it get water out you can rinse it for
30<00:02:00.689> seconds<00:02:01.140> would<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.469> good<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.860> then<00:02:01.920> put<00:02:02.759> it

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
30 seconds would be good and then put it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.200 
30 seconds would be good and then put it
in<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.090> nice<00:02:03.299> storage<00:02:04.049> container

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
in a nice storage container

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.869
