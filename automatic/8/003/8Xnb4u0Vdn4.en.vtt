00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
very brief acquaintance but BMW think

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.840 
very brief acquaintance but BMW think
it's<00:02:53.510> going<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.750> sell<00:02:53.959> like<00:02:54.170> hotcakes<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:55.430> at

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
twenty two thousand to thirty thousand I

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.660 
twenty two thousand to thirty thousand I
think<00:02:58.220> they<00:02:58.700> might<00:02:58.910> well<00:02:59.180> be<00:02:59.420> right
