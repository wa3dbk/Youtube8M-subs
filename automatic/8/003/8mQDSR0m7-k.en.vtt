00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
interesting thing about the Cayenne is

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.120 
interesting thing about the Cayenne is
of<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.310> range<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:19.330> range<00:01:19.710> starts<00:01:20.710> from<00:01:20.920> the

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
of the range the range starts from the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.250 
of the range the range starts from the
the<00:01:21.370> v6<00:01:21.790> which<00:01:21.970> is<00:01:22.120> around<00:01:22.330> 50<00:01:22.660> thousand<00:01:23.110> right

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
the v6 which is around 50 thousand right

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.900 
the v6 which is around 50 thousand right
up<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.680> Turbo<00:01:24.040> S<00:01:24.070> which<00:01:24.370> is<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.550> hundred<00:01:24.760> and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
up to the Turbo S which is a hundred and

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.000 
up to the Turbo S which is a hundred and
fifty<00:01:25.210> thousand<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:26.080> there's<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.320> real<00:01:26.560> broad

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
fifty thousand so there's a real broad

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.360 
fifty thousand so there's a real broad
range<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.490> base<00:01:27.670> price<00:01:28.000> there<00:01:28.980> three<00:01:29.980> times<00:01:30.160> as

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
range of base price there three times as

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.860 
range of base price there three times as
much<00:01:30.520> for<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:30.910> top<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.240> model<00:01:31.390> from<00:01:31.690> there

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
much for the top of the model from there

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.290 
much for the top of the model from there
from<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.200> lowest<00:01:32.350> model<00:01:32.800> and<00:01:33.760> within<00:01:34.090> that

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
from the lowest model and within that

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.920 
from the lowest model and within that
range<00:01:34.510> I've<00:01:34.810> got<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.080> drive<00:01:35.200> quite<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.500> few<00:01:35.740> and

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.250 
like the best is this one the diesel and
the<00:01:43.840> reason<00:01:44.110> for<00:01:44.230> that<00:01:44.290> is<00:01:44.590> well<00:01:45.400> the<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:47.020> s

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
the reason for that is well the the s

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.850 
the reason for that is well the the s
and<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.830> GTS<00:01:48.460> are<00:01:49.360> lovely<00:01:49.659> cars<00:01:49.900> they've<00:01:50.740> both

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
know this is an SUV and so horsepower is

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.740 
know this is an SUV and so horsepower is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
get into the turbos that you starts you

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.469

start<00:02:08.830> getting<00:02:09.069> more<00:02:09.280> talk<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.789> so<00:02:10.269> that's

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
start getting more talk and so that's

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.899 
start getting more talk and so that's
what<00:02:10.659> makes<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.989> diesel<00:02:11.379> not<00:02:11.799> only<00:02:12.219> a<00:02:12.400> lovely

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
what makes the diesel not only a lovely

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.699 
what makes the diesel not only a lovely
car<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.150> drive<00:02:13.359> but<00:02:13.930> it's<00:02:14.079> also<00:02:14.170> very<00:02:14.290> fuel

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
car to drive but it's also very fuel

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.070 
car to drive but it's also very fuel
efficient<00:02:15.129> you<00:02:15.219> know

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
efficient you know

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.750 
efficient you know
when<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.260> fill<00:02:17.500> up<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.680> tank<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.190> diesel<00:02:18.580> I

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
when I fill up the tank and the diesel I

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.160 
when I fill up the tank and the diesel I
see<00:02:19.360> 500<00:02:20.050> or<00:02:20.200> more<00:02:20.410> miles<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.950> range<00:02:22.140> because<00:02:23.140> it

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
see 500 or more miles a range because it

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.490 
see 500 or more miles a range because it
can<00:02:23.440> get<00:02:23.590> 29<00:02:24.460> miles<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.600> gallon

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
can get 29 miles to the gallon

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.890 
can get 29 miles to the gallon
even<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.370> hybrid<00:02:27.970> model<00:02:28.180> only<00:02:28.600> gets<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.870> think

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
even the hybrid model only gets I think

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.400 
even the hybrid model only gets I think
24<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.250> in<00:02:30.520> my<00:02:31.210> mind<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.840> always<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.140> bit<00:02:32.320> of

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
24 so in my mind that is always a bit of

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.230 
24 so in my mind that is always a bit of
a<00:02:32.500> hidden<00:02:32.830> gem<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.550> second<00:02:33.910> cheapest

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
a hidden gem it's the second cheapest

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.390 
a hidden gem it's the second cheapest
model<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:34.720> it's<00:02:35.230> one<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.530> nicest<00:02:36.040> models

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
model and it's one of the nicest models

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
to drive and that's why I'm reviewing

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.260 
to drive and that's why I'm reviewing
the<00:02:38.290> diesel<00:02:38.680> because<00:02:39.040> it's<00:02:39.640> my<00:02:39.790> favorite

noticed<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.970> improvement<00:03:52.510> in<00:03:52.600> handling

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
noticed is the improvement in handling

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.400 
noticed is the improvement in handling
over<00:03:53.410> previous<00:03:53.920> models<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:55.540> particular<00:03:55.989> car

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
over previous models this particular car

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.380 
over previous models this particular car
doesn't<00:03:56.709> have<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:56.920> air<00:03:57.040> suspension<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.940> it

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
doesn't have the air suspension and it

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.340 
doesn't have the air suspension and it
handles<00:03:58.540> very<00:03:58.750> well<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.980> used<00:04:00.160> to<00:04:00.310> be<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:01.450> used<00:04:02.110> I

earlier to regs and air suspension was a
must<00:04:09.489> these<00:04:09.790> days<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.450> think<00:04:10.600> you<00:04:11.530> can<00:04:11.680> do<00:04:11.860> it

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
must these days I think you can do it

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.920 
must these days I think you can do it
out<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.310> air<00:04:12.430> suspension<00:04:12.880> because<00:04:13.299> it

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
out the air suspension because it

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.449 
out the air suspension because it
handles<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:14.560> well

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.620 

taking<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.549> look<00:04:20.640> at<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.850> from<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.120> outside<00:04:21.390> I

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
taking a look at it from the outside I

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
taking a look at it from the outside I
think<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:21.989> is<00:04:22.110> one<00:04:22.230> of<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.410> better-looking
