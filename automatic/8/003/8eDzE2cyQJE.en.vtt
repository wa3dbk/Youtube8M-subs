00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that's pretty simple like really simple

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.539 
that's pretty simple like really simple
comparing<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> ticketed<00:01:26.700> or<00:01:26.869> put<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> back<00:01:28.110> on

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
comparing the ticketed or put it back on

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.440 
comparing the ticketed or put it back on
putting<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.640> back<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.090> definitely<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> lot

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
putting it back on it's definitely a lot

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.929 
putting it back on it's definitely a lot
harder<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:32.310> you're<00:01:32.400> gonna<00:01:32.490> need<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> do

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
harder but what you're gonna need to do

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.580 
harder but what you're gonna need to do
is<00:01:34.009> pull<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.040> charging<00:01:35.579> handle<00:01:35.729> back<00:01:36.590> just

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
is pull the charging handle back just

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.090 
is pull the charging handle back just
basically<00:01:40.250> what's<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> called<00:01:41.869> recycling

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
basically what's it called recycling

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.969 
basically what's it called recycling
step<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> guess<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.579> could<00:01:44.700> say<00:01:45.409> alright<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
step so I guess you could say alright so

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.749 
step so I guess you could say alright so
to<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.659> pull<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.750> back<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.700> when<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
to do that pull this back and when you

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.300 
to do that pull this back and when you
put<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.119> on

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.510 

you<00:01:55.310> put<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.580> on<00:01:55.700> you're<00:01:56.480> gonna<00:01:56.630> sure<00:01:57.520> click

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
you put it on you're gonna sure click

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.500 
you put it on you're gonna sure click
just<00:01:59.210> like<00:01:59.480> that<00:01:59.950> then<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.310> means<00:02:01.790> that<00:02:02.180> it's

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
just like that then that means that it's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.060 
just like that then that means that it's
locked<00:02:02.690> in<00:02:02.930> place<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:04.040> that<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:04.400> can<00:02:06.070> safely

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
locked in place and that you can safely

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.150 
locked in place and that you can safely
put<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.550> back<00:02:07.670> on<00:02:08.440> then<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.740> can<00:02:09.800> just<00:02:09.979> let<00:02:10.130> the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
put it back on then you can just let the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.120 
put it back on then you can just let the
charging<00:02:10.550> handle<00:02:10.580> go<00:02:10.910> once<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:12.080> there<00:02:12.970> fully

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
charging handle go once it's there fully

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.720 
charging handle go once it's there fully
all<00:02:16.130> right<00:02:16.310> so<00:02:17.210> that's<00:02:17.450> how<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.750> um<00:02:18.460> take<00:02:19.460> on
