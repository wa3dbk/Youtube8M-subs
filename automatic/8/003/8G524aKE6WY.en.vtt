minutes run time there's no need for any

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.500 
minutes run time there's no need for any
of<00:00:36.989> these<00:00:37.140> extra<00:00:37.980> features<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.239> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of these extra features on this one and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.510 
of these extra features on this one and
I'm<00:00:39.660> using<00:00:39.870> white<00:00:40.200> vinegar<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> fabric<00:00:41.280> song

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I'm using white vinegar as a fabric song

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.450 
I'm using white vinegar as a fabric song
so<00:00:42.030> it'll<00:00:42.239> look<00:00:42.300> good<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:44.100> press

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
so it'll look good so we just press

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.130 
so it'll look good so we just press
Start<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.340> there<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.430> go

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
Start and there we go

00:00:48.140 --> 00:01:07.340 
Start and there we go
she's<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> filling

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.300 

now<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.250> happen<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:09.090> it'll<00:01:10.020> fill<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
now what will happen is it'll fill for a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.399 
now what will happen is it'll fill for a
little<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.030> then<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.870> drum<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.229> rotate

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
little bit and then the drum will rotate

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.890 
little bit and then the drum will rotate
and<00:01:13.979> wet<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.400> fabric<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.210> then<00:01:15.390> it'll<00:01:15.630> feel<00:01:15.870> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
and wet the fabric and then it'll feel a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.290 
and wet the fabric and then it'll feel a
bit<00:01:16.140> more<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.590> rotate<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> bit<00:01:17.160> more<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.790> so

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
bit more and rotate a bit more and so

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.570 
bit more and rotate a bit more and so
what<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.630> does<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.530> only<00:01:19.710> uses<00:01:20.070> enough

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
what that does is that only uses enough

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.270 
what that does is that only uses enough
water<00:01:20.910> see<00:01:21.570> there<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.869> go

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
water see there we go

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.950 
water see there we go
and<00:01:23.280> only<00:01:23.520> easily<00:01:23.850> whatever<00:01:24.360> amount<00:01:24.690> of<00:01:24.750> water

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and only easily whatever amount of water

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.040 
and only easily whatever amount of water
is<00:01:25.140> actually<00:01:25.320> needed<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.160> coat<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.640> fabric<00:01:27.050> in

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
is actually needed to coat the fabric in

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.140 
is actually needed to coat the fabric in
a<00:01:28.200> certain<00:01:28.590> amount<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:29.009> water<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.580> have<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
a certain amount of water and have a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.930 
a certain amount of water and have a
little<00:01:30.390> bit<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> drum<00:01:31.050> at<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> bottom<00:01:31.940> so

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
little bit in the drum at the bottom so

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.030 
little bit in the drum at the bottom so
I<00:01:33.300> think<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.259> good<00:01:34.590> feature

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
I think that's very good feature

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.749 
I think that's very good feature
there<00:01:35.190> we<00:01:35.250> go<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.670> filling<00:01:36.030> some<00:01:36.240> more

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
there we go it's filling some more

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.940 
there we go it's filling some more
obviously<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.810> sheets<00:01:40.080> take<00:01:40.440> up<00:01:40.649> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
obviously as the sheets take up the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.820 
obviously as the sheets take up the
water<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:42.030> level<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> drum<00:01:42.899> below<00:01:43.320> will

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
water the level in the drum below will

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.730 
water the level in the drum below will
drop<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.910> the<00:01:45.630> machine<00:01:45.930> continues<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:46.560> fill

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
drop and the machine continues to fill

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.940 
drop and the machine continues to fill
up<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.100> level<00:01:47.280> until<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.000> clothes<00:01:48.240> are

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
up to that level until the clothes are

00:01:48.950 --> 00:03:27.750 
up to that level until the clothes are
saturated

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.660 

well<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.480> was<00:03:28.599> exciting<00:03:29.349> they<00:03:30.159> seem<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.519> be

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
well that was exciting they seem to be

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.880 
well that was exciting they seem to be
washing<00:03:31.090> quite<00:03:31.330> well<00:03:31.540> here<00:03:31.750> I'll<00:03:32.470> come<00:03:32.860> back

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
washing quite well here I'll come back

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.720 
washing quite well here I'll come back
later<00:03:33.280> with<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.610> spins<00:03:33.909> and<00:03:34.420> rinse
