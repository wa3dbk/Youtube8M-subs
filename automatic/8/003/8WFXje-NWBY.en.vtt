of this products about 15 years with a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.190 
of this products about 15 years with a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.250 

and<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.180> basically<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> Jandy<00:01:58.020> check

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
and so basically what a Jandy check

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.960 
and so basically what a Jandy check
value<00:01:58.650> would<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.890> take<00:01:59.100> off<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.760> check

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
value would just take off the check

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.750 
value would just take off the check
valve<00:02:00.000> itself<00:02:00.690> by<00:02:01.110> removing<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.560> screws<00:02:01.890> he

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
valve itself by removing the screws he

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.880 
valve itself by removing the screws he
would<00:02:02.910> drop<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.330> flow<00:02:04.080> of<00:02:04.110> his<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.620> in<00:02:04.800> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
would drop the flow of his in in the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.320 
would drop the flow of his in in the
same<00:02:05.070> direction<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.700> check<00:02:05.880> valve<00:02:05.910> was

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.000 
facing another common check valve that
you're<00:02:08.940> gonna<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.420> made<00:02:09.630> by<00:02:09.810> Pentair<00:02:10.290> the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
you're gonna see is made by Pentair the

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.210 
you're gonna see is made by Pentair the
clove<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.970> will<00:02:12.180> not<00:02:12.300> fit<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.630> Pentair<00:02:13.020> one<00:02:13.290> in

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
clove is will not fit the Pentair one in

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.190 
clove is will not fit the Pentair one in
at<00:02:14.370> Elfi<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.850> pintail<00:02:15.240> check<00:02:15.600> valve

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
at Elfi of a pintail check valve

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.870 
at Elfi of a pintail check valve
you'll<00:02:16.710> see<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> word<00:02:17.160> Pentair<00:02:17.610> written

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you'll see the word Pentair written

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.240 
you'll see the word Pentair written
across<00:02:18.060> there<00:02:18.480> if<00:02:19.320> you're<00:02:19.530> unsure<00:02:19.650> because

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
across there if you're unsure because

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.820 
across there if you're unsure because
the<00:02:20.460> plastic<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.060> ruined<00:02:21.510> by<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.660> Sun<00:02:22.020> it

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the plastic is ruined by the Sun it

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.320 
the plastic is ruined by the Sun it
could<00:02:22.950> actually<00:02:23.280> take<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.670> check<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.090> out

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
could actually take the check that out

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.180 
could actually take the check that out
and<00:02:24.690> look<00:02:24.840> at<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.050> flap<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.040> what<00:02:26.160> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
and look at the flap this is what a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.630 
and look at the flap this is what a
Pentair<00:02:26.670> check<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.600> flapper<00:02:27.930> looks<00:02:28.230> like

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
Pentair check that flapper looks like

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.280 
Pentair check that flapper looks like
here's<00:02:29.640> what<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:29.940> Jandy<00:02:30.210> flapper<00:02:30.900> looks<00:02:31.080> like

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
here's what the Jandy flapper looks like

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.130 
here's what the Jandy flapper looks like
when<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.800> have<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.950> dandy<00:02:32.310> valve<00:02:33.140> and

and you're gonna need some 2-inch PVC

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.429 
and you're gonna need some 2-inch PVC
pipe<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:20.099> pipe<00:03:20.370> cutting<00:03:20.700> tool<00:03:20.909> here<00:03:21.439> they

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
also sell a complete flow this for one

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.550 
also sell a complete flow this for one
and<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.390> half<00:03:24.420> inch<00:03:24.750> pipe<00:03:24.989> if<00:03:25.170> that's<00:03:25.349> how<00:03:25.500> you

and a half inch pipe if that's how you

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.130 
and a half inch pipe if that's how you
have<00:03:25.769> your<00:03:25.920> plumbing

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.470 

this<00:03:31.140> pool<00:03:31.379> has<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.830> flobiz<00:03:32.250> retrofit<00:03:32.849> kit

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
this pool has the flobiz retrofit kit

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.190 
this pool has the flobiz retrofit kit
here<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.080> also<00:03:34.590> plumbed<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.159> a<00:03:35.900> complete<00:03:36.900> flow

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
here I also plumbed in a complete flow

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.960 
here I also plumbed in a complete flow
of<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.470> here<00:03:37.739> also<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:38.129> little<00:03:38.370> further<00:03:38.549> down

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
of is here also a little further down

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.270 
of is here also a little further down
the<00:03:39.120> return<00:03:39.420> line<00:03:39.860> so<00:03:40.860> it's<00:03:40.950> not<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.099> major

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
the return line so it's not a major

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.009 
the return line so it's not a major
factor<00:03:41.430> where<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.330> actually<00:03:42.480> put<00:03:42.659> the<00:03:42.840> flow

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
factor where you actually put the flow

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.240 
factor where you actually put the flow
of<00:03:43.049> is<00:03:43.230> I'll<00:03:43.409> show<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.830> both<00:03:44.010> are

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
of is I'll show you that both are

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:55.990 
of is I'll show you that both are
reading<00:03:44.489> sixty<00:03:44.849> gallons<00:03:45.180> per<00:03:45.390> minute

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.450 

so<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:56.990> flobiz<00:03:57.380> is<00:03:57.530> not<00:03:57.680> just<00:03:57.920> for<00:03:58.100> variable

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
so the flobiz is not just for variable

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.040 
so the flobiz is not just for variable
speed<00:03:58.670> pumps<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.090> works<00:03:59.270> great<00:03:59.540> in<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.720> single

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
speed pumps it works great in a single

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.260 
speed pumps it works great in a single
speed<00:04:00.200> pump<00:04:00.470> they<00:04:01.220> get<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.490> accurate<00:04:01.880> actual

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
speed pump they get the accurate actual

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:09.300 
speed pump they get the accurate actual
flow

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.280 

that's<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.180> quick<00:04:10.390> look<00:04:10.600> at<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.810> flow<00:04:11.050> of<00:04:11.080> a

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
that's a quick look at the flow of a

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.240 
that's a quick look at the flow of a
flow<00:04:11.710> meter<00:04:12.100> for<00:04:12.880> your<00:04:13.000> pool
