00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.690
 hello girls today I'm here because as 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.360
 amounts of new days through 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.570
 facebook and social books I have come 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.370
 to prepare my skin for this summer 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 because although I really like to choose 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.680
 tan does not want you to do us 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.519
 stains or that the tan lasts two 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.439
 weeks so I'm tired what 's that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.230
 of the technique of sir and that is going to 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.289
 explain what steps to follow so that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.530
 our found is the ideal and about 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.920
 we all become smart 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.440
 not as perfect as we gave it good 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.910
 first before you start making a 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 specific treatment for 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.110
 treatments it is important to know the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.200
 skin phototype that you have as we can 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.039
 see is a type of skin rather and thick 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.989
 and it is a fruit of a prototype of skin 2 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.390
 means that for the first 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.640
 exposures to the sun it is important that 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.340
 so use a protection factor 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.560
 high 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.870
 the skin phototypes two are those 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.990
 skins that good if we put more 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.090
 colors can occur even a 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.960
 small edema but take a little longer 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.120
 in tanning independently of the 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.040
 product that you can put on a daily basis or 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.680
 when we go to take the sun is 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.369
 important to prepare the skin then what 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:32.660
 what are we going to do are three treatments 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:34.700
 indispensable in what the 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.930
 first treatment the fastest what 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.600
 first we're going to make a good 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.790
 exfoliation first to remove all 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.940
 the dead cells that we have all of 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.640
 the second winter for them to penetrate 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.300
 plus the active ingredients and especially 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.369
 it's important because we're going to insist on 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.820
 the areas of the knees elbows and 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.820
 heels 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.630
 the second step we will work the 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.180
 toning on everything that is the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.790
 toning and hydration we are going to 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.760
 take a bath 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.700
 of thermal water throughout the body to 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.400
 balance and restore the barrier 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.340
 skin protection of the third skin 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.950
 step let's work what is the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.330
 education and protection is very 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.430
 important once we've tried the 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.810

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.510
