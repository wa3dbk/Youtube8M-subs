00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.810

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.599
 teacher architect I am part of 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.759
 5 star movement arese we are the alpha 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.049
 romeo pedestrian connection bridge 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.480
 those are the old offices today has made 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.430
 she woke up in the snow 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.720
 yesterday she woke up with a new one 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 bad news 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.680
 the prefectural commissioner because to give 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.840
 if we don't have a mayor he had a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.380
 Commissioner signed the agreement of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.380
 program 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.570
 this means that within a few 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.579
 time in this area behind me 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 now there were exactly where it will come 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.579
 built one of the most shopping malls 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.800
 great of europe 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.980
 we are absolutely opposed to 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.070
 we have this in the last election 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.480
 we have strongly supported the renunciation 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.860
 of our common to the agreement in 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.059
 program many were with us in words 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.039
 the junta has fallen for internal reasons 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.290
 explainable commissioner thought well 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.379
 to sign this agreement 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.900
 now I will explain briefly what it is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.010
 treats here are the designs they are 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.500
 explanatory 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.930
 this will be the mall you see 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.300
 all this area this green area with 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.860
 these blue areas seem almost gods 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.380
 ponds a treatise the ponds 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.260
 no this is all a huge cover 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.400
 to cover an area of ​​77 thousand meters 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.630
 square equal to 15 soccer fields 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.180
 this parking lot 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.590
 will host 5,000 cars a day on average 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.110
 crazy traffic in an area already 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.390
 clogged in that direction 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.070
 over our shoulders there is already another 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.170
 very under construction shopping mall 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.700
 great and there is another one too 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.620
 on the other side in that direction a 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.620
 about 700 800 meters 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.970
 this is the front you see starts here 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.790
 this is the development are four 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.310
 entrances along it we all arrive 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.200
 a length of about 1,080 m ci 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.400
 it takes 25 minutes to go to one 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.060
 other part of this center 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.060
 commercial 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.200
 the height of this mall 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.190
 reaches 23 meters as a palace of 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.930
 seven floors then we see the section i 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.540
 size of the lowest point 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.730
 obviously only 12 are represented 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.320
 about four floors and inside 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.900
 height space and green cover 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.820
 but a green for those who benefit 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.140
 this green only to the firm of 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.140
 maintenance that had to cut the grass 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.770
 here are the plants slowly 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.080
 ground and first floor is truly one 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.110
 impressive size do you realize that 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.480
 these sales spaces 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.040
 I think it's a normal shop 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.590
 shopping center with 2 thousand measure 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.520
 this square meters will obviously be 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.470
 dedicated to a type of sales type 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.230
 supermarket is as big as three fields from 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.590
 kick this other shrewd space 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.210
 which is as big as two soccer fields 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.690
 they are absolutely in size 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:22.070
 out of scale and will bring traffic 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.220
 pollution in an area that is not not 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.220
 he needs it 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.350
 and here we see on the last floor the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:34.520
 cover 2 million cars each 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.680
 year the huge parking that's all 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.290
 here behind us 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.110
 ultimately a way to redevelop 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.570
 this area definitely wrong 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.730
 there is talk of re-industrialization but 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.370
 This is a shopping center there 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.840
 no re-industrialization 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.300
 yes now there is currently some 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.180
 activity that should be encouraged 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.440
 they could have done so many others 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.970
 types of interventions 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.489
 in the end another choice was made 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.750
 mall we reiterate that 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.250
 this mall does not 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.040
 we want and will do everything to avoid 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.120
 that it is built because the former area 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.120
 alpha and our tav
