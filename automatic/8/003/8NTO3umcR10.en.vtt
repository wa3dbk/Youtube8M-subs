painting<00:00:43.430> reflections<00:00:44.150> isn't<00:00:44.540> exactly<00:00:45.020> easy

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
painting reflections isn't exactly easy

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.940 
painting reflections isn't exactly easy
but<00:00:46.340> it's<00:00:46.520> no<00:00:46.700> rocket<00:00:46.970> science<00:00:47.600> either<00:00:47.950> you

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
but it's no rocket science either you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.330 
but it's no rocket science either you
just<00:00:49.340> have<00:00:49.580> to<00:00:49.730> observe<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.180> few<00:00:50.690> ground<00:00:51.020> rules

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
just have to observe a few ground rules

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.940 
just have to observe a few ground rules
for<00:00:52.340> example<00:00:52.880> the<00:00:53.660> reflection<00:00:54.350> is<00:00:54.500> always<00:00:54.920> a

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
for example the reflection is always a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:05.620 
for example the reflection is always a
shade<00:00:55.430> darker<00:00:55.460> than<00:00:56.060> the<00:00:56.330> original<00:00:56.360> I<00:01:04.630> begin

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
shade darker than the original I begin

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.960 
shade darker than the original I begin
by<00:01:05.690> drawing<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.590> outline<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.400> clouds<00:01:07.670> on

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
by drawing the outline of the clouds on

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.310 
by drawing the outline of the clouds on
top<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.480> the<00:01:08.600> underpainting<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:13.750> then<00:01:14.750> fill<00:01:15.140> in

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
top of the underpainting I then fill in

I<00:02:57.890> still<00:02:58.890> feel<00:02:59.190> as<00:02:59.430> if<00:02:59.610> something<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.240> missing

I still feel as if something is missing
I<00:03:01.340> decide<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.730> something<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.540> will

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
I decide to do something that will

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.720 
I decide to do something that will
probably<00:03:04.130> drastically<00:03:05.130> change<00:03:05.520> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
probably drastically change the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:32.050 
probably drastically change the
character<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.780> painting<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:19.380> guide

using<00:03:33.060> short<00:03:33.420> horizontal<00:03:33.770> touches<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:34.950> suggest

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
using short horizontal touches I suggest

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.780 
using short horizontal touches I suggest
the<00:03:36.090> movement<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.930> water<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:38.190> shape<00:03:38.489> will

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the movement of the water the shape will

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.210 
the movement of the water the shape will
be<00:03:38.940> less<00:03:39.239> start<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.350> transition<00:03:41.040> with

surprised by the result all of a sudden
there<00:03:55.510> is<00:03:55.600> much<00:03:55.900> more<00:03:56.140> unity<00:03:56.710> in<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.010> painting

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
there is much more unity in the painting
