00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 farmer practice team 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.390
 Welcome to the farmer 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.570
 Practical hints eat the roots 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.760
 the forage plants on our meadows 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.300
 cause the raised mounds 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.820
 problems 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.010
 They reduce the denseness of the names 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.650
 feed quality and crop yield 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.560
 next to me is michael hauer he is 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.570
 expert in things vole found out 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.680
 when is the right time to 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.170
 to catch the voles 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.600
 that's the whole thing, they catch you sooner 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.489
 and I drive against foreign currency 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.320
 over it and then next day I go 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.579
 gradually so raised a pile 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.780
 I'm assuming my trap and stuff 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.000
 I like that all year 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.769
 at how many hills should I stick to it 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.199
 think the rodent fight 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.079
 if I once an area of ​​10 15 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.480
 square 34 then run that is 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.309
 optimal to carry out the fight the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.410
 Mole is in some states in 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.850
 protected Austria how do I recognize the 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.579
 difference between a mole and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.080
 a movie from hill difference the 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.930
 Mole makes a cone-shaped 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.970
 round hope and the mühlenbacher one 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.190
 superficial gear or an extreme 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.470
 great hope and which fall 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.420
 recommend the original wolf 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.479
 estimates fall we look happy 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.220
 us on it those poles morbid 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.689
 put the oscar of köhler that he 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.630
 carrot potato or better heard 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.420
 take something then i take this trap x 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.280
 a bit together 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.399
 so i put her in the earth the aisle 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.170
 purely about the middle and I have to 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.579
 a small white ball inferior there 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.640
 the trap always so schareck cities 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.240
 not so round and so it is and 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.369
 then I squeeze the trap 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.659
 back as she fixes and then stands 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.880
 bring this trap in the way 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.890
 These two iron them club in the earth 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.539
 purely in the rent is free the moz 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.490
 Customer care therefore important carrot 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.750
 she comes from lausanne and the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.939
 trap collapses and the mosque 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.430
 instead of and how many do I need to fall 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.020
 that's about for a hectare that's the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.899
 ask how many are running here 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.820
 area but so covered with 10 20 I can 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.789
 let's start it is extremely fallen then 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.800
 practically safe 30 40 projects ok now 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.330
 we know which case we use 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.810
 how do we go now when laying the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.900
 in front of the guests on the weapons or 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.420
 a walk in the wall makes the place am 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.099
 input I have to always look as gang 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.750
 and go again where would be very important 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.000
 then have been in transition 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.650
 then take a soup spoon inbox 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.170
 not be a terrestrial globe never separate from as 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.760
 why the ids that the balls with the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.290
 triggers for already at then the of 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.840
 triggered and the assist 2 behind matti 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.650
 proposal brush of summer then namely 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.870
 The original was sang on the trap 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.060
 statistics then in case only up to has velvet 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.569
 Printer of horts in transition 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.730
 then it will be fixed when you are in 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.310
 residential and pinky inferior to the beautiful 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.430
 free symbol and her incitement do that 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.860
 visually this and then always tried it 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.269
 lightly wheel the rods and then it is 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.980
 save you earlier and then it goes in the 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.540
 next and always important if one 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.610
 Mark plug is back place 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.650
 very important and how often should I use the 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.360
 Traps inspect once a day 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.650
 at least many thanks for the conversation 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.670
