00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:11.360
 yes we have tomorrow the first of may 2015 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:15.299
 I'll show you more chicks that 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.660
 currently in the nests read one here 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.070
 hen the four young boys alone 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.010
 she raises her eyes 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.600
 the selected in massive behind there 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.369
 It may also be that it does not succeed 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.199
 the probability is relatively high 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.720
 if I think so but the three 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:41.149
 others are very good 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:43.290
 developed here are two birds 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.870
 gutmflora the group was not quite so 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.750
 I like him a little over 30 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.700
 given that theirs will be better but 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.530
 Of course you can say that this 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.649
 both coronas if you already know 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.239
 See that the wonderful heads get 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.469
 and that is not nearly here yet 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.969
 end of the flagpole 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.800
 they are maybe just short 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.239
 two weeks old when out of the nest 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.909
 I can imagine that course 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.580
 very high as the birds will be 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.700
 Hands on it is a mediocre 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.080
 but it can of course be decisive 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.080
 be the salvage 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:26.479
 here on I have a white rooster 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.740
 paired with the double bass with a 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.390
 make brown consorts dirty 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.479
 usually very reluctant concert times 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.979
 consort but it was at the time 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.119
 not otherwise big for me conceivable 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.110
 appropriate partner for this short 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.110
 to find bright 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.420
 two boys who are hungry 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.870
 that is currently the students of 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.710
 the albums I myself lead in the 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.710
 individual not 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.120
 I do not say for now added 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:07.820
 that is to say the canaries are becoming more popular 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:10.479
 I'm rather young for myself 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.479
 attention
