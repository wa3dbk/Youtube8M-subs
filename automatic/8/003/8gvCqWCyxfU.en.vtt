00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
where the only real imposition would be

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.679 
where the only real imposition would be
that<00:01:05.670> there<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> camera<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:06.630> were

so<00:01:09.840> everything<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.470> lit<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.890> gas<00:01:11.159> lamps

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
so everything was lit up with gas lamps

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.630 
so everything was lit up with gas lamps
or<00:01:11.760> oil<00:01:12.150> lamps<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:13.470> our<00:01:13.680> windows<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> scene

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
or oil lamps in our windows in the scene
then<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.270> light<00:01:15.450> would<00:01:15.600> come<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> windows

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
then my light would come to the windows

lighting my lens is very much in the
background<00:01:22.409> scenes<00:01:23.040> play<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.729> long<00:01:23.909> periods

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
background scenes play for long periods

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.480 
background scenes play for long periods
of<00:01:24.509> time<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.140> angle<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:26.009> wanted<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
of time in one angle I just wanted the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.969 
of time in one angle I just wanted the
scenes<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.060> exist<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.750> seemingly<00:01:28.409> real-time

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
scenes to exist in seemingly real-time

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.940 
scenes to exist in seemingly real-time
and<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.360> had<00:01:30.509> gotten<00:01:30.750> too<00:01:30.960> fancy<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.560> think<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and if I had gotten too fancy I think it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.260 
and if I had gotten too fancy I think it
would<00:01:32.040> have<00:01:32.130> drawn<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> attention<00:01:33.000> away<00:01:33.119> from

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
would have drawn the attention away from

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
would have drawn the attention away from
some<00:01:34.110> very<00:01:34.290> complicated<00:01:34.650> political<00:01:35.100> points

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
stepped out upon the world stage now now

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.490 
stepped out upon the world stage now now
the<00:01:42.150> fate<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.720> human<00:01:43.200> dignity<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.920> our<00:01:44.070> hands

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
immediately was very clear to me that we

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.179 
immediately was very clear to me that we
should<00:01:48.149> not<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.479> any<00:01:48.659> specific<00:01:49.170> color<00:01:49.560> changes

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
should not do any specific color changes

should not do any specific color changes
we<00:01:50.340> should<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.790> photograph<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> most

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
we should just photograph it in the most

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.260 
we should just photograph it in the most
beautiful<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.770> most<00:01:52.829> elegant<00:01:53.310> way<00:01:53.490> simply

beautiful the most elegant way simply

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.880 
beautiful the most elegant way simply
because<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.659> language<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.439> beautiful
