00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 I will explain very quickly in what 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.080
 consists of my lunch today's sardines to the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.099
 griddle with scrambled vegetables and 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.590
 spicy cayenne of the scrambled vegetables 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.160
 I assure you that pica tells you about 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.340
 benefits quickly from this meal 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.369
 first we can observe that there is no 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.470
 grain legumes no no dairy 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.390
 in principle it would fit perfectly 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.579
 within what is known as diet 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.590
 paleolithic we are not going to enter now 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.710
 this type of diet but I promise to take it out 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.230
 videos about her realize that the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.540
 fish usually seems to me more 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 healthy than meat because it's more 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.239
 wild the meat unless it is meat 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.770
 of hunting or unless it is pork 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.300
 of acorn that has been bred in the field 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.969
 running freely and eating acorns 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.040
 or unless they are from your own farm and 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.550
 live more similar conditions the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.860
 problem is that they grow in an environment 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.650
 unnatural grow enclosed they are 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.180
 Feeds with many times gives them 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.330
 growth hormones to grow 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.490
 faster they are fed with feed 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.740
 which generally contain foods that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.920
 would not consume the animal in its environment 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.300
 natural sometimes to the point we already saw 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.180
 what about mad cow not to 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.840
 the point to give animals to one or a 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.130
 herbivorous animal and they are also given 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.210
 antibiotics constantly because 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.880
 they grow so fast 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.300
 and a form so abrupt that these 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.960
 animals as well as living so so 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.640
 crammed 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.500
 it is very easy for them to develop 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.020
 diseases give them antibiotics to 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 mansalva and that's what we're 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.020
 eating us when when we put 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.010
 meat that is not that it is not organic 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.810
 that is not biological 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.100
 instead of fish we do not have that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.510
 problem the problem that we can have 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.590
 with fish is to accumulate mercury 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.570
 that's why I really like the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.990
 sardines and in general the fish 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.540
 small because having a life more 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.080
 short they do not accumulate so much 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.450
 mercury as we say the tuna or the grouper 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.350
 Larger fish is also fish 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.700
 blue rich in omega 3 and omega 3 in 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.960
 find the benefits that you do not 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.800
 let's go now the vegetables 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.920
 they balance very well the protein part of 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.820
 of fish and omega fatty acids 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.420
 3 and also the spicy one of the things 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.030
 what will you do if you like spicy 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.790
 apart from having a many effect 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.269
 sometimes too 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.269
 and 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.400
 of attacking certain to certain 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.030
 microorganisms that can be harmful 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.620
 for you 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.510
 aside to have a slight effect 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.720
 antibiotic 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.900
 and apart from being anticarcinogenic and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.799
 have other properties the spicy goes 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.799
 to help burn 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.350
 calories as you hear the meals 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.320
 spicy foods make you burn more calories 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.470
 that the non-spicy ones also produce a 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.550
 heat in the body but that heat what 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.440
 produce your own body and to 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.190
 produce it has to generate calories 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.420
 additional so these vegetables for 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.560
 being spicy will help me burn 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.900
 more calories 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.010
 are going to make you have a more metabolism 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.840
 intense that if they were not spicy and 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.900
 Well I 'm sorry but I can not stand 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.080
 more I'm hungry I throw myself already on 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.080
 she
