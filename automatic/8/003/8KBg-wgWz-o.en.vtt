00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.470
 save her porn called degeneration 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.630
 with a new video 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.680
 today we are asking you for a look at 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.279
 instructors back 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.289
 actually no more stop dagmar starter deck 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.170
 this year's reloaded indeed 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.540
 the old men have done the lard 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.930
 they did in the distant 2000 is something that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.110
 They will come out if I'm not mistaken, or December 6 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.210
 to December 9, however, believe the cm 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 short I know you go to inform me 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.289
 cursed 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.870
 anyway we are here and today I do 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.920
 see I say what I think of these 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.379
 star trek is first of all I tell you that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.750
 cards contain card bombs that others 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.690
 some of them are worse than not 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.510
 will be the price as techno by now 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.140
 all the first name in the cost on the 16 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.140
 euro to exaggerate 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.689
 I think this thing you can only show 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.970
 if I said so in my opinion for the cards that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.110
 let's say come by rips anyway gives 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.420
 look at the papers that are there 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.810
 inside a man revenue argument like 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.810
 they are two 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.079
 beyond maybe even nice environment 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:29.109
 company to use carmella but 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.270
 sure then some normal monsters put 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.710
 it is totally random, but will spit 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.500
 line ex under hi tech 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.240
 because in the structure load it e 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.000
 instead as if they were a canvas and 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.439
 printed the prize the monar 71 motorcycles 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.679
 room there is already you can play in the fans 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.420
 fis then we take a look at the monsters with 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.359
 affections maybe seemed more interesting 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.079
 beirut in front I could not see it 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:55.619
 a long time maybe at the distance e 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.209
 to the house because they wanted to put us 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.979
 also presidi since the commitment of the pd 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.459
 they are also quite played a lot 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.679
 interesting plant for paper puppeteers 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.229
 of cyber against old people playing in 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.750
 back game singer did not want card 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.739
 which is not crap equal to anyone but has 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.359
 however, maybe card 2 for monsters 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:22.180
 if we take a look right here 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:24.599
 fast there is no interesting thing about 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.430
 carlo nights 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.620
 oh well maybe a goal a parry tiger 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.889
 drake is a little bit look at the cards 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.739
 magic instead typhoon not really everything 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.959
 the whole world is not known why they are 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.430
 first fifteen year old starter back and yes 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.380
 therefore he wants to get us out of something 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.630
 vaguely remains 30 euros setups 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.980
 see they know the cost said maximum 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.049
 it costs more 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.450
 take the video you are psychopaths 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.799
 we don't know that with oil on these 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.220
 themes was where to make them from lemon 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.919
 however give a new candiana to the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.990
 tribute this that I do not know what 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:03.250
 could be about the crisis 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:11.230
 let's say the crap carp finds the sar 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:13.780
 that here too nothing declares Richard 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.340
 off grid interesting distance however i 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.010
 best because because you play it here 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.860
 why they put her in this star 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.620
 trek and finally here are some traps 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.680
 kind nature knows purity schabus because 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.380
 there is the demonic chain that thirty times 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.360
 hateful look instead with the yuki lees 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.440
 They have made even the Ughi as starter 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:44.500
 which I think is slightly more 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.410
 interesting than that of second paper 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.070
 me they are even better cards like 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:54.060
 always once while 49 paragraph field 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.350
 Useful selective jitian water 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.890
 otherwise one like me saying a man 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.980
 black is a name dedicated and evoked fumista 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.460
 of mourinho demonstrates without effect of 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.870
 less below in archive than cute 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.570
 among these here there is de ski evoked 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.780
 attacks are so varied i 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.630
 monsters with a minimum of a ribbon effect 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.389
 blade sketches of things here a girl 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:28.960
 black jersey that is seen I do not speak 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:30.499
 though common effort but the older 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.289
 indicative 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:36.650
 here it is great reprint is skilled magician 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.979
 white that does not remain ours 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.300
 grown up for the perma it sucks 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.849
 thinking dialogue I know why I am 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.370
 you are very pretty for the potential 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:50.919
 are those shoots censuses that you 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:53.860
 they printed good gadgets then gadgets 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:59.210
 virus and other hot lucana of said 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:02.210
 wrong revelers wow what cards that 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.659
 Reprints hole smokes signals is a good one 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:09.860
 reprint of nothing here the queen of 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:13.789
 city ​​that rules are not magic 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.620
 ancient here too will be a grade boboc 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.229
 it can be a great palmiero listam 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.449
 only if always a nice accept with infantryman 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.699
 which even though I didn't know from 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:26.180
 no magic fire with one 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:30.050
 reissue enchanter circles not dedicated 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.729
 magnified 0 leasing and bullshit 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.289
 however I have to say what I think about it 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:39.620
 if this starter deck is made to a 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:42.229
 price below 15 euros 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.479
 now also be considered a good one 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.589
 purchase for a brilliant he wants 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.909
 start there is 30 euros t party with 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:51.510
 gianni baget with some more good cards 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.060
 strong but second paragraph 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.980
 but I don't think it's a good one 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.320
 put papers of said to make 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.880
 reprints at home or that I am always in 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.190
 fact that until they reprint it 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.430
 section but nothing I'll say death there 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.430
 konami
