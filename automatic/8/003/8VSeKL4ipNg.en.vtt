00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.709
 did 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.360
 Taichi Yamamoto, currently traveling to Fukuoka Kochi University 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.110
 only this 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.250
 Agilent Planning 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.860
 I am this time 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.100
 I would like to do sumo wrestling at the center of the alternate city 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
 Let it do 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.090
 Can not end 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.160
 About aix1 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.510
 The point of this ex doctor is 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.510
 It is crest novel according to the city 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.020
 This section is to understand after the game 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.440
 For example, the first play 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.600
 Use only the pages you found 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 We will carry them out three times alternately 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.229
 But under that 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.089
 It is a long time 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.159
 3rd place in a row 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.449
 So before 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.679
 I keep moving, but in the sense that more than the original 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:22.509
 Do much 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.849
 Though 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.889
 When it comes to a novel right now, only three will always go online 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.839
 You can pitch 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:34.489
 Such as cat girl 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.619
 The first cheap 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.899
 It remains pitching like it used 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.599
 The power does not correspond to that 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.969
 Yes, in that case 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:45.919
 Be heard 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.919
 It doesn't feel rich at all times 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.529
 At the temple 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:52.709
 For wrist 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.509
 Make it necessary to move electricity 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:57.979
 I forbid it there 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.749
 That kind of feeling 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.749
 Ranked 120th in all stores 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.109
 It was greatly improved in the future 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.049
 Now some 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.229
 I tried to move it in an easy-to-understand manner, but this is also true 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:32.229
 I think the movement is not small 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:36.549
 That's it, but it's still a budget that can be moved only with Isakida wrists 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.709
 More than 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.069
 I also use Eco 7 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.399
 Three steps 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:44.129
 With good pitching 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.829
 Open a certain page 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.829
 Maggie intense phrase 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.649
 I think it's relatively easy to come 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:02.979
 to mex 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.359
 That's why this phrase is 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.269
 Much higher than tx1 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.559
 It will be intense movement again 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:12.209
 Of course, I have to pay attention to what I said earlier 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.759
 I can not do it though 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:17.079
 Shipment volume is 45 for Bin Laden as well 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.949
 Yes I am careful 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.740
 Linda Linda for example get rid of the kitchen 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.610
 Because it is easy to say that the timing is bad and different 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.939
 As it is in January and is easy to hold any 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.439
 Rather than a considerable number 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:36.159
 I feel like it's like a resort separately at my fingertips 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.870
 so 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.870
 I try to move 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:45.370
 Floor decoration 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.370
 I always feel for the purchaser 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.809
 3 languages 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.529
 Prophecy 13th place is the largest in the same party 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.430
 Because my left foot feels like that 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.860
 How to feel like this 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.180
 I am conscious 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.889
 But at first I was aware of that 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.069
 I spoke properly 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.029
 Yeah it's raining-while using 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.490
 First time at Mori Hidee store 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.490
 In the feeling that we will be quicker 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.260
 Introduce in the region
