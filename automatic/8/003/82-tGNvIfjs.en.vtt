year<00:01:30.420> when<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:30.780> investigating<00:01:31.560> what<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
year when I was investigating what it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.520 
year when I was investigating what it
cost<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.340> get<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.640> Thailand<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.869> airfare<00:01:34.439> is

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
cost to get to Thailand and airfare is

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
cost to get to Thailand and airfare is
like<00:01:34.680> way<00:01:34.890> more<00:01:34.920> expensive<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.729> New<00:01:35.880> York<00:01:36.150> so

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
like way more expensive the New York so

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.880 
like way more expensive the New York so
it's<00:01:36.630> gonna<00:01:36.750> work<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.380> roughly<00:01:37.619> about

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it's gonna work out to be roughly about

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.460 
it's gonna work out to be roughly about
four<00:01:38.340> thousand<00:01:38.820> bucks<00:01:39.030> as<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:39.869> I'm<00:01:40.170> sure

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
four thousand bucks as well I'm sure

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.749 
four thousand bucks as well I'm sure
it'd<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.650> cheaper<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.250> from<00:01:41.400> LA<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
it'd be cheaper to go from LA to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.200 
it'd be cheaper to go from LA to
Thailand<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.840> not<00:01:43.079> yeah<00:01:43.530> yeah<00:01:44.490> that's

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
Thailand it's not yeah yeah that's
