00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.170
 all the energy needs a treatment 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.849
 respiratory diseases 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.820
 allergic they can be classified as 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.039
 in a very simple way as 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.850
 intermittent those who only have evolve 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.590
 crises some episodes sporadic at 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.820
 once a month once every 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.430
 two months 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.470
 and in these cases the flash is not 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.900
 continuous treatment is required. 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.399
 we just have to deal with that 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.469
 crisis with specific medicines 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.090
 as antiallergic bronco dilators 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.350
 medicines to moisturize mucous membranes and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.530
 so on 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.700
 other cases are more intense 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.379
 and more persistent and where it is 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.289
 necessary the use of medicines 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.449
 crisis prevention is what we 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.280
 we call persistent allergies that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.050
 indicate the use of a more 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 whereas allergies 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.280
 can be intermittent are more 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.690
 persistent we will establish the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 treatment in accordance with this 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.610
 classification is however very 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.590
 It is important for families to know that a 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.439
 allergy that is intermittent at the moment 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.590
 it can become persistent through 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.990
 example in the face of some climatic 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.030
 or even for example the entry of a 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.570
 animal of a pet in the domestic environment 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.670
 can cause symptoms every time 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.369
 days then it is important to talk to the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.040
 doctor to see if there is any 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.970
 that is causing that chronicity 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.490
 of the disease and likewise an allergy 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.979
 persistent can through control in 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.680
 treatment can 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.329
 to be intermittent and this person is 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.500
 child does not need treatment 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.439
 continuous 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.030
 then this evaluation is done by the doctor 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.210
 during the consultation with the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.759
 family noting all the symptoms and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.420
 all the intercurrences that the child 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.470
 features 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.470
 a certain period
