00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.789 
that they both have imes very dry in
them<00:02:36.760> which<00:02:37.299> is<00:02:37.329> obviously<00:02:37.900> German<00:02:38.470> for<00:02:38.620> one

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799

two<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.069> three<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:40.000> also<00:02:40.239> corresponds<00:02:41.079> to

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
two and three this also corresponds to

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.990

the<00:02:41.380> mass<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.620> heads<00:02:42.040> but<00:02:42.549> each<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.730> these

allow<00:03:25.810> them<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:26.019> town<00:03:26.260> it's<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:26.650> horribly

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
allow them to town it's just horribly

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.759

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.900 
I disagree I think the parasite goes one
further<00:03:35.169> and<00:03:35.829> deserves<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.340> title<00:03:36.549> of

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910

the<00:04:20.000> internet<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.450> I<00:04:21.290> think<00:04:22.040> he<00:04:22.220> actually

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
the internet and I think he actually

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.030 
the internet and I think he actually
might<00:04:22.880> be<00:04:22.930> because<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:23.960> normal<00:04:24.200> person<00:04:24.830> doesn't

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
might be because a normal person doesn't

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.170 
might be because a normal person doesn't
actually<00:04:25.280> have<00:04:25.580> pink<00:04:25.820> ears

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180
