00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
is a very simple essential but but

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.550 
is a very simple essential but but
headphones<00:07:28.000> are<00:07:28.300> so<00:07:28.570> important<00:07:29.169> when<00:07:29.380> you<00:07:29.470> are

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 
headphones are so important when you are

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.899 
headphones are so important when you are
walking<00:07:29.740> in<00:07:30.009> the<00:07:30.070> halls<00:07:30.250> from<00:07:30.490> class<00:07:30.729> to<00:07:30.880> class

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:30.909 
walking in the halls from class to class

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.969 
walking in the halls from class to class
you<00:07:31.630> want<00:07:31.780> to<00:07:31.900> be<00:07:31.990> jamming<00:07:32.440> and<00:07:32.650> you<00:07:32.770> want<00:07:32.919> to

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:34.290 
you want to be jamming and you want to
be<00:07:33.039> pumped<00:07:33.340> up<00:07:33.490> so<00:07:33.520> I<00:07:33.699> definitely<00:07:33.880> recommend

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300
