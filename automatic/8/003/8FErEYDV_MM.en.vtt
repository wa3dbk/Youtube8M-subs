00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
that and all the over hoses would only

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.040 
that and all the over hoses would only
have<00:02:18.890> four<00:02:19.160> wires<00:02:19.420> it's<00:02:20.420> always<00:02:20.660> made<00:02:20.810> over

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
have four wires it's always made over

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.410 
have four wires it's always made over
the<00:02:21.140> stub<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:21.560> there<00:02:21.740> or<00:02:21.860> whatever<00:02:22.240> it's<00:02:23.240> just

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
the stub in there or whatever it's just

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.990 
the stub in there or whatever it's just
impossible<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.490> a<00:02:25.580> really<00:02:25.640> cool

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
impossible so this is it's a really cool

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.590 
impossible so this is it's a really cool
idea

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
idea

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.960 
idea
absolutely<00:02:27.590> basically<00:02:28.370> makes<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.670> easier<00:02:28.940> for

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
absolutely basically makes it easier for

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.850 
absolutely basically makes it easier for
the<00:02:29.150> customer<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.780> that's<00:02:29.959> that's<00:02:30.560> kind<00:02:30.830> of

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
the customer and that's that's kind of

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.570 
the customer and that's that's kind of
what<00:02:30.980> we<00:02:31.100> go<00:02:31.250> for

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
what we go for

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.220 
what we go for
and<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.240> streamlines<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:34.190> usage<00:02:34.610> for

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
and it streamlines the the usage for

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.420 
and it streamlines the the usage for
call<00:02:36.230> backs<00:02:36.260> we're<00:02:36.770> just<00:02:36.920> not<00:02:37.040> gonna<00:02:37.160> see<00:02:37.400> a

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
call backs we're just not gonna see a

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.699 
call backs we're just not gonna see a
lot<00:02:37.580> more<00:02:37.850> about<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.930> basically<00:02:39.470> the

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
lot more about this is basically the

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.530 
lot more about this is basically the
only<00:02:39.830> thermostat<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.730> would<00:02:40.850> need<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.240> stock

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
only thermostat you would need to stock

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.110 
only thermostat you would need to stock
it<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.530> only<00:02:42.680> thermostat<00:02:43.280> we<00:02:43.459> stock<00:02:43.790> I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
it is the only thermostat we stock I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.270 
it is the only thermostat we stock I
think<00:02:44.209> what<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.720> does<00:02:44.930> show<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.200> consumer<00:02:46.040> is

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
think what it does show the consumer is

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.610 
think what it does show the consumer is
that<00:02:46.880> we<00:02:46.970> care<00:02:47.239> about<00:02:47.300> putting<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.110> quality

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
that we care about putting a quality

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.920 
that we care about putting a quality
product<00:02:48.920> in<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.340> home<00:02:49.640> what<00:02:50.209> will<00:02:50.300> purchasing

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
product in the home what will purchasing

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.260 
product in the home what will purchasing
is<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.080> system<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.070> we<00:02:52.280> want<00:02:52.489> that<00:02:52.670> system<00:02:53.180> to

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
is a system and we want that system to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.650 
is a system and we want that system to
operate<00:02:53.420> at<00:02:54.260> its<00:02:54.530> maximum<00:02:54.980> capability<00:02:55.570> but<00:02:56.570> we

operate at its maximum capability but we

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.479
