00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
like I I run through the game like as a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
like I I run through the game like as a
practice<00:00:37.020> time<00:00:37.260> immediately<00:00:37.680> before<00:00:38.100> I

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
practice time immediately before I

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.040 
practice time immediately before I

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.160 
the fan on and it has these really
inconvenient<00:01:49.200> switches<00:01:50.690> they<00:01:51.690> have<00:01:51.870> to<00:01:51.990> use

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
inconvenient switches they have to use

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.710 
inconvenient switches they have to use
the<00:01:52.410> gravity<00:01:53.340> gun<00:01:53.520> thing<00:01:54.330> with<00:01:56.720> throughout

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
the gravity gun thing with throughout

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.940 
the gravity gun thing with throughout
the<00:01:57.810> game<00:01:59.330> anyway<00:02:00.470> apparently<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:01.830> wasn't

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the game anyway apparently that wasn't

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.660 
the game anyway apparently that wasn't
interesting<00:02:02.460> yeah<00:02:03.830> gravit<00:02:04.830> against<00:02:05.100> which<00:02:05.460> is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
interesting yeah gravit against which is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.389 
interesting yeah gravit against which is
something<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:06.570> they<00:02:06.750> lost<00:02:07.110> me<00:02:07.410> all<00:02:08.070> right<00:02:08.220> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
something like they lost me all right so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.609 
something like they lost me all right so
you<00:02:08.460> got<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> use<00:02:08.760> that<00:02:08.880> stasis<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.990> fan<00:02:10.320> so

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you got to use that stasis on the fan so

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.840 
you got to use that stasis on the fan so
you<00:02:10.709> don't<00:02:10.860> get<00:02:10.950> chopped<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.520> half<00:02:16.700> yeah<00:02:17.700> so

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
you don't get chopped in half yeah so

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.940 
you don't get chopped in half yeah so
basically<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.300> was<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.990> any<00:02:19.410> time<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.770> think

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
basically I was it any time you think

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.680 
basically I was it any time you think
something's<00:02:20.250> going<00:02:20.310> too<00:02:20.700> fast<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.480> should

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
something's going too fast you should

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.670 
something's going too fast you should
use<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.990> stasis<00:02:22.260> gun<00:02:22.530> pretty<00:02:23.520> much<00:02:24.560> man<00:02:25.560> this

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
use the stasis gun pretty much man this

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.170 
use the stasis gun pretty much man this
would<00:02:25.830> be<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> lot<00:02:26.160> easier<00:02:26.190> felling<00:02:26.820> was<00:02:26.940> going

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
would be a lot easier felling was going

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.640 
would be a lot easier felling was going
slow<00:02:27.600> which<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.410> do<00:02:28.590> speed<00:02:29.900> drops<00:02:30.900> below<00:02:31.140> 50

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
slow which I to do speed drops below 50

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:41.670 
slow which I to do speed drops below 50
miles<00:02:31.830> an<00:02:32.040> hour<00:02:36.800> yep<00:02:37.800> yep

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.740 

now<00:02:42.680> when<00:02:42.799> you<00:02:42.890> come<00:02:43.040> back<00:02:43.250> into<00:02:43.519> this<00:02:43.640> room

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
now when you come back into this room

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.420 
now when you come back into this room
the<00:02:44.750> rule<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.049> backtrack<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.799> continues<00:02:46.250> to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
the rule of backtrack and continues to
