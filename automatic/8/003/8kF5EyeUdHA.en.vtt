00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.219 
get sits in like the weirdest places
like<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.310> your<00:01:25.430> armpit<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.000> just<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:26.990> know<00:01:27.020> in

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
like in your armpit and just you know in

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.520 
like in your armpit and just you know in
your<00:01:27.320> thigh<00:01:27.650> strange<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.659> answer<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.440> your

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
your thigh strange so the answer to your

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.740 
your thigh strange so the answer to your
question<00:01:30.950> is<00:01:31.100> yes<00:01:31.369> you're<00:01:31.940> going<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.299> be<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> bit

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
question is yes you're going to be a bit

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.240 
question is yes you're going to be a bit
estrogenic<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.619> think<00:01:33.830> it<00:01:33.920> has<00:01:34.040> something

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
estrogenic and I think it has something

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.120 
estrogenic and I think it has something
to<00:01:34.369> do<00:01:34.520> with<00:01:34.580> your<00:01:34.729> body's<00:01:35.000> need<00:01:35.930> for

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
to do with your body's need for

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.560 
to do with your body's need for
homeostasis<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:37.580> basically<00:01:38.030> you're<00:01:38.240> at<00:01:38.390> your

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
homeostasis so basically you're at your

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.719 
homeostasis so basically you're at your
testosterone<00:01:38.900> was<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:39.500> high<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.100> then<00:01:40.610> it

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
testosterone was so high and then it

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.300 
testosterone was so high and then it
dropped<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.810> estrogen<00:01:42.560> sort<00:01:43.010> of<00:01:43.100> had<00:01:43.189> to

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
dropped that estrogen sort of had to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.399 
dropped that estrogen sort of had to
fill<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.850> gap<00:01:44.090> between<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.990> can<00:01:45.110> do<00:01:45.229> research

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
fill the gap between you can do research

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.469 
fill the gap between you can do research
on<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:46.010> find<00:01:46.040> out<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:47.030> know<00:01:47.150> what<00:01:47.390> I'm
