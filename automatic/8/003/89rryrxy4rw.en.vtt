00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.770
 fat test published results 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.290
 recent crash test series 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.960
 cars of the 7th class cars passed 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.450
 new tougher test crash test 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.520
 with a little overlap almost a quarter 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.410
 head-on collisions entailed serious 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.090
 injury or death falls precisely on 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.920
 frontal impact of this kind 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.380
 in modern models in front of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.109
 we crush her zones which 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.910
 extinguish the blows and thereby protect the cell 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.830
 salon 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.840
 but in crash test with small overlaps 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.089
 the main energy of impact passes by 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.799
 these zones and in this case the destruction 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.570
 directly exposed cab 

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.269
 cars if the designers are not 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.010
 provided special solutions 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.870
 preventing it from one of the cars 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.650
 showed the best results in this 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.650
 crash test 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.070
 became sedan honda accord 2013 model 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.140
 of the year 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.239
 as you see the cabin withstood the blow 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.100
 relatively good beauty is not inside 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.589
 all extraneous design elements 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.299
 the steering wheel stayed in place and this 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.400
 means airbag 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.860
 retained the correct position to protect 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.810
 driver's head and chest also 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.820
 side curtain safety 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.950
 sufficiently closes the zone in 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.900
 front end and allowing the driver 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.520
 hit your head on a windshield rack 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.590
 glass 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.720
 keys from toyota camry we see that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.090
 would like to avoid with such a hit 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.310
 the front wheel squeezed the doorway and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.560
 living space in the cabin is noticeable 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.320
 reduced brake pedal 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.510
 moved to the feet area front windshield 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.670
 the glass went back as a result 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.870
 front panel approached the driver 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.610
 and the steering wheel also advanced salon 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.710
 although the pillow and worked head 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.080
 logical dummy only pro slid 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.650
 on it and hit the corner dash 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.650
 panels here 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.330
 senior hand tour body toyota prius 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.040
 poorly weathered crash test here we 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.440
 observe knot penetration and 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.299
 units in the cabin while on the feet 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.130
 mannequins impacted large 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.020
 loads 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.799
 and then the type of the integrity of the cabin cells 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.750
 is broken 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.410
 risk of serious injury 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.239
 both toyota camry increase significantly 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.940
 and prius and got in this ranking 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.380
 unsatisfactory evaluation by an engineer 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.600
 toyota to do more 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.570
 work to get closer to achieving 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.220
 security competitors 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.620
 2012, we award a new award 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.390
 safety gateway car 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.880
 which show the best results 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.040
 on the totality of us all with the tester 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.440
 plus marked those machines that 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.600
 earned a rating of good or acceptable 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.130
 crash test with a small overlap itself 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.720
 aspire to acquire 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.120
 cars with the best performance 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.519
 safety first 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.590
 choose among models with the title top 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.840
 safety pick plus is not yet correct 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.790
 the number of produced cars managed 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.890
 pass the crash test small overlap 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.510
 but later in our tests will 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.810
 take part more and more 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.810
 models
