00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:13.590
 hello friends came to the forest and took 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.320
 with a few knives and one knife want 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.590
 today to see how he works 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.369
 Here is a steel knife on the blade rl 34 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.590
 powder stainless steel 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:32.090
 hardening from Alan well, the knife is assembled and made 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.329
 entirely master Aleksei Pozdnyakov 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.730
 I want to see how it is on the tree 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.489
 it works but where to see how it works 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.320
 our wood is not in the forest 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.320
 accordingly, here is a tree here in bulk 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.350
 Here is such a piece of wood this is a dry birch 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:14.750
 as I tried the struga well, that is, she 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.750
 not rubbing it up exactly to choose strong 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.590
 that is, you can look like a knife 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.550
 buries in a piece of wood makes it he 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.550
 very good 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.090
 cool planes can't say anything 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.090
 bad 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.450
 such a tube can be removed 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.000
 buries deep in the woods but you can 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.090
 control that is 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.129
 hand position in between how to climb 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:25.569
 wanted stronger harder superficially 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.569
 it is necessary to remove it is possible and so 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.340
 great 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.340
 Wood works great for us 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:48.380
 I did not take the paper with me to check it 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:51.380
 so you can look at the reflections on 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.380
 nail 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.520
 well here were not cattle brilliance before 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:06.440
 chicken dough, they also remained more 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:06.440
 nothing though wood seriously 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:25.090
 but I think itâ€™s pretty clear the knife works 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.090
 OK 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:34.750
 the thickness here in the butt is 3 millimeters so 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:39.669
 the tip is such a cracking of chips 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:42.940
 it is better not to produce them in principle 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:47.530
 try but thin for all the same 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:54.720
 of this this knife for more so thin 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:05:00.630
 work planing wood yes no problem 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.630
 You can try a little chop 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.550
 on the same take now will bring the camera 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:12.700
 and try 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.700
 Here is the very same dry birch 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.100
 Spring certainly nevertheless here such 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.639
 here is a piece 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.639
 managed to chop off 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.840
 Of course friends knife such a configuration 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.270
 not for cutting trees but also 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.840
 chambers of all this is just inconvenient to do 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:58.620
 due to the fact that thin shoes are only three 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.220
 millimeter concave descents almost from 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.740
 butt beginning false edge that is 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:09.389
 eased the blade well, nowhere else would I 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:12.300
 said therefore chop them uncomfortable light 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:14.490
 very weight for cutting all the same need 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.620
 the blade is heavier here the handle will be 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.240
 heavier than the blade itself since it 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.479
 made of iron wood 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.879
 but planing is not a problem so if 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:27.930
 something needs to pull up in principle be 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:32.330
 pull up but it's not very comfortable here and 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.950
 All and so on tree knife cuts very 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.800
 OK 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.800
 decided and still show the cutting edge of the knife 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:49.119
 watch 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:52.059
 if something can be seen of course from 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:55.769
 small glare here it is visible here 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:55.769
 were they originally 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.800
 in general, I found backpacks me newspaper 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:15.700
 it was after all now after all that 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:19.240
 we did a knife recall was made 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:26.040
 test on chicken and wood planed 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:26.040
 a little knock on it here she newspapers 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:37.410
 well, no comments well, such a cut 

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:46.210
 principle was originally such that 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:46.960
 nothing happened to the magazine magazine 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.110
 take now 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.480
 litter Court were not good Well 

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:55.000
 friends 

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:59.700
 little test finished hope you had 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.700
 interesting see you on the channel good luck to all
