00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.639
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.830
 I tell you how to give her a picture 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.610
 could insert into the background 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.890
 blender 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.970
 you can do that well if you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.550
 for example, to do an intro and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.570
 in the background, for example, a universe 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.429
 photo or so first clicks 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 her as always the window here and away 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.130
 then he presses on this plus symbol 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.020
 here and pull it out then here 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.600
 bottom is background images there 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.539
 make her hook and then he pushes 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.559
 on this arrow left then stands here 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.920
 down at image as you press on it and 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.510
 then you can select your picture if 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.739
 you do not have a cool game then 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.430
 he goes on google and google for a short time 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:09.689
 nice picture out I'm looking for here now 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:12.900
 times posterity and pictures 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.580
 and we already have a lot of them 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.740
 nice wallpaper so if possible seeks 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.950
 you look for a wallpaper because it is one 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.500
 has good resolution compared to 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.740
 normal pictures 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:36.869
 then you look for the nicest out 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:39.119
 i take this as a here and here 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.150
 is the beautiful wants already now 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.509
 I make a right click on it and 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:50.430
 press picture save under and give it 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.750
 save the name universe as you see 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.270
 I have the game brisk and short 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.680
 downloaded and need it now 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.340
 not to save anymore 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.619
 Now we go back to blender and 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.950
 can search our picture here now 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.950
 go 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:10.920
 pictures and now it is already 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.350
 the universe pressed twice and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.090
 now you are indeed back 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.790
 in this blender view you can see that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.680
 Subscribe to the image that's just because 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.110
 that he is not in the right view 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.930
 time to see the picture you can 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.370
 simply the camera with right-click 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.680
 select and 0 on the number pad 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.720
 press and then you are in the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.380
 camera view and now the picture is 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.380
 also nice to see that cool if you are 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.100
 the attitudes left so here 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.100
 So on reviews , I think so 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.200
 cool that the picture is always in the 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.360
 background has no matter where you are now 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.260
 camera hinstellt I can do that briefly 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.110
 demonstrate 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.450
 I take now the camera with g and 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.070
 puts them somewhere else to go, and go 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.230
 with zero on the new blog again in 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.750
 the camera view and the picture is always 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.080
 still beautiful in the view and we can 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.630
 rotate us here now also with nice 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.790
 and you will see 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.130
 Still, the picture is still accurate 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.200
 In the view that I find a cool 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.630
 attitude because you are not so um 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.010
 the picture has to take care of you if that 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.690
 I would help myself with the video 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.430
 very happy if you have my channel 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.260
 would subscribe and give me one 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.290
 would give thumbs up otherwise 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.950
 until next time and have fun with 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.950
