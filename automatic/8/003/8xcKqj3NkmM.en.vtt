 The moment a ballot box opens 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.570
 the queue here is not yet observed but I 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.610
 I think that in the near future it will appear 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.159
 in the congress house we found only 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.979

 the essence is the same yes but we will not say so 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.060
 little toe of his times so all parties 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.520
 plus or minus promise the same thing 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.130
 someone believes in one word 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.600

 preferences level of something special 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.860
 the main thing was a wreath or take the best 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.170
 although the mayor of Riga and was not represented in 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.659
 lists because there was no wipe 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.970

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.090
 and at the same time ready to cooperate with all 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.500
 by the way some voters specifically 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.079
 came to the site at that time 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.299
 when Ushakov was supposed to appear there 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.160
 Mostly country leaders voted in 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.560
 regions where they live or run 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.780

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.359
 Republic and I hope that the next 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.739
 pockets 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.660
 the next government will do everything 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.470
 so that the state developed 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.280
 developed dynamically and I hope that it 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.709
 same afternoon on the plots 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.480

 of all eligible to vote 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.799
 evidence of this data 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.989
 The central election commission is 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.269
 lowest voter turnout for everything 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.639
