new look so yeah she was like this for a
pretty<00:00:45.550> significant<00:00:45.969> amount<00:00:46.059> of<00:00:46.210> time<00:00:46.390> but

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
pretty significant amount of time but

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.169 
pretty significant amount of time but
I'm<00:00:47.350> just<00:00:47.499> stalling<00:00:47.769> let's<00:00:48.129> let's<00:00:48.699> make<00:00:48.879> a<00:00:48.910> toy

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
just like last time bunnies head started

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.529 
just like last time bunnies head started
out<00:00:52.359> as<00:00:52.449> a<00:00:52.480> tails<00:00:52.929> with<00:00:53.800> some<00:00:54.269> eyelashes<00:00:55.269> and

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
out as a tails with some eyelashes and

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.189 
out as a tails with some eyelashes and
bangs<00:00:56.469> sculpted<00:00:57.159> in<00:00:57.280> although<00:00:57.969> this<00:00:58.449> time<00:00:58.899> I

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
bangs sculpted in although this time I

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.500 
bangs sculpted in although this time I
wanted<00:00:59.800> there<00:01:00.039> to<00:01:00.069> be<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.280> stronger<00:01:00.819> anchoring

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
wanted there to be a stronger anchoring

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.630 
wanted there to be a stronger anchoring
point<00:01:01.780> for<00:01:01.960> her<00:01:02.050> ears<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.100> rather<00:01:03.339> than

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
point for her ears so rather than

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.850 
point for her ears so rather than
cutting<00:01:03.969> tails<00:01:04.360> his<00:01:04.540> ears<00:01:04.809> completely<00:01:05.050> off

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
cutting tails his ears completely off

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.760 
cutting tails his ears completely off
I<00:01:05.890> made<00:01:06.520> them<00:01:06.790> thinner<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:08.350> can't<00:01:08.530> tell<00:01:08.740> from

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
I made them thinner you can't tell from

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.070 
I made them thinner you can't tell from
just<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.190> front<00:01:09.430> but<00:01:09.610> I<00:01:09.670> also<00:01:09.820> cut<00:01:10.630> them<00:01:10.900> in

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
just the front but I also cut them in

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.840 
just the front but I also cut them in
the<00:01:11.170> back<00:01:11.380> so<00:01:11.620> they're<00:01:11.860> actually<00:01:11.980> flatter<00:01:12.520> to

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
the back so they're actually flatter to

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.120 
the back so they're actually flatter to
this<00:01:13.540> way<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:13.990> could<00:01:14.260> sculpt<00:01:14.620> bunny's<00:01:14.980> ears

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
this way I could sculpt bunny's ears

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.430 
this way I could sculpt bunny's ears
over<00:01:15.550> them<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:15.940> they<00:01:16.240> have<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.450> firm<00:01:16.900> root<00:01:17.260> in

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
over them and they have a firm root in

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.130 
over them and they have a firm root in
the<00:01:17.530> head<00:01:17.740> so<00:01:17.980> they<00:01:18.100> shouldn't<00:01:18.430> just<00:01:18.490> snap<00:01:18.850> off

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the head so they shouldn't just snap off

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.440 
the head so they shouldn't just snap off
unless<00:01:20.140> they<00:01:20.470> snap<00:01:20.890> off<00:01:21.130> above<00:01:21.880> where<00:01:22.360> it

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
unless they snap off above where it

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.480 
unless they snap off above where it
tails<00:01:22.750> his<00:01:22.930> ears<00:01:23.200> are<00:01:23.530> but<00:01:23.830> they<00:01:23.980> won't<00:01:24.250> fall

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
tails his ears are but they won't fall

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.950 
tails his ears are but they won't fall
off<00:01:24.520> his<00:01:24.880> head<00:01:25.120> that's<00:01:25.390> what<00:01:25.540> I'm<00:01:25.630> trying<00:01:25.870> to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960
