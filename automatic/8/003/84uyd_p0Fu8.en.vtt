 let's talk about this shop 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.809
 because calais hides red it comes 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.699
 of an inherited instinctive behavior 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.680
 from the wolf that hides the leftovers for 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.750
 to be recovered later because 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.390

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.039

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.980
 they will more easily smell 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.580
 the Jesolo the classic antagonism between 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.580
 dog and cat is not a fixed rule 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.300
 in fact many times it is a peaceful one 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.860
 cohabitation and it gives us feel later 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.860

 of 700 breeds of dogs they really dream 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.080
 how we smell smells a hundred times 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.850
 more and have in a formidable finger the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.470
 same thing cannot be said about sight 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.030
 have you ever tried to play on a lawn 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.130
 with your dog by throwing one 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.019
 red ball is not very easy for him 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.730
 finding the ball again is not successful 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.400
 to distinguish the tone of the ball 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.100
 from that of the lawn and to find it yes 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.480
 must entrust above all to the nose 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.370
 when the dog wags his tail everyone knows 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.060
 that a sign of extreme happiness but not 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.400
 It is always like this 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.560
 in some cases the dogs that wag their tail with 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.640
 the high tail indicates aggressiveness and is 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.500
 ready to attack fear has not 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.180
 fear it does nothing I did it too 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.190
 castrate advice the dog I have not mica 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.320
 afraid that small and I'm afraid the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.690
 north is that my puppy died 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.489
 anything up to 5 months have 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.890
 pains in the gums due to the change 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.910

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.650
 who try to massage themselves 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.770
 looking at whatever happens to them 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.540

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.940

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:31.650
 small however three months ok ok lick 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.750
 the nose is a calming sign but it means 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.210
 many other things mean interest 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.230
 towards food for cleaning and also for 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.150
