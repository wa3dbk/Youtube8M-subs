00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
sculpt I thought it would be fun to give

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.010 
sculpt I thought it would be fun to give
it<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.960> try<00:00:13.230> purely<00:00:13.950> out<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.190> curiosity<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.990> a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
it a try purely out of curiosity it is a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.010 
it a try purely out of curiosity it is a
very<00:00:16.410> focused<00:00:17.100> program<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.880> its<00:00:18.150> key<00:00:18.449> benefit

very focused program and its key benefit

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.660 
very focused program and its key benefit
is<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.410> fact<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.189> take<00:00:20.400> things

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
is the fact that you can take things

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.200 
is the fact that you can take things
like<00:00:21.140> extremely<00:00:22.140> dense<00:00:22.560> geometry<00:00:23.369> or<00:00:23.550> complex

now<00:00:31.019> when<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> watch<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.890> material<00:00:32.309> presented

now when I watch the material presented
at<00:00:32.969> SIGGRAPH<00:00:33.649> 2013<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.920> felt<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
at SIGGRAPH 2013 I felt that the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.400 
at SIGGRAPH 2013 I felt that the
demonstrations<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.510> Crona<00:00:36.809> sculpt<00:00:37.230> were

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
demonstrations on Crona sculpt were

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.709 
demonstrations on Crona sculpt were
quite<00:00:37.890> bland<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.969> say<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.510> as

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
quite bland and I say this as

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.110 
quite bland and I say this as
constructive<00:00:40.350> criticism<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.969> light

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
constructive criticism I know the light

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.540 
constructive criticism I know the light
with<00:00:42.300> 3d<00:00:42.629> group<00:00:42.870> works<00:00:43.230> very<00:00:43.770> hard<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.370> their

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
luxury of time to construct and put

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.920 
luxury of time to construct and put
together<00:00:48.870> example<00:00:49.590> content<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.430> even<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.090> who

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
making minor adjustments I sure don't

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.389 
making minor adjustments I sure don't
that<00:01:00.030> sounds<00:01:00.590> incredibly<00:01:01.590> boring<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.280> me

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
that sounds incredibly boring to me

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.729 
that sounds incredibly boring to me
useful<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.600> incredibly<00:01:04.110> time-saving

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
without a doubt but boring that said I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.370 
without a doubt but boring that said I
really<00:01:08.640> had<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.270> major<00:01:09.510> doubts<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.110> this

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
really had some major doubts that this

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.679 
really had some major doubts that this
program<00:01:10.860> offered<00:01:11.310> anything<00:01:11.970> useful<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.570> my

program offered anything useful to my
production<00:01:13.200> because<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.680> favor<00:01:13.979> tools<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
production because I favor tools that

production because I favor tools that
allow<00:01:15.270> me<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.509> produce<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.530> content<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.400> less

usage example of Corona scope that I
don't<00:01:39.180> feel<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.540> touched<00:01:39.810> upon<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.680> the

don't feel was touched upon at all the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.030 
don't feel was touched upon at all the

things simple in regards to facial
rigging<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.399> well<00:02:09.119> let's<00:02:09.750> take<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> look<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.530> have

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
rigging is well let's take a look I have

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.700 
rigging is well let's take a look I have

and<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.070> mouth<00:02:14.250> control<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> side<00:02:15.420> so

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and the mouth control is on the side so

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.160 
and the mouth control is on the side so
I<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:15.990> get<00:02:16.290> an<00:02:16.440> A<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.220> an<00:02:17.400> O<00:02:17.610> sound<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:19.080> a

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
finish this animation okay so what I'm

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.550 
finish this animation okay so what I'm
doing<00:03:27.030> here<00:03:27.210> is<00:03:27.270> that<00:03:27.420> instead<00:03:27.930> of

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
basically do the same thing but with

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.850 
basically do the same thing but with
less<00:03:41.130> complexity<00:03:41.760> better<00:03:42.390> results<00:03:42.990> and<00:03:43.140> lots

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
less complexity better results and lots

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.540 
less complexity better results and lots

this footage now Crona sculpt is a new

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.980 
this footage now Crona sculpt is a new
program<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.820> there<00:04:09.030> are<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.150> few<00:04:09.360> areas<00:04:09.540> where

program and there are a few areas where

program and there are a few areas where
it<00:04:10.140> could<00:04:10.470> improve<00:04:10.940> first<00:04:11.940> off<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.390> lack

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
it could improve first off is the lack

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.410 
it could improve first off is the lack
of<00:04:12.720> layers<00:04:13.410> usually<00:04:14.340> when<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:14.790> do<00:04:14.880> facial

on Cronus colt has radically changed my
opinion<00:05:21.330> on<00:05:21.690> how<00:05:22.050> much<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.500> could<00:05:22.650> contribute

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
opinion on how much it could contribute

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.970 
opinion on how much it could contribute
to<00:05:23.250> my<00:05:23.430> animation<00:05:24.000> workflow<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:25.410> simple<00:05:25.740> and

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
to my animation workflow the simple and

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.700 
to my animation workflow the simple and
easy<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.580> use<00:05:26.610> interface<00:05:27.150> kind<00:05:27.840> of<00:05:27.990> masks<00:05:28.530> the

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
sheer power of the application so I

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.140 
sheer power of the application so I
highly<00:05:31.710> recommend<00:05:31.740> downloading<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.820> trial

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
highly recommend downloading the trial

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.990 
highly recommend downloading the trial
and<00:05:33.450> giving<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:34.080> try<00:05:34.430> this<00:05:35.430> concludes<00:05:35.910> my
