00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
so we have a lovely patient we're going

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.320 
so we have a lovely patient we're going
to<00:00:22.800> do<00:00:22.890> two<00:00:23.100> little<00:00:23.250> videos<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.910> first<00:00:24.150> one

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
to do two little videos this first one

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.670 
to do two little videos this first one
is<00:00:24.480> actually<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.170> showing<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
is actually going to be showing the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.339 
is actually going to be showing the
volumizing<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.060> green<00:00:27.300> yes<00:00:27.570> we're<00:00:28.230> going

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
volumizing is in green yes we're going

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.960 
volumizing is in green yes we're going
to<00:00:28.410> use<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> cannula<00:00:29.010> technique<00:00:29.519> which<00:00:29.730> really

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
to use a cannula technique which really

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.630 
to use a cannula technique which really
decreases<00:00:30.810> pain<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> patient<00:00:31.710> also

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
decreases pain for the patient also

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.150 
decreases pain for the patient also
decreases<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.270> risk<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.960> bruising<00:00:34.590> following

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
decreases the risk of bruising following

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.720 
decreases the risk of bruising following
I've<00:00:36.120> mixed<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.930> radius<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.160> little<00:00:38.579> bit

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
I've mixed the radius with a little bit

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.639 
I've mixed the radius with a little bit
of<00:00:38.969> local<00:00:39.329> anesthetic<00:00:39.899> called<00:00:40.110> lidocaine

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
of local anesthetic called lidocaine

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.869 
of local anesthetic called lidocaine
that<00:00:41.190> should<00:00:41.370> make<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.610> even<00:00:41.730> more

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that should make it even more

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.520 
that should make it even more
comfortable<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> patient<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.350> did<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
comfortable for a patient we did a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.049 
comfortable for a patient we did a
little<00:00:43.770> numbing<00:00:44.010> blood<00:00:44.370> before<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.910> actually

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
little numbing blood before we actually

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.090 
little numbing blood before we actually
started<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.840> video<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.620> I've<00:00:46.860> made<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
started this video and I've made a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920 
started this video and I've made a
little<00:00:47.370> entrance<00:00:47.850> spot<00:00:48.329> where<00:00:48.600> we're<00:00:48.780> going

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
little entrance spot where we're going

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.810 
little entrance spot where we're going
to<00:00:49.020> introduce<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.620> cannula<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.340> order<00:00:50.610> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
to introduce the cannula in order to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.700 
to introduce the cannula in order to
materialize<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.260> let's<00:00:52.559> get

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
materialize so with that let's get

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.560 
materialize so with that let's get
started<00:00:53.100> we're<00:00:53.280> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.460> focus<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.910> their

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
started we're going to focus on their

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:14.460 
started we're going to focus on their
hand

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.140 

there<00:01:14.980> we<00:01:15.070> go

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
there we go

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.300 
there we go
all<00:01:16.690> right<00:01:16.930> so<00:01:17.200> once<00:01:17.560> we've<00:01:17.770> actually<00:01:17.950> found

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
all right so once we've actually found

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.100 
all right so once we've actually found
that<00:01:18.430> little<00:01:18.760> spot<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.090> was<00:01:19.210> so<00:01:19.360> tiny<00:01:19.630> it<00:01:19.900> took

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
that little spot it was so tiny it took

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.110 
that little spot it was so tiny it took
us<00:01:20.260> a<00:01:20.380> second<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.800> find<00:01:20.980> it<00:01:21.220> you<00:01:21.670> can<00:01:21.790> see<00:01:21.970> my

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
us a second to find it you can see my

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.910 
us a second to find it you can see my
candle<00:01:22.510> has<00:01:22.660> been<00:01:22.840> introduced<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.650> it's<00:01:23.770> in

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
candle has been introduced and it's in

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.010 
candle has been introduced and it's in
the<00:01:24.040> subcutaneous<00:01:24.610> space<00:01:25.300> so<00:01:25.510> that<00:01:25.660> actually

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
the subcutaneous space so that actually

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.480 
the subcutaneous space so that actually
means<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.290> space<00:01:26.560> under<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.070> first<00:01:27.310> two

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
means the space under the first two

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.610 
means the space under the first two
layers<00:01:27.640> of<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:28.030> skin<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.510> the<00:01:28.900> fat<00:01:29.050> layer<00:01:29.350> and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
layers of the skin and the fat layer and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.590 
layers of the skin and the fat layer and
you<00:01:30.040> can<00:01:30.190> see<00:01:30.430> by<00:01:30.760> withdrawing<00:01:31.270> we're<00:01:31.480> going

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
you can see by withdrawing we're going

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600 
you can see by withdrawing we're going
to<00:01:31.660> put<00:01:31.870> a<00:01:31.900> little<00:01:32.380> bit<00:01:32.530> of<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.710> radius<00:01:33.100> in

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
to put a little bit of the radius in

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.230 
to put a little bit of the radius in
between<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.660> tendons<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:36.490> overtime<00:01:37.030> is

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
between the tendons and this overtime is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.360 
between the tendons and this overtime is
really<00:01:37.510> going<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.720> help<00:01:37.900> camouflage<00:01:38.620> some<00:01:39.280> of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
really going to help camouflage some of

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.160 
really going to help camouflage some of
the<00:01:39.460> veins<00:01:39.760> you<00:01:40.180> can<00:01:40.330> see<00:01:40.510> that<00:01:40.690> those<00:01:40.870> veins

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
the veins you can see that those veins

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.860 
the veins you can see that those veins
actually<00:01:41.800> already<00:01:42.100> are<00:01:42.730> starting<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.600> look<00:01:43.750> a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
actually already are starting to look a

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.010 
actually already are starting to look a
little<00:01:43.960> bit<00:01:44.170> more<00:01:44.290> camouflaged<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:46.420> we're

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
little bit more camouflaged and we're

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.719 
little bit more camouflaged and we're
going<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.200> come<00:01:47.410> down<00:01:47.440> into<00:01:47.860> this<00:01:48.100> area<00:01:48.160> and

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
going to come down into this area and

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.400 
going to come down into this area and
fill<00:01:49.030> in<00:01:49.180> where<00:01:49.450> she's<00:01:49.780> lost<00:01:50.020> some<00:01:50.260> volume

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
fill in where she's lost some volume

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.070 
fill in where she's lost some volume
there<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.850> can<00:01:55.000> see<00:01:55.180> this<00:01:55.300> is<00:01:55.479> nice<00:01:55.690> and<00:01:55.720> easy

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
there you can see this is nice and easy

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.840 
there you can see this is nice and easy
and<00:01:56.350> it's<00:01:56.590> obviously<00:01:56.979> comfortable<00:01:57.580> for<00:01:57.760> the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
and it's obviously comfortable for the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.950 
and it's obviously comfortable for the
patient

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.020 

about<00:02:04.560> halfway<00:02:04.830> done<00:02:05.160> you<00:02:05.400> can<00:02:05.550> see<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.850> is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
about halfway done you can see this is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.850 
about halfway done you can see this is
just<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.630> nice<00:02:06.900> and<00:02:06.930> easy<00:02:07.290> we<00:02:07.650> put<00:02:07.830> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
just really nice and easy we put a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.920 
just really nice and easy we put a
little<00:02:08.070> bit<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.340> topical<00:02:09.330> numbing<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
little bit of topical numbing in the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.850 
little bit of topical numbing in the
area<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:11.460> were<00:02:11.580> filling<00:02:11.880> but<00:02:12.800> it's<00:02:13.800> a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
area that we were filling but it's a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.930 
area that we were filling but it's a
really<00:02:14.280> comfortable<00:02:14.880> easy<00:02:15.420> simple<00:02:16.170> way<00:02:16.940> to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
really comfortable easy simple way to

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.790 
really comfortable easy simple way to
fill<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.360> volume<00:02:18.750> loss<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.380> tell<00:02:19.620> patients

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
fill in that volume loss I tell patients

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.460 
fill in that volume loss I tell patients
often<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:21.480> know<00:02:21.600> we<00:02:21.750> take<00:02:22.020> really<00:02:22.230> good

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
often that you know we take really good

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.560 
often that you know we take really good
care<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.800> our<00:02:23.040> faces<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.820> we<00:02:23.940> sort<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.240> forget

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
care of our faces but we sort of forget

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.290 
care of our faces but we sort of forget
some<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.020> areas<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.680> our<00:02:25.950> skin<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.150> our

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
some of the areas of our skin and of our

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.900 
some of the areas of our skin and of our
body<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:27.750> actually<00:02:28.140> show<00:02:28.560> our<00:02:28.710> age<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.340> one

body that actually show our age and one

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.850 
body that actually show our age and one
of<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.090> most<00:02:30.270> critical<00:02:30.780> ones<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.200> think<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.620> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
of the most critical ones I think is is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.000 
of the most critical ones I think is is
the<00:02:32.370> hands<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:34.080> step<00:02:34.530> one<00:02:34.740> we're<00:02:34.920> going

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the hands and so in step one we're going

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.040 
the hands and so in step one we're going
to<00:02:35.070> revolve<00:02:35.430> eyes<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.000> hands<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.600> then<00:02:36.720> step

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
to revolve eyes the hands and then step

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.180 
to revolve eyes the hands and then step
two<00:02:37.260> I'm<00:02:37.440> going<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.620> show<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.920> quick<00:02:38.160> and

lot of the brown spots and we're going

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.430 
lot of the brown spots and we're going
to<00:02:44.520> take<00:02:44.730> 20<00:02:45.090> years<00:02:45.120> off<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.900> patients

hands<00:02:46.650> by<00:02:46.920> doing<00:02:47.190> these<00:02:47.340> quick<00:02:47.640> two<00:02:48.000> easy

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
hands by doing these quick two easy

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
hands by doing these quick two easy
simple<00:02:48.900> procedures<00:02:52.970> almost<00:02:53.970> done<00:02:54.180> now<00:02:54.480> the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
simple procedures almost done now the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.900 
simple procedures almost done now the
last<00:02:55.620> thing<00:02:55.920> I'll<00:02:56.070> do<00:02:56.280> once<00:02:56.550> we've<00:02:56.730> actually

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
last thing I'll do once we've actually

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.020 
last thing I'll do once we've actually
put<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.360> filler<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:59.220> massage<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.820> into

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
put the filler in is to massage it into

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.800 
put the filler in is to massage it into
place<00:03:00.240> which<00:03:00.510> i<00:03:00.630> think<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.930> really<00:03:01.080> important

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
place which i think is really important

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.060 
place which i think is really important
so<00:03:03.810> you're<00:03:03.900> going<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.050> have<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.350> patient<00:03:04.920> make

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
so you're going to have the patient make

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.330 
so you're going to have the patient make
a<00:03:05.100> little<00:03:05.280> bit<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.610> fist<00:03:05.910> for<00:03:06.330> me<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.340> we're

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
a little bit of a fist for me and we're

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.740 
a little bit of a fist for me and we're
just<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.640> massage<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:09.030> little<00:03:09.390> bit<00:03:09.540> which

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
just going to massage a little bit which

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.449 
just going to massage a little bit which
usually<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.230> patients<00:03:10.680> enjoy<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.190> feels

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
usually the patients enjoy this feels

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.570 
usually the patients enjoy this feels
sort<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.820> nice<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.769> always<00:03:13.769> start<00:03:14.100> with<00:03:14.220> just

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
sort of nice I always start with just

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.550 
sort of nice I always start with just
doing<00:03:14.910> about<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.180> half<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.690> syringe<00:03:16.080> on<00:03:16.380> either

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
doing about a half a syringe on either

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.620 
doing about a half a syringe on either
side<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.190> hand<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.730> find<00:03:18.000> if<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.239> do<00:03:18.390> more

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
side of the hand I find if you do more

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.360 
side of the hand I find if you do more
that<00:03:18.840> swelling<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.680> be<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.860> little<00:03:20.010> bit<00:03:20.160> more

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
that swelling can be a little bit more

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.670 
that swelling can be a little bit more
pronounced<00:03:20.970> now<00:03:21.630> with<00:03:21.780> doing<00:03:22.050> this<00:03:22.170> quick<00:03:22.500> and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
pronounced now with doing this quick and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.560 
pronounced now with doing this quick and
easy<00:03:22.830> procedure<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.459> can<00:03:23.700> see<00:03:23.880> there's<00:03:24.420> been

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
easy procedure you can see there's been

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.390 
easy procedure you can see there's been
absolutely<00:03:24.810> no<00:03:25.230> trauma<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.010> back<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.220> the

absolutely no trauma to the back of the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.979 
absolutely no trauma to the back of the
hand<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.940> already<00:03:27.209> see<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.510> Reval

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
hand you can already see the Reval

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.630 
hand you can already see the Reval
yuma's<00:03:28.260> ation<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.890> tendons<00:03:29.340> are<00:03:29.489> less

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
yuma's ation so the tendons are less

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.790 
yuma's ation so the tendons are less
visible<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.300> even<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.019> veins<00:03:31.320> are<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> little

visible and even the veins are a little

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.140 
visible and even the veins are a little
bit<00:03:31.980> less<00:03:32.160> visible<00:03:32.640> because<00:03:32.850> we've<00:03:33.000> given

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
bit less visible because we've given

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.830 
bit less visible because we've given
some<00:03:33.300> soft<00:03:33.720> tissue<00:03:33.930> support<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.860> area

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
some soft tissue support to that area

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.120 
some soft tissue support to that area
you<00:03:36.840> know<00:03:36.930> by<00:03:37.050> just<00:03:37.080> doing<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.590> little<00:03:37.800> bit<00:03:37.980> at<00:03:38.100> a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
you know by just doing a little bit at a

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.370 
you know by just doing a little bit at a
time<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.459> usually<00:03:38.910> we'll<00:03:39.060> reevaluate<00:03:39.390> patients

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
time I usually we'll reevaluate patients

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.920 
time I usually we'll reevaluate patients
at<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> month<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.190> by<00:03:41.940> doing<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.300> just<00:03:42.660> slowly

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
at a month and by doing that just slowly

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.330 
at a month and by doing that just slowly
and<00:03:43.170> gradually<00:03:43.320> I<00:03:43.650> think<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.070> gives<00:03:44.250> a

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
and gradually I think that gives a

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.330 
and gradually I think that gives a
really<00:03:44.370> nice<00:03:45.030> gradual<00:03:45.959> Reval<00:03:46.500> yuma's<00:03:46.860> ation

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
really nice gradual Reval yuma's ation
