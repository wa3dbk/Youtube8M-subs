to<00:02:26.370> many<00:02:26.580> different<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:29.670> live<00:02:29.940> with<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
to many different and to live with the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.320 
to many different and to live with the
guilt<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.750> sexuality<00:02:37.580> personal<00:02:38.580> feelings<00:02:39.090> and

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
then having other people no pick on you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.670 
then having other people no pick on you
for<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.370> cruel<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.720> it's<00:02:45.989> just<00:02:46.200> it's
