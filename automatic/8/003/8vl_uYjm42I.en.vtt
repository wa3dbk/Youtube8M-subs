00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
so once you have your pieces of fabric

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.120 
so once you have your pieces of fabric
cut<00:01:02.620> out<00:01:02.740> you're<00:01:03.430> going<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:04.620> seal<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.740> fabric

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
cut out you're going to seal the fabric

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.290 
cut out you're going to seal the fabric
like<00:01:06.400> what<00:01:06.550> you<00:01:06.640> want<00:01:06.820> and<00:01:06.940> say<00:01:07.060> there's<00:01:07.240> a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
like what you want and say there's a

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.780 
like what you want and say there's a
design<00:01:07.720> or<00:01:07.960> a<00:01:08.020> pattern<00:01:08.260> and<00:01:08.650> see<00:01:09.190> which<00:01:09.340> way

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
design or a pattern and see which way

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.390 
design or a pattern and see which way
you<00:01:09.850> want<00:01:10.210> that<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.450> be<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:11.200> kind<00:01:12.160> of<00:01:12.190> lay<00:01:12.370> it

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
you want that to be and kind of lay it

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.150 
you want that to be and kind of lay it
out<00:01:12.550> like<00:01:12.730> that<00:01:13.800> next<00:01:14.800> you're<00:01:14.920> just<00:01:14.950> gonna

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
out like that next you're just gonna

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.570 
out like that next you're just gonna
start<00:01:15.400> gluing<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:15.760> on<00:01:16.620> I'm<00:01:17.620> starting<00:01:18.100> by

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
start gluing it on I'm starting by

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.150 
start gluing it on I'm starting by
gluing<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.000> front<00:01:19.270> down<00:01:19.479> I<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:21.040> that's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
gluing the front down I think that's

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.890 
gluing the front down I think that's
gonna<00:01:21.280> be<00:01:21.370> a<00:01:21.460> lot<00:01:21.580> easier<00:01:21.970> than<00:01:22.450> starting<00:01:22.810> from

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
gonna be a lot easier than starting from

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.630 
gonna be a lot easier than starting from
the<00:01:23.020> other<00:01:23.140> end<00:01:26.190> make<00:01:27.190> sure<00:01:27.370> when<00:01:27.520> you're

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
the other end make sure when you're

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.100 
the other end make sure when you're
doing<00:01:27.670> this<00:01:28.000> you<00:01:28.180> start<00:01:28.450> a<00:01:28.510> little<00:01:28.750> further

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
doing this you start a little further

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.440 
doing this you start a little further
back<00:01:29.380> than<00:01:29.680> on<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.010> actual<00:01:30.190> toe<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:31.060> the

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
back than on the actual toe of the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.630 
back than on the actual toe of the
speaker<00:01:32.110> because<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.590> don't<00:01:32.770> want<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.130> melt

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
speaker because you don't want to melt

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.950 
speaker because you don't want to melt
the<00:01:33.910> rubber<00:01:34.150> or<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.100> glue<00:01:36.250> all<00:01:36.400> over<00:01:36.430> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the rubber or get the glue all over it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.390 
the rubber or get the glue all over it
because<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.110> will<00:01:38.259> spit<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:41.290> once<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.680> finish

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
because it will spit so once you finish

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.070 
because it will spit so once you finish
gluing<00:01:42.759> you<00:01:42.970> on<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.150> front<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.869> you<00:01:43.990> know

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
gluing you on the front and you know

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.440 
gluing you on the front and you know
what<00:01:44.200> that's<00:01:44.350> gonna<00:01:44.530> look<00:01:44.619> like<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:46.300> flip

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
what that's gonna look like and flip

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.820 
what that's gonna look like and flip
that<00:01:46.570> over<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:46.869> just<00:01:47.050> start<00:01:47.320> gluing<00:01:47.410> down<00:01:47.710> the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
that over and just start gluing down the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.590 
that over and just start gluing down the
fabric

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.970 

and<00:01:53.900> you're<00:01:54.200> just<00:01:54.380> going<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.530> continue<00:01:54.710> doing

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
and you're just going to continue doing

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.490 
and you're just going to continue doing
that<00:01:55.250> until<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.479> fabric<00:01:57.020> is<00:01:57.170> all<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.380> way

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
that until the fabric is all the way

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.060 
that until the fabric is all the way
down<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:58.790> finish<00:01:59.000> off<00:01:59.360> the<00:02:00.140> fabric<00:02:00.650> you're

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
down so to finish off the fabric you're

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.360 
down so to finish off the fabric you're
going<00:02:01.370> to<00:02:02.050> glue<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.200> inside<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.890> then<00:02:04.070> fold

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
going to glue the inside and then fold

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.350 
going to glue the inside and then fold
the<00:02:04.700> fabric<00:02:05.030> over<00:02:06.850> you're<00:02:07.850> going<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.149> do<00:02:08.240> the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
the fabric over you're going to do the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.140 
the fabric over you're going to do the
corners<00:02:08.630> last<00:02:08.990> so<00:02:09.950> all<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.610> fabric<00:02:10.940> lays

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
corners last so all of the fabric lays

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.360 
corners last so all of the fabric lays
down<00:02:11.360> flat<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:11.810> there's<00:02:12.200> no<00:02:12.380> bubbles<00:02:12.830> or<00:02:13.070> gaps

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
down flat and there's no bubbles or gaps

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.870 
down flat and there's no bubbles or gaps
at<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.670> top<00:02:14.440> okay<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.680> your<00:02:15.980> last<00:02:16.100> step<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.700> to

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
at the top okay so your last step is to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.550 
at the top okay so your last step is to
release<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.390> shoes<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:17.930> then<00:02:18.140> they<00:02:18.260> are<00:02:18.380> all

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
release the shoes and then they are all

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.390 
release the shoes and then they are all
ready<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.980> wear

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
ready to wear

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.430 
ready to wear

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440
