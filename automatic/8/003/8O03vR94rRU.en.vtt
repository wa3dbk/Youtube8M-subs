00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 hello everyone with you sly p and in this 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.450
 video we talk about the new branch 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.030
 artillery patches 86 let's start of course in 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.960
 tips for each version will open 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:21.270
 separate video 18 of us left without 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.340
 change is the standard gun 76 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.740
 millimeters rate of fire to 8 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.140
 shots per minute 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:33.450
 average armor penetration bombs and 42 when 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 damage 164 and mind facial damage 110 when 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.989
 breaking 75 millimeters further we 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.969
 su-26 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.840
 she was finally taken away they would trunk 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.390
 22 millimeters and it became more or 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.010
 less consistent with that level on 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.910
 which is the third 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.870
 level what does that mean it means that 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.829
 we have a top barrel caliber 76 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.360
 millimeters 10 shots per minute 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.510
 armor piercing armor-piercing 83rd not 110 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.610
 high-explosive 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.200
 bomb out equal damage over 64 and cumulative 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.240
 breaking 75 damage 110 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.220
 that is, in principle, it is now 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.220
 more or less adequate artillery on 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.290
 price of 53 thousand silver 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.020
 then we go su-5 to explore 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.280
 need to spend 3,600 experience on purchase 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.280
 40 147000 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.680
 here we have a mortar that is 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.439
 need to select through and behind markers or from 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.360
 howitzers and let's look at mortars 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.460
 this is a two millimeter community 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.680
 markers of fire rate in four 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.119
 shots per minute 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.689
 average penetrability located 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.930
 a terrible 75 millimeters with a plan of 450 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.970
 I remind you that in patch 86 outfits flat 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.159
 fly 50 percent slower than 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.250
 almost 85 and is now with only on 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.000
 20 percent mile verbal can 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.550
 choose a 122 mm howitzer 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.320
 Discord seats more than three shots - and 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.130
 projectile kit is much more and that is 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.520
 it and land mines 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.070
 than come on types of land mines and beg him 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.580
 area on land mines has to punch 61 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.640
 millimeter 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.530
 and the damage varies 300 and 400 given the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.940
 there is this the most howitzer which before 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.800
 stood on su-26 and all put it now 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.640
 she's here a cumulative break through 140 won 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.190
 270 further we should new car 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.410
 Su-122 and that is, research on the Su-26 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.530
 fine look thousand experience and cost 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.400
 purchases 385,000 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.420
 let's see what we have here is 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.720
 Tapos is the top 10 meter howitzer 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.010
 d1s cosrino glass shot per minute and 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.570
 Eight hundred and eight armored raids 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:03.080
 millimeters at a loss of 910 and cumulative 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.680
 250 millimeters at a loss of 700 i.e. 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.180
 if you use gold cumulative 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.299
 then it will be something with something 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:16.400
 further inherit sous-8 you already know the machines 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.040
 for research 8 you need to spend almost 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.950
 30 thousand experience and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.910
 932 1000 silver and here we get 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.130
 howitzer 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:32.360
 mil 20 angle to be 720 breaking through mine bombs 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.080
 88 millimeter spring 910 their motives 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.930
 rulers 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:41.510
 50 at Kherson damage, this is the rate of fire 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:46.070
 elevated that is about two two plan 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.440
 shots per minute valley follows new 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.930
 car su-14 one to explore 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.730
 you need to hurry two thousand experiences and for 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.239
 purchase million three hundred seventy thousand 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.940
 silver 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.290
 here we have a top 203 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.659
 millimeter howitzer 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:11.290
 remove the howitzer penetration of high-explosive 102 when 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:16.539
 Damage 1850 penetration by armor-piercing 260 with 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:20.400
 1450 damage and high-explosive fragmentation ie 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:24.030
 the second type of mines after breaking through 102 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.729
 won also 1750 is not clear what is different 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.720
 first type of land mines 3 types of land mines 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.520
 almost exactly the same and 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.870
 rate of fire about one and a half 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.870
 shots per minute but dependencies 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:41.740
 equipment 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.199
 further we go the Su-14, two words 17 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.889
 thousands of experience to research and almost 3 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:50.919
 million for purchase on this 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:57.370
 artillery we have something the floor is 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:59.770
 achieve b4 caliber 203 millimeter same 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.470
 the most characteristics were that of su-14 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:07.449
 one ninth level artillery is 212a 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:12.280
 it takes 2 17 thousand to open everything 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:15.220
 experience and 3 million 700 for purchase here 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.250
 we are all the same yes killed is 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.099
 and already kind of farm and we, too, damage 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.860
 arranged the previous one there are land mines 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:28.720
 first break through 1750 for mage 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.039
 and armor piercing 260 penetration and 50 damage 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.780
 top is 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.889
 that the first object to be 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.960
 explore for two hundred and seventy three 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:40.000
 experience food and ward 6 million on 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.900
 purchase here from us is the only one 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.840
 possible weapon 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.240
 this is a caliber of 80 millimeters 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:50.260
 rate of fire 171 minutes 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:54.639
 explosive blowout 102 damage 1700 penetration 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.650
 armor warrior 360 won 1100 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.240
 that is, in fact we have the same 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.999
 characteristics but higher 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.310
 rate of fire at the tenth level at 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:08.919
 this kind of 9 on this all so far he 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.449
 Soviet artillery put huskies 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:14.400
 subscribe our channel are waiting for you yet 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.400
 many interesting thanks for your attention
