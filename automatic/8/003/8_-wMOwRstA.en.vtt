what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.290> how<00:00:49.380> to<00:00:49.410> roll<00:00:49.650> back<00:00:50.270> with<00:00:51.270> the

show you how to roll back with the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.520 
show you how to roll back with the
panther<00:00:51.690> extreme<00:00:52.400> alright<00:00:54.110> first<00:00:55.110> off<00:00:55.350> we

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
panther extreme alright first off we

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.220 
panther extreme alright first off we
start<00:00:55.830> off<00:00:55.980> by<00:00:56.250> rolling<00:00:56.489> perpendicular<00:00:57.360> it's

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
start off by rolling perpendicular it's

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.680 
start off by rolling perpendicular it's
always<00:00:58.470> important<00:00:58.950> to<00:00:59.239> make<00:01:00.239> sure<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.630> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
always important to make sure you get a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.549 
always important to make sure you get a
perpendicular<00:01:01.320> roll<00:01:01.559> followed<00:01:01.980> by<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
perpendicular roll followed by a

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.280 
perpendicular roll followed by a
parallel<00:01:04.559> roll<00:01:04.800> I<00:01:05.630> usually<00:01:06.630> start<00:01:06.870> off<00:01:07.050> with<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
parallel roll I usually start off with a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.770 
parallel roll I usually start off with a
quarter<00:01:07.680> turn<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.190> most<00:01:08.729> softball<00:01:09.210> bats<00:01:09.420> just

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
quarter turn on most softball bats just

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.710 
quarter turn on most softball bats just
go<00:01:10.500> back<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> forth<00:01:11.150> get<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
go back and forth get a little bit of a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.080 
go back and forth get a little bit of a
cracking<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.229> first<00:01:13.670> usually<00:01:14.670> hit<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.910> about

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
cracking at first usually hit it about

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.030 
cracking at first usually hit it about
six<00:01:15.450> times<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:18.380> come<00:01:19.380> about<00:01:19.560> another<00:01:19.740> quarter

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
six times and come about another quarter

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.150 
six times and come about another quarter
of<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.250> turn<00:01:20.460> we're<00:01:21.210> doing<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.540> worth<00:01:21.860> reload<00:01:22.860> so

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
of a turn we're doing a worth reload so

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.560 
of a turn we're doing a worth reload so
we're<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> go<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> max<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.330> about

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
we're going to go up to a max of about

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.730 
we're going to go up to a max of about
one<00:01:25.410> turn<00:01:25.800> to<00:01:26.220> about<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:27.380> quarter<00:01:28.380> turn

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
one turn to about one and a quarter turn

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.540 
one turn to about one and a quarter turn
right<00:01:29.280> around<00:01:29.400> there<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:31.710> we're<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:31.979> 3/4

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
right around there so now we're at 3/4

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.290 
right around there so now we're at 3/4
turn<00:01:33.380> going<00:01:34.380> back<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> forth<00:01:36.830> I<00:01:38.000> go<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
turn going back and forth I go all the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.719 
turn going back and forth I go all the
way<00:01:39.509> up<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> back<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:41.160> about<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.760> couple<00:01:42.300> inches

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
way up the back to about a couple inches

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.390 
way up the back to about a couple inches
below<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.940> end<00:01:45.900> cap<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.920> couple<00:01:47.190> inches

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
below the end cap and a couple inches

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.780 
below the end cap and a couple inches
before<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.420> taper<00:01:48.950> some<00:01:49.950> people<00:01:50.220> say<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
before the taper some people say just a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.270 
before the taper some people say just a
roll<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.150> sweet<00:01:51.360> spot<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.140> found<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.130> works

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
roll of sweet spot but I found it works

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.060 
roll of sweet spot but I found it works
better<00:01:53.580> if<00:01:53.760> you<00:01:53.850> go<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:54.210> way<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.540> back

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
better if you go all the way up and back

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.760 
better if you go all the way up and back
okay<00:01:56.070> we're<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.370> one<00:01:56.549> turn<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.720> kind<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.650> hear

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
okay we're at one turn and kind of hear

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.039 
okay we're at one turn and kind of hear
a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:58.950> bit<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.190> crackling<00:02:02.510> now<00:02:03.510> go<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> one

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
a little bit of crackling now go to one

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.760 
a little bit of crackling now go to one
just<00:02:04.890> under<00:02:05.100> 1<00:02:05.370> and<00:02:05.520> 1/4<00:02:06.000> turn<00:02:06.470> again<00:02:07.470> just<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
just under 1 and 1/4 turn again just a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.090 
just under 1 and 1/4 turn again just a
little<00:02:08.010> bit<00:02:08.130> of<00:02:08.220> cracking<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:10.709> what<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.950> do

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
little bit of cracking and what you do

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.910 
little bit of cracking and what you do
is<00:02:11.630> after<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:12.900> roll<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.230> part<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.739> back

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
is after you roll this part of the back

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.360 
is after you roll this part of the back
you<00:02:14.730> come<00:02:14.940> over<00:02:15.090> about<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:16.190> quarter<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.280> an

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
you come over about it quarter of an

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.750 
you come over about it quarter of an
inch

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
inch

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.240 
inch
I<00:02:17.790> guess<00:02:18.060> half<00:02:18.930> inch<00:02:19.200> quarter<00:02:19.470> inch<00:02:19.799> normal

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
I guess half inch quarter inch normal

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.920 
I guess half inch quarter inch normal
that's<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.459> like<00:02:20.549> a<00:02:20.610> quarter<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:20.970> an<00:02:21.060> inch<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
that's it like a quarter of an inch and

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.860 
that's it like a quarter of an inch and
you<00:02:22.080> run<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.380> back<00:02:22.500> through<00:02:23.450> start<00:02:24.450> off<00:02:24.630> till

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you run it back through start off till

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.259 
you run it back through start off till
it's<00:02:24.989> finger<00:02:25.320> tight<00:02:26.030> right<00:02:27.030> here

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
it's finger tight right here

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.350 
it's finger tight right here
just<00:02:27.660> barely<00:02:27.870> finger<00:02:28.290> tight<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.150> go<00:02:30.150> your

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
just barely finger tight and go your

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.630 
just barely finger tight and go your
quarter<00:02:30.660> turn<00:02:30.890> start<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.950> process<00:02:32.370> over

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
quarter turn start the process over

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.039 
quarter turn start the process over
again

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
again

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.870 
again
again<00:02:34.049> rolling<00:02:34.530> all<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.799> way<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.130> all<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.790> way

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
again rolling all the way up all the way

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.530 
again rolling all the way up all the way
down<00:02:36.380> couple<00:02:37.380> which<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.650> from<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> taper<00:02:38.220> a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
down couple which is from the taper a

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.680 
down couple which is from the taper a
couple<00:02:39.540> inches<00:02:39.660> from<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.200> cap<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:42.299> that<00:02:42.480> we're

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
couple inches from the cap so that we're

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.830 
couple inches from the cap so that we're
rolling<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.320> between<00:02:43.739> here<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.220> here

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.589 

now<00:02:51.159> once<00:02:52.159> you've<00:02:52.340> rolled<00:02:52.549> once<00:02:53.420> you've

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
now once you've rolled once you've

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.720 
now once you've rolled once you've
rolled<00:02:54.409> this<00:02:54.650> way<00:02:57.069> all<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.219> way<00:02:58.340> around<00:02:58.609> the

the<00:03:10.129> rest<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.459> baton<00:03:10.819> okay<00:03:11.329> I<00:03:11.599> rolled<00:03:12.590> is

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
the rest of the baton okay I rolled is

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.819 
the rest of the baton okay I rolled is
bad<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:12.980> went<00:03:13.310> through<00:03:14.139> perpendicular<00:03:15.139> I<00:03:15.349> went

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
bad I went through perpendicular I went

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.599 
bad I went through perpendicular I went
through<00:03:16.120> all<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.389> points<00:03:17.569> along<00:03:17.930> here<00:03:17.989> and

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
through all the points along here and

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.410 
through all the points along here and
now<00:03:19.609> I'm<00:03:19.700> going<00:03:19.819> to<00:03:19.879> go<00:03:20.030> ahead<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.329> go<00:03:20.389> through

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
now I'm going to go ahead and go through

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.240 
now I'm going to go ahead and go through
parallel<00:03:22.090> what<00:03:23.090> we<00:03:23.209> did<00:03:23.359> parallel<00:03:23.980> we<00:03:24.980> get<00:03:25.129> it

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
parallel what we did parallel we get it

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.720 
parallel what we did parallel we get it
right<00:03:25.459> in<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:26.419> middle<00:03:27.220> that's<00:03:28.220> in<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.489> middle

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
right in the middle that's in the middle

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.629 
right in the middle that's in the middle
from<00:03:28.909> the<00:03:28.970> taper<00:03:29.329> which<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:29.780> about<00:03:30.400> right<00:03:31.400> here

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
from the taper which is about right here

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.789 
from the taper which is about right here
and<00:03:32.169> then<00:03:33.169> the<00:03:34.030> hinge<00:03:35.030> cap<00:03:35.620> doesn't<00:03:36.620> have<00:03:36.709> to

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
and then the hinge cap doesn't have to

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.649 
and then the hinge cap doesn't have to
be<00:03:36.889> perfect<00:03:37.310> but<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.519> has<00:03:37.609> to<00:03:37.730> be<00:03:37.790> close<00:03:38.389> to<00:03:38.540> the

start<00:03:41.840> off<00:03:41.959> about<00:03:42.079> a<00:03:42.169> quarter<00:03:42.409> of<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.590> turn

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
start off about a quarter of a turn

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.000 
start off about a quarter of a turn
we're<00:03:43.669> going<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.849> take<00:03:44.060> this<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.480> about<00:03:45.010> one

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
we're going to take this to about one

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.849 
we're going to take this to about one
and<00:03:46.040> one<00:03:46.310> eighth<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.389> turn<00:03:48.519> we'll<00:03:49.519> go<00:03:49.669> about

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
and one eighth of a turn we'll go about

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.300 
and one eighth of a turn we'll go about
four<00:03:51.859> to<00:03:51.949> five<00:03:51.979> revolutions<00:03:52.370> around<00:03:54.310> before

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
four to five revolutions around before

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.610 
four to five revolutions around before
we<00:03:55.519> switch<00:03:55.810> before<00:03:56.810> we<00:03:56.930> tighten<00:03:57.229> the<00:03:57.379> pressure

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
we switch before we tighten the pressure

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.729 
we switch before we tighten the pressure
just<00:03:58.340> tighten<00:03:58.639> it<00:03:58.669> down<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:58.909> half<00:03:59.329> a<00:03:59.419> turn<00:03:59.739> if

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
just tighten it down to half a turn if

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.670 
just tighten it down to half a turn if
you<00:04:00.829> can<00:04:01.040> listen

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.680 

you'll<00:04:06.680> be<00:04:06.800> able<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.100> hear<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:08.180> spots<00:04:08.480> that

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
you'll be able to hear the spots that

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.470 
you'll be able to hear the spots that
perpendicular<00:04:08.990> missed<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:10.460> here<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.090> goes<00:04:11.240> on

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
perpendicular missed it here it goes on

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:20.850 
perpendicular missed it here it goes on
3/4<00:04:12.200> turn<00:04:16.270> let's<00:04:17.270> hear<00:04:17.480> a<00:04:17.510> little<00:04:17.570> crackling

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:20.860 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.160 

my<00:04:21.860> next<00:04:22.220> on<00:04:22.340> 1<00:04:22.550> 1<00:04:23.240> turn<00:04:23.510> your<00:04:23.690> head<00:04:23.930> even<00:04:24.050> a

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
my next on 1 1 turn your head even a

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:36.150 
my next on 1 1 turn your head even a
little<00:04:24.290> more

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.120 

all<00:04:37.160> that<00:04:37.400> little<00:04:37.580> bit<00:04:37.760> of<00:04:37.790> crackling<00:04:39.130> is

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
all that little bit of crackling is

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.240 
all that little bit of crackling is
where<00:04:40.570> perpendicular<00:04:41.680> could<00:04:42.680> not<00:04:42.860> hit<00:04:43.100> the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
where perpendicular could not hit the

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.640 
where perpendicular could not hit the
bat<00:04:43.430> well<00:04:43.790> enough<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.930> break<00:04:45.139> it<00:04:45.290> in<00:04:45.380> all<00:04:45.530> the

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
bat well enough to break it in all the

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.960 
bat well enough to break it in all the
way<00:04:47.770> sometimes<00:04:48.770> I<00:04:48.889> like<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.070> go<00:04:49.280> in<00:04:49.550> opposite

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
way sometimes I like to go in opposite

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.409 
way sometimes I like to go in opposite
directions<00:04:52.330> when<00:04:53.330> I<00:04:53.360> roll<00:04:53.630> Parpan<00:04:54.020> parallel

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
directions when I roll Parpan parallel

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:13.410 
directions when I roll Parpan parallel
now<00:04:56.419> we'll<00:04:56.570> go<00:04:56.690> 1/8<00:04:57.580> like<00:04:58.580> I<00:04:58.699> said<00:04:58.910> one<00:04:59.360> in<00:04:59.449> 1/8

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.210 

all<00:05:14.020> right<00:05:14.230> now<00:05:14.410> that<00:05:14.560> we're<00:05:14.710> done<00:05:14.800> rolling

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
all right now that we're done rolling

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.210 
all right now that we're done rolling
this<00:05:15.340> bat<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:15.760> good<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.060> go
