00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.060 

we're<00:00:42.630> actually<00:00:42.780> using<00:00:43.080> the<00:00:43.350> fat<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.609 
while we're waiting for our quinoa to
finish<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> technique<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.290> start<00:02:04.560> at

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
finish so the technique is we start at

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.530 
finish so the technique is we start at
the<00:02:04.740> bottom<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.190> pull<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.729> let's<00:02:06.030> get<00:02:06.180> all<00:02:06.300> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the bottom and pull up let's get all the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.229 
the bottom and pull up let's get all the
tender<00:02:06.869> pieces<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:08.040> we<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.549> top<00:02:08.850> we'll

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
tender pieces as we get to the top we'll

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.180 
tender pieces as we get to the top we'll
