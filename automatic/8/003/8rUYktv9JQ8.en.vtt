00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
and it's really that easy repeat the

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.230 
and it's really that easy repeat the
same<00:05:30.990> steps<00:05:31.440> on<00:05:31.680> all<00:05:32.010> the<00:05:32.190> other<00:05:32.370> legs<00:05:32.760> and<00:05:33.060> you

same steps on all the other legs and you

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.390 
same steps on all the other legs and you
can<00:05:33.390> position<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.930> grapes<00:05:34.290> vertically<00:05:35.190> or

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
horizontally I found that the process is

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.770 
horizontally I found that the process is
much<00:05:38.160> faster<00:05:38.700> if<00:05:38.820> you<00:05:38.940> thread<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.330> grapes<00:05:39.570> on

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
much faster if you thread the grapes on

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.590 
much faster if you thread the grapes on
vertically

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.730

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.800 
for the eyes of the spider
I<00:05:47.860> used<00:05:48.190> peanut<00:05:48.640> butter<00:05:48.880> to<00:05:49.180> stick<00:05:49.420> on<00:05:49.600> the

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
I used peanut butter to stick on the

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.960 
I used peanut butter to stick on the
shaved<00:05:50.110> almonds<00:05:50.770> and<00:05:51.100> I<00:05:51.160> cut<00:05:51.400> a<00:05:51.430> raisin<00:05:51.880> in

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
shaved almonds and I cut a raisin in

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.390 
shaved almonds and I cut a raisin in
half<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:52.540> stuck<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.080> on<00:05:53.200> to<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.710> almonds<00:05:54.280> as

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
half and stuck it on to the almonds as

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.780 
half and stuck it on to the almonds as
the<00:05:55.060> spider's<00:05:55.600> pupils<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:56.620> this<00:05:57.220> makes<00:05:57.520> the
