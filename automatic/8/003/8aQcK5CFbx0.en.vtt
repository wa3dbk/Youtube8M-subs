00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.430 
footage I just hope that it will it
won't<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.270> overused<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.680> won't<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.039> this

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
won't be overused so you won't see this

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.139 
won't be overused so you won't see this
every<00:00:55.440> game<00:00:55.649> three<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.190> four<00:00:56.430> times<00:00:56.670> because

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
every game three or four times because

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.270 
every game three or four times because
it<00:00:57.300> takes<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.809> 10<00:00:58.170> 15<00:00:58.469> seconds

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it takes like 10 15 seconds

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.299 
it takes like 10 15 seconds
approximately<00:01:00.170> but<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> great<00:01:02.010> new

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
approximately but this is a great new

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.729 
approximately but this is a great new
feature<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.789> think<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.930> adds<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
feature I think it just adds to the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.270 
feature I think it just adds to the
realism<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.200> visuals<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> game

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
realism and the visuals of the game

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.670 
realism and the visuals of the game
because<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> Premier

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
