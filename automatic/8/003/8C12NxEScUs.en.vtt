reflections on the car are still there

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
reflections on the car are still there
now<00:01:19.170> I'm<00:01:19.619> gonna<00:01:19.770> fast<00:01:20.070> forward<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.610> where<00:01:20.850> I

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
now I'm gonna fast forward it to where I

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
now I'm gonna fast forward it to where I
have<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> whole<00:01:21.479> car<00:01:21.689> painted<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.290> but

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
have the whole car painted out but

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.580 
have the whole car painted out but
before<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> go<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.330> easier<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.409> is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
before I go an easier way to do it is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.340 
before I go an easier way to do it is
you<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.040> click<00:01:26.369> somewhere<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.110> hold

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you can click somewhere and if you hold

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.020 
you can click somewhere and if you hold
shift<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.009> click<00:01:29.250> somewhere<00:01:29.490> else<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
shift and you click somewhere else the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.810 
shift and you click somewhere else the
line<00:01:30.210> goes<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.280> okay<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.640> could<00:01:32.790> be

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
line goes for you okay so that could be

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.950 
line goes for you okay so that could be
a<00:01:33.150> whole<00:01:33.329> lot<00:01:33.390> quicker<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.610> also<00:01:35.900> instead<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
a whole lot quicker and also instead of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.260 
a whole lot quicker and also instead of
going<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.920> changing<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> size<00:01:38.850> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
going up here and changing the size of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.080 
going up here and changing the size of
the<00:01:39.900> brush<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.799> hit<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.090> buttons

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the brush you can just hit the buttons

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.520 
the brush you can just hit the buttons

all you would have to do is go over here

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.740 
all you would have to do is go over here
and<00:04:06.690> you<00:04:06.930> can<00:04:07.380> choose<00:04:07.620> in<00:04:07.860> between<00:04:08.750> different

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
and you can choose in between different

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.600 
and you can choose in between different
styles<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.560> Smurfette<00:04:11.069> that<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.340> want<00:04:11.519> to

head<00:04:14.850> looks<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:15.480> that's<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.200> one<00:04:16.320> I'm<00:04:16.410> going

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
head looks so that's the one I'm going

head looks so that's the one I'm going
to<00:04:16.590> keep<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.669> now<00:04:18.120> if<00:04:18.479> you<00:04:18.570> go<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.810> edit<00:04:19.320> and

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
to keep and now if you go to edit and

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.280 
to keep and now if you go to edit and
then<00:04:19.769> transform<00:04:20.489> then<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.450> go<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.690> school

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
then transform then you can go to school

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.830 
then transform then you can go to school
or<00:04:23.160> skew<00:04:23.550> or<00:04:23.880> pick<00:04:24.270> whatever<00:04:24.450> one<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:24.810> want

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
or skew or pick whatever one you want

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.680 
or skew or pick whatever one you want
use<00:04:25.260> skew<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:26.550> just<00:04:26.760> makes<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.570> know

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
use skew and that just makes it you know

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.029 
use skew and that just makes it you know
level<00:04:28.050> with<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.260> car<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.560> make<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.770> look<00:04:28.919> like

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
level with the car to make it look like

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.770 
level with the car to make it look like
it's<00:04:29.190> actually<00:04:29.340> on<00:04:29.640> the<00:04:29.789> car<00:04:29.970> door<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.450> then

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
it's actually on the car door and then

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.110 
it's actually on the car door and then
go<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.020> blur<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:31.620> Gaussian<00:04:31.860> blur<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.550> then<00:04:32.940> if

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
go to blur and Gaussian blur and then if

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.880 
go to blur and Gaussian blur and then if
it's<00:04:33.270> set<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.450> 0.5<00:04:34.140> that's<00:04:34.350> pretty<00:04:34.530> good<00:04:34.710> it

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
it's set to 0.5 that's pretty good it

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.100 
it's set to 0.5 that's pretty good it
just<00:04:34.919> blurs<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:35.460> in<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.610> little<00:04:35.880> bit<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.419> there

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
just blurs it in a little bit and there

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.850 
just blurs it in a little bit and there
you<00:04:37.200> go<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.620> car<00:04:37.800> looks<00:04:38.070> pretty<00:04:38.370> nice<00:04:39.860> the
