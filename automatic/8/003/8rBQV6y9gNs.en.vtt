00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
using the cue snaps they are this is the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.689 
using the cue snaps they are this is the
first<00:03:21.859> time<00:03:21.979> I've<00:03:22.129> actually<00:03:22.280> used<00:03:22.489> them

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:22.699 
first time I've actually used them

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.399 
first time I've actually used them
because<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.389> size<00:03:23.629> of<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.870> project<00:03:24.319> I

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
because of the size of the project I

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.189 
because of the size of the project I
usually<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:24.799> hold<00:03:24.979> a<00:03:25.069> fabric<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.459> my<00:03:25.489> hand<00:03:26.199> so

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
usually just hold a fabric in my hand so

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.319 
usually just hold a fabric in my hand so
far<00:03:27.229> it's<00:03:27.919> worked<00:03:28.129> pretty<00:03:28.310> well<00:03:28.639> except<00:03:29.209> I'm

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
far it's worked pretty well except I'm

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.270 
far it's worked pretty well except I'm
later<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:29.930> when<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.290> get<00:03:30.379> towards<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.889> middle

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
later on when I get towards the middle

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.849 
later on when I get towards the middle
I'm<00:03:31.930> kind<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:32.989> concerned<00:03:33.319> about<00:03:33.409> all<00:03:33.769> this

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
I'm kind of concerned about all this

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.610 
I'm kind of concerned about all this
excess<00:03:34.639> fabric<00:03:34.909> but<00:03:35.840> uh<00:03:36.010> let<00:03:37.010> me<00:03:37.040> uh<00:03:37.189> gonna

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
how big this piece of fabric is here

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:51.099 
how big this piece of fabric is here
this<00:03:47.689> is<00:03:48.519> pretty<00:03:49.519> massive<00:03:50.120> now<00:03:50.659> it's<00:03:50.900> not

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
this is pretty massive now it's not

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.319
