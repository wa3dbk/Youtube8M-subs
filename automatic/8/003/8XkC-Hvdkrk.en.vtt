and<00:00:29.760> we're<00:00:30.210> back<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.320> guess

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and we're back here and I guess

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.880 
and we're back here and I guess
Alvin's<00:00:32.340> we're<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> 9th<00:00:33.780> fleet<00:00:34.170> which<00:00:34.770> is

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
Alvin's we're on the 9th fleet which is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.770 
Alvin's we're on the 9th fleet which is
not<00:00:35.040> bad<00:00:35.280> actually<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.149> need<00:00:36.300> two<00:00:36.480> flips

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
not bad actually but we need two flips

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.420 
not bad actually but we need two flips
for<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.200> really<00:00:37.620> need<00:00:37.800> two<00:00:37.980> flips<00:00:38.280> for

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
for this we really need two flips for

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.220 
for this we really need two flips for
this<00:00:38.550> that's<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> think<00:00:39.450> can<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:39.989> speed

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
this that's what I think can we speed

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.700 
this that's what I think can we speed
them<00:00:40.350> up

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
them up

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.369 
them up
we're<00:00:41.129> 33<00:00:41.910> premium<00:00:42.390> currency<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.140> speed

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
we're 33 premium currency we can speed

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.830 
we're 33 premium currency we can speed
them<00:00:43.500> up<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:43.920> chance<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.090> victory<00:00:45.239> we're<00:00:45.750> at

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
them up so chance of victory we're at

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.549 
them up so chance of victory we're at
impossible<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.950> fare<00:00:47.250> too<00:00:47.640> good<00:00:48.469> you<00:00:49.469> know

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
impossible to fare too good you know

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.170 
impossible to fare too good you know
that<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.969> giving<00:00:51.390> me<00:00:51.539> much<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.969> it's<00:00:53.969> not

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
that is not giving me much of it's not

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.350 
that is not giving me much of it's not
making<00:00:54.570> me<00:00:54.660> feel<00:00:54.870> good<00:00:55.520> well<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> guess<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.180> can

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
making me feel good well I guess we can

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.010 
making me feel good well I guess we can
get<00:00:57.510> some<00:00:57.780> level<00:00:58.109> dragons<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:59.600> who<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.750> that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
get some level dragons up who is that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779 
get some level dragons up who is that
