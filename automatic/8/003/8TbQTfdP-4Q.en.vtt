00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.990
 Hello, welcome to 1 today 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.830
 the biscuit comes from me in two 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.870
 to dye 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:18.170
 I have about 250 grams of butter here 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.050
 let melt so properly and 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:27.140
 because these will look what's there 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:32.140
 Just pick up and have made up 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:39.199
 then here about 125 grams of powdered sugar 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:42.379
 two tablespoons of cocoa and about 400 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:46.629
 grate flour so after you ship 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:50.859
 you could have looked away here 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:54.289
 your mother just in a jar for 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.309
 or one so that the foam is down 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.899
 can stay 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.719
 So you do not take that with you now 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:07.040
 and puts the cold so internet for so long 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.080
 wait until the butter has gotten cold 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.590
 I'll just go to the window 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.960
 put so the mother is already cold 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.800
 I've got it now in the manne 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.800
 bowl clean 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.009
 and give the icing sugar with no 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.759
 mix together for the first time 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.270
 and then slowly mail would enter 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.369
 So at the beginning of the dough is of course so 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.890
 scary around you have the feeling 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.360
 somehow you can not do that 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.729
 but if you always get together 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.799
 kneads again then you get that 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.039
 It's still a bit together 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:09.030
 not angry but the longer you knead 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:12.660
 pesto is better that way I will now 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.970
 divide my day by two in the same way 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.920
 I give light dough as orange flavor 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.609
 such a small bottle in the other 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:30.840
 I then give two tablespoons of cocoa 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:33.120
 and of course that's for me too 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.069
 I divided my time by two 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.590
 once with cocoa with proper aromas 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.049
 I have so small from my day 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.980
 shaped balls so that goes all the way 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.859
 light 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.389
 the size is of course leave you over 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.440
 but of course we all have to 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.440
 be the same size 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.560
 and then I will make it to every flower shape 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.140
 So you always need six couples 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.140
 outside of 1 in the middle 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:22.790
 then watch it together then what 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.790
 also holds 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.990
 we do that with the helmet too 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:53.700
 you can of course also here 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.700
 also goes alternately 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:19.200
 now I'll take my church in not 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.299
 preheated oven at 150 degrees about 15 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.760
 bake minutes 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.980
 My biscuits are out of the oven 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.290
 I will cool it down completely 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:34.410
 leave and then serve on a plate 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:37.230
 to find the cookies from I am pleased 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.410
 of course, on a rating for you 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.120
 and if the recipe pleased you 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.270
 Of course, you also know that with her 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.400
 prejudice and hope that it is fun too 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.650
 did while watching and wishes 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.180
 you have a lot of fun trying it out 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.180
 bye until the next video
