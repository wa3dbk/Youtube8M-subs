because what's happening to this the
tick<00:00:24.630> goes<00:00:24.810> inside<00:00:25.289> your<00:00:25.560> skin<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.340> burrows

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
tick goes inside your skin it burrows

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.040 
tick goes inside your skin it burrows
inside<00:00:27.000> your<00:00:27.180> skin<00:00:27.419> goes<00:00:27.750> down<00:00:27.900> to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
inside your skin goes down to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.290 
inside your skin goes down to
capillaries<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:28.710> it's<00:00:29.220> spit<00:00:29.640> when<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.060> fits

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
capillaries but it's spit when it's fits

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.849 
capillaries but it's spit when it's fits
inside<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.840> does<00:00:30.960> two<00:00:31.170> things<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
inside you it does two things to you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.770 
inside you it does two things to you
one<00:00:32.129> is<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.610> spit<00:00:32.820> access<00:00:33.180> at<00:00:33.300> any<00:00:33.510> clogged

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
one is the spit access at any clogged

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.689 
one is the spit access at any clogged
line<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.559> blood<00:00:34.800> doesn't<00:00:34.949> harden<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.610> it

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
line so your blood doesn't harden so it

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.100 
line so your blood doesn't harden so it
can<00:00:35.820> lop<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.030> blood<00:00:36.330> up<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.720> that's<00:00:36.930> really

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
can lop the blood up and that's really

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.049 
can lop the blood up and that's really
kind<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.440> cool<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:38.309> discussing<00:00:38.879> right<00:00:39.000> now

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
kind of cool little discussing right now

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.240 
kind of cool little discussing right now
but<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.809> kind<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:39.989> cool<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> other

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
but it's kind of cool and the other

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.069 
but it's kind of cool and the other
thing<00:00:41.519> actually<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.420> spit<00:00:42.690> acts<00:00:42.900> like<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
thing actually is the spit acts like a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.710 
thing actually is the spit acts like a
cement<00:00:43.470> so<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.670> head<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:44.970> cemented<00:00:45.449> right

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
cement so it's head is cemented right

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.439 
cement so it's head is cemented right
inside<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.799> it<00:00:47.250> wants<00:00:47.580> that<00:00:47.760> because<00:00:48.299> it

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
inside you so it wants that because it

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.539 
inside you so it wants that because it
wants<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.720> stay<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.100> panic

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:50.549 
wants to stay in there but if you panic

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.130 
wants to stay in there but if you panic
and<00:00:50.699> start<00:00:50.940> pulling<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.750> these<00:00:51.960> things

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and start pulling out on these things

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.289 
and start pulling out on these things
that<00:00:52.440> causes<00:00:53.339> a<00:00:53.400> problem<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:54.089> your

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
that causes a problem because your

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
in the wound and that's gonna cause

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:01.700 
in the wound and that's gonna cause
infection<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.360> the<00:01:00.540> problem<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
have to actually get the tick to come

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.990 
have to actually get the tick to come
out<00:01:04.260> slowly<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:05.280> there's<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> couple<00:01:05.760> ways<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
out slowly now there's a couple ways you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.330 
out slowly now there's a couple ways you
could<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.200> neat<00:01:07.439> thing<00:01:08.220> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
could do this one really neat thing to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.740 
could do this one really neat thing to
do<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:08.670> nothing<00:01:08.970> else<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
do to get nothing else to do or on the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.719 
do to get nothing else to do or on the
camp<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.439> some<00:01:10.590> Vaseline<00:01:11.130> put<00:01:11.580> some

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
camp is get some Vaseline put some

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.300 
camp is get some Vaseline put some
Vaseline<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.689> top<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.979> tick<00:01:14.189> is

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
Vaseline on top of it the tick is

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.310 
Vaseline on top of it the tick is
breathing<00:01:14.759> out<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> its<00:01:15.090> back<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
breathing out of its back in so the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.980 
breathing out of its back in so the
Vaseline<00:01:16.799> will<00:01:17.490> make<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.780> able<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
Vaseline will make it not be able to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.780 
Vaseline will make it not be able to
breathe<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.740> will<00:01:19.860> back<00:01:20.100> its<00:01:20.310> way<00:01:20.430> out<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
breathe so it will back its way out and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.220 
breathe so it will back its way out and
that's<00:01:20.880> really<00:01:21.000> neat<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> watch<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.140> other

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
that's really neat to watch the other

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.800 
that's really neat to watch the other
best<00:01:22.530> way<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.190> get<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.490> bug<00:01:23.670> dope<00:01:23.910> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
best way is just get some bug dope and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.070 
best way is just get some bug dope and
you<00:01:24.960> spray<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.620> tick<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:27.080> you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you spray it on the tick like that you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.570 
you spray it on the tick like that you
can<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.500> now<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.980> that<00:01:29.100> tick<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.460> not

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
can see right now that that tick is not

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.510 
can see right now that that tick is not
liking<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.240> dopes<00:01:30.690> it<00:01:30.870> up<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:32.100> starts

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
liking it it dopes it up and it starts

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.060 
liking it it dopes it up and it starts
getting<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:33.510> dopey<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:34.260> then<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.920> get

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
getting well dopey and then you get

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130 
getting well dopey and then you get
tweezers<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.700> got<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.510> make<00:01:36.630> sure<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.990> go
