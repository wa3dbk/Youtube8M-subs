00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.199
 SMA have 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.400
 one million euros 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.400
 Percent of all claims come 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.230
 Hello 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.789
 it is a right one 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.789
 here is 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.790
 the Italians demand 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.470
 Eltville Red 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.570
 only back in a colleague 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.780
 has been again 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.970
 the exhibition Silent Step is 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.970
 as a whole a loan from Digi the Granny Zohner 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.960
 a collector of this house and this region also long been connected 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.770
 is 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.470
 He is not in the classical sense of an art buyer who only goes to measure 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.180
 but is actually a passionate and for decades 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.430
 tireless 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.490
 Hunters for the special 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.860
 So it's not easy that he has just got all the department store from what 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.200
 he is actually over there too 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.700
 personal and intensive contacts then convince people if they are 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.780
 then at some point separate it also to confide in him 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.490
 so revenge of the many works on his very personal story 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.520
 this is very remarkable for me 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.140
 so that the whole collection also contains a great deal of his passion 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.680
 when one dances on the structure of the exhibition, the stylish one is dancing 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.990
 first to say that 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.750
 if it's quite fundamentally 2 aspects of the subject portfolio works interested 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.750
 One aspect is the question of shipping deletion of pictures 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.580
 this means 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.230
 in principle no longer just single pieces 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.570
 bring out of works in addition to a whole in stock 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.020
 this aspect of duplication has in our age of the modern day 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.020
 insofar received a new face Wallmann 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:15.599
 if only artisanal printing has it but also 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.470
 using the photographer's so-called photographic templates 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.670
 Could produce reproductions and if the exhibition exists accordingly 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.400
 also at least a partial aspect of 11 this question 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.339
 the relationship between original and reproduction 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.959
 a bit lit. 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.639
 there is another aspect of inheriting works of art books 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:43.049
 The center is also the opportunity to tell something by doing more 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.650
 as a single image use it means images are also in 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:47.709
 series 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.029
 so that you just 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:53.819
 certain topics or stories can tell something in more detail that one 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.889
 Certain motives may vary or you can almost populate the themes 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.889
 also different artistic perspectives together 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.979
 so too that are exhibitions quite a lot also make important for that 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:07.429
 Understanding of the work
