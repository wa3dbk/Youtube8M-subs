00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
piece if they had what's called an

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.760 
piece if they had what's called an
upbeat<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:08.640> an<00:01:08.909> anacrusis<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.619> would

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
upbeat or an anacrusis then you would

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.070 
upbeat or an anacrusis then you would
need<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.100> give<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.460> beat<00:01:11.610> before<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.900> we

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
need to give the beat before so if we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.410 
need to give the beat before so if we
were<00:01:13.200> doing<00:01:14.570> way<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.200> sky<00:01:16.700> way<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
were doing way up in the sky way up in

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.859 
were doing way up in the sky way up in
the<00:01:18.720> sky<00:01:18.950> that's<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.130> three<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.460> pattern<00:01:21.210> but

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the sky that's a three for pattern but

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.830 
the sky that's a three for pattern but
they<00:01:22.049> come<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.950> beat<00:01:23.130> before<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> we

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
they come in on the beat before so we

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.819 
they come in on the beat before so we
would<00:01:24.990> need<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> give<00:01:25.409> beat<00:01:25.740> two<00:01:26.869> way<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:28.350> in

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
would need to give beat two way up in

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.149 
would need to give beat two way up in
the<00:01:29.340> sky<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.439> came<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.740> on

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the sky you see that they came in on

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
the sky you see that they came in on
beat<00:01:32.400> three<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> give<00:01:33.900> beat<00:01:34.170> two<00:01:35.210> way<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.689> in

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
beat three so I give beat two way up in

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.770 
beat three so I give beat two way up in
the<00:01:37.619> sky<00:01:38.150> now<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.180> try<00:01:39.600> it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the sky now you try it

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.319 
the sky now you try it
I'll<00:01:40.110> use<00:01:40.409> my<00:01:40.439> left<00:01:40.920> hand<00:01:42.320> way<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.790> sky

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
I'll use my left hand way up in the sky

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.289 
I'll use my left hand way up in the sky
so<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.740> doesn't<00:01:47.130> matter<00:01:47.369> whichever<00:01:48.000> beat

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
so it doesn't matter whichever beat

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.670 
so it doesn't matter whichever beat
they're<00:01:48.509> coming<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.049> whether<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
they're coming on whether it's at the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
they're coming on whether it's at the
beginning<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> piece<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> middle

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
beginning of the piece or in the middle

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
beginning of the piece or in the middle
of<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.540> piece<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.470> need<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.799> make<00:01:53.009> sure<00:01:53.040> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
of a piece you need to make sure that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.730 
of a piece you need to make sure that
you<00:01:53.610> give<00:01:53.850> them<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.090> gesture<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.990> preparation

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
you give them a gesture of preparation

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.609 
you give them a gesture of preparation
and<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.460> always<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> beat<00:01:57.619> previous

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and it will always be the beat previous

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.260 
and it will always be the beat previous
to<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> beat<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.369> they<00:01:59.490> will<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.820> coming<00:01:59.969> in

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.790 
to the beat that they will be coming in
on<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:01.020> sure<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.290> breathe

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800
