human rights broadly I think we're able
to<00:01:39.970> maybe<00:01:40.360> eliminate<00:01:40.900> some<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.680> borders

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280

between poor and rich I think we could

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.080 
between poor and rich I think we could
make<00:01:44.770> an<00:01:44.890> immense<00:01:45.160> difference<00:01:45.460> if<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:45.940> get

make an immense difference if you get

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.550 
make an immense difference if you get
