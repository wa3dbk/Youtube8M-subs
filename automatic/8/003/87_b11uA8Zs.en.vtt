designed by Adam G Cohen if anybody is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.530 
designed by Adam G Cohen if anybody is
curious<00:00:37.200> now<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.890> it's<00:00:40.969> different<00:00:41.969> than

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
curious now this one it's different than

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.979 
curious now this one it's different than
the<00:00:43.190> golden<00:00:44.190> egg<00:00:44.370> because<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.360> golden<00:00:45.780> egg

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
the golden egg because the golden egg

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.450 
the golden egg because the golden egg
its<00:00:47.030> mechanism<00:00:48.079> inside<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.070> scoop

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
its mechanism inside is like a scoop

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.600 
its mechanism inside is like a scoop
right<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.180> one<00:00:51.350> is<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.379> same<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.309> 3<00:00:53.489> by

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
right but this one is the same as a 3 by

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.369 
right but this one is the same as a 3 by
3<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:54.000> an<00:00:54.809> x<00:00:55.190> y&amp;z<00:00:56.190> axis<00:00:56.699> right<00:00:57.170> let's<00:00:58.170> take<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
3 as an x y&amp;z axis right let's take a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.310 
3 as an x y&amp;z axis right let's take a
look<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> second<00:00:59.070> I'll<00:00:59.280> show<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.520> example

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
look for a second I'll show you example

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.740 
look for a second I'll show you example
so<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.379> got<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.710> got<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.100> 3<00:01:02.399> by<00:01:02.520> 3<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
so you got the got the 3 by 3 right it

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.289 
so you got the got the 3 by 3 right it
pretty<00:01:03.930> much<00:01:04.110> matches<00:01:04.439> up<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:06.000> goes<00:01:06.150> in

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
pretty much matches up and it goes in

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.230 
pretty much matches up and it goes in
three<00:01:06.780> layers<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.200> course<00:01:09.350> pretty<00:01:10.350> smart<00:01:10.650> huh

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
three layers of course pretty smart huh

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.630 
three layers of course pretty smart huh
so<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:12.869> no<00:01:13.140> different<00:01:13.170> than<00:01:13.680> your

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
so it's really no different than your

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.380 
so it's really no different than your
mirror<00:01:14.909> box<00:01:15.619> an<00:01:16.619> exception<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.460> your

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
mirror box an exception for your

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780 
mirror box an exception for your
centerpieces<00:01:19.049> will<00:01:19.799> most<00:01:19.979> likely<00:01:20.100> rotate<00:01:20.640> so

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
centerpieces will most likely rotate so

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.520 
centerpieces will most likely rotate so
you'd<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.689> makes<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> little<00:01:22.380> more

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
you'd have to it makes it a little more

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.859 
you'd have to it makes it a little more
challenging<00:01:25.009> now<00:01:26.360> this<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.540> easily<00:01:27.630> be

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
challenging now this can easily be

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.109 
challenging now this can easily be
sticker<00:01:28.229> die<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.430> told<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.939> put

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
sticker die I was told it if I put

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.880 
sticker die I was told it if I put
stickers<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.900> wrinkled<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:31.799> I

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
stickers on it like wrinkled up is if I

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.560 
stickers on it like wrinkled up is if I
put<00:01:32.070> them<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.210> curved<00:01:33.840> edges<00:01:35.570> now

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
put them on the on the curved edges now

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.359 
put them on the on the curved edges now
there's<00:01:37.020> probably<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.320> kinds<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.770> different

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
there's probably all kinds of different

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.429 
there's probably all kinds of different
designs<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.090> with<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> 3x3

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
designs you can do with the 3x3

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.800 
designs you can do with the 3x3
in<00:01:40.920> shapes<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.490> know<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.759> know<00:01:41.850> Tony<00:01:42.509> Fisher

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
in shapes you know you know Tony Fisher

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.490 
in shapes you know you know Tony Fisher
he's<00:01:43.409> proved<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.799> pretty<00:01:44.070> pretty<00:01:44.579> good<00:01:44.759> so

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
he's proved that pretty pretty good so

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.120 
he's proved that pretty pretty good so
I'm<00:01:46.500> actually<00:01:46.680> thinking<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.399> making<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.950> V<00:01:49.950> ball

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
I'm actually thinking on making a V ball

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.819 
I'm actually thinking on making a V ball
just<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.549> his<00:01:50.790> once<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.530> proper

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
just like his once I get the the proper

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.100 
just like his once I get the the proper
tools<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.310> also<00:01:54.060> some<00:01:54.240> goggles<00:01:54.420> always<00:01:54.960> got

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
tools and also some goggles always got

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.990 
tools and also some goggles always got
to<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.259> safe<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.250> pretty<00:01:59.520> pretty

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
to be safe so and that's pretty pretty

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.929 
to be safe so and that's pretty pretty
quick<00:02:00.180> greedy<00:02:00.619> now<00:02:01.939> okay

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
quick greedy now okay

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.240 
quick greedy now okay

next week I hope and I'll be doing the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.570 
next week I hope and I'll be doing the
little<00:02:10.569> video<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.020> if<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:12.040> does<00:02:12.190> come<00:02:12.430> to

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
little video on that if it does come to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.370 
little video on that if it does come to
me<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:14.319> Chinese<00:02:14.530> 19<00:02:14.950> by<00:02:15.040> 9<00:02:15.989> it's<00:02:16.989> coming

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
me and the Chinese 19 by 9 it's coming

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.370 
me and the Chinese 19 by 9 it's coming
out<00:02:17.790> next<00:02:18.790> month<00:02:18.970> or<00:02:19.269> this<00:02:19.480> month<00:02:19.690> which<00:02:20.080> is

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
out next month or this month which is

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.820 
out next month or this month which is
now<00:02:20.890> June<00:02:21.250> it's<00:02:22.200> pretty<00:02:23.200> much<00:02:23.319> doomed<00:02:23.530> for<00:02:23.739> me

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
now June it's pretty much doomed for me

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.110 
now June it's pretty much doomed for me
in<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.190> few<00:02:24.400> more<00:02:24.550> hours<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:26.550> now<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.790> might<00:02:27.940> not

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
in a few more hours so now it might not

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.870 
in a few more hours so now it might not
come<00:02:28.300> out<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.569> it's<00:02:28.930> kind<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.260> been<00:02:29.380> delayed

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880
