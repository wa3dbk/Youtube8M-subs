suppose but definitely this is something
that<00:02:18.000> has<00:02:18.840> been<00:02:18.870> necessary<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.520> long<00:02:21.300> time

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750

this is some really interesting stuff
I'm<00:03:15.959> glad<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.920> funding<00:03:17.310> gate<00:03:17.489> because

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
I'm glad that this funding gate because

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.550 
I'm glad that this funding gate because
I've<00:03:17.820> been<00:03:17.850> trying<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.300> get<00:03:18.420> people<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.380> play

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
I've been trying to get people to play

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.440 
I've been trying to get people to play
with<00:03:19.650> me<00:03:19.920> but<00:03:20.100> they<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.459> will<00:03:20.910> not<00:03:21.120> because

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
with me but they just will not because

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.910 
with me but they just will not because
they<00:03:21.540> too<00:03:21.600> are<00:03:21.720> nice<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.260> mechanics<00:03:22.680> and

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
they too are nice and mechanics and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.699 
they too are nice and mechanics and
hopefully<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.850> really<00:03:24.300> basic<00:03:24.630> stuff<00:03:24.709> will

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
hopefully this really basic stuff will

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.710 
hopefully this really basic stuff will
help<00:03:26.100> them<00:03:26.489> with<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.000> third<00:03:27.150> base<00:03:27.360> it's<00:03:27.600> now

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
help them with the third base it's now

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.240 
help them with the third base it's now
let's<00:03:27.900> go<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.050> battle<00:03:28.350> training<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.950> see<00:03:29.100> what

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
let's go to battle training and see what

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.010 
let's go to battle training and see what
this<00:03:29.459> is<00:03:29.700> hopefully<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.660> something<00:03:30.750> you

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
this is hopefully it's something you

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.600 
this is hopefully it's something you
know<00:03:31.140> interesting

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
know interesting

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.810 
know interesting
it's<00:03:33.060> all<00:03:33.210> blocks<00:03:33.600> oh<00:03:33.810> okay<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.550> it's<00:03:35.580> just

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
it's all blocks oh okay so it's just

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.900 
it's all blocks oh okay so it's just
this<00:03:36.030> map<00:03:36.270> and<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.690> looks<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.080> know<00:03:37.910> it

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
this map and it looks you know it

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.340 
this map and it looks you know it
doesn't<00:03:39.270> look<00:03:39.390> proper<00:03:39.720> but<00:03:40.020> then<00:03:40.140> it's<00:03:40.260> not

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
doesn't look proper but then it's not

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.200 
doesn't look proper but then it's not
meant<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.680> either<00:03:40.860> oh<00:03:41.160> I<00:03:41.370> gotta<00:03:41.610> decide<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:41.940> be

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
meant to either oh I gotta decide to be

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.040 
meant to either oh I gotta decide to be
I<00:03:42.450> gotta<00:03:43.290> say<00:03:43.500> seven<00:03:44.010> Titans<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.580> or<00:03:45.210> does<00:03:45.630> feel

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
I gotta say seven Titans is or does feel

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.280 
I gotta say seven Titans is or does feel
a<00:03:46.080> bit<00:03:46.410> too<00:03:46.890> much<00:03:47.030> for<00:03:48.030> beginners<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.020> handle

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
a bit too much for beginners to handle

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.440 
a bit too much for beginners to handle
and<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:50.280> fact<00:03:50.520> that<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.850> place<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.300> so

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
and the fact that the place is so

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.660 
and the fact that the place is so
cramped<00:03:51.900> does<00:03:52.140> make<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.500> bit<00:03:52.530> weird<00:03:52.980> but

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
cramped does make it a bit weird but

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.610 
cramped does make it a bit weird but
it's<00:03:54.030> much<00:03:54.360> better<00:03:54.540> than<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.840> old<00:03:55.080> training

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
it's much better than the old training

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.480 
it's much better than the old training
map<00:03:55.770> which<00:03:55.950> was<00:03:56.100> 32<00:03:56.790> Titans<00:03:57.240> in<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:58.200> know<00:03:58.350> in<00:03:58.950> a

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
map which was 32 Titans in you know in a

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.130 
map which was 32 Titans in you know in a
very<00:03:59.670> cramped<00:04:00.060> space<00:04:00.330> so<00:04:00.630> definitely<00:04:00.840> this

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
very cramped space so definitely this

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.160 
very cramped space so definitely this
one's<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.530> lot<00:04:01.950> better<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.670> yeah<00:04:03.540> that's<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
one's a lot better and yeah that's the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.310 
one's a lot better and yeah that's the
way<00:04:04.320> it<00:04:04.470> is<00:04:05.420> that's<00:04:06.420> everything<00:04:07.170> for

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
way it is that's everything for

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.480 
way it is that's everything for
single-player<00:04:07.800> don't<00:04:08.160> think<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> new

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
single-player don't think a new

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.920 
single-player don't think a new
characters<00:04:08.910> added<00:04:09.090> nope<00:04:10.640> multiplayer<00:04:11.750> if<00:04:12.750> we

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
characters added nope multiplayer if we

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.300 
characters added nope multiplayer if we
quickly<00:04:13.110> create<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.500> game<00:04:14.900> has<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:16.320> forest<00:04:16.829> full

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
quickly create a game has a forest full

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.640 
quickly create a game has a forest full
with<00:04:17.669> larvae<00:04:18.419> which<00:04:18.630> is<00:04:18.780> really<00:04:19.079> cool<00:04:19.260> there's
