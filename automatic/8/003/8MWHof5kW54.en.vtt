00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.359 
versus someone let's say the hair who is
straight<00:01:39.259> here<00:01:39.409> if<00:01:39.500> their<00:01:39.619> hair<00:01:39.799> has<00:01:40.250> grown

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
straight here if their hair has grown

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.700 
straight here if their hair has grown
this<00:01:40.700> much<00:01:40.939> it'll<00:01:41.540> actually<00:01:41.750> look<00:01:42.229> like<00:01:42.259> your

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
this much it'll actually look like your

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.410 
this much it'll actually look like your
hair's<00:01:42.920> grown<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:43.460> much<00:01:43.700> if<00:01:43.939> you<00:01:44.060> have<00:01:44.210> curly

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
hair's grown this much if you have curly

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.289 
hair's grown this much if you have curly
hair<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.530> personally<00:01:46.250> it's<00:01:46.490> like<00:01:46.729> if<00:01:46.970> I

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
hair and so personally it's like if I

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.330 
hair and so personally it's like if I
got<00:01:47.479> my<00:01:47.600> hair<00:01:47.780> cut<00:01:47.990> once<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.500> month<00:01:48.710> then<00:01:49.189> it'd

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
got my hair cut once a month then it'd

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.999 
got my hair cut once a month then it'd
be<00:01:49.490> like<00:01:49.610> I'd<00:01:49.820> be<00:01:50.030> cutting<00:01:50.390> more<00:01:50.840> hair<00:01:51.439> off<00:01:51.649> and

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
be like I'd be cutting more hair off and

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.380 
be like I'd be cutting more hair off and
is<00:01:52.159> actually<00:01:52.549> growing<00:01:52.729> if<00:01:52.939> that<00:01:53.090> makes<00:01:53.270> sense

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
is actually growing if that makes sense

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.630 
is actually growing if that makes sense
so<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:53.960> guess<00:01:54.079> it<00:01:54.259> really<00:01:54.469> just<00:01:54.920> depends<00:01:55.310> on

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
so I guess it really just depends on

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.240 
so I guess it really just depends on
like<00:01:55.820> how<00:01:56.000> fast<00:01:56.299> your<00:01:56.509> hair<00:01:56.659> grows<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.250> my

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
like how fast your hair grows and my

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.240 
like how fast your hair grows and my
point<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:58.939> personally<00:01:59.930> I<00:02:00.170> barely<00:02:00.829> get<00:02:01.189> my

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
point is personally I barely get my

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.670 
point is personally I barely get my
haircut<00:02:01.579> ever<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.960> found<00:02:03.200> out<00:02:03.380> like

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680

single day seventh and eighth grade my

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.310 
single day seventh and eighth grade my
hair<00:02:34.430> was<00:02:34.550> pretty<00:02:34.790> much<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.090> mess<00:02:35.420> really<00:02:36.020> dead

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
hair was pretty much a mess really dead

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.620 
hair was pretty much a mess really dead
like<00:02:36.590> let's<00:02:37.010> say<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.400> now<00:02:37.670> this<00:02:38.030> much<00:02:38.270> would

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
like let's say it is now this much would

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.840 
like let's say it is now this much would
be<00:02:38.810> like<00:02:38.990> split<00:02:39.440> ends<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:39.950> dead<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.490> is

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
be like split ends and dead it is

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.940 
be like split ends and dead it is
practiced<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:41.780> much<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.290> it's<00:02:42.410> not<00:02:42.560> as<00:02:42.680> curly

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
practiced so much and it's not as curly

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.800 
practiced so much and it's not as curly
as<00:02:43.070> it<00:02:43.220> used<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.460> be<00:02:43.580> because<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:44.000> this<00:02:44.270> so

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
as it used to be because of this so

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.420 
as it used to be because of this so
anything<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.380> do<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.650> heat<00:02:45.890> blow<00:02:46.160> dryers

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
anything to do with heat blow dryers

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.970 
anything to do with heat blow dryers
aren't<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:46.970> bad<00:02:47.210> but<00:02:47.840> more<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.800> like

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
aren't that bad but more of like

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.580 
aren't that bad but more of like
straighteners<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.120> curling<00:02:50.420> irons<00:02:50.660> those

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
straighteners and curling irons those

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.220 
straighteners and curling irons those
can<00:02:51.950> be<00:02:51.980> really<00:02:52.730> damaging<00:02:52.970> to<00:02:53.360> your<00:02:53.450> hair<00:02:53.750> so

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
can be really damaging to your hair so

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.660 
can be really damaging to your hair so
the<00:02:54.350> number<00:02:54.620> one<00:02:54.740> thing<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.340> stay<00:02:55.370> away

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
the number one thing is to stay away

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.360 
the number one thing is to stay away
from<00:02:55.760> anything<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.750> do<00:02:56.900> with<00:02:57.050> heat<00:02:57.320> so<00:02:58.010> also

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
from anything to do with heat so also

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.860 
from anything to do with heat so also
I've<00:02:58.580> heard<00:02:58.790> there's<00:02:59.090> like<00:02:59.240> no<00:02:59.540> way<00:02:59.810> to

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
I've heard there's like no way to

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.020 
I've heard there's like no way to
physically<00:03:00.560> make<00:03:00.770> your<00:03:00.980> hair<00:03:01.130> grow<00:03:01.160> faster

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
physically make your hair grow faster

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.060 
physically make your hair grow faster
and<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.600> do<00:03:02.660> how<00:03:02.990> to<00:03:03.020> believe<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.650> I'm<00:03:03.860> or

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
and I do how to believe that I'm or

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.370 
and I do how to believe that I'm or
believes<00:03:04.430> like<00:03:04.700> if<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.450> take<00:03:05.810> good<00:03:06.050> care<00:03:06.080> of

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
believes like if you take good care of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.840 
believes like if you take good care of
your<00:03:06.560> hair<00:03:06.710> you<00:03:06.950> don't<00:03:07.190> have<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.460> get<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.700> cut

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
your hair you don't have to get it cut

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.370 
your hair you don't have to get it cut
so<00:03:08.060> then<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.300> seems<00:03:08.570> as<00:03:08.810> if<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:09.140> growing

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
so then it seems as if it's growing

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.620 
so then it seems as if it's growing
faster<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.130> that<00:03:10.430> makes<00:03:10.580> sense<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.300> another

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
faster and that makes sense so another

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.320 
faster and that makes sense so another
