00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
I thought I'd just give you a taste of

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.919 
I thought I'd just give you a taste of
what's<00:00:07.230> going<00:00:07.379> on<00:00:07.620> here<00:00:08.480> I've<00:00:09.480> done<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.750> few

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
what's going on here I've done a few

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.980 
what's going on here I've done a few
mods<00:00:10.380> already<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:11.880> Lee<00:00:12.599> Ann<00:00:12.809> Lee<00:00:13.080> case<00:00:14.990> so

mods already to this Lee Ann Lee case so

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.750 
mods already to this Lee Ann Lee case so
you<00:00:16.049> can<00:00:16.170> see<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.350> detailed<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.460> lot<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
you can see I detailed a lot of the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.730 
you can see I detailed a lot of the
powder<00:00:17.970> coating<00:00:18.359> stuff<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.109> removable

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
powder coating stuff like this removable

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.279 
powder coating stuff like this removable
hard<00:00:20.490> drive<00:00:20.580> caddy<00:00:21.119> took<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.689> totally<00:00:22.020> part

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
hard drive caddy took a totally part

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.450 
hard drive caddy took a totally part
powder<00:00:22.590> coated<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.990> plextor<00:00:25.160> DVD<00:00:26.160> took

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
powder coated it this plextor DVD took

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.700 
powder coated it this plextor DVD took
it<00:00:26.670> apart<00:00:27.050> powder<00:00:28.050> coated<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:30.349> when<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.380> mount

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
it apart powder coated it when I mount

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.940 
it apart powder coated it when I mount
up<00:00:32.090> fans<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.420> radiators<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:33.899> stuff<00:00:34.290> it's

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
up fans and radiators and stuff it's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.090 
up fans and radiators and stuff it's
pretty<00:00:35.219> easy<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.610> isolate<00:00:36.829> vibrations<00:00:37.829> if<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
pretty easy to isolate vibrations if you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.340 
pretty easy to isolate vibrations if you
just<00:00:38.309> use<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:39.120> correct<00:00:39.420> combinations<00:00:40.200> of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
just use the correct combinations of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.330 
just use the correct combinations of
stuff<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.610> helps<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.390> kinds<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
stuff and it helps to have all kinds of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.160 
stuff and it helps to have all kinds of
hardware<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.420> you'll<00:00:45.629> want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> buy

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
hardware and then you'll want to buy

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.470 
hardware and then you'll want to buy
more<00:00:46.440> hardware<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.309> then<00:00:47.489> you'll<00:00:47.910> want<00:00:48.000> some

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
more hardware and then you'll want some

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 
more hardware and then you'll want some
more<00:00:48.960> hardware<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.309> what

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
more hardware just so you can get what

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.720 
more hardware just so you can get what
you<00:00:50.579> want<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.629> case<00:00:52.160> i'm<00:00:53.160> using<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
you want in this case i'm using the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.110 
you want in this case i'm using the
silicon<00:00:54.710> these<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:55.949> guna<00:00:56.489> ass<00:00:56.670> these<00:00:56.969> are

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
silicon these are not guna ass these are

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.389 
silicon these are not guna ass these are
silicone<00:00:57.570> rubber<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> higher

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
silicone rubber and they have a higher

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.460 
silicone rubber and they have a higher
damping<00:00:59.969> value<00:01:00.899> than<00:01:01.109> buna<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:03.470> there's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
damping value than buna and then there's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.550 
damping value than buna and then there's
also<00:01:04.790> silicon<00:01:05.810> these<00:01:06.810> come<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.409> noise

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
also silicon these come with the noise

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.550 
also silicon these come with the noise
blockers<00:01:08.250> like<00:01:09.619> little<00:01:11.090> screw<00:01:12.110> Isolators<00:01:13.110> so

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
blockers like little screw Isolators so

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.590 
blockers like little screw Isolators so
that<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.130> like<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.369> tea<00:01:14.580> well<00:01:14.850> type<00:01:15.299> thing<00:01:15.570> so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that it's like a tea well type thing so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.469 
that it's like a tea well type thing so
it's<00:01:15.930> isolates<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> entire<00:01:16.890> screw<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.490> then

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
it's isolates the entire screw and then

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.070 
it's isolates the entire screw and then
of<00:01:19.170> course<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.590> used<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.100> button<00:01:20.520> head<00:01:21.080> black

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
of course I used a button head black

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.640 
of course I used a button head black

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
oxide throughout this is the LAN League

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.819 
oxide throughout this is the LAN League
grill<00:01:26.040> okay<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.939> been<00:01:27.060> matched<00:01:27.829> double

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
grill okay it's been matched double

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.929 
grill okay it's been matched double
nutted<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:30.420> tiny<00:01:32.689> isolator<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:34.020> of

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
nutted a little tiny isolator out of

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.640 
nutted a little tiny isolator out of
that's<00:01:35.939> always<00:01:36.329> really<00:01:36.360> room<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:36.840> these

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
that's always really room for these

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.410 
that's always really room for these
things<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.100> care<00:01:38.340> anyway<00:01:38.700> underneath<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
things we care anyway underneath and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.999 
things we care anyway underneath and
stuff<00:01:39.630> there's<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> big<00:01:40.079> gap<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> big

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
stuff there's a big gap there and a big

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.520 
stuff there's a big gap there and a big
gap<00:01:41.250> there<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.090> little<00:01:42.960> tiny<00:01:43.140> space

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
gap there so it's a little tiny space

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.410 
gap there so it's a little tiny space
like<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> little<00:01:44.220> 30-second<00:01:45.000> inch<00:01:45.149> base

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
like that a little 30-second inch base

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.880 
like that a little 30-second inch base
of<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.780> national<00:01:46.170> difference<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.680> sort

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
of the national difference and this sort

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.530 
of the national difference and this sort
of<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.579> dampen<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> whole<00:01:48.180> thing<00:01:48.390> now

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
of will dampen the whole thing now

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
of will dampen the whole thing now
because<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.979> overlaps<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
because as you can see this overlaps the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.289 
because as you can see this overlaps the
motherboard<00:01:51.329> quite<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> bit<00:01:52.110> okay<00:01:53.000> got<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
motherboard quite a bit okay got the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.179 
motherboard quite a bit okay got the
thumb<00:01:54.899> nut<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.290> these<00:01:55.500> come<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.009> noise

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
thumb nut so these come with the noise

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.310 
thumb nut so these come with the noise
blockers<00:01:56.700> every<00:01:57.390> noiseblocker<00:01:57.750> comes<00:01:58.170> with

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
blockers every noiseblocker comes with

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.789

things for little and a gasket and we're

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.540 
things for little and a gasket and we're
not<00:02:07.020> using<00:02:07.229> them<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.619> there<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.950> go<00:02:07.979> got<00:02:08.429> all

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
not using them so there you go got all

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.919 
not using them so there you go got all
this<00:02:08.670> extra<00:02:09.000> hardware<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> play<00:02:09.599> with<00:02:09.750> and

what this does this makes the
radiator<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.409> going<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.739> easily<00:02:14.040> removable

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
radiator is going to be easily removable

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.979 
radiator is going to be easily removable
they'll<00:02:14.760> be<00:02:14.879> quick<00:02:15.120> disconnects<00:02:15.690> you<00:02:15.870> can

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
they'll be quick disconnects you can

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.630 
they'll be quick disconnects you can
just<00:02:16.140> take<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.319> radiator<00:02:16.830> out<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.519> when

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
just take the radiator out so that when

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.920 
just take the radiator out so that when
you<00:02:17.700> want<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:17.970> get<00:02:18.090> at<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.420> motherboard

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
you want to get at the motherboard

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.289 
you want to get at the motherboard
there's<00:02:19.200> no<00:02:19.379> issues<00:02:19.830> with<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.310> taking<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.180> in

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
there's no issues with it taking it in

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.520 
there's no issues with it taking it in
and<00:02:21.330> out<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:21.930> see<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.260> could<00:02:22.379> be<00:02:22.500> a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and out as you can see it could be a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.470 
and out as you can see it could be a
real<00:02:22.769> juggling<00:02:23.069> match<00:02:23.459> well<00:02:24.030> let's<00:02:24.209> take<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
real juggling match well let's take the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.780 
real juggling match well let's take the
power<00:02:24.629> supply<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.530> senator<00:02:25.920> another

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
power supply to the senator another

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.580 
power supply to the senator another
little<00:02:27.060> thing<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.299> did<00:02:27.450> okay<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.170> case<00:02:28.440> is

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
little thing I did okay this case is

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.830 
little thing I did okay this case is
going<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.799> be<00:02:28.890> drawing<00:02:29.129> air<00:02:29.579> in<00:02:29.810> from<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
going to be drawing air in from the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.229 
going to be drawing air in from the
bottom<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.500> there's<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.610> be<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.790> vent

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
bottom and there's going to be a vent

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.190 
bottom and there's going to be a vent
cut<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> side<00:02:34.110> panel<00:02:34.650> right<00:02:35.579> here<00:02:36.090> okay<00:02:36.569> so

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
cut in the side panel right here okay so

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.979 
cut in the side panel right here okay so
it'll<00:02:37.379> be<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> long<00:02:37.709> slot<00:02:38.280> there<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.989> there's

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
it'll be a long slot there and there's

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.770 
it'll be a long slot there and there's
this<00:02:40.140> area<00:02:40.530> here<00:02:40.980> okay<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.760> then<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.599> a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
this area here okay and then this is a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.380 
this area here okay and then this is a
removable<00:02:43.440> filter<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.760> that<00:02:44.790> it's<00:02:45.239> really

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
removable filter so that it's really

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.940 
removable filter so that it's really
easy<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.690> keep<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.079> dust<00:02:46.290> out<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.769> thing

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
easy to keep the dust out of the thing

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.619 
easy to keep the dust out of the thing
and<00:02:46.980> there'll<00:02:47.250> be<00:02:47.280> another<00:02:47.609> removable<00:02:48.299> filter

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
and there'll be another removable filter

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.240 
and there'll be another removable filter
same<00:02:48.840> material<00:02:49.349> right<00:02:49.530> there<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.040> it'll<00:02:50.190> be

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
same material right there so it'll be

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.780 
same material right there so it'll be
easy<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.670> remove<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.980> filters<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.579> dust

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
here and get go further along but I got

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.670 
here and get go further along but I got
two<00:03:30.030> more<00:03:30.180> radiators<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.870> dump<00:03:31.079> in<00:03:31.260> there<00:03:31.470> and

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
two more radiators to dump in there and

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.159 
two more radiators to dump in there and
then<00:03:31.829> pump<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.849> we'll<00:03:33.480> take<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.720> little<00:03:33.959> look

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
then pump and we'll take a little look

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.879 
then pump and we'll take a little look
at<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.410> situation<00:03:34.620> see<00:03:35.280> what<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.519> looks<00:03:35.669> like
