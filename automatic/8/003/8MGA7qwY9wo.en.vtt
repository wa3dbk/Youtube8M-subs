00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.970
 Hello everyone in this video 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.860
 today I'm going to talk about diets 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.870
 sugar- free small dieting without 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.269
 sugar to lose weight is a sugar 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.919
 type of carbohydrate it's a carbohydrate 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.690
 simple to a very assimilated carbohydrate 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.410
 quickly by the body and so 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.240
 when not in use 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.130
 immediately it is stored in form 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.539
 of fat eating too sweet it's a 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.250
 little like eating too fat you eat 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.900
 too much energy and your body is doing 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.939
 reserves could use this energy 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.339
 later on so it should be done 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.140
 sugar-free diet to lose weight in fact 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.820
 it poses a problem with sugar 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.590
 it's the sweet taste you get used to 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.210
 very quickly there is a phenomenon that one 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.309
 calls adaptation and logistics 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.750
 it's the exact scientific term for 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.379
 to say that one simply gets used to 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.120
 at pleasure 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.559
 so when we eat regularly 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.270
 sugar one is used to eating this 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.430
 quantity of sugar we do not like 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.320
 the more a lot of people do then 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.730
 the mistake of increasing the quantities of 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.039
 sugar to regain the pleasure of taste 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.809
 sweet and so they eat more and 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.910
 more calories and wholesalers 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.410
 if you love to eat so much sweet if 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.910
 sugar is your weak point 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.100
 so maybe you would have advantage 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.210
 to pay attention to sugar so far 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.010
 it is not necessary to eliminate 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.960
 completely sugar is mostly a 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.610
 matter of being reasonable and eating 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.650
 balanced ie to eat varied 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.330
 if you eat sweet foods but 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.430
 that next to you also eat a lot of 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.990
 vegetable proteins and lipids the 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.509
 carbs and that your diet and 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.960
 moderate then the sugar will not change 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.460
 big thing 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.829
 sugar must be part of a 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.090
 balanced diet obviously he 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.290
 is very dangerous to consume very 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.939
 large amounts of sugar or 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.710
 consume only sugar but 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.479
 eat a little sugar does not pose any 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.280
 problem this is not what you 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.479
 prevent to lose weight to lose weight there 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.979
 no secret you have to change 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.329
 gradually his bad habits 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.340
 in good habits 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.259
 and save your motivation 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.390
 in the long run because motivation 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.100
 is not unlimited if your weak point 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.210
 is to eat sugar too often 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.430
 eat too much 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.930
 so get in the habit of rectifying 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.250
 this bad habit and you 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.350
 limit on the quantities of sugar 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.299
 eat a sweet food for pleasure 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.799
 sweet taste but tell you well that 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.299
 you have a weak point at this level 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.110
 and that if you let yourself eat from 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.520
 too large quantities 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.469
 then you may have problems 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.759
 to progress and lose weight do you 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.500
 pleasure from time to time give yourself 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.030
 small pleasures and regular and 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 also continues to make efforts on 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.149
 all the other shots of your food 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.830
 passion weight loss is not done 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.090
 not overnight we do not lose 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.770
 fat more quickly than two or 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.600
 three kilos a month this is not the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.250
 sugar that causes the imbalance is the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.360
 world of other foods if you eat 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.190
 sugar but you have a 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.810
 varied diet very balanced 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.280
 and reasonable then there is no 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.990
 because sugar is bad for 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.400
 you're just getting into the habit of 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.770
 be careful and pay attention 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.260
 to sugars if it is a weak point 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.670
 for you to recap this video 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.050
 what is a diet without class 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.090
 that a sugar-free diet is useful for 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.500
 to lose weight sugar is a carbohydrate 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.300
 simple a very assimilated carbohydrate 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.920
 quickly by the body when not 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.660
 not used it is immediately stored 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.040
 in the form of fat the sugar in 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.360
 itself is not harmful it's just to 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.709
 a certain molecules that so is a 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.209
 number of calories if you 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.560
 abuse sugar if that's your point 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.160
 weak then paid attention to his 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.390
 consumption 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.500
 but it is useless to deprive you 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.480
 completely the sugar itself 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.370
 does not prevent melee just doing 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.450
 careful not to overeat take 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.800
 as a good habit of eating it 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.630
 regularly but very little 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.930
 quantity simply for the pleasure of 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.930
 sweet taste
