00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:25.720
 the case for iphones installers 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.080
 we do it still issues this 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.850
 for companies but we have an attitude 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.280
 very large in the product state for 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.400
 have good fashion this second 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.100
 knowledge does not really exist 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.420
 an ecological fashion in Peru only 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.690
 some efforts of designers 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.940
 independents who do things with what 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.860
 that can recycle including recycle 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.470
 clothes the same standard clothes the 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.960
 Transforms that either new clothes is a 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.010
 way to recycle or insane 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.780
 with respect to materials and 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.780
 work really is very new 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.000
 but is doing this way I know 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.869
 it is used are added 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.710
 fibers for example to manufacture this 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.380
 polar 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.160
 but in this way and giving the emphasis 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.590
 what we want to give you is 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.830
 because our next step is to do 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.710

 inclusion caps and we have made hats 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.120
 then this actually says it's a 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.150
 fabric that you have to develop simply 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.959
