00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.720
 we present the summary of what 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.610

 fans started this clash the first 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.199
 arrival of the arch was for llaneros 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 the tasty argentinian tasted lucky by 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.519
 the left side on the part of the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.369
 academics giancarlo maldonado was trying 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.310
 from afar without success subsequently it is 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.949
 the corner appears again sarosa for 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.129
 send it to the wilfredo area alvarado but 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.000
 this one does not manage to nod at 14 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.219
 game minutes 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.519
 luís garcía makes the tie shiver 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.559
 with the arrival of the long- awaited goal of 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.600
 llaneros from the corner los merideños 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.090
 they tried but the defense holy 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.339
 rejected and on the other hand the cases 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.710
 they responded with a second goal when 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.870
 from the corner norberto riascos receives 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.940
 a ball in the area and in one hand to 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.370
 hand with the academic goalkeeper the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.589
 sent to save with the score in favor 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.869
 llaneros commits an oversight in the part 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.490
 defensive that gives you the opportunity to 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.340
 discount students 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.590
 through Luciano but at 28 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.500
 minutes of play so they went to rest 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.630
 and the second part would still be loaded with 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.640
 goals the Colombian Cesar Alzate 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.280
 got a duel with the keeper 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.830
 academic who manages to win to mark the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.600
 third in favor of the student battalion 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.640
 I was looking for all ways to go back in 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.250
 the marker however the answer 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.710
 llanera did not wait and is that a 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.960
 the 61 kings give a pass to luis garcía 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.509
 that he manages to lead the rival arch 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.289
 to get the second in your account 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.630
 staff at 82 would finally close 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.690
 the account when the juvenile Janowski 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.869
 Kings breaks the academic networks with the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.200
 fifth goal in favor of the holy battalion I 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.450
 I read everything in a group then there cms 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.399
 gave me the opportunity to score from de 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.500

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:09.119
 points at home we started adding three 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:12.030
 points that were important not that not 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.939
 we had this got that victory that 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.500
 at home and thanks 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:24.840
 today thank God this is the result 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.329
 5 to 1 and we could have this triumph that 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.579
 we need the team and the group to 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.680
 grasp the trust and have taken it back 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.420
 again in the position table since 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.180
 this new last and good situation 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.430
 that we are economic and political 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.430
 there is not a very good basis to god today 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.720
 we could the continent get a 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.090
 very important result and hopefully that 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.549
 on Wednesday be equally happy for 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.890
 the boys for the group we gave everything 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.079
 As each party we give all each 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.909
 Sunday in every match that we left 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.769
 we win the best of us good today 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.629
 the result of that because it has 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.190
 developed we could mark enough 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.079
 very important goals to win the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.239
 trust this is the reality of this 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.269
 team when you want to be forceful 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.799
 especially here in the local in the streets 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.239
 I paint that is where we make ourselves 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.700
 strong we made the tournament strong 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.299
 passed where slogans were fulfilled 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.000
 clear objectives of getting a vote with 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.920
 at the end for an international glass 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.599
 and this is the reality 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.060
 problems that all these factors 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.060
 externalities have taken us out of concentration 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.690
 the concentration levels has been low 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.099
 unfortunately we did not have the best 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.020
 starting point of view of the 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.569
 preparation and that was what affected us the 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.270
 first days but this one team 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.730
 who knows how to play plays football generates 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.560
 produces and today prove it to a rival 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.800
 that is coming strong over everything 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.180
 the road and today we were forceful 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.989
 with this bulky score of 5 goals 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.610
 for 1 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.800
 llaneros get important of mine 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.840
 moods to try to counteract the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.790
 complicated extra-sports situation that 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.489
 crosses the team from square one 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.489
 I report Manuel Alvarado for football
