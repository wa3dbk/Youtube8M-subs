00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.590
 the project gave access to a menu so propose an alternative to the 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.969
 overconsumption of clothing 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.029
 in vain recovering clothes that are used for various reasons 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:16.320
 having the alps by diverting their use by restructuring them again 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.809
 piece that single watch for example has risen to 1 6% and tenaciously make go 

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:24.080
 in this context a sprite 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.080
 in fact it is 100% 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.080
 with quite a lot and so patterns like that 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.560
 a little easy malady 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.030
 so here I am reading more the world 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.180
 on the one hand 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.080
 the nail of the finances she raised as to leave patty schwartz nike 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.010
 we think a suite 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.590
 and that's enough to interest me so I'll use it as holy 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.950
 shroud 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.380
 parallel main do it 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.360
 and then apart from that the other two elements ie 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.840
 a tank top 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.250
 nothing since their creation there is a single little thought for example you 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.390
 can not 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.590
 a small antenna 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.810
 so if you are looking for 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.320
 will end up fighting 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 44th longshoremen 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.330
 it means 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.820
 belted per hour by profession 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.490
 in fact we have only one thing that allows us to afp 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.580
 it is certainly more 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.000
 but we can not continue to separate in place and to say 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.360
 I'm going to do something with his clothes the market at the carrier market 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.830
 tomorrow's europe grandmother then serves can be revisited strong by month 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.580
 to convey the emotional charge is in power worry less someone 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.920
 else 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.330
 when she will be deprived of pau like that so it is true that this approach 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.570
 personal who already equips who is already well anchored before I 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.060
 meets girls is common 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.290
 passed consciousness to the project 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.770
 l access to road accidents 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.800
 so do it again to think about reliving it 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.610
 and so that's all the philosophy around the project and not just for 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.470
 hundred and 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.580
 of the Eurocity of clothing but also to rethink how to consume 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.420
 m 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.589
 since 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:10.859
 I'm nothing 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.769
 finally off I was there with a spoon 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.229
 and I want to convey his situation 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.629
 we want to touch people we want it to come from victory 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.689
 we do not give 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.689
 because since 19th paris 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.669
 because because that's how many people see more of ours 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:30.559
 also today 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.269
 and an assemblage of doing past missions with different patterns and 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.029
 then cut out the adjacent pivot mini-center farm 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.379
 and then managing a little bit of high-level for his 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.919
 sophistication 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.089
 I wanted to embark on the creation of a society that was 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.929
 sure because I did not want to work 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:51.860
 e with ten days 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.050
 upstream of this sum 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.420
 I said to myself that's what I need to make new meaning to us 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.599
 to touch 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.920
 try this kind of project that I want to vote against those who had everything to 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.719
 do it so it's really interesting 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.669
 and in addition we found the three loops 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.529
 so from the point 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.259
 it's a bit of a coincidence but a happy coincidence
