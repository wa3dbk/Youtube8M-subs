00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.789 
goes into all of this as you can see so
yeah<00:04:18.340> that's<00:04:18.549> basically<00:04:18.729> just<00:04:19.120> what<00:04:20.019> I<00:04:20.049> did<00:04:20.440> to

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
yeah that's basically just what I did to

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.399 
yeah that's basically just what I did to
the<00:04:20.919> hair<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.159> dyed<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.880> used<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.389> door<00:04:22.690> and<00:04:23.020> I

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
the hair I dyed it I used a door and I

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.159 
the hair I dyed it I used a door and I
will<00:04:23.560> purge<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.889> I'll<00:04:24.130> put<00:04:24.400> everything<00:04:24.639> down

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
will purge it I'll put everything down

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.640 
will purge it I'll put everything down
but<00:04:26.520> yeah<00:04:27.520> that's<00:04:27.790> basically<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:29.139> this<00:04:29.380> hair

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
but yeah that's basically it this hair

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.670 
but yeah that's basically it this hair
is<00:04:29.770> amazing<00:04:30.070> there's<00:04:31.000> barely<00:04:31.810> any<00:04:32.110> shedding

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
is amazing there's barely any shedding

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.650 
is amazing there's barely any shedding
and<00:04:32.919> if<00:04:33.040> it<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:33.250> like<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.520> said<00:04:33.550> it's<00:04:33.790> operator

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
and if it is like I said it's operator

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.590 
and if it is like I said it's operator
there's<00:04:35.460> tangling<00:04:36.460> in<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.790> back<00:04:37.000> but<00:04:37.419> it's

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
there's tangling in the back but it's

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.340 
there's tangling in the back but it's
not<00:04:37.870> like<00:04:38.169> oh<00:04:38.380> my<00:04:38.740> gosh<00:04:38.949> like<00:04:39.780> I'm<00:04:40.780> going<00:04:41.320> to

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
not like oh my gosh like I'm going to

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.820 
not like oh my gosh like I'm going to
die<00:04:41.710> tangles<00:04:42.400> like<00:04:42.669> it's<00:04:42.880> just<00:04:43.120> like<00:04:43.300> ok<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:44.050> did

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
die tangles like it's just like ok I did

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.270 
die tangles like it's just like ok I did
double<00:04:45.310> my<00:04:45.780> 228<00:04:46.780> in<00:04:47.139> the<00:04:47.320> back<00:04:47.500> so<00:04:47.860> they<00:04:47.889> are

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
double my 228 in the back so they are

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.500 
double my 228 in the back so they are
thicker<00:04:48.610> but<00:04:50.250> so<00:04:51.250> I<00:04:51.550> think<00:04:51.580> that's<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.240> reason

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
thicker but so I think that's the reason

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.360 
thicker but so I think that's the reason
why<00:04:52.630> right<00:04:52.870> now<00:04:53.050> it's<00:04:53.290> only<00:04:53.500> tangling<00:04:54.070> because

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
why right now it's only tangling because

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.510 
why right now it's only tangling because
it<00:04:54.580> is<00:04:54.729> it<00:04:55.180> was<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:55.710> tightly<00:04:56.710> curled<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:57.400> know

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
it is it was so tightly curled you know

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.330 
it is it was so tightly curled you know
what<00:04:57.610> I<00:04:57.699> mean<00:04:57.910> and<00:04:58.680> yeah<00:04:59.680> like<00:04:59.979> right<00:05:00.130> now<00:05:00.310> I

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
what I mean and yeah like right now I

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.400 
what I mean and yeah like right now I
just<00:05:00.520> got<00:05:00.820> one<00:05:01.120> strand<00:05:01.479> like<00:05:01.750> you<00:05:02.110> can't<00:05:02.320> even
