00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
this particular unboxing does not

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.179 
this particular unboxing does not
require<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> handy-dandy<00:01:12.180> bat-knife<00:01:12.869> uh

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
require the handy-dandy bat-knife uh

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.649 
require the handy-dandy bat-knife uh
because<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.610> really<00:01:14.729> simple<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.270> open

because it's just really simple to open
this<00:01:15.750> up<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.860> won't<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.280> needing<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> for

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
this up so we won't be needing that for

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
this up so we won't be needing that for

just going to go ahead and get into it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.710 
just going to go ahead and get into it
here<00:01:22.520> alright<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.759> overall<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.420> pretty

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
here alright so overall this is pretty

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
straightforward we've got our USB cable

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
straightforward we've got our USB cable
right<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.869> does<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:28.500> require<00:01:28.650> any<00:01:29.070> kind

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
right here it does not require any kind

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.270 
right here it does not require any kind
of<00:01:29.520> external<00:01:29.850> power<00:01:30.390> now<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
of external power now this is not a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.179 
of external power now this is not a
standard<00:01:33.200> USB<00:01:34.200> port<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.829> terms<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
standard USB port in terms of the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.700 
standard USB port in terms of the
connector<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> USB<00:01:36.840> side<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.619> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
connector it is for the USB side but it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.710 
connector it is for the USB side but it
has<00:01:37.890> its<00:01:38.100> own<00:01:38.369> special<00:01:38.700> prongs<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:39.570> and

pretty<00:01:43.920> cool<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.579> build<00:01:44.850> quality<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.299> solid

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
pretty cool the build quality is solid

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.660 
pretty cool the build quality is solid
it<00:01:45.840> doesn't<00:01:46.170> feel<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.409> heavy<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it doesn't feel that heavy and this is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.069 
it doesn't feel that heavy and this is
something<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.030> could<00:01:48.240> fit<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.750> your<00:01:48.869> pocket

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
something that could fit in your pocket

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.770 
something that could fit in your pocket
it<00:01:49.439> needs<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.460> that's<00:01:50.850> pretty<00:01:51.030> cool<00:01:51.119> this

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
it needs be so that's pretty cool this

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.660 
it needs be so that's pretty cool this
is<00:01:51.960> fairly<00:01:52.200> substantial<00:01:52.950> now<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.310> am<00:01:53.460> thinking

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
is fairly substantial now I am thinking

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.370 
is fairly substantial now I am thinking
of<00:01:53.909> week<00:01:54.149> reaching<00:01:54.600> out<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.720> western<00:01:55.140> digital

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
of week reaching out the western digital

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.760 
of week reaching out the western digital
to<00:01:56.040> check<00:01:56.790> out<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.210> metal<00:01:57.840> edition<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.439> see

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
to check out the metal edition and see

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.380 
to check out the metal edition and see
how<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.070> compares<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.850> terms<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.149> build

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
how that compares in terms of build

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.209 
how that compares in terms of build
quality<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.200> I'll<00:02:01.290> probably<00:02:01.469> ask<00:02:01.799> them<00:02:02.100> for

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
quality so I'll probably ask them for

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.399 
quality so I'll probably ask them for
that<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> review<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.170> is

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
that so I can do a review but this is

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.950 
that so I can do a review but this is
super<00:02:04.649> sleek<00:02:05.100> super<00:02:05.610> light<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.600> love<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
super sleek super light and I love it

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.529 
super sleek super light and I love it
and<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.290> two<00:02:07.770> terabytes<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.879> very<00:02:09.149> small

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
and is two terabytes in a very small

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.690 
and is two terabytes in a very small
amount<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:10.050> space<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.800> that's<00:02:11.310> very<00:02:11.400> cool

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
amount of space so that's very cool

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.460 
amount of space so that's very cool
especially<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:12.239> consider<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.930> my

as my seagate hard drive they are
several<00:02:20.160> times<00:02:20.370> larger<00:02:20.610> than<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.090> very

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
several times larger than this very

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.020 
several times larger than this very

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
heavy and the required power supply so

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.580 
heavy and the required power supply so
just<00:02:24.330> having<00:02:24.480> something<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.140> that's

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
really well for me so my first

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.880 
really well for me so my first
impressions<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.630> WD<00:02:40.020> my<00:02:40.200> passport<00:02:40.230> ultra

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
impressions of the WD my passport ultra

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.690 
impressions of the WD my passport ultra
is<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.480> solid<00:02:43.050> it's<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.800> pretty<00:02:44.190> robust

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
is that it's solid it's a pretty robust

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.330 
is that it's solid it's a pretty robust
I<00:02:44.910> love<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.480> it's<00:02:45.540> two<00:02:46.260> terabytes<00:02:46.740> for<00:02:47.010> under

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
I love that it's two terabytes for under

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.760 
I love that it's two terabytes for under
a<00:02:47.370> hundred<00:02:47.640> bucks<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.660> that's<00:02:48.990> very<00:02:49.050> cool<00:02:49.380> it

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
a hundred bucks so that's very cool it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.960 
a hundred bucks so that's very cool it
might<00:02:49.950> cost<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.340> little<00:02:50.459> more<00:02:50.730> if<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.880> get

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
might cost you a little more if you get

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.790 
might cost you a little more if you get
the<00:02:51.090> different<00:02:51.120> colors<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.870> went<00:02:52.320> with<00:02:52.440> basic

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
the different colors I went with basic

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.530 
the different colors I went with basic
black<00:02:52.830> because<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.670> was<00:02:53.790> also<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> cheapest

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
black because it was also the cheapest

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.870 
black because it was also the cheapest
option<00:02:54.959> for<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.260> but<00:02:55.770> if<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.040> do<00:02:56.100> some<00:02:56.670> other

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
option for this but if I do some other

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.340 
option for this but if I do some other
ones<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.270> future<00:02:57.450> I'll<00:02:57.690> probably<00:02:57.900> mix<00:02:58.230> it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
ones in the future I'll probably mix it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.900 
ones in the future I'll probably mix it
up<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.530> get<00:02:58.650> different<00:02:58.830> colors<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.400> that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
up and get different colors so that

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.150 
up and get different colors so that
could<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.180> very<00:03:00.420> cool<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.320> those<00:03:01.890> are<00:03:01.920> my

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
could be very cool so those are my

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.770 
could be very cool so those are my
thoughts<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.940> going<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.209> probably<00:03:03.570> do

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
thoughts this is going to probably do

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780 
thoughts this is going to probably do
tremendous<00:03:04.440> work<00:03:04.650> for<00:03:04.950> me<00:03:05.040> I've<00:03:05.280> had<00:03:05.520> no

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
tremendous work for me I've had no

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.340 
tremendous work for me I've had no
problems<00:03:05.820> with<00:03:06.390> any<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> other<00:03:06.990> western

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
problems with any of the other western

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.930 
problems with any of the other western
digital<00:03:07.650> products<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.070> been<00:03:08.190> using<00:03:08.550> like

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
digital products that been using like

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.449 
digital products that been using like
the<00:03:09.060> my<00:03:09.209> passport<00:03:09.450> wireless<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.709> my<00:03:10.980> book<00:03:11.280> and

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
the my passport wireless the my book and

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.630 
the my passport wireless the my book and
the<00:03:11.940> my<00:03:12.180> cloud<00:03:12.510> mirror<00:03:12.959> for<00:03:13.260> terabyte<00:03:13.770> so<00:03:14.220> I

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
the my cloud mirror for terabyte so I

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.790 
the my cloud mirror for terabyte so I
think<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.270> this<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.660> going<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.930> be<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.410> great

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
think that this is going to be a great

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.979 
think that this is going to be a great
part<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.489> my<00:03:17.550> little<00:03:18.000> Western<00:03:18.300> Digital<00:03:18.600> family

part of my little Western Digital family

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.660 
part of my little Western Digital family
