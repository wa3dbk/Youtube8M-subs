00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.990
 it is always 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.770
 to the root 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.860
 you have to give them something like that 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.710
 okay 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:10.910
 is sometimes I have to bring the emulator of 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.910

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.109
 go up 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.010

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.990
 comment three weeks ago 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.689
 one of my 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.119
 of my friends and he had told me that 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:34.340
 The ring man does not charge in the review 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:40.220
 95 ipc that sounds a lot to load in the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.530
 revision of 85 86 279 does not load very well 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.950
 I have brought you this emulator that is loaded 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.140
 in revision 95 and in the reviews 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.500
 with view men 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.260
 the good load 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.260
 from the scene avoid but not no 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.920

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.530
 enter 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.480

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.450

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.920
 Also once you have downloaded 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.500

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.510

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.290

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:37.070

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.070

 but I bring you that is with the house 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.239
 here you have to wait 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.109
 for a few seconds 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.109

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.520
