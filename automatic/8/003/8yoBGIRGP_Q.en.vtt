should<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.690> go<00:00:18.840> into<00:00:19.020> e<00:00:22.100> most<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.310> our<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.820> all

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
should we go into e most of our so all

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.500 
should we go into e most of our so all
of<00:00:24.090> our<00:00:24.269> heroes<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.900> 80<00:00:25.260> range<00:00:25.590> right<00:00:25.890> now

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
of our heroes are in 80 range right now

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.179 
of our heroes are in 80 range right now
so<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:28.380> know<00:00:28.439> one<00:00:28.529> that's<00:00:28.619> higher<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.160> you

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
so don't know one that's higher so you

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.069 
so don't know one that's higher so you
got<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.119> 60<00:00:31.250> this<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.489> at<00:00:33.079> 80

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
got like this one at 60 this one at 80

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.600 
got like this one at 60 this one at 80
this<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:35.130> at<00:00:36.260> 85<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:38.190> one<00:00:38.550> at<00:00:39.260> 83<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.649> this

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
this one at 85 this one at 83 and this

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.430 
this one at 85 this one at 83 and this
one<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.270> higher<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.780> which<00:00:43.140> then

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
one is the higher one which then

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.080 
one is the higher one which then
balances<00:00:44.070> back<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:44.850> that's

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
balances back out with that one that's

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.590 
balances back out with that one that's
at<00:00:45.300> 60<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.680> pretty<00:00:47.250> much<00:00:47.430> all<00:00:47.820> together<00:00:47.969> our

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
at 60 so pretty much all together our

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.299 
at 60 so pretty much all together our
heroes<00:00:49.200> total<00:00:49.800> up<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> 80<00:00:50.780> 80<00:00:51.780> each<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
heroes total up to 80 80 each so that

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
heroes total up to 80 80 each so that
rigid<00:00:53.940> mount<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.329> got<00:00:54.480> 80s<00:00:56.329> so<00:00:57.329> what<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
rigid mount we got 80s so what do you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.020 
rigid mount we got 80s so what do you
think<00:00:58.730> can<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.090> e<00:01:01.039> with<00:01:02.039> 80<00:01:02.340> level<00:01:02.640> heroes

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
think can we do e with 80 level heroes

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.260 
think can we do e with 80 level heroes
I'd<00:01:03.780> probably<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.760> lulz<00:01:05.909> we're

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
I'd probably not but just for lulz we're

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.630 
I'd probably not but just for lulz we're
gonna<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.860> we're<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> attempt<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
gonna do it we're going to attempt it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.200 
gonna do it we're going to attempt it
and<00:01:08.820> fail<00:01:09.360> horribly<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> ask<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.880> haven't

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
and fail horribly so ask you haven't

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.370 
and fail horribly so ask you haven't
done<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.360> yet<00:01:13.790> did<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> whole<00:01:14.909> bunch<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.210> these

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
done it yet did a whole bunch of these

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.620 
done it yet did a whole bunch of these
those<00:01:16.380> worked<00:01:16.650> out<00:01:16.799> quite<00:01:16.950> well<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.630> that's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
those worked out quite well and that's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.800 
those worked out quite well and that's
why<00:01:18.900> we're<00:01:19.140> attempting<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.740> fates<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.810> going

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
why we're attempting the fates and going

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.600 
why we're attempting the fates and going
to<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.080> slaughtered<00:01:22.380> horribly<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.430> if<00:01:23.549> i

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
to get slaughtered horribly because if i

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.929 
to get slaughtered horribly because if i
remember<00:01:23.820> correctly<00:01:24.830> all<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.280> heroes<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
remember correctly all the heroes that

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.859 
remember correctly all the heroes that
attack<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:28.759> in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> 90s<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
attack you are like in the 90s and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.789 
attack you are like in the 90s and
hundred<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> end<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.979> think<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.150> I'm

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
hundred at the end I think so I I'm

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.630 
hundred at the end I think so I I'm
guaranteed<00:01:34.799> we're<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.189> make<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.460> past

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
guaranteed we're not gonna make it past

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.749 
guaranteed we're not gonna make it past
that<00:01:35.790> last<00:01:36.329> wave<00:01:36.740> will<00:01:37.740> probably<00:01:38.490> make<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
that last wave will probably make the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.179 
that last wave will probably make the
first<00:01:38.970> few<00:01:39.450> ways<00:01:39.750> maybe<00:01:40.350> maybe<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:40.860> i<00:01:41.009> think

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
first few ways maybe maybe not i think

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.020 
first few ways maybe maybe not i think
we're<00:01:41.430> gonna<00:01:41.520> probably<00:01:41.880> die<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.479> III<00:01:44.030> place

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
we're gonna probably die on III place

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.719 
we're gonna probably die on III place
your<00:01:45.180> bets<00:01:45.210> place<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:45.630> bets<00:01:45.930> III<00:01:46.890> ii<00:01:47.329> 4g<00:01:48.530> 5<00:01:49.729> go

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
your bets place your bets III ii 4g 5 go

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.580 
your bets place your bets III ii 4g 5 go
for<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.390> don't<00:01:51.899> think<00:01:51.960> we're<00:01:52.140> gonna<00:01:52.200> die<00:01:52.439> in

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
for it I don't think we're gonna die in

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.649 
for it I don't think we're gonna die in
the<00:01:52.680> beginning<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.369> hope<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.240> that'd<00:01:54.479> be

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the beginning I hope not that'd be

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.340 
the beginning I hope not that'd be
horrible

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
horrible

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.399 
horrible
that's<00:01:56.070> find<00:01:56.310> out<00:01:59.299> cross<00:02:00.299> fingers<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:01.290> I

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
that's find out cross fingers that I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.570 
that's find out cross fingers that I
don't<00:02:01.650> die<00:02:02.070> horribly<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.190> start<00:02:05.430> off<00:02:05.520> at

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
don't die horribly so they start off at

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.059 
don't die horribly so they start off at
85<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.960> they're<00:02:07.110> about<00:02:07.290> five<00:02:07.590> levels<00:02:07.920> higher

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
85 so they're about five levels higher

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.550 
85 so they're about five levels higher
than<00:02:08.100> my<00:02:08.729> my<00:02:09.959> heroes<00:02:10.440> II<00:02:12.319> one<00:02:13.319> we're

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
than my my heroes II one we're

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.199 
than my my heroes II one we're
gonna<00:02:13.650> survive<00:02:16.430> there<00:02:17.430> we<00:02:17.550> go<00:02:17.700> cleared<00:02:18.060> those

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
gonna survive there we go cleared those

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.690 
gonna survive there we go cleared those
up<00:02:18.420> quite<00:02:18.630> nice<00:02:18.870> e<00:02:19.170> 2<00:02:19.620> we're<00:02:19.950> probably<00:02:20.400> gonna

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
up quite nice e 2 we're probably gonna

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.229 
up quite nice e 2 we're probably gonna
survive<00:02:21.170> III<00:02:22.170> probably<00:02:23.040> gonna<00:02:23.250> die<00:02:25.970> that's<00:02:26.970> my

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
survive III probably gonna die that's my

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.500 
survive III probably gonna die that's my
assumption<00:02:31.010> okay<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.069> as<00:02:32.459> long<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:33.480> a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
assumption okay so as long they get a

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.449 
assumption okay so as long they get a
heel<00:02:33.810> off<00:02:33.959> get<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> heel<00:02:34.560> off<00:02:34.709> gon<00:02:35.069> get<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
heel off get a heel off gon get the

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.540 
heel off get a heel off gon get the
heels<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.930> need<00:02:37.110> some<00:02:37.350> heels<00:02:37.650> alright

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
heels go on we need some heels alright

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.030 
heels go on we need some heels alright
so<00:02:39.269> that's<00:02:39.390> pretty<00:02:39.810> much<00:02:39.989> et<00:02:40.230> tu<00:02:40.350> e<00:02:40.380> 2<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.709> going

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
so that's pretty much et tu e 2 is going

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.009 
so that's pretty much et tu e 2 is going
to<00:02:41.220> be<00:02:41.310> cleared<00:02:41.580> up<00:02:41.790> here<00:02:42.090> fairly<00:02:42.600> quickly

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
to be cleared up here fairly quickly

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:55.970 
to be cleared up here fairly quickly
maybe<00:02:43.560> III<00:02:44.390> III<00:02:45.390> III<00:02:45.690> III<00:02:53.510> 344<00:02:54.739> so<00:02:55.739> we<00:02:55.830> don't

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
maybe III III III III 344 so we don't

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.550 
maybe III III III III 344 so we don't
have<00:02:56.280> any<00:02:56.580> um<00:02:57.140> Griffin's<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.380> wave

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
have any um Griffin's in this wave

have any um Griffin's in this wave
that's<00:02:58.769> good<00:02:59.040> because<00:02:59.160> those<00:02:59.340> Griffin's<00:02:59.579> were

that's good because those Griffin's were

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.400

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
if you do it again Thunder God we got

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.309 
if you do it again Thunder God we got
this<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:59.130> said<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.269> you<00:04:00.299> do<00:04:00.600> it<00:04:00.720> again<00:04:00.989> Thunder

this I said if you do it again Thunder
God<00:04:01.500> not<00:04:01.680> if<00:04:01.859> you<00:04:01.980> miss

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.380 

well<00:04:08.010> it's<00:04:09.010> plausible<00:04:09.490> that<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.120> could<00:04:10.360> be

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
well it's plausible that it could be

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.510 
well it's plausible that it could be
done<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.630> guess<00:04:10.810> if<00:04:11.500> they<00:04:11.950> attack<00:04:12.220> from<00:04:12.430> the

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
done I guess if they attack from the

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.020 
done I guess if they attack from the
other<00:04:12.760> side<00:04:13.390> we<00:04:14.170> could<00:04:14.500> do<00:04:15.010> ye<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:18.310> they<00:04:18.790> hid

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
other side we could do ye so they hid

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.650 
other side we could do ye so they hid
all<00:04:19.209> from<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.540> same<00:04:19.720> side<00:04:20.700> which<00:04:21.700> is<00:04:21.730> you<00:04:22.630> know

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
all from the same side which is you know

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.210 
all from the same side which is you know
unfortunate<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.620> know<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.830> odds<00:04:23.920> were

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
unfortunate you know the odds were

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.910 
unfortunate you know the odds were
against<00:04:24.760> us<00:04:24.880> there<00:04:25.180> but<00:04:25.590> looking<00:04:26.590> at<00:04:26.710> this

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
against us there but looking at this

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.070 
against us there but looking at this
they<00:04:27.850> would<00:04:28.000> have<00:04:28.090> hid<00:04:28.210> from<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.540> last<00:04:28.780> side

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
they would have hid from the last side

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.550 
they would have hid from the last side
if<00:04:29.980> they<00:04:30.910> would<00:04:31.060> hit<00:04:31.180> from<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.390> other<00:04:31.540> side<00:04:31.720> we

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
if they would hit from the other side we

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.120 
if they would hit from the other side we
would<00:04:32.710> have<00:04:32.800> had<00:04:32.920> it<00:04:34.830> we<00:04:35.830> would<00:04:36.010> have<00:04:36.100> had<00:04:36.250> it

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
would have had it we would have had it

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.220 
would have had it we would have had it
maybe<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.280> could<00:04:39.520> be<00:04:39.610> doing<00:04:39.850> he's<00:04:42.690> hmm<00:04:43.690> that's

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
maybe I could be doing he's hmm that's

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.140 
maybe I could be doing he's hmm that's
crazy<00:04:44.590> I<00:04:45.900> think<00:04:46.900> we<00:04:47.020> could<00:04:47.730> maybe<00:04:48.730> start<00:04:49.090> doing

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
crazy I think we could maybe start doing

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.920 
crazy I think we could maybe start doing
some<00:04:49.450> Mesa<00:04:49.630> with<00:04:49.990> this<00:04:52.680> yeah<00:04:54.510> we<00:04:55.510> got<00:04:55.660> unlucky

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
some Mesa with this yeah we got unlucky

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.310 
some Mesa with this yeah we got unlucky
and<00:04:56.350> they<00:04:56.680> all<00:04:56.830> hit<00:04:57.070> from<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.780> same<00:04:58.780> side<00:04:59.020> over

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
and they all hit from the same side over

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.900 
and they all hit from the same side over
and<00:04:59.470> over<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.710> over<00:04:59.770> again<00:05:00.010> I<00:05:00.660> think<00:05:02.760> if<00:05:03.760> we'd

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
and over and over again I think if we'd

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.320 
and over and over again I think if we'd
have<00:05:04.030> been<00:05:04.120> lucky<00:05:04.270> but<00:05:04.540> I<00:05:04.570> had<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.840> eat<00:05:04.960> on

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
have been lucky but I had to eat on

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.100 
have been lucky but I had to eat on
that's<00:05:07.330> crazy<00:05:07.660> i<00:05:09.420> tempted<00:05:10.420> it<00:05:10.720> just<00:05:10.930> for

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
that's crazy i tempted it just for

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.930 
that's crazy i tempted it just for
giggles<00:05:11.730> but<00:05:13.920> now<00:05:14.920> that<00:05:15.160> I'm<00:05:15.280> looking<00:05:15.310> at<00:05:15.760> it

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
giggles but now that I'm looking at it

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.990 
giggles but now that I'm looking at it
we<00:05:16.030> got<00:05:16.180> hit<00:05:16.450> unluckily<00:05:16.930> each<00:05:17.500> side<00:05:17.890> and<00:05:18.280> on

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
we got hit unluckily each side and on

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.140 
we got hit unluckily each side and on
the<00:05:19.060> weaker<00:05:19.450> side<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:20.050> cannon<00:05:21.030> doesn't<00:05:22.030> take

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
it over I'm taking the only thing that

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.600 
it over I'm taking the only thing that
held<00:06:56.419> us<00:06:56.539> back<00:06:56.570> was<00:06:57.020> we<00:06:57.260> got<00:06:57.440> hit<00:06:57.680> on<00:06:57.830> the<00:06:57.889> same

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
held us back was we got hit on the same

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.719 
held us back was we got hit on the same
side<00:06:58.820> over<00:06:59.270> and<00:06:59.389> over<00:06:59.510> and<00:06:59.690> over<00:06:59.780> again<00:07:00.050> I

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:00.729 
side over and over and over again I

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:02.860 
side over and over and over again I
needed<00:07:01.729> to<00:07:01.820> come<00:07:01.850> from<00:07:02.210> the<00:07:02.330> other<00:07:02.419> side<00:07:02.630> and

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
needed to come from the other side and

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.439 
needed to come from the other side and
it<00:07:02.990> really<00:07:03.590> did<00:07:05.020> if<00:07:06.020> it<00:07:06.229> would<00:07:06.380> have<00:07:06.470> came<00:07:06.680> from

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:07.449 
it really did if it would have came from

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:11.230 
it really did if it would have came from
down<00:07:08.449> here<00:07:08.750> or<00:07:08.960> over<00:07:09.680> here<00:07:09.710> I<00:07:10.100> think<00:07:11.030> we<00:07:11.150> would

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 
down here or over here I think we would

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.330 
down here or over here I think we would
have<00:07:11.300> had<00:07:11.450> a<00:07:11.479> guaranteed<00:07:11.900> win<00:07:12.080> oh<00:07:12.460> I<00:07:13.460> I<00:07:15.340> didn't

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
have had a guaranteed win oh I I didn't

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.650 
have had a guaranteed win oh I I didn't
think<00:07:16.430> it<00:07:16.580> was<00:07:16.639> going<00:07:16.760> to<00:07:16.820> be<00:07:16.910> possible<00:07:17.419> but

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
think it was going to be possible but

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.350 
think it was going to be possible but
now<00:07:18.169> that<00:07:18.349> I'm<00:07:18.440> looking<00:07:18.470> at<00:07:18.800> it<00:07:19.000> we<00:07:20.000> might<00:07:20.180> be

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 
now that I'm looking at it we might be

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.560 
now that I'm looking at it we might be
able<00:07:20.419> to<00:07:20.570> get<00:07:20.660> a<00:07:20.690> sub<00:07:21.520> for<00:07:22.520> que<00:07:22.820> un<00:07:24.729> but<00:07:25.729> yeah
