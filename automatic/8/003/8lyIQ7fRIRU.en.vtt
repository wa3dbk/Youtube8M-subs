00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.089
 the video contains a small amount 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.810
 spoilers but mostly interesting 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.790
 nonsense 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.870
 weight in general will bring it by the handle and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.950
 will show exactly where to build the garrison 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.600
 the terrain of the alliance for some reason I 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.000
 resembles ash forest 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.190
 and the hordes of Korean tundra when all 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.890
 will be ready will show mini cinematic y 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.529
 alliance and its either not added yet 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.179
 whether it is broken and in general it is now necessary 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.189
 do quests that will help you 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:33.259
 develop a garrison to find drawings 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.259
 buildings and recruit followers 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.720
 and I made a general view for each level 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.720
 garrison 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.190
 Now, about the interface so that it 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.920
 do you need to click on the desired table 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.409
 there is a table for planning a garrison a 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.810
 there is a table for sending followers 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.250
 on a mission to build a building or 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.470
 improve existing 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.659
 you need a table next to yours 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.399
 architect and opens the tab where you 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.710
 just dragging the buildings you need 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.229
 the right place to start building 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.479
 Here is such a fun farm itself to 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.950
 this need to learn the drawings that i 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.810
 like so this is what the building 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.840
 really builds they so she 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.760
 magically grows and lands still around 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.500
 garrison haunting work out of voice acting out 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.670
 old warcraft which can 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.670
 cry out 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:38.500
 now about messi 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.080
 click on the table with was on the commander and 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.300
 rate your followers the same 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.010
 the most that with the drawings teach the contract 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.970
 follower to appear in 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.380
 list periodically becomes available 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.930
 missions you send 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.709
 each of them has different followers 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.650
 chance of success 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.209
 different level different gear in more detail 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.030
 they can be seen corresponding 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.530
 tab track status of execution 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.049
 missions can be here in this window 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.790
 button on the minimap and i start first 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.100
 why not resent remotely 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.769
 complete the mission and get the gold but 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.180
 this is the whole point of the garrison 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.540
 being built to sit there 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.220
 For hours they are of kage from the capital not if 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.590
 honestly so far more like the external 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.780
 view of the garrison horde here it is clear that the people 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.510
 someone busy practicing someone 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.609
 somewhere goes something bears for alliance 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.690
 only runs the thing girly buries in 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.690
 earth precious resources 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.180
 in the future it will be possible to put here 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.319
 such monuments that are issued as 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.319
 achievement awards 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.569
 at the third level there will be such 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.730
 magic portal 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.250
 they can be rearranged but not too 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.010
 far apart and i know what i will 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.019
 do everything instead of raids today 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.290
 and I will go on to deal with disconnect 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.360
 ami 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.360
 thanks for watching and everybody leave good
