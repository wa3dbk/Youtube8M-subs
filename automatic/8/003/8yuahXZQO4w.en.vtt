00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
the last row you're going to do so we

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:23.619 
the last row you're going to do so we
just<00:02:59.110> do<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:01.540> okay<00:03:05.920> keep<00:03:06.920> going

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.990 

okay<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:27.920> that's<00:03:28.920> pretty<00:03:29.310> important<00:03:29.730> site

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
okay and that's pretty important site

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.890 
okay and that's pretty important site
and<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.299> should<00:03:30.480> see<00:03:30.689> this<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:33.180> at<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.750> last

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
and you should see this so at the last

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.880 
and you should see this so at the last
knot<00:03:34.260> instead<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.739> making<00:03:35.069> a<00:03:35.280> regular<00:03:35.819> forward

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
knot instead of making a regular forward

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.720 
knot instead of making a regular forward
not<00:03:38.120> going<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.239> make<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:40.459> forward<00:03:41.459> backward

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
not going to make a forward backward

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.809 
not going to make a forward backward
knot<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:42.599> that<00:03:42.629> would<00:03:43.019> be<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.379> forward<00:03:44.280> knot<00:03:44.489> and

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
knot so that would be a forward knot and

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:52.039 
knot so that would be a forward knot and
then<00:03:45.079> making<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.409> backward<00:03:47.310> knot<00:03:49.639> okay<00:03:51.049> now

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
then making a backward knot okay now

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.690 
then making a backward knot okay now
you're<00:03:52.349> going<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.590> take<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.829> stamp<00:03:53.250> same

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
you're going to take the stamp same

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:03.110 
you're going to take the stamp same
strand<00:03:54.319> do<00:03:55.319> backward<00:03:55.889> knots<00:03:56.129> across<00:04:01.700> its<00:04:02.700> like

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
strand do backward knots across its like

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:20.420 
strand do backward knots across its like
so<00:04:10.670> okay<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:13.260> just<00:04:13.620> do<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:18.889> and<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.130> can't

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
so okay so just do that and you can't

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.480 
so okay so just do that and you can't
really<00:04:20.609> see<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.599> bend<00:04:21.989> yet<00:04:22.260> but<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.800> will<00:04:22.830> start

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
really see a bend yet but you will start

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:39.839 
really see a bend yet but you will start
to<00:04:23.550> see<00:04:23.639> one<00:04:24.440> let's<00:04:26.360> keep<00:04:27.360> going

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:48.739 

okay<00:04:40.889> so<00:04:41.889> just<00:04:42.249> keep<00:04:42.879> going<00:04:43.270> like<00:04:43.509> the<00:04:43.839> regular

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:48.749 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:51.119 

computer<00:04:49.749> hbu<00:04:49.809> do<00:04:50.169> except<00:04:50.529> the<00:04:50.619> backward

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
computer hbu do except the backward

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.619 
computer hbu do except the backward
knots<00:04:51.899> and<00:04:52.899> I'll<00:04:53.080> show<00:04:53.319> you<00:04:53.349> what<00:04:54.039> you<00:04:54.189> do<00:04:54.629> and

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
knots and I'll show you what you do and

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:01.290 
knots and I'll show you what you do and
your<00:04:56.110> do<00:04:56.349> that<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:59.740> now<00:05:00.459> I've<00:05:00.729> made<00:05:00.969> a<00:05:00.999> couple

more backward candy stripes and this is

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:11.669 
more backward candy stripes and this is
how<00:05:05.349> it<00:05:05.589> should<00:05:05.919> look<00:05:06.189> like<00:05:10.469> should<00:05:11.469> look<00:05:11.649> like

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:11.679 
how it should look like should look like

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:16.919

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
okay okay and we're just going to put

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:13.840 
okay okay and we're just going to put
these<00:06:02.690> tools<00:06:03.080> so<00:06:04.660> let's<00:06:05.660> see<00:06:05.930> better<00:06:09.820> okay<00:06:12.850> so

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
these tools so let's see better okay so

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:21.310 
these tools so let's see better okay so
you're<00:06:14.210> going<00:06:14.420> to<00:06:14.540> make<00:06:14.810> a<00:06:15.080> backward<00:06:19.180> knot<00:06:20.320> and

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
you're going to make a backward knot and

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:29.950 
you're going to make a backward knot and
now<00:06:22.280> a<00:06:22.600> forward<00:06:23.600> knot<00:06:27.790> so<00:06:28.790> then<00:06:29.090> that's<00:06:29.720> what

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
now a forward knot so then that's what

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.960 
now a forward knot so then that's what
causes<00:06:30.440> the<00:06:30.590> bed<00:06:30.800> because<00:06:31.250> of<00:06:31.400> the<00:06:31.520> backward

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
causes the bed because of the backward

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.550 
causes the bed because of the backward
form<00:06:32.330> or<00:06:32.450> not<00:06:32.600> if<00:06:33.170> you<00:06:33.320> forget<00:06:33.620> that<00:06:33.890> oh<00:06:34.390> well

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
form or not if you forget that oh well

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.670 
form or not if you forget that oh well
so<00:06:37.180> what<00:06:38.180> you<00:06:38.300> would<00:06:38.420> do<00:06:38.630> is<00:06:38.930> you<00:06:38.990> would

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
so what you would do is you would

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.040 
so what you would do is you would
basically<00:06:40.610> just<00:06:41.150> do<00:06:41.390> that<00:06:41.540> until<00:06:41.840> you<00:06:41.900> have

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
basically just do that until you have

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.440

your desired length I'll turn out the at

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.230 
your desired length I'll turn out the at
