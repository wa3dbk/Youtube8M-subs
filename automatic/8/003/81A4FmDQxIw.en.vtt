00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.430
 It lacked luck thirty-eight months for the 2014 World Cup. 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.260
 as well 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.190
 is that to finish what needs to be done at Brazilian airports at the Copa 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.590
 already finished vision that by the way the works are not able to learn 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.540
 of South Africa see in the third report of the series last airports 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.540
 call 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.249
 in three years Brazil will be in the center of the world 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:40.439
 'international lives' that will bring tourists 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.720
 four corners of the planet 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.420
 we will have almost 13 million shipments and landings in the country during the canopy 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.290
 Have you ever imagined what the arrival will be like here? 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.290
 a lot of people at our airports 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.520
 if peak times today can reach 8% 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 the number of airplanes after 12 noon 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.850
 there are no official estimates 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.479
 but it is already known that during the canopy beyond the increase in commercial aviation 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.700
 regular 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.840
 the country is also an example 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.800
 the executive jets 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.800
 and chartered planes 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.160
 the Freemasons Hungarian airspace 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.900
 Brazil is completely well prepared for this month brands like 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.390
 works a bit as the infraero announced that it will invest 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.510
 5 billion of the 130 million reais 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.220
 thirteen airports 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.510
 considered strategic 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.990
 most of the works are still in phase 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.840
 or bidding 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.660
 marujo sÃ£o paulo the most important airport in the country 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.750
 with more problems 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.610
 should receive the largest volume of money 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.180
 opincipal investments promises to take from the paper a work discussed since the end 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.710
 90's 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.330
 the construction of terminal 3 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.170
 which would increase the airport's capacity by 3 7 million passengers per year 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.689
 but so far little has changed for now just some reforms on the track 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.120
 only three other airports linked to the world 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.939
 In Brazil, it's the same thing. 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.619
 one of them from the Great Northern River does not even exist 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:31.489
 A temporary structure is being set up in Campinas to meet the 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.359
 increase 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.869
 at the international airport of the river, the infraero works to complete the 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:41.560
 terminal 2 that had an unused part for 12 years 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:43.869
 because of the low demand 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.679
 last month the majority of the 20 workers we encountered 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.769
 I pack it 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.959
 today the pace of work here is not the most intense according to the infraero 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.989
 the increase in the finalization phase the workers are working on step 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:58.440
 in 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.319
 building finish 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.529
 and the forecast 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:06.679
 is that this second half of terminal 2 is ready by August of 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:07.789
 2012 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:12.329
 the planned investments for the cup only the first two goals were 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.139
 executed so far 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.669
 the car was a little tired 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.339
 according to a study by the institute of applied economic research 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.189
 the airport hotels 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.569
 no deadline for world forgiveness will be ready by 2014 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.199
 who knows well the sector of another serious problem what was planned 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.330
 it is not enough 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.650
 seventy-eight companies the worst is to see passenger terminals enter vain 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.579
 be built should be at least the group already in 2004 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.409
 16 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.409
 it's a lot of reason that drives away physics that are being made now are no longer going 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.409
 give an account 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.239
 Flight that Brazil should do 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.799
 if the last host country of the cup can teach us 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.159
 the reporter renato ribeiro and went to South Africa 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.379
 but 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.709
 since the South Africans made the Brazilian reality is 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.309
 worrying complaint or freedom the modern airport 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.299
 spacious 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.769
 gateway to the country of the African continent 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.249
 the reform of the airport in Johannesburg took five years 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:28.039
 started in 2004 exactly one month after the choice of South Africa as 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:29.719
 seat of the cup 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.589
 there was time to spare is the work finished in June 2009 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:37.860
 the year before the world-wide one and there is a growth in the number of passengers 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.749
 we needed a work of this size and even if there were no cuts 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:46.669
 explain the scenario of petit art is director of communication of the company that 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.990
 manages the itirapina biarritz airport 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.039
 Think very loose 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.340
 beyond the canopy 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.760
 today oliver tambo 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.820
 can have up to 20 8 million passengers per year 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.039
 but receives only 19 million 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.600
 but it's in the details 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.879
 what you see the greatness of the work 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.809
 the special carts 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:07.449
 using an escalator 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.809
 avoiding queues and elevators 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.499
 the two hotels 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.639
 of 16 thousand places for car 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.110
 are two buildings garage with electronic panels 24 vacancies 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.599
 already available on the road 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:22.500
 then more 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.809
 bring each floor 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:27.199
 next to the airport 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:30.199
 paulo for us brazilians 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.110
 I can get in the car 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.610
 in another city 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.909
 with 14 minutes 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.959
 the whole of South Africa has spent about 4 billion reais at eight airports 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.930
 the Cape Town champion of country tourism 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.990
 also won a new airport 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.889
 and doubled the capacity 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.889
 never been ready just before the world cup 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.449
 even with all the investments the South Africans will face a problem 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.259
 record air traffic 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:04.319
 responsible for one of the biggest cheers during the penalty shootout 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.909
 five thousand fans with ticket 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:09.349
 I do not come to spain to beat germany 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.909
 If you want to return the group 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:16.020
 the new airport in the city does not take account of receiving numerous private flights 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.289
 carrying personalities and leaders 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.289
 there were already more airplanes in the air than allowed 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.389
 adriano of associates 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.849
 in the cup left for South Africans new airports 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:29.810
 that's how it works 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.919
 space 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.409
 good signage everything you need these services to be attended to 

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:40.869
 I apprized series of requirements good luck the first 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:42.659
 dial last impression 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:43.930
 are you 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.639
 Here in Brazil 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.469
 the country's experts in August 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:48.789
 an outlet 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.309
 run with sunday 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:52.149
 more and more Brazilians travel 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:55.520
 more and more we will have living conditions here 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.969
 the average selling price 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:58.149
 so I think the students 

00:06:58.149 --> 00:06:59.559
 we prepare 

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:02.559
 thomaz walnut speed we have 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:04.169
 off duty 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:05.699
 missing people generate 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:10.290
 and set as soon as possible with the government for the participation of all 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:14.110
 aging projects and the removal of these bottlenecks from the 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.110
 brazil airport infrastructure 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:35.089
 in tomorrow's report from the series airports last called a city of 

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:38.149
 northeast will have the first terminal as the private administration 

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:41.999
 what is the best solution for the privatization concession crisis?
