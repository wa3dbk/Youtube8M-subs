00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.130 
that bad probably bent this yeah you can
actually<00:02:48.230> spin<00:02:48.470> there<00:02:48.650> see<00:02:49.040> right<00:02:49.250> there<00:02:49.489> but

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
actually spin there see right there but

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.100 
actually spin there see right there but
it<00:02:51.140> doesn't<00:02:51.320> look<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.830> all<00:02:51.980> damaged<00:02:52.430> so

it doesn't look like it's all damaged so
that's<00:02:54.110> those<00:02:54.560> frames<00:02:54.950> are<00:02:55.160> pretty<00:02:55.370> tough

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
that's those frames are pretty tough

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:09.520 
that's those frames are pretty tough
busted<00:02:57.650> gear<00:03:07.330> well<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.360> don't<00:03:08.570> know<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.930> mean<00:03:09.410> it

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
busted gear well I don't know I mean it

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.490 
busted gear well I don't know I mean it
you<00:03:09.680> probably<00:03:09.950> lost<00:03:10.100> some<00:03:10.370> on<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:10.880> but<00:03:11.060> I

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
you probably lost some on it but I

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.479 
you probably lost some on it but I
wouldn't<00:03:12.500> trust<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:12.980> though<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.160> wouldn't

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
wouldn't trust it though I wouldn't

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.830 
wouldn't trust it though I wouldn't
trust<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:15.820> might<00:03:16.820> be<00:03:16.940> good<00:03:17.090> for<00:03:17.120> what<00:03:17.540> maybe

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
trust it might be good for what maybe

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.780 
trust it might be good for what maybe
your<00:03:18.580> airplanes

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
your airplanes

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.819 
your airplanes
yeah<00:03:20.500> well<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.980> servo<00:03:22.760> survived<00:03:23.239> I've<00:03:23.570> got<00:03:23.780> a

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
yeah well the servo survived I've got a

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.699 
yeah well the servo survived I've got a
carbon<00:03:24.829> flame<00:03:25.220> coming<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.930> Barrow<00:03:26.930> three<00:03:27.500> we

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
carbon flame coming the Barrow three we

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.080 
carbon flame coming the Barrow three we
got<00:03:27.829> a<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.400> new<00:03:28.579> designer<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:30.940> this<00:03:31.940> thing

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
got a the new designer so this thing

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.460 
got a the new designer so this thing
will<00:03:32.180> sit<00:03:32.329> in<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.480> box<00:03:32.660> until<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:33.079> get<00:03:33.380> the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
will sit in the box until I get the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.770 
will sit in the box until I get the
frame<00:03:33.769> I<00:03:34.040> got<00:03:34.760> frames<00:03:35.090> coming<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.510> got<00:03:35.600> any

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
frame I got frames coming I got any

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.270 
frame I got frames coming I got any
servos<00:03:36.140> coming<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:36.680> it'll<00:03:36.860> be<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:36.980> whole<00:03:37.160> new

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
servos coming so it'll be a whole new

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.860 
servos coming so it'll be a whole new
helicopter<00:03:37.760> when<00:03:37.880> I<00:03:37.910> get<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.450> all<00:03:38.660> right

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
helicopter when I get it all right

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.810 
helicopter when I get it all right
probably<00:03:39.530> what<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.799> wasn't<00:03:40.400> such<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.579> good<00:03:40.760> idea

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
probably what it wasn't such a good idea

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.559 
probably what it wasn't such a good idea
that<00:03:41.120> go

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
that go

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:51.030 
that go
do<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:42.049> with<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.319> tail<00:03:45.549> just<00:03:46.549> an<00:03:46.999> idea<00:03:48.819> well

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
do it with the tail just an idea well

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.550 
do it with the tail just an idea well
the<00:03:52.040> video<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:53.150> course<00:03:53.389> well<00:03:53.689> you<00:03:54.170> know<00:03:54.290> what<00:03:54.530> I

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
the video of course well you know what I

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.920 
the video of course well you know what I
don't<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:55.189> may<00:03:55.430> have<00:03:55.519> lost<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:56.120> actual<00:03:56.599> they

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
don't I may have lost the actual they

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.869 
don't I may have lost the actual they
came<00:03:57.109> down<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.469> fast<00:03:57.680> might<00:03:58.430> have<00:03:58.549> lost<00:03:58.730> the

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
came down so fast might have lost the

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.250 
came down so fast might have lost the
actual<00:03:59.239> thing<00:03:59.420> but<00:03:59.569> I<00:03:59.599> saw<00:03:59.810> it<00:03:59.900> bounce<00:04:00.109> it
