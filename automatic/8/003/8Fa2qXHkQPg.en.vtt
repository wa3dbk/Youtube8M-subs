00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.450
 yo everyone knows 17 10 we get 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.760
 found today for a scrum 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.860
 general in this club where I'm going to 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.480
 quickly explain my technique for 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.100
 close something else quickly for 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.420
 mount the gold weapons what is it 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.629
 still the challenge is for me the most 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.920
 the longest and most boring way 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.650
 and schott it's still like 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.670
 it requires precision work not 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.750
 will take time while 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.970
 the bloodthirsty medals and where he 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.680
 suffices to a minimum of delay no 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.640
 camp makes it possible to delay to manage its 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.800
 displacements what is not even 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.350
 temporize and then it gets super 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.309
 easily double murder on black 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.840
 ops you have probably noticed 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.330
 now to make a double murder 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.750
 even if at maybe one or two seconds 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.310
 interval between the two which 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.560
 rented from seconds to 2 3 seconds even 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.479
 between the two that there are widely means 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.430
 to make them do the double murder 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.040
 here are the other challenges really 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.299
 not many worries to be made after 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.710
 the senses and shock so the web is 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.790
 really the thing that I put where I put 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.080
 the most time but there I have not found 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.240
 a technique either that it's not a 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.660
 something revolutionary or what but it's 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.000
 really a way of things 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.370
 get done faster as well 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.720
 the illustrated this part it's not going to be 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.070
 done on purpose but I selected this 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.130
 partly because it really showed 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.150
 the first 15 that you will see 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.460
 that I will really play normally 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.200
 I will not be careful about targeting 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.530
 heads or what I'm going to play as I 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.780
 plays all the time and the other 15 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.580
 that he had one more particularly 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.840
 the last five they'll see you that 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.760
 I was really aiming for the heads 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.080
 otherwise you will see the number of cat 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.840
 that I'm doing at 27 participates in something 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.979
 kind thirty thousand 30 is chestnut 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.470
 or do not be crazy but almost 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.989
 you rely on on the last 15 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.950
 that they will see you that I had the imans 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.319
 of 80% of this relapse so the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.370
 techniques that I have bass has already gone 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.049
 in general melee as you may have the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.870
 notice because that's often where 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.750
 we find these rare who is big 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.830
 big pgm or what a general it is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.629
 a little everyone who goes in there 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.180
 except the very very strong who prefer it 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:39.130
 already played in steam is rare to see 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.870
 a calaf monster to play alone so 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.510
 in general melee the receptions are 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.250
 often quite easy me I know I 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.430
 must win maybe 90% but mixed up 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.430
 General 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.900
 then I advise you to take the 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.099
 accessories that increases the damage for 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.269
 avoid for example with China as 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.860
 to put a gust in the head and that 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.829
 it does not kill more than that it's very 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.910
 very annoying so take the 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.000
 accessories that increases the damage and 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.739
 that reduce the recoil so that's 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.590
 really the technique that I you 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.030
 advise after month on three others 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.340
 case the work for me to play in tears is 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.870
 summed up to put a silent what I 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.639
 still wanted and stealthy on this break 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.889
 of the I do not know why but I do not 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.359
 do not feel the need and especially in 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.099
 general melee I advise you beats 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.269
 to do if you want to do that I 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.519
 really advise you not to put a 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.650
 silent because if ever nests 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.420
 play that sound silva hear a 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.980
 burst or muffler bullets it goes 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.299
 to say is that start to panic he goes 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.620
 not be able to identify you on the radar 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.660
 he's really going to search everywhere 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.280
 and so that I really recommend it 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.980
 not because after he goes to 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.120
 cup folds and jump where he goes 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.049
 to do a little foufou and blow bah 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.549
 you did not manage to put a 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.040
 head 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.090
 they will be a bit of a shame what 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.239
 then we advise to work around 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.239
 the enemy 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.450
 no there by cons here is the enemy who 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.500
 was on the left I'm not working around it 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.300
 just that I did not see them I do not know 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.530
 why when I watched the video 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.470
 before you make the comment and there 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.880
 I did not understand too much but so 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.709
 circumvent the enemy do not seek the 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.270
 face to face even though sometimes she has 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.220
 place him apart sorry to cut me 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.870
 but it seems it really 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.950
 did he really surprised me at once 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.200
 I did not have time to adjust the head 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.150
 I did not understand that he was fk so 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.200
 I come back around the night do not 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.000
 especially not looking face to face 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.169
 because face to face the one you 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.160
 take a ball or what if you do not have 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.870
 not sturdiness and you flinch 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.880
 wanted to put no head 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.250
 so I advise you to move on 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.300
 the sides or see from back then in 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.360
 general also in May the hazards of 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.970
 small campers so it goes over cream 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.470
 to do the toilets 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.130
 then advise you to use 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.520
 paralytic 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.840
 like that down the nests will be much 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.040
 idle what but instead make 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.169
 gaffe who drop a little head when 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.850
 you use crippling and suddenly 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.810
 it can be annoying too because 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.980
 you can aim her head and at 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.860
 final you touch her back or what 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.650
 for then advise you not 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.910
 necessarily seek to win is necessary 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.300
 to know what wanted to be to win the sea 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.650
 and general be ferlay cat it's not so 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.800
 obvious if it hosts a minimum of 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.390
 level it's not easy to use 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.530
 it's not easy to say sorry to mix 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.580
 two so that's so did not look 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.500
 necessarily win if you want to make a 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.940
 one shot that after you to you can 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.630
 win a general melee package you 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.220
 do not have to look to the 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.050
 do while you do these challenges 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.250
 there you can notice these five 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.540
 last that it is I remained 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.110
 worries chaduc I counted before the 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.600
 beginning of the game 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.100
 I had 5 left and shot to succeed at 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.470
 see China as gold to have them 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.729
 meaning we talk about it we can see the 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.510
 challenge of the senses and shock so there you 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.310
 can see that the two they 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.510
 defend shot and that was it but 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.620
 it was really my end-of-life challenge 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.479
 part it's just I have five left 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.760
 they help me five heads to see her 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.250
 in gold at the end of the game and I want 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.570
 succeed with a very nice doublet 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.620
 I'm waiting for him to be really sorry 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.530
 to have you this price there 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.699
 but yeah that's so in the middle of the 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.770
 part I was only a headshot 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.940
 and you will see that after in 15 at 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.430
 little louvre and eat is to aim 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.750
 the page heads and told me cat so 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.220
 web at 66% match offering to the right in 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.590
 lingering a little bit and she tries 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.530
 to target the tests so here I am you 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.330
 invite to try these small techniques 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.940
 and then you can tell me what you 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.710
 think 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.360
 if you did or did not do all that 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.680
 so here are the people I tell you to the 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.680
 next and then bah chao everyone
