00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.230 

so<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.469> new<00:00:01.620> controller<00:00:02.010> truly<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.820> really

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so the new controller truly is a really

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.150 
so the new controller truly is a really
amazing<00:00:03.510> piece<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.959> kit<00:00:04.140> because<00:00:04.410> it<00:00:04.740> has<00:00:04.950> a

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
amazing piece of kit because it has a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.099 
amazing piece of kit because it has a
lot<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.339> simple<00:00:05.940> inputs<00:00:06.299> but<00:00:06.569> when<00:00:06.750> we<00:00:06.870> combine

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
lot of simple inputs but when we combine

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.459 
lot of simple inputs but when we combine
them<00:00:07.379> together<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:08.010> becomes<00:00:08.160> very<00:00:08.490> very<00:00:08.849> rich

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.560 

we<00:00:13.469> talked<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.370> lot<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.580> developers<00:00:15.179> saw

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
we talked with a lot of developers saw

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.019 
we talked with a lot of developers saw
what<00:00:15.839> they<00:00:16.049> really<00:00:16.289> want<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.000> what<00:00:18.000> they

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
what they really want and what they

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.720 
what they really want and what they

thing that you noticed is the light bar
at<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> front<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.949> light<00:00:56.160> bar<00:00:56.340> has

at the front and this light bar has

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.450 
at the front and this light bar has
several<00:00:57.420> functions<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.620> track<00:00:59.219> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
multiple folks in the room it's very

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.440 
multiple folks in the room it's very
easy<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.199> ps4<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.949> identify<00:01:05.489> who's<00:01:06.180> who

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
easy for the ps4 to identify who's who

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.810 
easy for the ps4 to identify who's who
who's<00:01:06.960> holding<00:01:07.350> which<00:01:07.530> controller<00:01:08.040> if<00:01:08.340> the

who's holding which controller if the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
system sees that for some reason we've

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.600 
system sees that for some reason we've
swapped<00:01:10.530> places<00:01:10.710> or<00:01:11.159> I've<00:01:11.280> passed<00:01:11.460> the

swapped places or I've passed the

controller to someone it can

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.450 
controller to someone it can
automatically<00:01:13.409> adjust<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> ordering<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
automatically adjust the ordering of the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.800 
automatically adjust the ordering of the
split<00:01:14.670> screen<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.390> makes<00:01:15.509> sense<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
split screen so that it makes sense to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.359 
split screen so that it makes sense to
everyone<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.470> seems<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> minor<00:01:17.070> thing<00:01:17.340> but

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
everyone it seems like a minor thing but

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
everyone it seems like a minor thing but
it<00:01:17.670> actually<00:01:17.790> really<00:01:18.150> helps<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.170> flow<00:01:19.380> of

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it actually really helps the the flow of

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.020 
it actually really helps the the flow of
the<00:01:19.560> game<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.040> helps<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
the game and just helps the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.420 
the game and just helps the
intuitiveness<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> whole<00:01:21.900> console<00:01:22.430> most

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
intuitiveness of the whole console most

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.240 
intuitiveness of the whole console most
important<00:01:24.030> arguably<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.500> touchpad<00:01:25.799> on

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
important arguably is this touchpad on

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
important arguably is this touchpad on
the<00:01:26.580> top<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> controller<00:01:27.720> touched<00:01:28.200> by

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the top of the controller touched by

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.380 
the top of the controller touched by
these<00:01:28.409> multi<00:01:28.799> touch<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.310> you're<00:01:30.119> able<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
these multi touch and you're able to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.789 
these multi touch and you're able to
have<00:01:30.509> touch<00:01:30.720> interactions<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.500> are<00:01:31.560> very

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
have touch interactions that are very

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.440 
have touch interactions that are very
comfortable<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.520> play<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.270> use<00:01:33.360> you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
comfortable to play so you can use you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.999 
comfortable to play so you can use you
feel<00:01:33.689> more<00:01:33.900> or<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.290> could<00:01:34.500> be<00:01:34.619> freaking

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
feel more or you could be freaking

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.740 
feel more or you could be freaking
freaking<00:01:35.490> things<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.600> add<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
freaking things out and then you add the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.210 
freaking things out and then you add the
fact<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.170> there's<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.470> speaker<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
fact that there's a speaker on the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.600 
fact that there's a speaker on the
controller<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:39.509> adds<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:40.020> lot<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.770> dynamic

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
controller that adds a lot of dynamic

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.940 
controller that adds a lot of dynamic
sound<00:01:42.090> when<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.869> are<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.380> shooter<00:01:43.710> for
