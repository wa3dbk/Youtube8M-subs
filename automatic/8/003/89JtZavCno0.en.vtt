 dallas 13 60 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.210
 sports history 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.250
 2 Javier Alonso 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.620
 at least as they are 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.579
 greets you javier alarcón here in radio 13 points with mx point 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.579
 it is mentioned a lot to the by the arrival of Carlos Bianchi 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.720
 to the technical direction of the America is a note that begins to take certain 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.929
 strength but it's just a possibility so far 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.039
 who thinks of the probable arrival of Carlos Bianchi beyond that 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.740
 the affective bond for having worked with us in several worlds so 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:33.690
 what seems 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.670
 a choice of several very suitable for the moments that the america because 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.829
 because he knows how to work with young people 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.760
 because he understands the idiosyncrasy of the Mexican footballer that in something not in 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 everything but something substantially resembles that of the Mexican is a guy who 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.620
 convinces the player is a guy who explains football simple 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.609
 and of course in these circumstances of deep restructuring 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.439
 america is going to once again exercise a significant budget and if carlos 

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:06.630
 bianchi is committed and if the america has a medium project 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.869
 term surely he will be the one who defines the probable hiring thus is the 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.060
 current football 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.340
 and that compromises even more encouraging 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.820
 and if in addition to repair the issue that your child is an entrepreneur 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.750
 Well anyway, Carlos Bianchi will have to answer for these 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.610
 casual hirings now rural as it approached to go from valencia wolf 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.710
 they fired and they are going to give 9 million euros there some controversy in the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.060
 subject d the epic that is questioned to Carlos Bianchi for having charged the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.189
 athletic of madrid 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.939
 full compensation 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.959
 maybe it's a topic where you're going to coincide or not with the way you charge 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.939
 but in Europe if it is styled if you hire me you are wrong you can send us 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.060
 to serve I have the right to collect compensation regardless of 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.959
 moral or ethical criteria flight if Carlos Bianchi is questioned why 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.599
 it would seem to me a wrong interpretation if we are going to see it from the 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.090
 point of view of what he got with mouth and a after is an option for 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.570
 america and for anybody to win the league he frequently also takes out 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.730
 europe players and after winning frequently intercontinental cope 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.550
 they talk about the quality of Carlos Bianchi, what is he aware of? 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.739
 Mexican football that we know follows all the transmissions through the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.329
 television if at this time we asked for the atlas we could 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.900
 give the atlas stop could you tell us how you think the old atlas 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.029
 to the round of eighteen finals of the Copa Libertadores 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:39.100
 it seems to me that it is yes it comes to Carlos Bianchi to America it can be 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.550
 the beginning of a stage in which things so that they work do not have 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.579
 to be blind work of magic because America is so low 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.020
 to ask Carlos Bianchi, for example, for the next tournament 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.620
 rate is nothing extraordinary in football as generous as ours 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.780
 with such an open competition system 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.499
 let's see if the next days 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:03.870
 ends by landing cest idea of ​​Carlos Bianchi to America that so 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.980
 soon it is a 3 version of the reform 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.230
 to see how much strength it charges with the passing of days thank you very much
