 more distance jumping from objects

 to indicate if you can climb that 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.329
 surface 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.090
 crafting is lethal from above 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.040

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.810
 can climb by most 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.030
 surfaces use air discharges 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.010
 to move faster this 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.930
 skill recharges over time the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.750
 kraken will fly towards the direction in 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.210
 that you're moving fast access

 of a powerful electric shock 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.980
 mines go if they are ideal for 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.690
 ambush 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.690
 and count the objectives by 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.340
 with sequels inflict a lot of damage to 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.340
 close goals 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.330
 the vortex drives the hunters away 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.330
 inflicts damage 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.590
 and more 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.730
 the air discharges are recharged 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.500
 slowly if you're not in combat fly 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.290
 everything you can before returning to 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.969
 activate them 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.400
 and stays in the air during the 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:57.829
 Combat the ideal position to strike 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.190
 hits with the skills of the deal is 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.650
 be on the hunters 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.750
 remember to use long- range attacks 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.830
 when the skills are regenerating 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.690
 or to top off a weakened hunter 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.150
 with sequelae to damage objectives 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.950
 grouped and teams the kraken will continue 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.959
 being able to move after activating the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.850
 skill so keep correcting your 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.610
 position to reach the maximum 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.310
 number of possible targets the attack 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.620
 Lightning is powerful but easy 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.139
 escape from it use it with goals that 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.270
 have little mobility 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.659
 the vortex to isolate targets 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.219
 priority as doctors or trappers 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.810
 Top off when they are separated from their 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.970
 companions 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.160
 her friends are going to stop the 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.750
 hunters that chase you will hide your 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.910
 life path for hunters 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.450
 have to deal with them instead of 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.450
 Chase you 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.160
 Spectrum is a lethal killer that stands out 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.560
 in the art of deception 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.310
 use the smell ability to highlight 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.990
 the hunters and the animals nearby 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.340
 the melee attacks are very 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.150
 effective in short distances 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.400
 like to get bandage and evolve 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.220
 the spectrum can climb through most 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.920
 of surfaces, move quickly with the 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.330
 teleportation the skill 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.460
 teleportation is recharged over time 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.050
 the spectrum teleports to 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.330
 where are you moving 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.830
 use the teleportation download to 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.879
 get to a game and want a 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.879
 explosive discharge 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.990

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.990
 of your group 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.880
 we generate in what you fight in your luxury 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.880
 while we have indicated 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.900
 the supernova as a combat zone and 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.740
 velocity and melee deception 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.740
 increase 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.870
 nothing 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.640
 has poor health and little shielding so 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.010
 can not remain in combat during 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:10.390
 You will have to use a lot of time 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:12.070
 surprise attack practices the mode 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.960
 stealth often when you're not in 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.850
 combat the slender silhouette and 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.950
 ability to go unnoticed 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.980
 spectrum allow you to move without being 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.350
 viewed 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.540
 bid the teleportation to appear and 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.530
 disappear use your skills to 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.530
 mislead the enemy 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.250
 the teleportation download causes 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.900
 serious damage and it is easy to use 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.900
 ideal for hunting and fighting 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.490
 great counterattack ability in the 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.500
 mobile formula always gtc shielding yes 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:49.780
 the hunters escape from the cloud 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.780
 you can bring them back with kidnapping 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.540
 the lure is a very useful maneuver for 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.610
 escape and perform stealth leaps 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.020
 activate it when you make off the line 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.090
 of vision of the enemy 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.190
 then put yourself in position to give the 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.380
 jump and pounce on a hunter 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.430
 that is alone while his classmates are 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.430
 they entertain with the lure 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.330
 they were dragging 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.500
 or maybe not
