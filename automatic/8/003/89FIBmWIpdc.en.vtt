00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
had to buy heat gun and I had to buy

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
had to buy heat gun and I had to buy
like<00:00:54.120> some<00:00:54.420> heat<00:00:54.989> count<00:00:55.350> hate<00:00:55.590> compound<00:00:57.170> this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
like some heat count hate compound this

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.959 
like some heat count hate compound this
is<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.440> right<00:00:58.590> here<00:00:58.649> oh<00:00:58.829> let<00:00:59.039> me<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> macro

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
is it right here oh let me get the macro

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.939 
is it right here oh let me get the macro
on<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:02.300> arctic<00:01:03.300> silver<00:01:03.600> heat<00:01:04.019> compounding<00:01:04.890> up

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
on it arctic silver heat compounding up

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.200 
on it arctic silver heat compounding up
for<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.309> see<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.390> um<00:01:07.580> yeah<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> had<00:01:09.119> to

do work they lied to open it up get my
little<00:01:12.060> heat<00:01:12.240> gun<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.510> blow<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:17.330> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
little heat gun and blow it on there it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.070 
little heat gun and blow it on there it
was<00:01:18.540> crazy<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> worst<00:01:20.939> part<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.540> wasn't

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
was crazy the worst part about it wasn't

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.370 
was crazy the worst part about it wasn't
the<00:01:22.170> actual<00:01:22.350> process<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:27.380> getting

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the actual process of you know getting

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.319 
the actual process of you know getting
the<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.070> know<00:01:29.220> how<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.939> describe<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the you know how can I describe it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.480 
the you know how can I describe it
actually<00:01:31.200> blowing<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> heat<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.009> stuff<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
actually blowing the heat and stuff and

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
actually blowing the heat and stuff and
heating<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.030> caught<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.780> called<00:01:33.960> reef

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
heating it and caught it's called reef

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.740 
heating it and caught it's called reef
lowing<00:01:34.680> first<00:01:34.950> off<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.390> know<00:01:36.509> gets

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
lowing first off and it you know gets

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.690 
lowing first off and it you know gets
everything<00:01:37.049> flowing<00:01:37.590> again<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.310> there<00:01:38.520> you

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
everything flowing again in there you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.819 
everything flowing again in there you
have<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.939> heat<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.540> where<00:01:39.689> it'll<00:01:40.590> get

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
have to heat it up to where it'll get

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.350 
have to heat it up to where it'll get
moving<00:01:41.189> again<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> had<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.850> heat<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
moving again so I had to heat up the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.249 
moving again so I had to heat up the
circuit<00:01:42.810> board<00:01:42.960> basically<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:44.430> um<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.990> part

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
circuit board basically but um the part

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.600 
circuit board basically but um the part
that<00:01:46.409> sucks<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.860> getting<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.250> back<00:01:47.369> together

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
that sucks is getting it back together

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.819 
that sucks is getting it back together
like<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.240> been<00:01:48.360> taking<00:01:48.630> me<00:01:48.689> forever<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.710> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
like it's been taking me forever like I

like it's been taking me forever like I
got<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> first<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.909> got<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> first<00:01:51.840> 16<00:01:52.409> screws

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
got the first I got the first 16 screws

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.289 
got the first I got the first 16 screws
you<00:01:54.060> know<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.649> had<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> undo<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.520> do

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
you know and then I had to undo it do

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.719 
you know and then I had to undo it do
undo<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.810> them<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.229> 16<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.369> had<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.579> do

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
undo all of them all 16 then I had to do

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.969 
undo all of them all 16 then I had to do
them<00:01:59.850> over<00:02:00.000> again<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.200> had<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> undo<00:02:01.799> him

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
got them done so I've been moving

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.999 
got them done so I've been moving
forward<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.899> progressing<00:02:07.530> pretty<00:02:07.710> good
