use onions you use anything and I
sauteed<00:00:38.229> it<00:00:38.350> in<00:00:38.440> just<00:00:38.589> a<00:00:38.679> little<00:00:38.710> bit<00:00:39.039> of

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
sauteed it in just a little bit of

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.500 
sauteed it in just a little bit of
butter<00:00:39.370> you<00:00:39.969> don't<00:00:40.089> want<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.269> brown<00:00:40.449> it
