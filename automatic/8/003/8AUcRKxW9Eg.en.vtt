probably I'd think like 10k it's
probably<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.090> it'll<00:00:48.239> go<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.660> maybe<00:00:48.960> even

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
probably what it'll go for maybe even

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
probably what it'll go for maybe even
way<00:00:49.500> less<00:00:49.710> than<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.890> who<00:00:50.129> knows<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.300> have
