okay so baking soda is also good for
neutralizing<00:02:42.069> stomach<00:02:42.580> acid<00:02:42.880> but<00:02:43.000> it's

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
neutralizing stomach acid but it's

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.630 
neutralizing stomach acid but it's

water you know again a soak for 20
minutes<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.030> probably<00:02:52.150> use<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.630> good

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
minutes you probably use a good

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.539 
minutes you probably use a good
tablespoon<00:02:53.319> for<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.799> small<00:02:54.040> container<00:02:54.370> of
