00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:09.370
 the law of the game lego harry potter years 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.769
 14 and we are with our first 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.749
 unlocking characters so I hope 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.400
 that you liked and montoro says that you 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.090
 I have been asking for videos of this 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.589
 game 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.990
 and at least I bring you this roll of 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:25.750
 characters and the previous video that was 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.279
 a tournament of a new team is worth 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.949
 the above of the spell lock what 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.290
 we did here and if you remember and here 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.670
 we have the metal candadito this 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.670
 we will say now 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.660
 speak general we enter here and what is 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.780
 what we have to do here now and 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.370
 we have three cages worth and that's what 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.110
 we have to do we have to use 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.190
 our team that we unlock 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.730
 previously to convert to these 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.820
 rats 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.820
 in rne and you are there we have a hairline 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.469
 another reality 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.400
 transform that we have 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.380
 42 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.270
 but you do not know very well how much 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.750
 we have 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.990
 normal 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:30.010
 we have three but they have to enter 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.620
 the cage 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.690
 whether we need very little and here 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.490
 so we can a business mile 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.350
 grade 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.159
 we have 72 of 200 and finally the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.619
 unlocking the character 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.469
 and we have it this is the teacher 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.899
 mcgonagall so we've already 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.479
 unlocked is worth now what 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.970
 let's do is go to the cauldron 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.950
 giant 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.200
 Ok, guys, we're already in the cauldron 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.970
 It's big and what we're going to do is 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.620
 leave through this door 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.010
 we are in the alley of Aragon 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.280
 and now not because we have to enter the 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:15.280
 station we have here very well we come 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.319
 here and here we have 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.190
 the place where we can buy all the 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.130
 characters that we unlock most 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.520
 they are blocked 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.280
 but the mcgonagall teacher is the one 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.860
 just unlock here is we can 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.440
 buy it for two hundred thousand coins or 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.680
 pieces of lego for boys there the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.680
 we have 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.140
 what I do not know here is how to change 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.850
 character I want to put with her 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.950
 but I'm not sure how it goes 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.800
 there is not a button like in other games 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.800
 to easily change the character 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.410
 but leave in the comments 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.080
 but let's try this time since 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.450
 believe that this is the pressure that we 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.660
 allows to change 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.379
 personality well let's 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.560
 put us with the professor mcgonagall there 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.370
 we have it very well 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.830
 there is what some said 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.720
 was the first character to unlock 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.090
 let's see the spells he has then 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.670
 they have all the spells and this spell 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.260
 green because I do not know it 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.260
 and then I'll prove it 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.620
 and nothing 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.620
 but simple
