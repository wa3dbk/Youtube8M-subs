00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:07.230
 Hahaha, beauty is making a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.780
 video here with the same phone as 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:15.630
 I do not have my camera for now. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.699
 I'm coming to get my bike 60 251 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.029
 flex 2015 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.689
 is I spent two years researching is 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.000
 about cb 300 already did until i got to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.960
 enter the consortium of cb 300 and brake 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.449
 abs 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.050
 only a few complications there in my 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.660
 group and then some people spoke before 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.829
 here you do not get it done then I'm done 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.680
 choosing to pick did the same and what I 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.920
 I can say for now I think I did 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.800
 a good choice is also liked then 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.110
 much also that it came already with the engine 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.289
 and it 's just two things like that. 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.960
 red is beautiful and the black tail 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.350
 Frosted so I found it very cool 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.969
 this combination referred therein 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.860
 Because she did not want to talk 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.729
 My work just knocking the bike 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.900
 one arm ft hit in the exhaust here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.860
 on the other side as you can see 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.960
 It is also a bit ugly year so 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.530
 black spots here 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.080
 Then it became popular then the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.060
 what I can say of the bike is that the bike 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.290
 I like it so she has strength and such 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.030
 and something else is quite stable like that 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.820
 an entire process of softening it 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:45.340
 still she's with a I do not know if she's going 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.340
 appear here 9 787 kilometers rolled 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:54.560
 I can only stretch up to 7,500 rpm and 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.700
 fifth gear with this rotation already 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.009
 115 per hour and the motorcycle is thus 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.459
 training or anything I really liked the 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.830
 stability is something else too. 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.410
 What I already managed to do was the consul 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.690
 I put 10 liters of gasoline and 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.209
 those 10 liters I rode around is 282 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.830
 miles then from an average 128 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.049
 kilometers per liter 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.080
 So I think it's good for a motorcycle. 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.830
 250 cylinders nor my fan 150 than 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.900
 I had made a 37 per liter 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.819
 I do not think so much I have not gotten to 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.010
 search the internet as 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.799
 said it's not about the two bikes and 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.530
 people do more or less there 27 30 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.200
 miles with liters with the ugly nÃ© 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.239
 so that is the question of the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.209
 mileage I always put mixed 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.670
 I put added gasoline and a little 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.250
 of alcohol and the 10 liters gave seven of 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.650
 gasoline and three liters of alcohol 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.480
 I do not know if what I did was because 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.370
 But I believe that what she should 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.590
 to do even that's it , right from the 25th to the 5th 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.620
 so this is it folks showing the 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.220
 details of love 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.290
 rio who wants to see is introduce jamil 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.790
 sports and such 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:19.200
 so the tip is for anyone with squid 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.430
 and wanting to buy phaser goes in faith that 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.610
