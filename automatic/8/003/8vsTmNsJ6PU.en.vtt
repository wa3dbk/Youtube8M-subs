00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
by chance which was well what we do is

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.969 
by chance which was well what we do is
we<00:02:07.450> usually<00:02:07.780> pray<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.200> first<00:02:08.380> thing<00:02:08.560> we<00:02:08.800> want

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
know if it wasn't for him we wouldn't be

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.430 
know if it wasn't for him we wouldn't be
here<00:02:13.000> today<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.450> then<00:02:13.690> we<00:02:13.840> give<00:02:13.990> respect<00:02:14.380> to

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
here today and then we give respect to

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.990 
here today and then we give respect to
each<00:02:14.590> other<00:02:14.770> by<00:02:14.980> breaking<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.430> out<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.820> our

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
each other by breaking it out and our

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.710 
each other by breaking it out and our
own<00:02:16.150> ritual<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:18.370> just<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:19.030> know<00:02:19.060> by<00:02:19.600> the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
own ritual and that just you know by the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.080 
own ritual and that just you know by the
time<00:02:20.040> we're<00:02:21.040> done<00:02:21.190> with<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.370> that's<00:02:21.970> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
time we're done with that that's the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.430 
time we're done with that that's the
reason<00:02:22.330> why<00:02:22.420> we<00:02:22.570> call<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.900> electrolytes

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
reason why we call the electrolytes

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.070 
reason why we call the electrolytes
because<00:02:23.740> the<00:02:23.890> second<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.520> together<00:02:25.300> we

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
because the second we get together we

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.810 
because the second we get together we
you<00:02:26.260> know<00:02:26.380> we<00:02:26.560> electrify<00:02:27.040> each<00:02:27.220> other<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.670> we

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
you know we electrify each other and we

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.040 
you know we electrify each other and we
give<00:02:27.940> each<00:02:28.060> other<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.270> energy<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.780> we<00:02:28.930> all

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
give each other the energy that we all

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
give each other the energy that we all
need

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
need

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.860 
need
if<00:02:30.430> one<00:02:30.670> guys<00:02:30.880> down<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.360> other<00:02:31.480> one<00:02:31.630> gives

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
if one guys down the other one gives

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.180 
if one guys down the other one gives
them<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.080> energy<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.470> get<00:02:32.560> back<00:02:32.740> up<00:02:32.950> and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
them the energy to get back up and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.010 
them the energy to get back up and
that's<00:02:33.610> what<00:02:33.820> electrolyte<00:02:34.300> stands<00:02:34.630> for<00:02:34.810> for

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
that's what electrolyte stands for for

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.800 
that's what electrolyte stands for for
unity<00:02:35.320> for<00:02:35.500> family<00:02:35.890> for<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.450> one-man<00:02:37.450> Wolf<00:02:37.660> Pack

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
unity for family for a one-man Wolf Pack

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.940 
unity for family for a one-man Wolf Pack
so<00:02:38.520> hey<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.730> saw<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.450> saw<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:41.230> one<00:02:41.560> thing<00:02:41.830> you
