00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.790 
I found them for almost half that price
I<00:02:26.250> think<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.670> was<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:27.090> lot<00:02:27.270> lot<00:02:27.480> cheaper<00:02:27.930> and

little bit harder to see since she's in
all<00:02:31.680> black<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.160> she's<00:02:32.340> basically<00:02:32.780> just

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
all black but she's basically just

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.890 
all black but she's basically just
lifting<00:02:34.110> her<00:02:34.230> hair<00:02:34.440> up<00:02:34.470> behind<00:02:35.280> her<00:02:35.430> head<00:02:35.900> I'm
