isn't touching this piece at all now if
it's<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.659> top<00:01:12.840> isn't<00:01:13.080> touching<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.439> piece<00:01:13.619> at

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it's on top isn't touching this piece at

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.160 
it's on top isn't touching this piece at
all<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.270> kind<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.330> floating<00:01:15.750> or

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
all it's just kind of floating or

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.060 
all it's just kind of floating or
sitting<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.100> these<00:01:17.990> wooden<00:01:18.990> things<00:01:19.290> let's<00:01:19.920> go

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
sitting on these wooden things let's go

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.820 
sitting on these wooden things let's go
from<00:01:20.220> here<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.619> connect<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.710> in

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
from here to here and then connect it in

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.030 
from here to here and then connect it in
front<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.159> brackets<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:25.040> that's

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
front with the brackets so that's

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.140 
front with the brackets so that's
important<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.400> there's<00:01:26.670> got<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:26.909> room

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
important because there's got to be room

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.109 
important because there's got to be room
for<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> PVC<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.960> sit<00:01:28.670> otherwise<00:01:29.670> it'll<00:01:29.970> just

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
for the PVC to sit otherwise it'll just

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.630 
for the PVC to sit otherwise it'll just
be<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.329> top<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.600> that's<00:01:30.920> stupid<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.130> how

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
be on top and that's stupid that's how

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.020 
be on top and that's stupid that's how
most<00:01:32.759> people<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:34.439> got<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.710> have

wood on top and on the sides the entire

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.560 
wood on top and on the sides the entire
box<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:29.960> 16<00:02:30.960> feet<00:02:31.200> long<00:02:31.440> which<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.420> it's<00:02:33.420> really

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
box is 16 feet long which is it's really

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.660 
box is 16 feet long which is it's really
not<00:02:33.750> as<00:02:33.900> long<00:02:34.080> as<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.500> think<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:34.830> once<00:02:35.580> you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
not as long as you think it is once you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.820 
not as long as you think it is once you
build<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.720> seems<00:02:36.960> long<00:02:37.170> at<00:02:37.320> first<00:02:37.500> but<00:02:37.710> then

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
build it it seems long at first but then

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.140 
build it it seems long at first but then
once<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.100> actually<00:02:38.130> skate<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:38.790> not<00:02:38.910> that

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
once you actually skate it's not that

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.900 
once you actually skate it's not that
big<00:02:39.710> so<00:02:40.710> you<00:02:41.040> should<00:02:41.430> probably<00:02:41.580> make<00:02:41.760> it

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
big so you should probably make it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.480 
big so you should probably make it
longer<00:02:42.120> if<00:02:42.990> you<00:02:43.050> want<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.440> do<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.800> lot<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.340> sweat

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
longer if you want to do a lot of sweat

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.300 
longer if you want to do a lot of sweat
chops<00:02:44.700> on<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.000> or<00:02:45.090> something<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:47.040> is

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
chops on it or something and it is

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.950 
chops on it or something and it is
actually<00:02:47.730> very<00:02:47.760> heavy<00:02:48.180> unless<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.660> have<00:02:48.780> two

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
actually very heavy unless you have two

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.510 
actually very heavy unless you have two
people<00:02:49.170> willing<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.770> pick<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.130> up<00:02:50.250> every<00:02:50.370> time

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
people willing to pick it up every time

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.030 
people willing to pick it up every time
and<00:02:50.900> it<00:02:51.900> really<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.290> struggle<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.680> move<00:02:52.860> it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
and it really is a struggle to move it

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.530 
and it really is a struggle to move it
unless<00:02:53.520> you're<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.910> get<00:02:54.060> treated<00:02:54.300> wood

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
unless you're going to get treated wood

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.330 
unless you're going to get treated wood
so<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.380> leave<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.590> outside<00:02:55.770> in<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.100> rain

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
so you can leave it outside in the rain

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.970 
so you can leave it outside in the rain
because<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.330> will<00:02:57.540> warp<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.500> started<00:02:58.950> to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
because it will warp and it started to

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.290 
because it will warp and it started to
work<00:02:59.250> because<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.610> used<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.880> leave<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.090> out<00:03:00.180> in

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
work because I used to leave it out in

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.620 
work because I used to leave it out in
the<00:03:00.360> rain<00:03:00.650> like<00:03:01.650> right<00:03:02.010> here

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
the rain like right here

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.690 
the rain like right here
it's<00:03:03.630> been<00:03:03.810> warping<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.290> little<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:05.400> sticks

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
it's been warping a little and it sticks

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.040 
it's been warping a little and it sticks
up<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.660> can<00:03:06.840> see<00:03:08.630> but<00:03:09.630> yeah<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:10.020> really

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
up you can see but yeah it's really

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.140 
up you can see but yeah it's really
heavy<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:11.150> what<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.180> use<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:13.730> put<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.820> away<00:03:14.880> every

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
heavy so what I use to put it away every

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.240 
heavy so what I use to put it away every
time<00:03:16.190> this<00:03:17.190> which<00:03:17.610> is<00:03:17.790> basically<00:03:18.470> just<00:03:19.470> two

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
time this which is basically just two

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.520 
time this which is basically just two
two<00:03:20.400> by<00:03:20.610> fours<00:03:20.880> like<00:03:21.120> three<00:03:21.690> feet<00:03:21.870> long<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.380> on

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
two by fours like three feet long and on

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.240 
two by fours like three feet long and on
two<00:03:23.430> things<00:03:23.610> going<00:03:23.910> sideways<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.510> then

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
two things going sideways and then

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.410 
two things going sideways and then
underneath<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.610> got<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:29.519> swivel<00:03:29.910> wheels<00:03:30.209> on

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
underneath I got a to swivel wheels on

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.900 
underneath I got a to swivel wheels on
each<00:03:30.570> side<00:03:30.890> 11<00:03:31.890> inches<00:03:32.100> apart<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.550> they<00:03:32.760> go

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
each side 11 inches apart so they go

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.140 
each side 11 inches apart so they go
right<00:03:33.150> underneath<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:34.190> two<00:03:35.190> pieces<00:03:35.459> main

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
right underneath the two pieces main

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.290 
right underneath the two pieces main
pieces<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.630> thing<00:03:37.310> one<00:03:38.310> more<00:03:38.519> thing<00:03:38.790> if

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
pieces of the thing one more thing if

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.720 
pieces of the thing one more thing if
you've<00:03:39.480> never<00:03:39.769> put<00:03:40.769> the<00:03:40.890> PVC<00:03:41.180> onto<00:03:42.180> a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
you've never put the PVC onto a

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.160 
you've never put the PVC onto a
you've<00:03:42.819> never<00:03:42.940> made<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.209> rail<00:03:43.450> or<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.720> box<00:03:43.959> or

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
you've never made a rail or a box or

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.770 
you've never made a rail or a box or
anything<00:03:44.319> I<00:03:44.500> have<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> four<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:46.030> really<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.599> was

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
anything I have a four it really it was

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.890 
anything I have a four it really it was
the<00:03:46.810> PDC<00:03:47.379> on<00:03:47.560> all<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:47.860> do<00:03:48.450> please<00:03:49.450> hold<00:03:49.750> here

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
the PDC on all you do please hold here

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.470 
the PDC on all you do please hold here
hold<00:03:49.930> here<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:50.860> you<00:03:51.250> take<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.879> screw<00:03:52.209> which

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
hold here so you take the screw which

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.589 
hold here so you take the screw which
you're<00:03:53.230> going<00:03:53.319> to<00:03:53.440> use<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.970> use<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.000> drill<00:03:55.390> bit

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
you're going to use and use a drill bit

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.170 
you're going to use and use a drill bit
just<00:03:56.409> a<00:03:56.530> little<00:03:56.769> bit<00:03:56.920> bigger<00:03:57.159> than<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.030> head

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
just a little bit bigger than the head

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.000 
just a little bit bigger than the head
of<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.420> screws<00:03:58.720> so<00:03:58.959> that<00:03:58.989> it<00:03:59.440> fits<00:03:59.680> in<00:03:59.830> there

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
of the screws so that it fits in there

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.720 
of the screws so that it fits in there
and<00:04:00.280> then<00:04:00.849> on<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.780> inside<00:04:02.230> which<00:04:03.129> screws

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
and then on the inside which screws

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.320 
and then on the inside which screws
right<00:04:04.000> there<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.920> drill<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> hole<00:04:06.549> with<00:04:07.269> a

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
right there you drill a hole with a

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.880 
right there you drill a hole with a
different<00:04:07.660> drill<00:04:07.870> bit<00:04:08.049> just<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.620> little<00:04:08.650> bit

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
different drill bit just a little bit

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.750 
different drill bit just a little bit
smaller<00:04:09.250> than<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.640> screw<00:04:09.849> head<00:04:10.060> but<00:04:10.959> so<00:04:11.440> the

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
smaller than the screw head but so the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.670 
smaller than the screw head but so the
shaft<00:04:12.760> or<00:04:13.000> whatever<00:04:13.269> part<00:04:13.510> sticks<00:04:14.319> down<00:04:14.530> in

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
shaft or whatever part sticks down in

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.110 
shaft or whatever part sticks down in
there<00:04:14.799> and<00:04:14.860> gets<00:04:15.010> into<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.280> wood<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.760> then

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
there and gets into the wood and then

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.229 
there and gets into the wood and then
that'll<00:04:16.720> keep<00:04:17.109> them<00:04:17.260> in<00:04:17.380> place<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:18.090> use<00:04:19.090> it

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
that'll keep them in place and use it

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.699 
that'll keep them in place and use it
about<00:04:19.539> every<00:04:19.780> foot<00:04:19.959> four<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.650> half

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
about every foot four and a half

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.770 
about every foot four and a half
whatever<00:04:21.039> you<00:04:21.250> think<00:04:21.699> is<00:04:21.850> necessary<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.630> keep

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
whatever you think is necessary to keep
