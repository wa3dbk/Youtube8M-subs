00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.090

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.940
 age restrictions 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.520
 all this we had a cardboard hand in 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.680
 we shot already see itself 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.590
 collectible packaging of this edition 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.200
 it is metal we do not dare 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.009
 her beautiful quality 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:09.780
 Well, here we have the inscription rocket convex 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.880
 pick side of the internet name if not 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.119
 I am mistaken of the ship on which we sailed to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.220
 an expedition at the beginning of the game 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.740
 box 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.110
 I personally liked it very much now. 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.260
 we will open it and already examine the contents 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.470
 this edition so we opened this 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.420
 box and now we see its contents 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.970
 means the first thing we saw in this 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.740
 boxes this is such a cardboard liner with 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.350
 depiction of the dead ship 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.380
 especially still with us does not represent you 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.760
 and we will remove it 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.580
 next we have the figure of Lara Croft 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.740
 which is clay but here in this 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.290
 plastic box with us 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 attached set of weapons dark 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.180
 set of brushes 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.619
 so that you can keep different weapons and 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.409
 also from the manual like this all 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.900
 need to place in the figure itself now 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.619
 studied in more detail and so figurine 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.320
 Lara Croft 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.530
 looks like this 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.200
 about 25 20 centimeters she is tall 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.079
 the quality and detail of this fact 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.630
 I liked her, but not only data 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.850
 advantages but also the fact that 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.190
 fixed weapon kit for example 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.480
 pistol pickax bow and arrow and shotgun 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.670
 all this of course is very good 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.360
 complements 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.670
 well, the main character well, and still huge 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.270
 plus this figure is what she has 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.989
 moving parts are like legs and 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.810
 also you can see with hands this general 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.480
 the figure is very cool and especially happy 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.900
 removable set of weapons and its quality 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.730
 but we will also postpone and that's when I put it 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.190
 it sometimes falls 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.550
 this is her only possible minus 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.959
 but if it's good to put it, then maybe 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.550
 she will not fall what we go on 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.920
 the next part of this edition and the 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.280
 tomb raider sat de tires for playstation 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.799
 3 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.010
 This edition was sold separately and on 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.290
 it will also separate the pine box but 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.980
 Now Iâ€™ll also see the face 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.620
 the side is like this 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.650
 the same is just another list then 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.870
 what goes into this edition 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.640
 well now we will open and he will show you everything 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.350
 Before that I wanted to say that he was pretty 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.890
 Qualitatively made of cardboard and me personally 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.930
 I liked it and so I already unpacked 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.609
 data building now show you it 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.600
 content 1 we have a tomb raider game for 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.780
 playstation 3 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.239
 all the same behind the screenshots and already 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.890
 not a list of what data is included 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.180
 I will not open the building because 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.290
 nothing special inside there is a drive 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.870
 addition for hit on served 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.030
 manual and activation key of the game itself 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.130
 the manual by the way is black and white and 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.530
 tell only about how to manage in 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.540
 the game and blew out of shock 3 go ahead 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.450
 then we go so tight 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.790
 bag with the name of the game tomb raider and with 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.310
 various icons from the game as well 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.510
 it was attached that is attached 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.900
 such from the rope and inside we can 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.850
 see how well it is packed I generally 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:26.229
 last seen in such 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:28.729
 sealed clasps sealed mean 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.710
 seasonings are different but I think it is not 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.950
 It is worth at this bag pouring seasoning 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.470
 She is without such a good rubber such 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.639
 a bag and we go on further it remains 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.509
 included for cargo 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:43.340
 q soundtracks soundtracks tomb raider 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:46.069
 an estate that I really liked right now 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.599
 I understand that the fashion went on to 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.789
 just give a key to download 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.090
 soundtrack but I never 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.819
 I liked why because I am first 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.340
 lazy to enter codes and secondly 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.439
 I've always been more suited to the disk 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.669
 just copy the soundtrack data to 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:06.919
 myself and no longer fingers and even here 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.419
 there is an instruction how to download data 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:13.930
 soundtracks even in Russian 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:17.210
 next we have the tomb raider artbook 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.759
 such a tabular artbook 20 pages 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.039
 hardcover afternoon liked 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.710
 firstly quality secondly to what he 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:30.020
 very bright and colorful means that we have 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:33.199
 inside we have pictures of species 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.620
 islands and motai and there are also various 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:41.120
 heroes of games or, for example, 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.520
 what we see here is pretty cool 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.919
 sound and we go on further on we go 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.229
 map of the island I mota it now I 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:52.210
 unfolded and I'll show you already 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:55.189
 it means the map here looks like this 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.719
 A3 format map symbol 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:06:01.009
 as a photo of various island species 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:03.469
 She resembles some 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.879
 black and white card but on the reverse side 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:08.360
 we already have a color 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:12.770
 A3 format poster with Lara Croft 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.839
 here's a cool poster history of the garden we 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.729
 already ready to take stock of this 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:18.409

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:24.169
 Now this edition can be purchased 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.939
 at a price of about 5,000 rubles yes it is 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.610
 expensive but I thought this building 

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:30.800
 standing tomb raider fans appreciate it 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.899
