00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.930
 playing such a game as fifa 14 and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.180
 notifications and recorded clip appear 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.660

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.440
 who is online and many channels there 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.079

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.460

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.350

 If I start, I 'll warn you that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.720
 dislike of the video because of this but I 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.080
 I have received many questions even in 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.600
 relation to this and many people there 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.360
 of the year will win xbox one or already 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.259
 have won and are people who have never had 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.570
 contact with a Microsoft 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.850
 never had contact with xbox your 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.909
 so I hope you understand then 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.909
 these quick tips and 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.979
 basic houses also here of xbox one 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.070
 so come on the first thing that 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.909
 Let's go in settings you do not know 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.850
 where is the start grip configurations 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.100
 that little button with 36 small 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.710
 below the xbox control symbol 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.469
 one that stays that light with that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.960
 clear symbol tightens him and come here 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.929
 in settings we were here in 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.330
 options and here we already have the options 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.770
 here notifications 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.890
 here you can or 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.810
 turn off all notifications then 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.270
 no notifications will appear for 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.870
 You do not even want to conquer 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.360
 Can you select the skype case? 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.750
 you can hang up let more 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.990
 off while a video is displayed 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.720
 if you rented you bought an xbox one video game 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.490
 you can leave here this option that he 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.920
 will be turned on more off while 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.260
 You watch a video, okay, I'll go. 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.500
 here, then, the way I 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.480
 use of my configuration but you can 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.970
 make your configuration the way you 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.340
 you prefer okay I'll do it this way 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.150
 because as I record many xbox videos 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.210
 one 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.430
 sometimes some notifications hamper 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.560
 listen not that you send a message 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.660
 disrupts the video certainly can not 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.600
 send message that xbox or an 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.490
 I always reply to messages but I 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.310
 always turns off here so sometimes I 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.200
 Can I take a little time to receive today? 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.780
 I never know when I have a precise message. 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.180
 to get in the messages live but can 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.850
 Send message calmly here I go 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.510
 leave the game here and go 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.520
 there skype messages I always off 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.800
 also always since off we can 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.690
 also leave it on more off 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.480
 during video display 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.530
 the group also I always leave off 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.110
 games and systems I leave on but if 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.610
 I do not like it much, you should have a 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.610
 option here for achievements and another option 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.220
 for recorded clips because in the case of 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.640
 fifa 14 she got more in a game 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.190
 very fifteen fifteen is still always what we do 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.430
 a goal or whenever we suffer some 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.010
 attack appears there recorded clip and 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.080
 fill the old bag and if we leave here 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.310
 connected it will always appear 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.560
 recorded clip 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.360
 If we let Aquino hang up, it will not 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.360
 the recorded clip appears but also does not 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.000
 will appear your achievements is 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.910
 so in my case I always use the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.790
 notifications are turned off and 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.680
 reason is that recorded clip that wiggled 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.780
 too much bag 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.810
 microsoft had to put more 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.470
 options here in this menu again 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.970
 to be alone is but for you there you 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.169
 you can put it there that way 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.840
 want 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.120
 that's when someone comes in to 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.690
 these can only put friends all 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.389
 favorite friends and everything and that's it 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.660
 give a quick tip and for you go 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.630
 stay on notifications here in the 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.270
 xbox one and then I'm going to stay here 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.120

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.030
 Wanna see the doubt of you, I 'm not going 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.220
 make a video and in that video I go 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.350
 ask you to put all the 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.240
 Questions All Questions 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.610
 I'll answer or make a video 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.650
 explaining each of the doubts is 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.690
 As I already did a while ago. 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.850
 well, that's it, I'm staying here for 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.190
 A like the favorite I did not see if you liked it 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.590
 and part of the channel's disclosure is 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.169
 register if you do not register and that's it 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.590
