00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:07.232
 Then, hoping to join him, 

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:09.945
 a waitress from Nashville, Tennessee. 

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:21.414
 My name is Rachel Potter. 29 years and I'm a waitress. 

00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:28.722
 I moved from New York to Nashville and worked in a bar, 

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:32.193
 because I need to support myself as I pursue this dream. 

00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:46.707
 Where do I start? You're a beast. 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.107
 At 29, I have a lot more experience than I had when I was younger. 

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:54.712
 And thank you very much for having this opportunity now. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.460
 I live in Nashville, where these incredible 

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:00.992
 country stars show up. 

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:05.100
 But being in the city and knocking on the doors does not mean they will be opened. 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.946
 I need to prove to Kelly that I deserve to be here. 

00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:10.706
 I want to go to the stage. I want to live my dream. 

00:01:13.348 --> 00:01:19.571
 Rachel Potter - Performance Irreplaceable - (BeyoncÃ©) Dance of the chairs 

00:01:20.191 --> 00:01:21.616
 Left, left 

00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:24.818
 Everything that is yours is in the left box 

00:01:24.972 --> 00:01:26.297
 In the closet, 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.836
 This is my stuff 

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.070
 Yeah, if I bought it, please do not mess with it. 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.077
 And you can continue as your litany, no problem. 

00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:37.202
 But can you talk and walk at the same time? 

00:01:37.243 --> 00:01:39.803
 And my name is in this pendant 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.347
 So come get your bags 

00:01:41.514 --> 00:01:42.883
 Let me call you a taxi. 

00:01:42.918 --> 00:01:45.231
 Planted in front of house 

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:48.144
 Talking to me like I'm an idiot 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.176
 With the conversation that 

00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:53.163
 I'll never find a man like you. 

00:01:53.198 --> 00:01:55.332
 You confused me with someone else. 

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:57.524
 You should not know anything about me. 

00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:00.070
 You should not know anything about me. 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.089
 I can get another like you in a minute. 

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:06.066
 In fact, he'll be here in a minute 

00:02:06.154 --> 00:02:07.291
 soft cat 

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:09.653
 You should not know anything about me. 

00:02:09.688 --> 00:02:12.181
 You should not know anything about me. 

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:15.041
 I'll get another one like you tomorrow. 

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:21.020
 So do not you dare to think for a second 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.533
 'You should not know anything about me' 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.406
 'You should not know anything about me' 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.190
 'I can find another like you in a minute' 

00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.228
 By the way, it will get here, here 

00:02:32.263 --> 00:02:33.254
 in one minute 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:34.460
 soft cat 

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:36.404
 'You should not know anything about me' 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.956
 'You should not know anything about me' 

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:42.162
 I'll get another one like you tomorrow. 

00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:44.461
 'So do not you dare think for a second' 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.384
 do not you dare to think 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.723
 That you are irreplaceable 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.969
 "Rachel, I'll ask you something. -Yes. 

00:02:58.498 --> 00:03:00.091
 How do you feel about this presentation? 

00:03:00.364 --> 00:03:02.157
 To be honest with you, 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.530
 I was sick and I took medicine all day. 

00:03:05.692 --> 00:03:07.346
 But how do you feel about your presentation? 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.619
 I do not think it was my best. 

00:03:09.787 --> 00:03:13.038
 I think you can do better. -Yes. 

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:15.969
 But it was a bit jarring. 

00:03:18.981 --> 00:03:22.576
 I found it brave, make this song in a country version. 

00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:25.287
 It will be a difficult decision. 

00:03:25.993 --> 00:03:28.015
 I hoped it was prepadar today. 

00:03:28.198 --> 00:03:30.413
 And prepared to surprise everyone. 

00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:33.123
 Especially for the incredible audition he had. 

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:35.504
 This girl has a high pitched voice. 

00:03:36.034 --> 00:03:39.091
 Very serious treble. Your high tone is crazy. 

00:03:39.274 --> 00:03:45.200
 And another thing is that his sharpness was not as clear as ever. that surprised me 

00:03:45.403 --> 00:03:49.221
 -You know? Can you still do them? -For sure. I can. 

00:03:49.404 --> 00:03:50.397
 That's what I do best. 

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.050
 It is the hour of truth. 

00:03:54.247 --> 00:03:56.445
 What is your decision? 

00:04:02.653 --> 00:04:05.120
 You made it difficult. I'll put you in that chair. 

00:04:05.437 --> 00:04:07.630
 "Or shall I send you home?" "You can not send her home." 

00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:10.211
 "You can not ..." "Please do not. 

00:04:16.346 --> 00:04:18.970
 Rachel, you're among the 4. I will not send you home. 

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:20.513
 I'll give you a chance. 

00:04:20.852 --> 00:04:23.451
 Rachel, congratulations. 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.639
 Good job. Please sit. 

00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:32.434
