cows<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.779> put<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.590> together<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.669> went

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
cows we put this together and we went

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.720 
cows we put this together and we went
through<00:00:33.090> many<00:00:33.390> prototypes<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:35.250> try<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> get

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
through many prototypes to try to get

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.180 
through many prototypes to try to get
this<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.300> successful<00:00:36.840> design<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
this in a successful design and as you

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.060 
this in a successful design and as you
can<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:38.719> we<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.320> called<00:00:40.620> floating

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
can see we have the so called floating

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.639 
can see we have the so called floating
anchors<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.510> between<00:00:44.719> two<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.780> keep<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> puzzle

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
anchors in between two I keep the puzzle

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.000 
anchors in between two I keep the puzzle
stable<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.460> now<00:00:47.789> i'm<00:00:48.059> going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.510> make

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
stable and now i'm going to make

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
stable and now i'm going to make
checkerboard<00:00:50.010> pattern<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> less<00:00:51.149> over

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
checkerboard pattern on the less over

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:02.060 
checkerboard pattern on the less over
the<00:00:51.809> top<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.579> course<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.239> realigning<00:01:01.070> now

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the top and of course the realigning now

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.990 
the top and of course the realigning now
we're<00:01:02.280> ready<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> make<00:01:02.670> seconds

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.430 

it<00:01:07.000> it's<00:01:07.540> a<00:01:07.690> bit<00:01:07.870> stiff<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.810> then<00:01:11.020> of<00:01:11.140> course

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
it it's a bit stiff and then of course

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.330 
it it's a bit stiff and then of course
the<00:01:12.030> always<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.600> realigning<00:01:14.230> there<00:01:15.130> was<00:01:15.310> a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
the always the realigning there was a

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.270 
the always the realigning there was a
rosete<00:01:15.850> captain<00:01:19.620> you<00:01:20.620> don't<00:01:20.770> just<00:01:20.830> take<00:01:21.100> this
