you<00:00:08.740> again<00:00:08.799> with<00:00:09.549> a<00:00:09.580> modified<00:00:10.240> version<00:00:10.270> of<00:00:10.809> the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
you again with a modified version of the

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.039 
you again with a modified version of the
hip<00:00:11.590> flexor<00:00:11.980> quadricep<00:00:12.670> stretch<00:00:12.750> now<00:00:13.750> I<00:00:13.809> still

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049 
hip flexor quadricep stretch now I still

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.049 
hip flexor quadricep stretch now I still
like<00:00:14.289> the<00:00:14.469> old<00:00:14.650> version<00:00:14.770> but<00:00:15.610> one<00:00:15.820> of<00:00:15.969> the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
like the old version but one of the

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.390 
like the old version but one of the
things<00:00:16.330> that<00:00:16.630> lacks<00:00:16.990> in<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.529> old<00:00:17.680> version<00:00:17.949> is

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
things that lacks in the old version is

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.939 
things that lacks in the old version is
getting<00:00:18.880> that<00:00:19.029> transverse<00:00:19.660> plane<00:00:20.019> in<00:00:20.259> and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
getting that transverse plane in and

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.710 
getting that transverse plane in and
Center<00:00:21.339> in<00:00:21.550> what<00:00:21.849> we<00:00:22.000> know<00:00:22.210> from<00:00:22.419> the<00:00:22.570> hip

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
Center in what we know from the hip

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.079 
Center in what we know from the hip
flexor<00:00:23.080> quad<00:00:23.320> complex<00:00:23.949> that<00:00:24.429> a<00:00:24.490> lot<00:00:24.730> of<00:00:24.820> people

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
flexor quad complex that a lot of people

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.749 
flexor quad complex that a lot of people
stretches<00:00:25.509> sadly<00:00:26.079> some<00:00:26.949> people<00:00:26.980> stretch<00:00:27.579> it

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
stretches sadly some people stretch it

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.970 
stretches sadly some people stretch it
in<00:00:27.939> frontal<00:00:28.329> plane<00:00:28.570> but<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.169> lot<00:00:29.380> of<00:00:29.499> times<00:00:29.710> that

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
in frontal plane but a lot of times that

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.690 
in frontal plane but a lot of times that
rotational<00:00:30.759> component<00:00:31.449> doesn't<00:00:31.990> get<00:00:32.259> hit

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
rotational component doesn't get hit

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.160 
rotational component doesn't get hit
interesting<00:00:33.700> enough<00:00:34.000> is<00:00:34.270> that<00:00:34.540> rotational

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
interesting enough is that rotational

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.950 
interesting enough is that rotational
component<00:00:35.830> that's<00:00:35.980> probably<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.580> key<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
component that's probably the key to

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.900 
component that's probably the key to
making<00:00:38.200> sure<00:00:38.350> that<00:00:38.530> hip<00:00:38.950> opens<00:00:39.430> up<00:00:39.610> it<00:00:39.790> allows

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
making sure that hip opens up it allows

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.880 
making sure that hip opens up it allows
you<00:00:40.240> to<00:00:40.270> be<00:00:40.420> very<00:00:40.450> functional<00:00:40.990> and<00:00:41.380> at<00:00:41.860> a

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
you to be very functional and at a

you to be very functional and at a
height<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.190> able<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.820> perform<00:00:43.270> at<00:00:43.450> a<00:00:43.480> high

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
height of able to perform at a high

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.050 
height of able to perform at a high

let<00:00:46.180> me<00:00:46.270> show<00:00:46.450> you<00:00:46.570> this<00:00:46.690> quick<00:00:47.340> modification

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
let me show you this quick modification

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.490 
let me show you this quick modification
in<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.970> hip<00:00:49.270> flexor<00:00:49.630> quad<00:00:49.870> stretch<00:00:50.230> that<00:00:50.470> I

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
in the hip flexor quad stretch that I

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.290 
in the hip flexor quad stretch that I
came<00:00:50.710> up<00:00:50.890> with<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.130> few<00:00:51.460> about<00:00:51.820> a<00:00:51.850> month<00:00:52.120> or<00:00:52.270> so

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
came up with a few about a month or so

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.820 
came up with a few about a month or so
ago<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.600> I've<00:00:52.780> been<00:00:52.810> working<00:00:53.290> with<00:00:53.470> it<00:00:53.710> and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
ago and I've been working with it and

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.000 
ago and I've been working with it and
liking<00:00:54.460> it<00:00:54.520> a<00:00:54.640> lot<00:00:54.690> now<00:00:55.690> let's<00:00:56.440> go<00:00:56.620> ahead<00:00:56.740> and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
liking it a lot now let's go ahead and

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.780 
liking it a lot now let's go ahead and
go<00:00:57.100> down<00:00:58.110> now<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.170> old<00:00:59.530> version<00:01:00.040> would<00:01:00.730> have

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
go down now the old version would have

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.660 
go down now the old version would have
taken<00:01:01.270> the<00:01:01.360> top<00:01:01.570> foot<00:01:01.930> hooked<00:01:02.350> it<00:01:02.500> on<00:01:02.650> here<00:01:03.100> we

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
taken the top foot hooked it on here we

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.889 
taken the top foot hooked it on here we
just<00:01:03.820> slid<00:01:04.210> in<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.619> foot<00:01:06.180> locked<00:01:07.180> it<00:01:07.390> out<00:01:07.539> and

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
just slid in this foot locked it out and

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.669 
just slid in this foot locked it out and
there<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:09.009> go<00:01:09.159> now<00:01:09.990> very<00:01:10.990> easily<00:01:11.200> can<00:01:11.469> get<00:01:11.590> the

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679 
there you go now very easily can get the

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:14.219 
there you go now very easily can get the
sagittal<00:01:12.219> plane<00:01:12.249> here<00:01:12.820> kind<00:01:13.689> of<00:01:13.780> hard<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.140> get

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
sagittal plane here kind of hard to get

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.160 
sagittal plane here kind of hard to get
the<00:01:14.380> frontal<00:01:14.740> plane<00:01:14.859> except<00:01:15.369> by<00:01:15.820> dropping<00:01:16.509> the

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
the frontal plane except by dropping the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.649 
the frontal plane except by dropping the
stretch<00:01:17.499> leg<00:01:17.799> and<00:01:18.130> then<00:01:18.819> the<00:01:18.939> rotational

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
stretch leg and then the rotational

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
stretch leg and then the rotational
plane<00:01:19.929> you<00:01:20.079> get<00:01:20.229> by<00:01:20.499> trying<00:01:21.039> to<00:01:21.369> rotate<00:01:22.350> your

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
plane you get by trying to rotate your

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.349 
plane you get by trying to rotate your
chest<00:01:24.810> towards<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:26.020> floor<00:01:26.789> still<00:01:27.789> like<00:01:28.119> that

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
chest towards the floor still like that

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.330 
chest towards the floor still like that
version<00:01:28.600> still<00:01:29.259> think<00:01:29.469> that's<00:01:29.649> a<00:01:29.770> very<00:01:30.069> good

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
version still think that's a very good

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.099 
version still think that's a very good
option<00:01:30.609> but<00:01:31.299> let<00:01:31.479> me<00:01:31.539> just<00:01:31.600> show<00:01:31.869> you<00:01:31.899> this

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
option but let me just show you this

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.289 
option but let me just show you this
different<00:01:32.619> aggression<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.460> seems<00:01:33.819> to<00:01:34.030> lock

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
different aggression it seems to lock

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.660 
different aggression it seems to lock
the<00:01:34.600> athletes<00:01:35.109> especially<00:01:35.280> lock<00:01:36.280> them<00:01:36.520> in<00:01:36.639> a

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
the athletes especially lock them in a

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.889 
the athletes especially lock them in a
little<00:01:36.939> bit<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.210> get<00:01:37.329> a<00:01:37.359> little<00:01:37.569> bit<00:01:37.749> better

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
little bit to get a little bit better

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.599 
little bit to get a little bit better
stretch<00:01:38.289> we're<00:01:38.950> going<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.100> take<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.520> we're

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
stretch we're going to take and we're

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.520 
stretch we're going to take and we're
going<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.759> put<00:01:39.939> it<00:01:39.999> on<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.149> other<00:01:40.389> foot<00:01:40.719> and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
going to put it on the other foot and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.319 
going to put it on the other foot and
what<00:01:41.679> we're<00:01:41.799> going<00:01:41.889> to<00:01:41.950> do<00:01:42.219> is<00:01:42.639> we're<00:01:43.179> going<00:01:43.270> to

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.010 
what we're going to do is we're going to
step<00:01:43.689> over<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:45.009> band<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:46.209> now<00:01:46.479> it's<00:01:46.869> the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
step over the band so now it's the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.489 
step over the band so now it's the
bottom<00:01:47.649> leg<00:01:47.920> that's<00:01:48.219> stretching<00:01:48.579> now

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
bottom leg that's stretching now

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.660 
bottom leg that's stretching now
immediately<00:01:50.499> what<00:01:50.679> happens<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.490> bottom

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
immediately what happens is the bottom

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.370 
immediately what happens is the bottom
leg<00:01:52.060> especially<00:01:52.299> if<00:01:52.630> you're<00:01:52.749> on<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.840> carpeted

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
leg especially if you're on a carpeted

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.410 
leg especially if you're on a carpeted
floor<00:01:53.439> or<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.979> floor<00:01:54.670> that<00:01:54.700> has<00:01:54.969> a<00:01:54.999> little<00:01:55.270> bit

what<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.500> can<00:02:11.769> do<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.370> really<00:02:13.239> work

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
what I can do is really work

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.290 
what I can do is really work
good<00:02:14.900> rotation<00:02:15.459> now<00:02:16.459> if<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.700> still<00:02:16.940> want<00:02:17.150> more

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
good rotation now if you still want more

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.120 
good rotation now if you still want more
stretch<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:17.840> just<00:02:17.990> sneak<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.440> like<00:02:18.830> back<00:02:19.100> a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
stretch you just sneak that like back a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.000 
stretch you just sneak that like back a
little<00:02:19.459> bit<00:02:19.640> by<00:02:20.120> rotating<00:02:20.630> forward<00:02:21.020> sneak<00:02:21.800> it

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
little bit by rotating forward sneak it

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.640 
little bit by rotating forward sneak it
back<00:02:22.190> push<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.730> back<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.240> then<00:02:24.050> lock<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.560> out

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
back push it back and then lock it out

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.820 
back push it back and then lock it out
and<00:02:24.980> then<00:02:25.490> they're<00:02:25.610> back<00:02:25.760> into<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.330> again

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
and then they're back into it again

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.949 
and then they're back into it again
great<00:02:27.830> way<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.280> really<00:02:29.060> open<00:02:29.390> up<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.810> hip

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
great way to really open up the hip

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.559 
great way to really open up the hip
flexor<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.620> where<00:02:31.400> I'm<00:02:31.550> getting<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.970> dynamic

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
flexor and where I'm getting the dynamic

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.990 
flexor and where I'm getting the dynamic
or<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.840> mobility<00:02:33.170> portion<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.100> is<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.970> the

or the mobility portion of it is in the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.840 
or the mobility portion of it is in the
transverse<00:02:35.630> plane<00:02:35.870> by<00:02:36.560> rotating<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.610> just

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
transverse plane by rotating and just

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.780 
transverse plane by rotating and just
stretching<00:02:38.330> out<00:02:38.920> again<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.069> got<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.430> keep<00:02:40.580> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
stretching out again you got to keep the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.820 
stretching out again you got to keep the
top<00:02:41.060> arm<00:02:41.360> locked<00:02:41.660> out<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.620> lower

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
top arm locked out so the lower

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.000 
top arm locked out so the lower
abdominal<00:02:42.920> stay<00:02:43.610> engaged<00:02:44.620> foot<00:02:45.620> against<00:02:45.890> the

abdominal stay engaged foot against the

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.740 
abdominal stay engaged foot against the
wall<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:46.519> still<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.760> great<00:02:47.000> option<00:02:47.300> but<00:02:47.630> in

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
wall it's still a great option but in

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.990 
wall it's still a great option but in
this<00:02:47.870> case<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.290> can't<00:02:48.590> get<00:02:48.769> away<00:02:48.920> with<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.340> by

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
this case you can't get away with it by

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.970 
this case you can't get away with it by
digging<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.510> into<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.900> floor<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.590> little

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
digging it into the floor to a little

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.850 
digging it into the floor to a little
bit<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.370> will<00:02:52.580> help<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.350> then<00:02:54.350> lastly

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
bit that will help you and then lastly

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.400 
bit that will help you and then lastly
getting<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:55.400> rotational<00:02:56.180> plane<00:02:56.450> in<00:02:56.690> by<00:02:57.200> just

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
getting that rotational plane in by just

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.820 
getting that rotational plane in by just
reaching<00:02:57.830> back<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.040> stretch<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.730> out

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
reaching back and stretch it out

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.309 
reaching back and stretch it out
standing<00:03:00.830> stretch<00:03:01.130> now<00:03:02.060> get<00:03:02.420> keep<00:03:02.900> in<00:03:03.080> mind

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
standing stretch now get keep in mind

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.380 
standing stretch now get keep in mind
we're<00:03:04.100> not<00:03:04.220> trying<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.580> stretch<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.090> lumbar

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
we're not trying to stretch the lumbar

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.870 
we're not trying to stretch the lumbar
spine<00:03:05.680> people<00:03:06.680> say<00:03:06.890> well<00:03:07.130> I'm<00:03:07.400> getting<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.700> lot

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
spine people say well I'm getting a lot

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.180 
spine people say well I'm getting a lot
of<00:03:07.940> pressure<00:03:08.330> through<00:03:08.720> my<00:03:08.989> lumbar<00:03:09.680> spine<00:03:10.010> when

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
of pressure through my lumbar spine when

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.250 
of pressure through my lumbar spine when
I<00:03:10.220> rotate<00:03:10.670> two<00:03:11.450> things<00:03:11.750> could<00:03:11.959> be<00:03:12.080> happening

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
I rotate two things could be happening

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.860 
I rotate two things could be happening
number<00:03:12.800> one<00:03:13.010> thoracic<00:03:13.970> spine<00:03:14.269> could<00:03:14.510> be<00:03:14.569> tight

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
number one thoracic spine could be tight

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.080 
number one thoracic spine could be tight
and<00:03:15.110> therefore<00:03:16.010> you're<00:03:16.160> driving<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.850> down

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
and therefore you're driving it down

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.900 
and therefore you're driving it down
through<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.630> lumbar<00:03:17.989> spine<00:03:18.910> secondly

through that lumbar spine secondly

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.420 
through that lumbar spine secondly
secondly<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.350> may<00:03:21.500> not<00:03:21.680> have<00:03:21.890> your<00:03:22.010> foot<00:03:22.250> up

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
secondly you may not have your foot up

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.160 
secondly you may not have your foot up
forward<00:03:23.030> enough<00:03:23.239> tonight<00:03:23.540> might<00:03:23.750> not<00:03:23.930> be<00:03:24.049> in<00:03:24.140> a

big enough staggered stance to take the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.470 
big enough staggered stance to take the

pressure off alpha so taking keep that
in<00:03:29.630> consideration<00:03:29.920> again<00:03:30.920> it's<00:03:31.190> just<00:03:31.340> another

in consideration again it's just another
