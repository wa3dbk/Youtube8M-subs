00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
stabilized on the fifth and then it's

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.569 
stabilized on the fifth and then it's
been<00:00:30.599> clearing<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.140> two<00:00:31.289> days<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:34.370> when<00:00:35.370> I

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
been clearing for two days and when I

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.810 
been clearing for two days and when I
did<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:36.000> last<00:00:36.149> batch<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:37.370> ended<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
did my last batch I ended up with a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.360 
did my last batch I ended up with a
slight<00:00:39.180> amount<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.110> sediment<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> bottles

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
slight amount of sediment in the bottles

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.270 
slight amount of sediment in the bottles
so<00:00:42.270> I've<00:00:42.600> decided<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.200> time<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.920> filter

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
so I've decided this time it's a filter

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.940 
so I've decided this time it's a filter

the clarity that you like I've got the
polishing<00:01:08.400> number<00:01:08.700> two<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.640> let's<00:01:12.330> go<00:01:12.420> with

polishing number two so let's go with

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:24.140 
polishing number two so let's go with
that<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:15.259> I've<00:01:16.259> got<00:01:20.990> three<00:01:21.990> putts<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:23.150> they

let's see washes okay then you've got
three<00:02:22.319> separate<00:02:23.319> filters<00:02:24.299> but<00:02:25.299> the<00:02:25.390> one<00:02:25.540> goes

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
three separate filters but the one goes

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:36.089 
three separate filters but the one goes
through<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.769> move<00:02:29.920> each<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.430> those<00:02:33.269> okay<00:02:35.099> take

I've put another hose onto the outlet

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
entire of the filter and then they just

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:17.890 
entire of the filter and then they just
get<00:05:04.940> thrown<00:05:05.180> away<00:05:08.680> do<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:09.800> for<00:05:09.980> each<00:05:10.100> one<00:05:16.900> and

back together the pump does get very hot

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.150 
back together the pump does get very hot
especially<00:05:25.790> after<00:05:26.270> two<00:05:26.540> runs<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:27.920> does

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
especially after two runs and it does

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.830 
especially after two runs and it does
say<00:05:28.430> in<00:05:28.610> instructions<00:05:29.150> that<00:05:29.300> after<00:05:29.510> you<00:05:29.600> don't

any subsequent batches otherwise you

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.200 
any subsequent batches otherwise you
risk<00:05:35.450> damaging<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:36.020> pump<00:05:36.350> and<00:05:37.060> that's<00:05:38.060> all

there is to it and what we'll do now is

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.000 
there is to it and what we'll do now is
draw<00:05:42.620> off<00:05:42.830> a<00:05:43.130> sample<00:05:43.730> to<00:05:43.880> see<00:05:44.060> how<00:05:44.150> clear<00:05:44.420> is

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
draw off a sample to see how clear is

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.970 
draw off a sample to see how clear is
