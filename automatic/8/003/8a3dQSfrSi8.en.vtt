Los<00:03:10.609> Angeles<00:03:10.640> really<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.660> had<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.870> stage

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
Los Angeles really I had a stage

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.780 
Los Angeles really I had a stage
background<00:03:12.440> which<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:13.100> also<00:03:13.250> think<00:03:13.370> helps

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
background which I also think helps

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.099 
background which I also think helps
though<00:03:13.940> with<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.359> because<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:14.840> almost

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
though with this because this is almost

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.930 
though with this because this is almost
feels<00:03:15.680> like<00:03:15.769> forming<00:03:16.280> on<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.519> stage

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
feels like forming on the stage

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.900 
feels like forming on the stage
yes<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:20.380> here<00:03:20.620> we<00:03:20.710> are<00:03:20.740> this<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.310> performance

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
yes so here we are this is performance

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.140 
yes so here we are this is performance
capture<00:03:22.290> stay<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:24.310> volume<00:03:24.670> they<00:03:24.820> call<00:03:25.000> it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
capture stay the volume they call it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.280 
capture stay the volume they call it
that's<00:03:25.450> interesting<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:25.870> have<00:03:25.960> to<00:03:26.050> explain

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
that's interesting you have to explain

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.850 
that's interesting you have to explain
it<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.440> me<00:03:26.590> later

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
it to me later

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.980 
it to me later

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
I think maybe it's like like a

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.500 
I think maybe it's like like a
measurement<00:03:29.320> thing<00:03:29.590> like<00:03:29.890> height<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:31.120> width

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
measurement thing like height and width

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.390 
measurement thing like height and width
and<00:03:31.810> depth<00:03:32.340> creates<00:03:33.340> volume<00:03:33.580> yes<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:36.250> you

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
and depth creates volume yes and you

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.910 
and depth creates volume yes and you
also<00:03:36.550> do<00:03:36.760> get<00:03:36.910> nifty<00:03:37.390> props<00:03:37.690> yes<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:38.650> what's<00:03:38.800> a
