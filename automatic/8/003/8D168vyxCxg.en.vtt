me know this is jess some ideas and they

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.069 
me know this is jess some ideas and they
come<00:04:09.180> many<00:04:09.900> minutes<00:04:10.199> condiments<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:11.780> yeah<00:04:12.780> we

come many minutes condiments and yeah we

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.430 
come many minutes condiments and yeah we
will<00:04:13.319> be<00:04:13.470> good<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.650> go<00:04:13.859> why<00:04:14.069> on<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.519> on<00:04:15.320> what<00:04:16.320> is

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
will be good to go why on you on what is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.240 
will be good to go why on you on what is
this<00:04:17.539> redstone<00:04:18.539> trickery<00:04:19.169> our<00:04:19.440> cost<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:20.010> brick

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
this redstone trickery our cost of brick

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.690 
this redstone trickery our cost of brick
and<00:04:20.280> redstone<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.909> easily<00:04:21.239> so<00:04:22.049> strong<00:04:22.700> they

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
and redstone to easily so strong they

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.020 
and redstone to easily so strong they
have<00:04:23.820> my<00:04:24.000> muscles<00:04:24.590> down<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.770> tail

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
have my muscles down the tail

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.170 
have my muscles down the tail
I said<00:04:27.389> could<00:04:27.690> this<00:04:27.720> be<00:04:28.020> way<00:04:28.940> making<00:04:29.940> its<00:04:30.120> own

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
I said could this be way making its own

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.350 
I said could this be way making its own
little<00:04:30.590> tick<00:04:31.590> tock<00:04:31.770> clock<00:04:31.950> over<00:04:32.280> here<00:04:35.360> perhaps

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
little tick tock clock over here perhaps

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.330 
little tick tock clock over here perhaps
if<00:04:36.660> we<00:04:36.840> do<00:04:36.960> this<00:04:37.380> I<00:04:37.740> can<00:04:38.730> put<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.810> there<00:04:40.340> look

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
if we do this I can put that there look

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.750 
if we do this I can put that there look
that<00:04:41.550> is<00:04:41.669> exactly<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.210> same<00:04:42.450> will<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:42.810> know

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
that is exactly the same will you know

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.920 
that is exactly the same will you know
right<00:04:44.760> there<00:04:45.000> we<00:04:45.090> go<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.570> then<00:04:45.660> that's<00:04:45.810> it

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
right there we go and then that's it

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.280 
right there we go and then that's it
there<00:04:47.330> time<00:04:50.570> okay<00:04:51.570> now<00:04:51.780> it<00:04:51.900> doesn't<00:04:52.110> want<00:04:52.230> to

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
there time okay now it doesn't want to

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.650 
there time okay now it doesn't want to
turn<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.560> IC<00:04:53.400> IC<00:04:53.940> ah<00:04:54.840> now<00:04:55.470> I<00:04:55.500> see<00:04:56.360> cuz<00:04:57.360> of

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
turn the IC IC ah now I see cuz of

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.730 
turn the IC IC ah now I see cuz of
Purdue<00:04:58.669> balls<00:05:00.380> it's<00:05:01.380> gonna<00:05:01.530> make<00:05:01.680> things

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
Purdue balls it's gonna make things

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.840 
Purdue balls it's gonna make things
awkward<00:05:02.130> okay<00:05:03.030> we<00:05:03.120> can<00:05:03.240> do<00:05:03.330> it<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:03.720> way<00:05:04.850> can

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
awkward okay we can do it this way can

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.909 
awkward okay we can do it this way can
we<00:05:05.910> let<00:05:06.140> Nikoli<00:05:07.140> yes<00:05:08.120> we<00:05:09.120> need<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:09.419> there

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
we let Nikoli yes we need that there

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.310 
we let Nikoli yes we need that there
they<00:05:10.919> need<00:05:11.130> that<00:05:11.250> repeater<00:05:11.550> into<00:05:11.760> their<00:05:12.320> then

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
they need that repeater into their then

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:22.150 
they need that repeater into their then
that<00:05:13.590> there<00:05:16.130> now<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.730> when<00:05:17.910> it<00:05:18.210> goes<00:05:18.690> to<00:05:21.140> night

off yeah I fix the problem redstone will
anyway<00:05:35.400> so<00:05:35.760> will<00:05:36.060> top<00:05:36.540> that<00:05:36.570> up<00:05:36.870> i'll<00:05:37.440> leave

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
anyway so will top that up i'll leave

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.200 
anyway so will top that up i'll leave
that<00:05:37.710> loose<00:05:38.100> down<00:05:38.340> there<00:05:38.550> just<00:05:38.850> in<00:05:38.940> case<00:05:38.970> it

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
that loose down there just in case it

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.890 
that loose down there just in case it
was<00:05:39.360> Papa<00:05:39.890> the<00:05:40.890> working<00:05:41.400> circuit<00:05:41.940> stuff<00:05:42.539> and

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
was Papa the working circuit stuff and

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.020 
was Papa the working circuit stuff and
that<00:05:43.530> should<00:05:43.770> fix<00:05:43.979> itself<00:05:44.370> now<00:05:44.610> so<00:05:44.729> when<00:05:44.850> we<00:05:44.910> go

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
that should fix itself now so when we go

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.810 
that should fix itself now so when we go
back<00:05:45.300> to<00:05:46.130> 2200<00:05:47.150> ha<00:05:48.350> we<00:05:49.350> have<00:05:49.650> letting<00:05:50.130> we<00:05:50.610> have

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
back to 2200 ha we have letting we have

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.610 
back to 2200 ha we have letting we have
light<00:05:51.030> ink<00:05:52.669> anyway<00:05:53.669> let's<00:05:54.000> err<00:05:54.410> pop<00:05:55.410> that<00:05:55.560> on

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
light ink anyway let's err pop that on

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.400 
light ink anyway let's err pop that on
there<00:05:55.830> we<00:05:56.370> need<00:05:56.700> four<00:05:57.030> pieces<00:05:57.240> of<00:05:57.450> mud<00:05:57.660> also<00:05:58.380> I

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
there we need four pieces of mud also I

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.990 
there we need four pieces of mud also I
got<00:05:58.470> rid<00:05:58.710> of<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:58.890> extra<00:05:59.070> blocks<00:05:59.400> to<00:05:59.580> jump<00:05:59.820> up

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
got rid of the extra blocks to jump up

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.140 
got rid of the extra blocks to jump up
onto<00:06:00.390> here<00:06:01.100> decided<00:06:02.100> to<00:06:02.160> put<00:06:02.370> a<00:06:02.400> ladders<00:06:02.700> well

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
onto here decided to put a ladders well

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.060 
onto here decided to put a ladders well
bit<00:06:03.270> neater<00:06:03.450> but<00:06:03.840> anyway<00:06:04.650> yeah<00:06:04.770> I<00:06:04.800> guess

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070
