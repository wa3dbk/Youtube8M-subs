potential<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> start<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.890> year<00:01:28.950> was

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
potential at the start of the year was

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
potential at the start of the year was
84<00:01:29.790> obviously<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> Dortmund<00:01:30.780> career<00:01:31.049> mode

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
84 obviously in the Dortmund career mode

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.130 
84 obviously in the Dortmund career mode
we<00:01:31.409> were<00:01:31.500> able<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.829> get<00:01:31.979> him<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.640> 85<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.689> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
we were able to get him up to 85 and of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.899 
we were able to get him up to 85 and of
course<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.500> 15<00:01:35.159> he'll<00:01:35.340> start<00:01:35.610> off<00:01:35.700> with<00:01:35.880> a

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
course in 15 he'll start off with a

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.760 
course in 15 he'll start off with a
higher<00:01:36.180> base<00:01:36.479> rating<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
higher base rating as you can see I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.340 
higher base rating as you can see I
actually<00:01:38.070> reckon<00:01:38.460> he'll<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:38.909> high<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.390> 87

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
actually reckon he'll get as high as 87

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.069 
actually reckon he'll get as high as 87
or<00:01:40.560> 88<00:01:41.299> considering<00:01:42.299> obviously<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.869> past

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
or 88 considering obviously in the past

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.020 
or 88 considering obviously in the past
18<00:01:43.470> months<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.829> real<00:01:44.009> life<00:01:44.159> he<00:01:44.340> really<00:01:44.790> has

18 months in real life he really has

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.749 
18 months in real life he really has
come<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.509> he's<00:01:45.689> improved<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.560> much<00:01:46.759> lightning

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
come on he's improved so much lightning

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.929 
come on he's improved so much lightning
pace<00:01:48.240> he's<00:01:48.479> gone<00:01:48.689> from<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.560> youth

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
pace he's gone from just a youth

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.429 
pace he's gone from just a youth
rotation<00:01:50.939> player<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.780> last<00:01:52.049> year<00:01:52.320> was

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
rotation player and a last year was

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.350

heavily<00:01:52.799> involved<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.369> first<00:01:53.579> team<00:01:53.850> was

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
heavily involved in the first team was

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.450 
heavily involved in the first team was
one<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.840> England's<00:01:55.290> brightest<00:01:55.799> parks<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
one of England's brightest parks in the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.670 
one of England's brightest parks in the
world<00:01:56.549> cup<00:01:56.909> during<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.299> summer<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.750> he<00:01:58.469> has

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
world cup during the summer and he has

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.499 
world cup during the summer and he has
it<00:01:58.890> been<00:01:59.040> particularly<00:01:59.610> impressive<00:02:00.180> this

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
it been particularly impressive this

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.139 
it been particularly impressive this
season<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:01.110> well<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.640> taking<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.729> all<00:02:02.880> into

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
season as well and taking that all into

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.240 
season as well and taking that all into
account<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.600> do<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:03.990> given<00:02:04.649> time<00:02:04.890> because

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
account I do think given time because

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.249 
account I do think given time because
obviously<00:02:05.399> some<00:02:05.909> players<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.960> career<00:02:07.200> mode

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
obviously some players in in career mode

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.919 
obviously some players in in career mode
can<00:02:07.590> really<00:02:08.129> reach<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.550> high<00:02:08.729> ends<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
can really reach the high ends of the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.690 
can really reach the high ends of the
rating<00:02:10.259> systems<00:02:10.619> without<00:02:10.739> actually<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.520> real

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
rating systems without actually in real

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.220 
rating systems without actually in real
life<00:02:11.849> being<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.989> know

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
life being you know

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.320 
life being you know
potential<00:02:13.890> world-beaters<00:02:14.430> right<00:02:14.640> now<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.090> in

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
potential world-beaters right now but in

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.300 
potential world-beaters right now but in
the<00:02:15.390> career<00:02:15.959> Moto's<00:02:16.349> I<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.650> think<00:02:17.040> Raheem

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the career Moto's I do think Raheem

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.369 
the career Moto's I do think Raheem
Sterling<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:18.269> reach<00:02:18.420> those<00:02:18.629> high<00:02:18.840> reaches<00:02:19.260> of

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
Sterling can reach those high reaches of

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.309 
Sterling can reach those high reaches of
the<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.920> late<00:02:20.069> 80s<00:02:20.459> maybe<00:02:20.819> even<00:02:21.180> if<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:22.230> know

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
the the late 80s maybe even if you know

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.199 
the the late 80s maybe even if you know
he<00:02:22.440> plays<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.920> hundred<00:02:23.400> percent<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.060> time

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
he plays a hundred percent of the time

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.970 
he plays a hundred percent of the time
for<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.629> in<00:02:24.780> career<00:02:25.019> but<00:02:25.140> he<00:02:25.170> may<00:02:25.440> even<00:02:25.470> reach

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
for you in career but he may even reach

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.300 
for you in career but he may even reach
the<00:02:26.670> 90<00:02:27.060> rating<00:02:27.390> by<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.540> time<00:02:27.810> he<00:02:28.019> is<00:02:28.080> say<00:02:28.409> 27

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
impressed that the World Cup wasn't as

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.220 
impressed that the World Cup wasn't as

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.979 
games and Memphis to play came on as his
help<00:03:23.459> although<00:03:23.609> of<00:03:23.790> course<00:03:23.819> Hollins<00:03:24.810> got

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
help although of course Hollins got

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.780 
help although of course Hollins got
slightly<00:03:25.260> further<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.829> competition<00:03:25.919> than

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
slightly further in the competition than

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.789 
slightly further in the competition than
we<00:03:27.000> did<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.419> still<00:03:27.690> 2<00:03:27.900> pi<00:03:28.049> really<00:03:28.380> impressed

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
we did but still 2 pi really impressed

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.159 
we did but still 2 pi really impressed
when<00:03:28.950> he<00:03:29.069> came<00:03:29.220> on<00:03:29.280> off<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.790> bench<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.209> he

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
when he came on off the bench and he

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.330 
when he came on off the bench and he
actually<00:03:31.319> got<00:03:31.560> an<00:03:31.650> international<00:03:32.099> man<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.250> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
actually got an international man of the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.860 
actually got an international man of the
match<00:03:32.430> card<00:03:32.700> for<00:03:32.910> having<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.209> good<00:03:33.389> impact<00:03:33.660> off

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
match card for having a good impact off

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.270 
match card for having a good impact off
the<00:03:33.900> bench<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.260> scoring<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.709> decent<00:03:35.040> goal<00:03:35.160> as

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
the bench and scoring a decent goal as

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.009 
the bench and scoring a decent goal as
well<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.609> I<00:03:36.030> reckon<00:03:36.329> he'll<00:03:36.419> start<00:03:36.720> around

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
well and I reckon he'll start around

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.379 
well and I reckon he'll start around
about<00:03:37.200> 77<00:03:37.799> 78<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.430> in<00:03:38.579> ultimate<00:03:38.849> team<00:03:39.030> terms<00:03:39.269> he

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
about 77 78 so in ultimate team terms he

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.150 
about 77 78 so in ultimate team terms he
will<00:03:39.540> have<00:03:39.630> been<00:03:39.750> upgraded<00:03:40.200> from<00:03:40.290> silver<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.889> a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
will have been upgraded from silver to a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.280 
will have been upgraded from silver to a
gold<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.760> then<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.239> he's<00:03:42.480> his<00:03:42.900> potential

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
gold and then I think he's his potential

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.289 
gold and then I think he's his potential
is<00:03:43.680> going<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.010> be<00:03:44.069> around<00:03:44.220> about<00:03:44.459> 85<00:03:44.910> although

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
is going to be around about 85 although

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.659 
is going to be around about 85 although
of<00:03:45.450> course<00:03:45.560> similarly<00:03:46.560> with<00:03:46.859> Raheem<00:03:47.250> Sterling

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
of course similarly with Raheem Sterling

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.789 
of course similarly with Raheem Sterling
that<00:03:47.819> could<00:03:48.120> go<00:03:48.389> a<00:03:48.599> little<00:03:48.959> bit<00:03:49.200> higher<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:49.650> you

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
that could go a little bit higher if you

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.860 
that could go a little bit higher if you
do<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.010> multiple<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.060> know<00:03:51.180> season<00:03:51.569> upon

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
do a multiple you know season upon

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.690 
do a multiple you know season upon
season<00:03:51.930> upon<00:03:52.349> season<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:52.859> career<00:03:53.099> mode<00:03:53.130> then

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
season upon season in career mode then

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.819 
season upon season in career mode then
he<00:03:53.790> could<00:03:53.970> quite<00:03:54.239> possibly<00:03:54.269> reach<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.079> 87<00:03:55.560> 88

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
he could quite possibly reach the 87 88

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.259 
he could quite possibly reach the 87 88
mark<00:03:56.190> but<00:03:56.400> I<00:03:56.430> think<00:03:56.639> just<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:56.879> be<00:03:56.970> on<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.060> safe

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
mark but I think just to be on the safe

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.330 
mark but I think just to be on the safe
side<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:58.230> know<00:03:58.349> we'll<00:03:58.530> put<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.859> around<00:03:58.950> about

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
side you know we'll put it around about

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.580 
side you know we'll put it around about
85<00:03:59.910> but<00:04:00.150> then<00:04:00.269> my<00:04:00.359> opinions<00:04:00.780> on<00:04:00.930> those<00:04:01.410> two

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
85 but then my opinions on those two

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.839 
85 but then my opinions on those two
players<00:04:01.829> of<00:04:02.010> course<00:04:02.160> feel<00:04:02.430> free<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.730> leave
