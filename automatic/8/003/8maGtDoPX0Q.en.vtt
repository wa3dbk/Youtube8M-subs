00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.190
 Now that we have the whole flesh nice 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.630

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.880

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.950
 gretner accept and with straight long 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.119
 cut the meat clean and separate 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.150
 you have no notch afterwards 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:16.620
 cut us a small bracket here 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:21.780
 What a wonderful meat then 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:26.220
 to get rid of skin can manage a little bit 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.350
 cleaned then we remove the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.830
 with existing equipment 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.830
 a pair of tweezers 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.820
 if we go against it when we get the equipment 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.430
 clean then we cut 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:48.600
 The meat was halved first 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:51.990
 is then elongated then fine stripes out of it 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:59.930
 then we then small dice 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:03:02.970
 if we cut the girl 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.640
 wonderful fish finished five minutes 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.650
 have a red take us 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.440
 onion I have this be cut 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.630
 nice his little hurt too 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.170
 about 2 mm big on bruno it in the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.170
 called technical language 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:33.020
 Now let's take a look where we are 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.020
 put a yellow in it 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:45.000
 from the egg yolk vinegar and oil we do 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.099
 then then a slight opinion 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.290
 give it first 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:04:01.519
 the vinegar salt all the sugar 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.519
 after all club is a little bit 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:10.799
 Mull is first and then we give 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.590
 start gradually nice little 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.320
 an illusion arises through the 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.970
 yolk lecithin contains an emotion 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.970
 means water and connects 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.940
 It starts to become a cream known 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.320
 For example, illusion is a lousy thing for him 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.479
 about to make a derivative 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.760
 or the nivea cream is partly too 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:46.710
 An emotional time also from water 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:52.349
 and oil plays the whole valley for me 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:58.320
 we give the onions 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:05:02.130
 Take a little fish into it 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.430
 chives which a beautiful girl 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.430
 to cut 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.530
 afterwards the whole thing still tastes good 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.530
 a little stronger off 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.660
 the whole leave it for half 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.180
 hour in the fridge if we are 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.380
 the whole only one hour in the fridge 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:29.389
 marinated wonderful we have the whole 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.389
 a nice shape on a plate 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.180
 depending on how you want to do that 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.360
 you can do more or less this 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.130
 Add mayonnaise 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:48.260
 the more mayonnaise becomes the more fluid 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:52.970
 the whole and the creamier we go 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:56.630
 whole to judge a little balsamic 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:09.320
 dressing or balsamic vinegar in this 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:14.870
 Trap decorates a small picture 2 on it 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:20.210
 Given the ring deducted can 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:21.800
 Serve whole now 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.630
 wonderful as a appetizer gorgeous 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.000
 can be eaten with other fish 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.430
 such as trout and made awesome 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.050
