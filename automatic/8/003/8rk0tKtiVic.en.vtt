this end and then activate your fuel

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.390 
this end and then activate your fuel
injector<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.710> will<00:00:19.890> spray<00:00:20.130> out<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
injector and that will spray out the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.859 
injector and that will spray out the
cleaning<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.820> she<00:00:20.939> had<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.300> other<00:00:21.449> end<00:00:21.689> and

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
fuel injector and we will be using this

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.599 
fuel injector and we will be using this
car<00:00:28.170> cleaner<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.740> our<00:00:28.859> cleaning<00:00:29.220> solution

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
car cleaner for our cleaning solution

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.160 
car cleaner for our cleaning solution
and<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.300> way<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.599> going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> go<00:00:30.929> about<00:00:31.019> doing

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and the way I'm going to go about doing

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.930 
and the way I'm going to go about doing
this<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.590> I'm<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> just<00:00:32.219> use<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.520> candle

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
this is I'm going to just use the candle

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.220 
this is I'm going to just use the candle
source<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.300> pressure<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.200> just

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
source of pressure and then I'm just

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
source of pressure and then I'm just
gonna<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> find<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.040> way<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.850> connect<00:00:36.149> this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
gonna have to find a way to connect this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.450 
gonna have to find a way to connect this
to<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> end<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.590> fuel<00:00:37.829> injector<00:00:38.160> without

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
to the end of this fuel injector without

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.850 
to the end of this fuel injector without
losing<00:00:38.790> too<00:00:38.940> much<00:00:39.090> cleaning<00:00:39.989> solution<00:00:40.410> when

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
losing too much cleaning solution when

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.650 
losing too much cleaning solution when
we<00:00:40.890> pressurize<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> system<00:00:41.550> alright<00:00:42.510> so

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
we pressurize the system alright so

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540 
we pressurize the system alright so
first<00:00:42.840> I'm<00:00:43.079> gonna<00:00:43.200> start<00:00:43.320> by<00:00:43.710> removing<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
first I'm gonna start by removing the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.150 
first I'm gonna start by removing the
o-rings<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> end<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.480> injector<00:00:46.160> next

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
o-rings at the end of this injector next

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.350 
o-rings at the end of this injector next
you<00:00:47.250> wanna<00:00:47.370> measure<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> diameter<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
you wanna measure the diameter of this

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.850 
you wanna measure the diameter of this
area<00:00:48.660> where<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.079> would<00:00:49.200> normally<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.739> into

the Sun of the fuel injector it makes

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.429 
the Sun of the fuel injector it makes
I'm<00:01:03.120> gonna<00:01:03.270> put<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.570> clamp<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
I'm gonna put this clamp on here and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.630 
I'm gonna put this clamp on here and
tighten<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.769> down<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.400> don't<00:01:05.549> have

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
tighten it down but if you don't have

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.800 
tighten it down but if you don't have
one<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.790> these<00:01:05.909> clamps<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.630> use<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
one of these clamps you can just use a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.149 
one of these clamps you can just use a
zip<00:01:07.110> tie<00:01:07.290> there's<00:01:07.560> not<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> whole

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
zip tie there's not going to be a whole

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
zip tie there's not going to be a whole
lot<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.400> pressure<00:01:08.580> from<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.689> into

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
lot of pressure from that can going into

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.740 
lot of pressure from that can going into
this<00:01:10.049> fuel<00:01:10.290> injector<00:01:10.820> there<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.939> go<00:01:12.060> nice<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
this fuel injector there we go nice and

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.539 
this fuel injector there we go nice and
tight<00:01:12.900> alright<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.920> here's<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> idea<00:01:14.430> behind

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
tight alright so here's the idea behind

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.800 
tight alright so here's the idea behind
what<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:14.880> building<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.299> I'm<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
what I'm building here I'm just going to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
what I'm building here I'm just going to
be<00:01:15.900> using<00:01:16.259> smaller<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.920> smaller<00:01:17.159> sized

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
be using smaller and smaller sized

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.890 
be using smaller and smaller sized
rubber<00:01:17.759> hoses<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.270> go<00:01:18.390> from<00:01:18.570> our<00:01:18.689> fuel

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
rubber hoses to go from our fuel

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.980 
rubber hoses to go from our fuel
injector<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.979> our<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> car<00:01:20.939> cleaner<00:01:21.180> but

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.690 
you get too close you can damage this
thanks<00:03:10.350> we've<00:03:10.470> got<00:03:10.590> another<00:03:10.740> size<00:03:11.040> down<00:03:11.310> on

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
thanks we've got another size down on

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.630 
thanks we've got another size down on
our<00:03:11.880> shrink<00:03:12.420> tubing<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:12.990> put<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.380> here

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.920 

alright<00:03:17.640> now<00:03:17.790> this<00:03:17.940> plastic<00:03:18.480> tube<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.870> goes

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
alright now this plastic tube that goes

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.960 
alright now this plastic tube that goes
on<00:03:19.230> there<00:03:19.410> can<00:03:19.890> itself<00:03:20.250> as<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.580> can<00:03:20.700> see<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
on there can itself as you can see the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.360 
on there can itself as you can see the
diameter<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.570> really<00:03:21.930> tiny<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.130> order<00:03:23.250> to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
diameter is really tiny so in order to

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.949 
diameter is really tiny so in order to
bring<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.790> diameter<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.450> thing<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:24.840> a

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
bring the diameter of this thing up a

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.690 
bring the diameter of this thing up a
little<00:03:24.989> bit<00:03:25.350> we'll<00:03:26.100> just<00:03:26.310> find<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.640> a

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
little bit we'll just find that a

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.550 
little bit we'll just find that a
smallest<00:03:27.150> piece<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.420> shrink<00:03:28.019> tubing<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.410> got

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
smallest piece of shrink tubing we got

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.410 
smallest piece of shrink tubing we got
in<00:03:28.709> our<00:03:28.800> store<00:03:29.040> my<00:03:29.190> kit<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.670> put<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.180> top<00:03:30.360> of

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
in our store my kit and put it on top of

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.540 
in our store my kit and put it on top of
here<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.930> then<00:03:31.050> we're<00:03:31.830> gonna<00:03:31.920> heat<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.310> up

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
here and then we're gonna heat this up

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.300 
here and then we're gonna heat this up
and<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.090> gonna<00:03:33.360> just<00:03:34.200> shrink<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.070> stick

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
and this is gonna just shrink and stick

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.550 
and this is gonna just shrink and stick
to<00:03:35.459> this<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:35.820> at<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.540> same<00:03:36.690> time<00:03:36.900> bring<00:03:37.380> its

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
to this and at the same time bring its

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.800 
to this and at the same time bring its
diameter<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.880> when<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.120> put<00:03:39.360> this<00:03:39.450> inside

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
diameter so that when we put this inside

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.720 
diameter so that when we put this inside
the<00:03:40.080> shrink<00:03:40.680> tubing<00:03:40.920> that's<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:41.430> our<00:03:41.519> main

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
the shrink tubing that's on our main

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.630 
the shrink tubing that's on our main
piece<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.239> heat<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.870> up<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.680> will<00:03:43.860> have<00:03:44.489> an

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
piece and heat that up it will have an

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.060 
piece and heat that up it will have an
easier<00:03:44.940> time<00:03:45.000> sealing<00:03:45.630> around<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:45.989> now<00:03:46.860> when

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
easier time sealing around this now when

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.259 
easier time sealing around this now when
you're<00:03:47.220> dealing<00:03:47.370> with<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.820> you<00:03:48.030> want<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.209> be

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
you're dealing with this you want to be

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.880 
you're dealing with this you want to be
very<00:03:48.330> careful<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.200> don't<00:03:49.290> melt<00:03:49.650> it

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
very careful so that you don't melt it

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.259 
very careful so that you don't melt it
because<00:03:50.280> otherwise<00:03:50.489> then<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.850> have<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.090> keep

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
because otherwise then you have to keep

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.690 
because otherwise then you have to keep
cutting<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.380> gonna<00:03:52.530> just<00:03:52.830> shrink<00:03:53.549> in

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
cutting it and it's gonna just shrink in

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:01.030 
cutting it and it's gonna just shrink in
size<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.269> basically<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.110> will<00:03:55.260> happen

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.500

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
the battery post with the other one

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.730 
the battery post with the other one
quickly<00:04:32.849> to<00:04:33.270> activate<00:04:33.689> it<00:04:33.840> all<00:04:34.259> right<00:04:34.439> here<00:04:34.650> we

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
quickly to activate it all right here we

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.480 
quickly to activate it all right here we
go

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:51.980 

hey<00:04:41.490> I'll<00:04:41.610> give<00:04:41.789> you<00:04:41.879> guys<00:04:41.969> a<00:04:42.030> closer<00:04:42.360> shot<00:04:50.990> so

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
when you do this you want to just

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.469 
when you do this you want to just
basically<00:04:53.370> keep<00:04:53.580> an<00:04:53.729> eye<00:04:53.819> on<00:04:53.849> the<00:04:54.090> fan<00:04:54.270> area

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
basically keep an eye on the fan area

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:55.999 
basically keep an eye on the fan area
make<00:04:54.780> sure<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:55.169> clean<00:04:55.620> air<00:04:55.770> that's<00:04:55.919> coming

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
make sure the clean air that's coming

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.379 
make sure the clean air that's coming
out<00:04:56.310> of<00:04:56.400> this<00:04:56.460> injector<00:04:56.879> is<00:04:57.000> coming<00:04:57.270> out

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
out of this injector is coming out

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.540 
out of this injector is coming out
evenly<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.349> if<00:04:58.650> it's<00:04:58.800> not<00:04:58.979> you<00:04:59.099> just<00:04:59.129> do<00:04:59.430> this

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
evenly and if it's not you just do this

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.369 
evenly and if it's not you just do this
until<00:04:59.759> it<00:04:59.969> comes<00:05:00.210> out<00:05:00.360> nice<00:05:00.509> even<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:01.139> clean

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
until it comes out nice even and clean

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.019 
until it comes out nice even and clean
also<00:05:01.949> have<00:05:02.159> any<00:05:02.279> activating<00:05:02.879> and

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:03.029 
also have any activating and

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.519 
also have any activating and
deactivating<00:05:03.060> your<00:05:03.810> fuel<00:05:04.020> injector<00:05:04.319> just

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:04.529 
deactivating your fuel injector just

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:06.320 
deactivating your fuel injector just
make<00:05:04.650> sure<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:04.979> you<00:05:05.159> do<00:05:05.279> this<00:05:05.400> quickly

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
make sure that you do this quickly

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.879 
make sure that you do this quickly

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
because you know under normal

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.649 
because you know under normal
circumstances<00:05:08.669> your<00:05:08.819> fuel<00:05:09.060> injectors<00:05:09.120> the

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
circumstances your fuel injectors the

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.089 
circumstances your fuel injectors the
post<00:05:09.870> is<00:05:10.050> sent<00:05:10.259> to<00:05:10.289> your<00:05:10.409> fuel<00:05:10.620> injectors<00:05:10.949> is

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
only there for you know fraction of a

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.100 
only there for you know fraction of a
second<00:05:13.979> if<00:05:14.219> you<00:05:14.639> just<00:05:14.819> put<00:05:15.539> this<00:05:15.659> on<00:05:15.870> here<00:05:16.050> and

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
second if you just put this on here and

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.080 
second if you just put this on here and
wait<00:05:16.469> maybe<00:05:16.919> for<00:05:17.159> a<00:05:17.189> couple<00:05:17.250> of<00:05:17.460> seconds<00:05:17.879> then

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
wait maybe for a couple of seconds then

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.360 
wait maybe for a couple of seconds then
you<00:05:18.389> run<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.599> risk<00:05:18.719> of<00:05:18.990> overheating<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.159> song

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
you run the risk of overheating the song

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.890 
you run the risk of overheating the song
right<00:05:20.610> inside<00:05:20.939> your<00:05:21.060> fuel<00:05:21.360> injector<00:05:21.659> and<00:05:21.779> then

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
right inside your fuel injector and then

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.110 
right inside your fuel injector and then
damaging<00:05:22.349> it<00:05:22.469> also<00:05:23.009> recommend<00:05:23.430> that<00:05:23.490> you<00:05:23.580> do

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
damaging it also recommend that you do

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.249 
damaging it also recommend that you do
some<00:05:24.270> research<00:05:24.629> and<00:05:24.719> find<00:05:24.900> out<00:05:25.050> how<00:05:25.139> much

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
some research and find out how much

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.769 
some research and find out how much
voltage<00:05:25.529> your<00:05:26.340> fuel<00:05:26.669> injectors<00:05:27.150> require<00:05:27.479> and

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:27.779 
voltage your fuel injectors require and

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.240 
voltage your fuel injectors require and
if<00:05:27.960> it's<00:05:28.110> less<00:05:28.289> than<00:05:28.469> 12<00:05:28.680> volts<00:05:28.979> then<00:05:29.219> I

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
if it's less than 12 volts then I

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.040 
if it's less than 12 volts then I
recommend<00:05:29.639> that's<00:05:29.909> what<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.180> use<00:05:30.389> and<00:05:30.840> what

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
recommend that's what you use and what

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.329 
recommend that's what you use and what

we're going to do next is just to take
this<00:05:32.490> fuel<00:05:32.699> injector<00:05:32.969> out<00:05:33.120> flip<00:05:33.360> it<00:05:33.479> around

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629 
this fuel injector out flip it around

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:35.659 
this fuel injector out flip it around
and<00:05:33.870> then<00:05:34.050> just<00:05:34.259> back<00:05:34.379> flush<00:05:34.680> it<00:05:34.860> but<00:05:35.400> before
