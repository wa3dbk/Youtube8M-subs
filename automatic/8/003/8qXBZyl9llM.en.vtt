00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.900 

and<00:00:18.570> I'm<00:00:18.720> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.230> test<00:00:20.240> an<00:00:21.240> aircraft<00:00:22.760> that<00:00:23.760> I

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and I'm going to test an aircraft that I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.349 
and I'm going to test an aircraft that I
made<00:00:24.210> out<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.570> aluminum<00:00:25.109> cans<00:00:26.930> we<00:00:27.930> shall<00:00:28.199> see

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
made out of aluminum cans we shall see

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.200 
made out of aluminum cans we shall see
how<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.599> works<00:00:31.610> try<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> build<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.090> as

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
how this works try to build it as

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
how this works try to build it as
lightweight<00:00:33.510> as<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.050> could<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.870> use<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
lightweight as I could and use the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.619 
lightweight as I could and use the
canard<00:00:37.890> configuration<00:00:38.540> in<00:00:39.800> order<00:00:40.800> to

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
canard configuration in order to

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.950 
canard configuration in order to
maximize<00:00:42.739> aerodynamic<00:00:43.739> efficiency<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
maximize aerodynamic efficiency and as a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.220 
maximize aerodynamic efficiency and as a
matter<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.850> general<00:00:47.850> philosophy<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:50.660> like<00:00:51.660> an

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
matter of general philosophy I like an

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:02.439 
matter of general philosophy I like an
art<00:00:52.530> style<00:00:52.920> forward<00:00:54.020> stabilizer<00:00:55.020> aircraft<00:00:56.360> so

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.580 

see<00:01:03.140> how<00:01:03.289> this<00:01:03.469> puppy<00:01:03.890> works<00:01:04.129> right<00:01:04.519> now

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
see how this puppy works right now

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:21.260 
see how this puppy works right now
okay<00:01:07.590> flight<00:01:07.950> number<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.429> here<00:01:08.759> we<00:01:08.880> go<00:01:09.090> oh<00:01:20.270> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
okay flight number one here we go oh the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.620 
okay flight number one here we go oh the
advantage<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.959> aluminum<00:01:22.439> yeah<00:01:23.450> that'll<00:01:24.450> bend

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
advantage of aluminum yeah that'll bend

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:36.889 
advantage of aluminum yeah that'll bend
down<00:01:32.719> minor<00:01:33.719> trouble

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.249 

minor<00:01:37.530> trouble<00:01:40.850> nothing<00:01:41.869> nothing<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.899> can't

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
minor trouble nothing nothing that can't

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.090 
minor trouble nothing nothing that can't
be<00:01:43.350> fixed

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
be fixed

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.349 
be fixed
oops<00:01:45.770> yeah

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
oops yeah

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.749 
oops yeah
minor<00:01:49.079> repairs<00:01:49.560> no<00:01:50.369> trouble<00:01:52.130> our<00:01:53.130> plane<00:01:53.490> is

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
minor repairs no trouble our plane is

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.399 
minor repairs no trouble our plane is
newly<00:01:54.270> repaired<00:01:55.399> with<00:01:59.810> another<00:02:00.810> section

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
newly repaired with another section

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.509 
newly repaired with another section
added<00:02:01.709> right<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:07.009> that'll<00:02:08.009> add<00:02:08.160> more

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
added right here so that'll add more

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.180 
added right here so that'll add more
rigidity<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> fuselage<00:02:10.500> where<00:02:11.069> it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
rigidity to the fuselage where it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.009 
rigidity to the fuselage where it
connects<00:02:11.549> to<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.910> wing<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:14.329> here<00:02:15.329> goes<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
connects to the wing and here goes the

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:25.310 
connects to the wing and here goes the
flight<00:02:16.349> test

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:36.800 

okay<00:02:27.270> good<00:02:29.100> fine<00:02:30.480> say<00:02:31.480> okay<00:02:32.460> medic<00:02:33.460> terrible

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.880 

just<00:02:37.810> another<00:02:38.170> horribly<00:02:38.770> mangled<00:02:43.890> horizontal

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
just another horribly mangled horizontal

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:53.870 
just another horribly mangled horizontal
stabilizer

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:08.230 

you

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:04:15.170 

that<00:03:09.240> was<00:03:09.390> beautiful

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.570 

already<00:04:17.070> back

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:31.600 

and<00:04:25.060> now<00:04:27.580> back<00:04:28.580> with<00:04:28.819> my<00:04:29.030> airplane<00:04:30.400> which<00:04:31.400> has

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
and now back with my airplane which has

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:39.550 
and now back with my airplane which has
now<00:04:31.849> been<00:04:32.680> reasonably<00:04:33.680> repaired<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:38.560> I'm

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
now been reasonably repaired and I'm

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.589 
now been reasonably repaired and I'm
starting<00:04:40.069> to<00:04:41.530> arrive<00:04:42.530> at<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.889> opinion<00:04:43.190> that

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
starting to arrive at the opinion that

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:48.330 
starting to arrive at the opinion that
I'm<00:04:44.599> starting<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:46.210> polish<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.240> turd<00:04:47.389> here

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
I'm starting to polish a turd here

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.499 
I'm starting to polish a turd here
things<00:04:49.340> are<00:04:49.550> starting<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.150> get<00:04:50.300> into

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
things are starting to get into

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.760 
things are starting to get into
polishing<00:04:51.199> a<00:04:51.289> turd<00:04:51.319> territory<00:04:53.199> and<00:04:54.199> I<00:04:54.319> dislike

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
polishing a turd territory and I dislike

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.080 
polishing a turd territory and I dislike
polishing<00:04:55.430> turds<00:04:56.199> because<00:04:57.699> they<00:04:58.699> never<00:04:58.909> get

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
polishing turds because they never get

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:07.029 
polishing turds because they never get
shiny<00:05:01.629> anyway<00:05:02.629> I<00:05:03.909> guess<00:05:04.909> it's<00:05:05.530> time<00:05:06.530> for<00:05:06.590> the

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
shiny anyway I guess it's time for the

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:33.690 
shiny anyway I guess it's time for the
test<00:05:10.150> once<00:05:11.150> more

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:06:02.350 

you

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:10.680 

more

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:22.530
