00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.170
 seconds to go provoking crisis this is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.540

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.500
 the policeman that's what happened 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.980
 left typing foul and men 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.890
 were already affected by the damage 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.640

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.140
 kaman closed 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.640
 but awake 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.740
 sometimes also is actually a 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.060
 little idea of balloon and frustration 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.220
 without the look 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.260
 four cars and maxime bouet 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.270
 benjamin the body is a real event 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.450
 in front of the hakes at the Stade de France ten 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.430
 years after 10 finally wants to win a

 cup of France that endive to 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.780
 customers and it will be an event 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.000
 occupy him who did 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.159
 never set foot at the Stade de France 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.090
 who dreams of winning a first trophy 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.280
 at his heart club 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.770
 there is still half an hour left 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.690
 play nothing is played yet in a musket 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.570
 but here is more but not 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.040
 well I'll tell you something 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.200
 that can shock but so much better for 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.149
 Lyon because it's a quarter 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.649
 of time that are not well returned is this 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.649
 more seen maybe the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.510
 it's his brother 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.510
 2 0 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.000
 extremely complicated now 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.670
 tobias hill waiting zero rate 2-0 for 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.980
 the hakes 2 0 what are we getting 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.620
 easily in seven of the pensioners and 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.690
 profits the wii she has no fight 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.970
 naval to stop him hesitated at three 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.740
 spring arrives allowed two years you are 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.800
 the opera the headlights of a es8 30 but 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.690
 look at it how co2 can not 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.770
 stop him both kids were thrilled 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.369
 because you go to the pelouse 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.960
 intelligently from the country and in a 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.569
 closed angle it happens to the kevin m 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.200
 monnet package anyway 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.609
 strait third goal this season for 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.049
 kevin monnet package that no longer 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.730
 marked since September 24 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.499
 it was facing lille he found the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.859
 way of the nets tonight it's a goal 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:28.799
 decisive because it allows lorient to do 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.519
 the break facing the ol in the 68th minute of 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.230
 game 2 0 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.920
 and that's it in the space of ten minutes 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.519
 and well the Lorient that made the pitch 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.319
 Lyonnaise machine 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.750
 yeah fabien attention because there they 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.299
 are warm he calait the guide go 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.359
 must be squeezed aside lyon because 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.469
 that otherwise it can hurt 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.730
 they are not back at all from 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.109
 cloakrooms Lyon very surprising 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.790
 even for a match of this importance 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.750
 a semi final cup of the league and 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.090
 a place at the Stade de France 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.230
 your game tonight but they're gone 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.970
 in the commitment 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.490
 defeat passive passivity that was 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.030
 really 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.290
 1800 it is like pierce the 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.890
 galas in dips it's not the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.900
 first time 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.250
 emeghara he left the line 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.660
 median and not stung in the surface and 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.310
 did not stop who just helped the 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.310
 imagine a little offensive will 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.170
 go twenty minutes to play 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.959
 again and that's the 2 0 mousetrap for 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.239
 lorient against Lyon and it's deserved at 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.650
 seen from these top twenty but 25 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.930
 first minutes in the second period 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.010
 photo there even though yohan a lot 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.560
 opportunities in first half and who 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.180
 sandro including that falls well we want 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.340
 say quickly to 1 and lisandro here it is 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.640
 this balloon the ball because 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.170
 emeghara title accessory emeghara 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.709
 there is a boy as well as funny 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.709
 to grease 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.670
 it's kevin monnet package who knows 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.640
 still this goal is truly and 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.290
 find his middle right place the side there 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.650
 he has defensive activities since the 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.650
 beginning of the arm 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.230
 we're all definitely not going to one side 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.980
 team match on the team's side 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.840
 lorient who is totally 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.120
 awesome tonight and lacazette 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.660
 to revive the Lyonnais 4th e lisandro 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.660
 in the surface 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.910
 and it's solid, it's more 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.110
 proud of you if I really wanted to 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.040
 risks there they still have a pair 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.390
 attackers high enough rank in front of him 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.500
 must not play the control of the 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.030
 Lyons defense 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.030
 already that it sleeps a little bit 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.980
 they should reduce the score 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.900
 quickly anyway because that's 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.030
 not engage him fabien there is last 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.800
 having to fix to the test in the five 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.120
 minutes that it's definitely going to sit 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.920
 gets to pick up the score a little bit 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.450
 the Lyonnais can revive them 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.800
 the raises and otherwise it will be complicated 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.240
 that's why at 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.770
 the moment christian gourcuff comes from 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.510
 tell his players not to catch fire from 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.250
 stayed well behind because he knows 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.250
 that lyon be suitable at any time 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.430
 it's legal played towards 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.300
 monnet-pack the centers and ends up 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.849
 this actress would have many delays 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.629
 it's strange and renault we fled 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.900
 on the line 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.490
 I come q the second anthony wake up 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.280
 but what an opportunity what an opportunity 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.409
 lorient and again if this detail and the 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.110
 violent spending dpcp 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.759
 and I'm going to put it on the left they get 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.560
 are torn as well as right 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.849
 left 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.940
 disturbing also a symposium in the 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.800
 list is aware 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.689
 they were 1 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.670
 the attackers to return if not 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:41.050
 it'll go 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.760
 and thou strong positions there and 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.500
 corner corner for men from 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.320
 christian gourcuff 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.330
 hit by m bemba was opposite side 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.390
 directly out of goal 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.710
 what game there we see the risk suspicions 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.350
 on clearance happily hollow of the 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.270
 cover tunes otherwise 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.890
 but it's not a very 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.840
 very convincing trainer to click 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.820
 on evening I say no and beyond that we 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.460
 can not have him you putted it all 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.150
 the language all thing tonight but I 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.150
 find 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.110
 oh la la la la you are well they are they 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.060
 are incredible they practically have 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.220
 not touched down in the second period he 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.660
 feels nothing taken of purpose to cram and 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.630
 when in all the big teams there 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.980
 have great players when visuality 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.640
 the equalization at the end of the end of the end of the 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.390
 foot 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.130
 that's hard yable here's the big ones 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.360
 teams and jimmy briand that rises more 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:45.320
 high that everyone is a good 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:46.820
 small marking error down there 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.380
 had a foot and a half at the Stade de France 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.300
 after leading 2 0 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.670
 this year counting either put an end 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.880
 to tensions makes of course one has a half 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.880
 additional hour 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:59.199
 but pulls 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.800
 and we 're just going to take back our 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.690
 minds with the mushroom was coming back 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.260
 for want to relive 30 minutes 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.630
 additional 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.130
 we're waiting for it to be completely crazy 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.160
 here between lyon and lorient has everything from 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.160
 after 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.599
 the cup of the league
