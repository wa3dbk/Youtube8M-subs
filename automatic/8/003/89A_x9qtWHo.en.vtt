00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.460 
vacation and now that I'm here it's
gonna<00:00:24.390> be<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.570> lot<00:00:24.689> harder<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.230> outside

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.470 
gonna be a lot harder to do outside
videos<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.699> could<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.090> leave<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
videos so if you could just leave in the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.080 
videos so if you could just leave in the
comments<00:00:27.869> video<00:00:28.199> ideas<00:00:28.619> or<00:00:29.310> insight<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
comments video ideas or insight that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.150 
comments video ideas or insight that
would<00:00:30.210> be<00:00:30.330> great<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.140> let's<00:00:31.590> get<00:00:31.740> started

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
would be great so let's get started

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.900 
would be great so let's get started
because<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.420> cool<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.870> here

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
so typically before I start the process

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.590 
so typically before I start the process
