00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.060 
really terrible he does only cost about
10k<00:01:40.700> though<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.180> can't<00:01:41.450> really<00:01:41.510> complain

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
10k though so you can't really complain

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.710 
10k though so you can't really complain
he<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.159> worth<00:01:43.340> trying<00:01:43.670> out<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:44.030> definitely<00:01:44.540> in

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
he is worth trying out but definitely in

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.140 
he is worth trying out but definitely in
a<00:01:44.810> team<00:01:45.080> different<00:01:45.409> to<00:01:45.710> mine<00:01:45.860> as<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:46.490> hated<00:01:46.939> it

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
a team different to mine as I hated it

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.140 
a team different to mine as I hated it
so<00:01:47.210> much<00:01:47.420> when<00:01:48.260> I<00:01:48.320> say<00:01:48.500> it's<00:01:48.650> worth<00:01:48.740> 10k

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
so much when I say it's worth 10k

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.719 
so much when I say it's worth 10k
probably<00:01:50.150> not<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:50.990> only<00:01:51.200> 10k<00:01:51.530> but<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.580> can

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
probably not it is only 10k but you can

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.760 
probably not it is only 10k but you can
find<00:01:52.970> normal<00:01:53.210> French<00:01:53.600> silver<00:01:54.290> strikers<00:01:54.590> who
