why use sea salt sea salt is superior to
regular<00:00:12.870> salt<00:00:13.200> because<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.889> has<00:00:14.070> minerals<00:00:14.490> in

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
regular salt because it has minerals in

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.599 
regular salt because it has minerals in
it<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:16.289> tell<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> really<00:00:17.100> good<00:00:17.310> sea

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
it and you can tell a really good sea

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.150 
it and you can tell a really good sea
salt<00:00:17.970> by<00:00:18.779> actually<00:00:19.350> by<00:00:19.470> putting<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.070> your

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160

grey and black flecks in it and those
are<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.400> minerals<00:00:31.219> Celtic<00:00:32.219> salt<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> really

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
are the minerals Celtic salt is a really

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.690 
are the minerals Celtic salt is a really
good<00:00:33.480> sea<00:00:33.719> salt<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.079> Celtic<00:00:34.590> salt<00:00:34.920> guarantees

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
good sea salt and Celtic salt guarantees

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.639 
good sea salt and Celtic salt guarantees
you<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.120> there's<00:00:36.329> sixteen<00:00:37.110> percent

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
you that there's sixteen percent

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.580 
you that there's sixteen percent
minerals<00:00:38.190> which<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.350> our

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
minerals which is a lot and because our

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.819 
minerals which is a lot and because our
our<00:00:41.059> soil<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.300> kind<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.660> depleted<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.320> minerals

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
our soil is kind of depleted of minerals

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.549 
our soil is kind of depleted of minerals
these<00:00:44.520> days<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.270> good<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.870> those<00:00:46.350> extra

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
these days it's good to have those extra

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.420 
these days it's good to have those extra
minerals<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:47.460> food<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.719> good<00:00:48.960> also<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
minerals in your food it's good also the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.279 
minerals in your food it's good also the
regular<00:00:50.879> stuff<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.449> buy<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> iodized

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
regular stuff that you buy the iodized

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.220 
regular stuff that you buy the iodized
sea<00:00:52.620> salt<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.820> iodice<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:54.989> does<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
sea salt it's iodice and what does that

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.549 
sea salt it's iodice and what does that
mean<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.500> add<00:00:55.800> iodine<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.020> iodine

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
mean to add iodine to it and the iodine

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.650 
mean to add iodine to it and the iodine
can<00:00:58.829> discolor<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> needs<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.539> be

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
can discolor it so that it needs to be

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.590 
can discolor it so that it needs to be
bleached<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.800> also<00:01:01.980> make<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.670> cake<00:01:03.300> up

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
bleached and it can also make it cake up

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.170 
bleached and it can also make it cake up
so<00:01:03.870> they<00:01:04.019> need<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.229> add<00:01:04.439> anti-caking<00:01:05.400> agents

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so they need to add anti-caking agents

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.969 
so they need to add anti-caking agents
and<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.420> don't<00:01:06.600> need<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.229> stuff<00:01:07.530> in

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and you don't need all that stuff in

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.550 
and you don't need all that stuff in
your<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.330> add<00:01:09.479> iodine<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.700> well

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
your so I do they add iodine to it well

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.039 
your so I do they add iodine to it well
that<00:01:13.560> oh<00:01:13.799> yeah<00:01:14.340> um<00:01:15.770> because<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.330> don't<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.540> weird
