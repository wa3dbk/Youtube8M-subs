00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
detonator is pretty dang good but it's a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.859 
detonator is pretty dang good but it's a
little<00:01:40.680> bit<00:01:41.159> inconsistent<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.689> guys

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
little bit inconsistent because the guys

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
absolutely insane on this game type up

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.020 
absolutely insane on this game type up
if<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:49.750> get<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.930> saw<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.379> host<00:02:50.590> it's<00:02:51.030> completely

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
if you get a saw on host it's completely

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.140 
if you get a saw on host it's completely
over<00:02:52.299> if<00:02:52.480> you're<00:02:53.230> not<00:02:53.349> host<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.859> know<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.430> it

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
over if you're not host you know and it

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.759 
over if you're not host you know and it
just<00:02:55.420> really<00:02:55.720> depends<00:02:56.049> on<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.319> connection

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
just really depends on the connection

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.099 
just really depends on the connection
but<00:02:56.950> as<00:02:57.220> host<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:57.970> can<00:02:58.299> tear<00:02:58.510> through<00:02:58.540> people

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109
