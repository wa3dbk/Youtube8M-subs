00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.650
 I'm going to prepare some prawns in the solar oven 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.359
 we will only need the prawns 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.579
 and a little coarse salt 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.119
 we put a bed of salt in the bottom of a tray 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.630
 as you are seeing 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.249
 we level and place the prawns 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.090
 then we have put for the Chinese banks add a little more salt 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.890
 not too many 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.160
 the idea is to fill the spaces a bit and thus ensure a better 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.350
 transfer of heat through the grains of salt 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.070
 immediately and we take everything to the solar oven 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.070
 which we must have already preheated 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.840
 today a very sunny day so we will have them cooked the world 20 min 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.040
 important the prawns should not release liquid because if it did 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.490
 they would absorb a lot of salt 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.880
 to achieve this 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.640
 formed warm second step is the preparation and immediately lead to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.390
 oven 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.469
 third do not cover the tray during cooking 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.330
 in this way we will remain juicy for sale 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.660
 and as the point of salt just 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.930
 accompanied by a white wine 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.010
 it is delicious
