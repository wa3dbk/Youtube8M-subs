investment project I think on

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.189 
investment project I think on
Kickstarter<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:14.120> they<00:00:15.120> basically<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.960> kind

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
Kickstarter that they basically it kind

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.140 
Kickstarter that they basically it kind

of fits the theme of the hillbilly glass
Fair<00:00:18.420> which<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:18.750> also<00:00:18.900> sell<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:20.220> taking<00:00:20.760> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
Fair which we also sell it's taking the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.849

the<00:00:21.390> hillbilly<00:00:21.869> approach<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.289> saying<00:00:22.529> here's

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the hillbilly approach of saying here's

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.640 
the hillbilly approach of saying here's
your<00:00:23.100> mason<00:00:23.460> jar<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:25.019> can't<00:00:25.260> typically

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
your mason jar but you can't typically

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.589 
your mason jar but you can't typically
shake<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.189> very<00:00:26.340> easy<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> tops<00:00:27.390> are

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
shake it very easy because the tops are

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.849 
shake it very easy because the tops are
flat<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.529> they've<00:00:29.039> developed<00:00:29.359> this<00:00:30.529> of<00:00:31.529> course

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
flat so they've developed this of course

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.270 
flat so they've developed this of course
a<00:00:32.189> strainer<00:00:32.759> system<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> cap<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.590> then

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
a strainer system with a cap and then

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.760 
a strainer system with a cap and then
you<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.520> your<00:00:35.640> standard<00:00:36.320> strainer<00:00:37.320> or

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you have your standard strainer or

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.810 
you have your standard strainer or
locking<00:00:38.430> mechanism<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.820> it's

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
locking mechanism that you use and it's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.880 
locking mechanism that you use and it's
sold<00:00:42.059> less<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> set<00:00:42.960> everything<00:00:43.379> comes<00:00:43.590> with

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
sold less as a set everything comes with

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.250 
sold less as a set everything comes with
this<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:45.930> really<00:00:46.140> a

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
this right here and it's it's really a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.310 
this right here and it's it's really a
very<00:00:46.760> basic<00:00:47.760> shaking<00:00:48.660> mechanism<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.230> I'm

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
very basic shaking mechanism so I'm

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
very basic shaking mechanism so I'm
gonna<00:00:49.440> use<00:00:49.590> some<00:00:49.620> orange<00:00:49.950> juice<00:00:50.100> cuz<00:00:50.520> we're

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
gonna use some orange juice cuz we're

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.090 
gonna use some orange juice cuz we're
not<00:00:51.449> doing<00:00:52.050> any<00:00:52.170> crazy<00:00:52.469> drinking<00:00:52.920> right<00:00:53.070> now

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
not doing any crazy drinking right now

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.229 
not doing any crazy drinking right now
and<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:54.719> holds<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.289> lot<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> fluid<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:57.059> can

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and it holds a lot of fluid so you can

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.410 
and it holds a lot of fluid so you can
use<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:58.129> Morel<00:00:59.129> more<00:00:59.609> complex

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420

there is if anything a little bit of a
not<00:02:02.840> necessarily<00:02:03.320> leak<00:02:03.500> but<00:02:03.740> uh<00:02:04.000> you<00:02:05.000> know<00:02:05.090> as

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
not necessarily leak but uh you know as

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.240 
not necessarily leak but uh you know as
the<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.990> liquid<00:02:06.380> comes<00:02:06.920> through<00:02:07.160> the

the the liquid comes through the
strainer<00:02:07.460> if<00:02:07.640> you're<00:02:07.730> shaking<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.210> may

strainer if you're shaking it you may

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.270 
strainer if you're shaking it you may
get<00:02:08.510> a<00:02:08.570> little<00:02:08.720> there<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.230> either<00:02:09.950> have<00:02:10.100> to

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
get a little there so either have to

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.850 
get a little there so either have to
deal<00:02:10.460> with<00:02:10.490> a<00:02:10.610> little<00:02:10.820> bit<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.090> pour<00:02:11.630> down<00:02:11.860> into

your mat or pour over the glass a little

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.300 
your mat or pour over the glass a little
wider<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.970> then<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:18.170> know<00:02:18.290> strain<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.220> out

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
wider and then you know strain it out

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.570 
wider and then you know strain it out
the<00:02:19.760> straining<00:02:20.090> holes<00:02:21.130> depending<00:02:22.130> on<00:02:22.250> who<00:02:22.430> you

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
the straining holes depending on who you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.490 
the straining holes depending on who you
are<00:02:22.610> some<00:02:23.000> people<00:02:23.270> didn't<00:02:23.690> take<00:02:23.810> much<00:02:24.050> today

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
are some people didn't take much today

are some people didn't take much today
some<00:02:24.950> people<00:02:25.220> like<00:02:25.460> a<00:02:25.490> slower<00:02:25.880> strain<00:02:26.300> some

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
some people like a slower strain some

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.970 
some people like a slower strain some
people<00:02:26.810> like<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> faster<00:02:27.410> strain<00:02:27.650> this<00:02:27.830> is

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
people like a faster strain this is

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.220 
people like a faster strain this is
somewhere<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.880> middle<00:02:28.940> depending<00:02:29.570> on<00:02:29.660> the

create a product for the masses so each

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.729 
create a product for the masses so each

the the maker of the product hand packs
each<00:03:01.940> one<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:02.870> know<00:03:03.800> they're<00:03:04.280> there<00:03:04.700> paid

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
shipped out I kind of equate it to like

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.520 
shipped out I kind of equate it to like
the<00:03:10.820> small<00:03:11.120> batch<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.720> you've<00:03:11.900> seen<00:03:12.080> bidders

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
the small batch that you've seen bidders

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.009 
the small batch that you've seen bidders
I'm<00:03:12.890> sure<00:03:13.250> as<00:03:13.550> they<00:03:13.790> expand<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:14.390> as<00:03:14.510> as<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
I'm sure as they expand it as as the

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.979 
I'm sure as they expand it as as the
demand<00:03:15.290> grows<00:03:15.519> you'll<00:03:16.519> you<00:03:17.090> know<00:03:17.209> it'll<00:03:17.810> be<00:03:17.959> a

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
demand grows you'll you know it'll be a

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.110 
demand grows you'll you know it'll be a
little<00:03:18.620> you'll<00:03:19.280> see<00:03:19.459> these<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.640> little<00:03:19.940> more

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
little you'll see these a little more

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.390 
little you'll see these a little more
prevalent<00:03:20.720> in<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.260> industry<00:03:21.680> but<00:03:22.100> right<00:03:22.250> now

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
prevalent in the industry but right now

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.650 
prevalent in the industry but right now
we're<00:03:22.640> one<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.030> only<00:03:23.150> people<00:03:23.360> that<00:03:23.630> I

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
we're one of the only people that I

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.380 
we're one of the only people that I
could<00:03:23.780> find<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.860> sells<00:03:25.160> these<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:26.090> there<00:03:26.269> you

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
could find that sells these so there you

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.050 
could find that sells these so there you
go<00:03:26.540> it's<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.080> Mason<00:03:27.530> shaker<00:03:28.040> it'll<00:03:28.670> make<00:03:28.880> your

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
go it's the Mason shaker it'll make your

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.930 
go it's the Mason shaker it'll make your
orange<00:03:29.450> juice<00:03:29.480> just<00:03:30.050> that<00:03:30.290> bit<00:03:30.590> colder<00:03:31.930> Cheers
