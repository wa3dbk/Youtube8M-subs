cutter with swords dance now I know I'm

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.219 
cutter with swords dance now I know I'm
probably<00:02:05.939> not<00:02:06.270> gonna<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> whole<00:02:06.780> lot<00:02:06.810> but<00:02:07.170> I

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
probably not gonna do a whole lot but I

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.680 
probably not gonna do a whole lot but I
decided<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.649> test<00:02:07.890> out<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.340> spin<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.179> since<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
decided to test out I spin on it since I

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.920 
decided to test out I spin on it since I
can't<00:02:10.020> use<00:02:10.140> earthquake<00:02:10.500> obviously<00:02:10.979> and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
can't use earthquake obviously and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.530 
can't use earthquake obviously and
unfortunately

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
unfortunately

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.059 
unfortunately
it<00:02:13.750> doesn't<00:02:14.110> do<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.260> much<00:02:14.319> damage<00:02:14.439> but<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:14.980> do

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
it doesn't do that much damage but I do

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.589 
it doesn't do that much damage but I do
get<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.459> flinch<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.030> that's<00:02:16.180> kind<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.450> nice

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599
