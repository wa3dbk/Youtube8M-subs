00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.860 

like<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> way<00:01:40.260> this<00:01:40.530> came<00:01:40.770> out<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.870> it

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
like the way this came out because it

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.270 
like the way this came out because it
doesn't<00:01:44.270> hang<00:01:45.270> way<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.470> past<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.979> front<00:01:47.220> of

doesn't hang way out past the front of
the<00:01:47.370> windshield<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.590> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.650> didn't<00:01:49.890> really

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
the windshield I kind of didn't really

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.740 
the windshield I kind of didn't really
care<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.580> look<00:01:50.820> some<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> other

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
mounts that you can buy online I think

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.210

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
this one sits pretty nice one of the

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.460 
this one sits pretty nice one of the
other<00:01:59.340> things<00:01:59.700> about<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.450> light<00:02:00.720> bar<00:02:00.930> when<00:02:01.440> I

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
other things about this light bar when I

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.010 
other things about this light bar when I
was<00:02:01.710> trying<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.369> pick<00:02:02.700> them<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.540> wasn't

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
was trying to pick them out I wasn't

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.969 
was trying to pick them out I wasn't
sure<00:02:04.229> if<00:02:04.560> 50<00:02:05.490> inch<00:02:05.610> was<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.750> way<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:07.200> or<00:02:07.229> 50

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
sure if 50 inch was the way to go or 50

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.430 
sure if 50 inch was the way to go or 50
to<00:02:08.160> would<00:02:08.280> work<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:09.140> measured

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to would work I measured

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.250 
to would work I measured
I<00:02:10.850> kept<00:02:11.850> measuring<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.390> measuring<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> truck

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
I kept measuring and measuring the truck

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.220 
I kept measuring and measuring the truck
and<00:02:14.000> couldn't<00:02:15.000> figure<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.300> out<00:02:15.540> which<00:02:15.810> side<00:02:16.080> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
and couldn't figure it out which side to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.509 
and couldn't figure it out which side to
go<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.650> ended<00:02:17.519> up<00:02:17.580> going<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.940> 52<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.989> was

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
go I ended up going to 52 because it was

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.060 
go I ended up going to 52 because it was
cheaper<00:02:20.519> than<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.290> curved<00:02:22.530> ones<00:02:22.830> and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
cheaper than like the curved ones and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.410 
cheaper than like the curved ones and
stuff<00:02:23.930> but<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:26.010> actual<00:02:26.310> measurement<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.269> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
stuff but the actual measurement of the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.070 
stuff but the actual measurement of the
52<00:02:27.900> inch<00:02:28.050> light<00:02:28.260> bar<00:02:28.370> from<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.610> end<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
52 inch light bar from the end of the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.100 
52 inch light bar from the end of the
mount<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.510> other<00:02:33.660> end<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.080> other

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
mount to the other end of the other

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.830 
mount to the other end of the other
mount<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:35.750> exactly<00:02:36.950> 52<00:02:37.950> inches<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:39.660> when<00:02:39.810> I

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
mount is exactly 52 inches and when I

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.420 
mount is exactly 52 inches and when I
originally<00:02:40.110> made<00:02:40.530> these<00:02:40.709> brackets<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.280> was

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
originally made these brackets I was

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.310 
originally made these brackets I was
thinking<00:02:43.549> it<00:02:44.549> was<00:02:44.700> gonna<00:02:44.820> be<00:02:44.970> 51<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.110> some

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
thinking it was gonna be 51 and some

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.650 
thinking it was gonna be 51 and some
change<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.769> think<00:02:47.180> because<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.690> picture<00:02:49.049> in

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
change I think because of the picture in

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.650 
change I think because of the picture in
the<00:02:51.660> actual<00:02:52.019> ad<00:02:52.530> for<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.220> light<00:02:53.370> bar<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:54.450> I

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
the actual ad for the light bar but I

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.350 
the actual ad for the light bar but I
was<00:02:54.870> able<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:56.090> straighten<00:02:57.090> out<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:59.209> bins<00:03:00.209> I

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
was able to straighten out the bins I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.699 
was able to straighten out the bins I
put<00:03:00.600> in<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:02.750> just<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.840> little<00:03:04.079> bit<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.380> make<00:03:04.560> up

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
put in it just a little bit to make up

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.360 
put in it just a little bit to make up
for<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:08.570> but<00:03:09.570> yeah<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.079> that<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
for that but yeah that that to the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.970 
for that but yeah that that to the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
inside of the drip rail on the Cherokee

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.340 
inside of the drip rail on the Cherokee
is<00:03:14.340> 53<00:03:15.180> inches<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.940> just<00:03:18.510> kind<00:03:19.320> of

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350
