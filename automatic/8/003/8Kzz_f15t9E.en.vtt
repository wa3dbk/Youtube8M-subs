range than the ACR but in the reverse
the<00:01:23.100> ACR<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.670> better<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.479> long<00:01:24.689> range<00:01:24.720> than

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380

would really recommend using silencer on
it<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.189> simple<00:01:53.520> fact<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.850> you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
it just for the simple fact that you

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.840 
it just for the simple fact that you
won't<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.750> shown<00:01:55.740> as<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> red<00:01:56.340> dot<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.790> your

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
won't be shown as a red dot on your

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.050 
won't be shown as a red dot on your
enemy's<00:01:57.630> radar<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:59.070> with<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.610> out<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
enemy's radar so with that out of the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.389 
enemy's radar so with that out of the
way<00:02:00.149> i'll<00:02:00.509> give<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.869> guys<00:02:01.020> my<00:02:01.200> first<00:02:01.530> tip<00:02:01.890> on

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
way i'll give you guys my first tip on

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.520 
way i'll give you guys my first tip on
my<00:02:03.030> first<00:02:03.240> tip<00:02:03.420> would<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.840> control<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
my first tip would be to control a

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.709 
my first tip would be to control a
high-traffic<00:02:04.920> area<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> map<00:02:06.149> where

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
high-traffic area of the map where

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.540 
high-traffic area of the map where
you're<00:02:06.930> able<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.350> control<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.190> your

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you're able to control your get your

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.320 
you're able to control your get your
engagement<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.679> means

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
engagement so that means

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.840 
engagement so that means
right<00:02:12.170> here<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.650> see<00:02:12.890> me<00:02:13.070> I'm<00:02:13.340> controlling

right here you see me I'm controlling

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.330 
right here you see me I'm controlling
this<00:02:14.180> area<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.840> map<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.440> top<00:02:15.770> part<00:02:16.130> of

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
this area of the map so this top part of

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.450 
this area of the map so this top part of
the<00:02:16.430> map<00:02:17.030> I'm<00:02:17.270> controlling<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.080> I'm<00:02:18.460> staying

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
spot on a map where the equipment's like

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.860 
spot on a map where the equipment's like
let's<00:02:51.890> say<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.160> box<00:02:52.670> where<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.000> objects<00:02:53.540> on<00:02:53.750> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
let's say a box where the objects on the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.949 
let's say a box where the objects on the
map<00:02:54.080> are<00:02:54.850> or<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:56.120> can<00:02:56.270> use<00:02:56.300> them<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.840> your

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
map are or you can use them to your

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.290 
map are or you can use them to your
advantage<00:02:57.020> and<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.430> would<00:02:58.550> really<00:02:58.790> help<00:02:59.090> you

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
advantage and that would really help you

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.480 
advantage and that would really help you
out<00:02:59.420> because<00:02:59.660> right<00:03:00.080> now<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.920> enemy<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.280> when

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
out because right now the enemy is when

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.610 
out because right now the enemy is when
they<00:03:01.610> come<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.060> they<00:03:02.360> only<00:03:02.510> see<00:03:02.780> my<00:03:02.930> head<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.410> I

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
they come in they only see my head and I

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.370 
they come in they only see my head and I
have<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:03.980> advantage<00:03:04.550> on<00:03:04.730> them<00:03:05.450> because<00:03:05.959> they

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
have the advantage on them because they

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.350 
have the advantage on them because they
only<00:03:06.650> see<00:03:06.920> my<00:03:07.040> head<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.580> can<00:03:07.790> see<00:03:07.970> their

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
only see my head and I can see their

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.050 
only see my head and I can see their
whole<00:03:08.570> bodies<00:03:09.110> so<00:03:09.950> with<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.520> out<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:10.970> way

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
whole bodies so with that out of the way

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.350 
whole bodies so with that out of the way
um<00:03:11.390> let's<00:03:12.350> continue<00:03:12.740> on<00:03:13.010> with<00:03:13.280> my<00:03:13.520> first<00:03:13.820> trick

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
um let's continue on with my first trick

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.280 
um let's continue on with my first trick
so<00:03:15.110> oh<00:03:15.620> no<00:03:16.580> sorry<00:03:16.850> my<00:03:17.000> first<00:03:17.239> trick<00:03:17.420> was<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.840> use

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
so oh no sorry my first trick was to use

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.340 
so oh no sorry my first trick was to use
the<00:03:18.590> equipment's<00:03:19.550> on<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.940> map<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.870> after<00:03:21.200> that

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
the equipment's on the map so after that

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.180 
the equipment's on the map so after that
um<00:03:22.190> my<00:03:22.940> first<00:03:23.180> tip<00:03:23.440> was<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.709> control<00:03:25.160> a

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
um my first tip was to control a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.729 
um my first tip was to control a
high-traffic<00:03:25.430> area<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.330> that's<00:03:27.200> out<00:03:27.500> of<00:03:27.530> the

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
high-traffic area and that's out of the

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.790 
high-traffic area and that's out of the
way<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:28.130> let's<00:03:29.030> moving<00:03:29.450> on<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:29.959> second<00:03:30.620> tip

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
way so let's moving on to the second tip

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.430 
way so let's moving on to the second tip
I<00:03:31.010> don't<00:03:31.519> rush<00:03:32.090> out<00:03:32.330> in<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:32.750> middle<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.290> the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
I don't rush out in the middle of the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.070 
I don't rush out in the middle of the
map<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:34.310> guy's<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.360> worst<00:03:35.660> thing<00:03:35.870> you

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
map that guy's is the worst thing you

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.600 
map that guy's is the worst thing you
can<00:03:36.230> do<00:03:36.410> especially<00:03:36.560> when<00:03:37.130> you're<00:03:37.250> going<00:03:37.459> for

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
can do especially when you're going for

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.580 
can do especially when you're going for
those<00:03:37.730> high<00:03:37.940> killstreaks<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:39.110> let's<00:03:39.470> say

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
those high killstreaks so let's say

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.740 
those high killstreaks so let's say
you're<00:03:40.160> on<00:03:40.250> a<00:03:40.280> 20<00:03:40.850> kill<00:03:41.030> streak<00:03:41.269> and<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.570> just

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
you're on a 20 kill streak and you just

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.690
