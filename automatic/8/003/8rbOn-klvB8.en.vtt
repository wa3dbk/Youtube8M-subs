00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.850 
force but don't forget to dodge there
will<00:03:29.209> be<00:03:29.239> times<00:03:29.570> when<00:03:29.720> an<00:03:29.959> attack<00:03:30.320> goes<00:03:30.560> wrong

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
will be times when an attack goes wrong

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.340 
will be times when an attack goes wrong

you to escape and this is where rolling

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.810 
you to escape and this is where rolling
becomes<00:03:35.630> key<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:36.830> can<00:03:37.070> move<00:03:37.280> away<00:03:37.459> from

to<00:04:24.110> this<00:04:24.259> video<00:04:24.669> obviously<00:04:25.669> the<00:04:25.909> vampires<00:04:26.360> are

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
to this video obviously the vampires are

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.270 
to this video obviously the vampires are
a<00:04:26.720> little<00:04:26.870> more<00:04:27.110> complex<00:04:27.440> due<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:27.979> nature

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
a little more complex due to the nature

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.830 
a little more complex due to the nature

of their classes being individually

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.390 
of their classes being individually
unique<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:30.620> it's<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.860> case<00:04:31.069> of<00:04:31.099> getting

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400
