00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
you do is there are four different

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.200 
you do is there are four different
categories<00:01:13.020> there's<00:01:13.640> four<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:14.970> five

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
categories there's four or five

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.850 
categories there's four or five
different<00:01:15.390> categories<00:01:16.290> I'm<00:01:16.409> sorry<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
different categories I'm sorry and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.410 
different categories I'm sorry and
there's<00:01:17.220> five<00:01:17.460> different<00:01:17.490> difficulties

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
there's five different difficulties

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
there's five different difficulties
letters<00:01:18.930> being<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.260> easiest<00:01:19.710> other<00:01:20.220> shapes

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
letters being the easiest other shapes

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060 
letters being the easiest other shapes
harder<00:01:21.060> shapes<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.510> hardest<00:01:21.840> shapes<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.260> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
harder shapes the hardest shapes and the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.670 
harder shapes the hardest shapes and the
most<00:01:23.700> difficult<00:01:24.180> shapes<00:01:24.420> okay<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.260> you<00:01:25.409> start

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
most difficult shapes okay so you start

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.140 
most difficult shapes okay so you start
with<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.979> I've<00:01:26.280> gotten<00:01:26.580> pretty<00:01:26.610> far<00:01:26.850> but

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
with this I've gotten pretty far but

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.370 
with this I've gotten pretty far but
we're<00:01:27.299> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> start<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> basics<00:01:28.229> again

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
we're going to start the basics again

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.590 
we're going to start the basics again
you<00:01:29.159> select<00:01:29.550> your<00:01:29.730> drawing<00:01:30.000> okay<00:01:30.330> it's<00:01:30.510> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you select your drawing okay it's a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.750 
you select your drawing okay it's a
drawing<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.770> you're<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.550> you

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
drawing and what you're to do is you

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.210 
drawing and what you're to do is you
havin<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.060> lot<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.270> time<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.440> six<00:01:34.830> pins

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
havin a lot of time but I have six pins

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.030 
havin a lot of time but I have six pins
I'm<00:01:35.520> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> drop<00:01:35.940> on<00:01:36.150> there<00:01:36.330> drop<00:01:36.690> on<00:01:36.900> there

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.390 

45<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.460> then<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:42.810> oh<00:01:43.220> okay<00:01:44.220> well

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
45 and then I don't really oh okay well

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.010 
45 and then I don't really oh okay well
I<00:01:44.430> guess<00:01:44.670> that's<00:01:44.880> where<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.120> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.330> be<00:01:45.420> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
I guess that's where it's going to be so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.070 
I guess that's where it's going to be so
now<00:01:46.260> I<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.830> redraw<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> shape<00:01:47.970> by<00:01:48.720> using

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
now I have to redraw the shape by using

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.910 
now I have to redraw the shape by using
the<00:01:49.410> pins<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.040> i<00:01:50.100> use<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> point<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:52.200> shape<00:01:52.560> i

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the pins that i use to point the shape i

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.940 
the pins that i use to point the shape i
can<00:01:53.850> now<00:01:54.030> draw<00:01:55.310> redraw<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.790> letter<00:01:57.680> using<00:01:58.680> my

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
can now draw redraw the letter using my

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.730 
can now draw redraw the letter using my
pins<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.580> then<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.090> try<00:02:01.050> and<00:02:01.110> see<00:02:01.380> how<00:02:01.500> accurate

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
pins so then I try and see how accurate

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.580 
pins so then I try and see how accurate
i<00:02:02.100> was<00:02:02.310> i<00:02:02.610> was<00:02:03.420> only<00:02:03.720> forty-three<00:02:04.440> percent

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
i was i was only forty-three percent

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.160 
i was i was only forty-three percent
accurate<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.400> retry<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.840> keep<00:02:06.990> going

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
accurate so I retry and you keep going

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:15.440 
accurate so I retry and you keep going
at<00:02:07.440> this<00:02:07.470> until<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.519> succeed<00:02:09.000> further<00:02:14.450> that's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
at this until you succeed further that's

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
at this until you succeed further that's
bad<00:02:15.720> um<00:02:16.700> okay<00:02:17.700> their<00:02:17.849> view<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.629> we<00:02:19.110> try<00:02:19.319> one

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
bad um okay their view so we try one

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.860 
bad um okay their view so we try one
more<00:02:19.620> time<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.730> have<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.209> above<00:02:21.450> fifty

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
more time you have to get above fifty

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.140 
more time you have to get above fifty
percent<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.440> accede<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.190> next<00:02:23.459> level<00:02:23.790> this

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
there we go that one was eighty-two

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.700 
there we go that one was eighty-two
percent<00:02:47.760> accuracy<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.750> i<00:02:48.810> accede<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.440> next

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
percent accuracy so i accede to the next

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.440 
percent accuracy so i accede to the next
level<00:02:50.040> now<00:02:50.550> there<00:02:50.730> are<00:02:50.760> several<00:02:51.150> levels

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
level now there are several levels

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.440 
level now there are several levels
there's<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.960> whole<00:02:52.140> alphabet<00:02:53.360> there<00:02:54.360> are

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
there's the whole alphabet there are

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.110 
there's the whole alphabet there are
several<00:02:54.690> shapes<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.470> mean<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.310> fruit<00:02:56.820> and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
several shapes I mean this is fruit and

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.370 
one was kind of tricky but there's
different<00:03:09.150> pins<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:09.750> different<00:03:10.080> amounts<00:03:10.140> of

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
different pins for different amounts of

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.410 
different pins for different amounts of
things<00:03:10.710> when<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.370> get<00:03:11.490> harder<00:03:11.970> down<00:03:12.150> here

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
of accuracy so excited to the next level
