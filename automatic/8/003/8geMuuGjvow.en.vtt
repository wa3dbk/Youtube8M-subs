right teeny little video on urea for
motion<00:00:07.840> it's<00:00:08.840> pretty<00:00:09.110> straightforward<00:00:09.380> this

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
motion it's pretty straightforward this

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.380 
motion it's pretty straightforward this
if<00:00:09.920> you<00:00:10.010> want<00:00:10.160> to<00:00:10.280> look<00:00:10.580> into<00:00:10.910> it<00:00:11.030> in<00:00:11.090> any<00:00:11.210> kind

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:11.390 
if you want to look into it in any kind

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.530 
if you want to look into it in any kind
of<00:00:11.480> depth<00:00:11.780> you<00:00:12.050> know<00:00:12.830> be<00:00:13.070> my<00:00:13.220> guest<00:00:13.490> but<00:00:13.700> I'm

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
of depth you know be my guest but I'm

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.940 
of depth you know be my guest but I'm
going<00:00:14.690> to<00:00:14.720> keep<00:00:14.870> it<00:00:15.050> fairly<00:00:15.290> straightforward

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
going to keep it fairly straightforward

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.410 
going to keep it fairly straightforward
and<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.279> kind<00:00:16.490> of<00:00:16.580> things<00:00:16.760> that<00:00:16.850> you<00:00:16.970> need<00:00:17.210> on

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
and the kind of things that you need on

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.980 
and the kind of things that you need on
the<00:00:18.170> exam<00:00:18.850> so<00:00:21.699> it<00:00:22.699> all<00:00:22.880> link<00:00:23.119> back<00:00:23.360> to<00:00:23.390> proteins

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
the exam so it all link back to proteins

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.130 
the exam so it all link back to proteins
which<00:00:24.920> as<00:00:25.160> we<00:00:25.279> know<00:00:25.460> are<00:00:25.699> polymer<00:00:26.539> of<00:00:26.690> amino

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
which as we know are polymer of amino

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.019 
which as we know are polymer of amino
acids<00:00:29.440> depending<00:00:30.440> on<00:00:30.560> your<00:00:31.190> body<00:00:31.369> size<00:00:31.670> is<00:00:32.000> a

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
acids depending on your body size is a

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.330 
acids depending on your body size is a
rough<00:00:32.300> guide<00:00:32.570> how<00:00:33.440> about<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:33.920> weigh<00:00:34.160> in

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
rough guide how about you weigh in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.169 
rough guide how about you weigh in
kilograms<00:00:36.159> you<00:00:37.159> probably<00:00:37.519> need<00:00:37.670> about<00:00:37.729> half

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:38.179 
kilograms you probably need about half

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.899 
kilograms you probably need about half
of<00:00:38.420> that<00:00:38.479> maybe<00:00:39.350> per<00:00:39.679> day<00:00:39.979> in<00:00:40.280> grams<00:00:40.729> of

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
of that maybe per day in grams of

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.840 
of that maybe per day in grams of
protein<00:00:41.329> so<00:00:41.359> and<00:00:41.960> now<00:00:42.589> somebody<00:00:42.979> weighs<00:00:43.219> 90

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
protein so and now somebody weighs 90

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.209 
protein so and now somebody weighs 90
kilograms<00:00:44.329> are<00:00:44.539> probably<00:00:44.780> about<00:00:45.109> 45<00:00:45.649> grams<00:00:46.069> of

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
kilograms are probably about 45 grams of

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.450 
kilograms are probably about 45 grams of
protein<00:00:46.609> they<00:00:46.819> very<00:00:47.299> roughly<00:00:47.809> speaking

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
protein they very roughly speaking

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.169 
protein they very roughly speaking
assuming<00:00:49.460> that<00:00:49.549> you're<00:00:49.639> not<00:00:49.729> doing<00:00:49.850> is<00:00:49.999> like

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
assuming that you're not doing is like

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.569 
assuming that you're not doing is like
bodybuilding<00:00:50.899> or<00:00:50.960> something<00:00:51.319> now<00:00:51.499> which<00:00:52.399> is

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
bodybuilding or something now which is

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.819 
bodybuilding or something now which is
obviously<00:00:52.879> you<00:00:52.969> need<00:00:53.089> quite<00:00:53.389> a<00:00:53.420> bit<00:00:53.539> more<00:00:53.829> but

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
obviously you need quite a bit more but

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.250 
obviously you need quite a bit more but
the<00:00:55.579> value<00:00:55.819> given<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.179> Bacchus<00:00:56.539> is<00:00:56.719> between

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
the value given the Bacchus is between

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.419 
the value given the Bacchus is between
40<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.769> 60<00:00:58.249> grams<00:00:58.280> per<00:00:58.819> day<00:00:59.059> depending<00:00:59.600> on<00:00:59.659> the

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
40 to 60 grams per day depending on the

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.039 
40 to 60 grams per day depending on the
individual<00:01:01.429> the<00:01:02.149> problem<00:01:02.539> with<00:01:02.659> this<00:01:02.780> is<00:01:03.019> that

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
individual the problem with this is that

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.980 
individual the problem with this is that
if<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.070> take<00:01:04.309> more<00:01:04.580> than<00:01:04.640> this<00:01:04.940> thing<00:01:05.119> we

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
if you take more than this thing we

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.140 
if you take more than this thing we
can't<00:01:06.229> actually<00:01:06.409> store<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.370> any<00:01:07.760> excess

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
can't actually store it so any excess

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.580 
can't actually store it so any excess
amino<00:01:08.390> acids<00:01:08.870> that<00:01:09.050> come<00:01:09.230> from<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.410> break

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
amino acids that come from the break

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.130 
amino acids that come from the break
down<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.800> protein<00:01:10.190> we<00:01:10.280> can't<00:01:10.520> store<00:01:10.820> and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
down the protein we can't store and

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.510 
down the protein we can't store and
amino<00:01:12.140> acid<00:01:13.240> then<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:14.330> just<00:01:14.510> dry<00:01:15.250> as<00:01:16.250> our

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
amino acid then you just dry as our

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.490 
amino acid then you just dry as our
amine<00:01:16.970> group<00:01:17.440> is<00:01:18.440> our<00:01:18.590> carboxyl<00:01:19.430> group<00:01:19.730> and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
amine group is our carboxyl group and

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.990 
amine group is our carboxyl group and
then<00:01:21.500> impossible<00:01:21.920> but<00:01:22.010> later<00:01:22.220> functional<00:01:22.850> our

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
then impossible but later functional our

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.060 
then impossible but later functional our
group<00:01:23.300> there's<00:01:23.510> a<00:01:23.630> basic<00:01:24.020> amino<00:01:24.230> acid<00:01:24.620> this

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
group there's a basic amino acid this

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.850 
group there's a basic amino acid this
aiming<00:01:25.670> group<00:01:25.910> here<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:27.140> turns<00:01:27.350> out<00:01:27.590> is

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
aiming group here it turns out is

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.550 
aiming group here it turns out is
actually<00:01:28.220> quite<00:01:28.550> toxic<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.110> so<00:01:30.110> we<00:01:30.230> don't

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
actually quite toxic and so we don't

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.160 
actually quite toxic and so we don't
want<00:01:30.830> this<00:01:31.330> floating<00:01:32.330> around<00:01:32.420> in<00:01:32.630> our<00:01:32.720> body<00:01:32.960> or

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
want this floating around in our body or

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.560 
want this floating around in our body or
around<00:01:33.260> our<00:01:33.760> fluids<00:01:34.760> so<00:01:35.330> it's<00:01:35.450> all<00:01:35.540> about

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
around our fluids so it's all about

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.620 
around our fluids so it's all about
getting<00:01:35.750> rid<00:01:36.170> of<00:01:36.200> this<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.850> what<00:01:38.270> your<00:01:38.480> your

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
getting rid of this so what your your

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.370 
getting rid of this so what your your
rear<00:01:38.870> is<00:01:39.110> really<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:42.070> removal<00:01:43.070> of

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
rear is really is the removal of

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.430 
rear is really is the removal of
nitrogenous<00:01:46.090> material<00:01:47.090> this<00:01:47.690> amine<00:01:48.200> group

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
nitrogenous material this amine group

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.870 
nitrogenous material this amine group
from<00:01:48.680> broken-down<00:01:49.630> amino<00:01:50.630> acids<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:52.220> this<00:01:52.670> is

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
from broken-down amino acids so this is

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.500 
from broken-down amino acids so this is
going<00:01:53.120> to<00:01:53.180> occur<00:01:53.510> in<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.380> liver<00:01:55.180> that<00:01:56.180> first

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
going to occur in the liver that first

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.390 
going to occur in the liver that first
ml<00:01:56.900> is<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.320> amination

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
ml is the amination

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.200 
ml is the amination
which<00:01:59.120> really<00:01:59.450> means<00:01:59.890> removing<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.520> Amigo

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
which really means removing the Amigo

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.370 
which really means removing the Amigo
how's<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.260> done

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
how's it done

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.249 
how's it done
if<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:04.740> take<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.509> amino<00:02:06.509> acid<00:02:06.900> there<00:02:07.080> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
if we take that amino acid there and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.309 
if we take that amino acid there and
it's<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.530> see<00:02:07.799> there's<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.250> HCG<00:02:08.970> which<00:02:12.319> it

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
it's you see there's a HCG which it

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.610 
it's you see there's a HCG which it
takes<00:02:13.560> an<00:02:13.680> oxygen<00:02:14.450> oxidize<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.470> is

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
takes an oxygen oxidize this it is

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.380 
takes an oxygen oxidize this it is
converted<00:02:17.340> into<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:20.400> there's<00:02:20.580> I'll<00:02:20.760> see<00:02:21.090> still

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
converted into so there's I'll see still

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.790 
converted into so there's I'll see still
we've<00:02:21.569> broken<00:02:21.840> off<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.230> air<00:02:22.350> mean<00:02:22.560> group

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
we've broken off the air mean group

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.170 
we've broken off the air mean group
we've<00:02:22.950> got<00:02:23.100> rid<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.310> we've<00:02:23.670> still<00:02:23.970> got

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
we've got rid of that we've still got

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.090 
we've got rid of that we've still got
the<00:02:24.300> R<00:02:24.630> group<00:02:24.739> sitting<00:02:25.739> on<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> top<00:02:28.100> we're

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
the R group sitting on the top we're

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.360 
the R group sitting on the top we're
going<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> add<00:02:29.370> an<00:02:29.489> oxygen<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:30.270> here<00:02:34.370> colors

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
going to add an oxygen on here colors

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.710 
going to add an oxygen on here colors
room<00:02:37.100> we've<00:02:38.100> still<00:02:38.400> got<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.030> carboxyl

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
room we've still got the the carboxyl

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.320 
room we've still got the the carboxyl
group<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.080> there

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
group on there

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.050 
group on there
no<00:02:43.330> we've<00:02:43.510> got<00:02:44.070> nh3<00:02:45.070> know<00:02:45.610> if<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:45.940> actually

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
no we've got nh3 know if you actually

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.560 
no we've got nh3 know if you actually
have<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.720> up<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.180> numbers<00:02:49.480> don't

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
have this up the the the numbers don't

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.850 
have this up the the the numbers don't
quite<00:02:49.840> work<00:02:49.990> out<00:02:50.230> because<00:02:50.380> I've<00:02:50.530> only<00:02:50.590> got<00:02:50.830> one

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
quite work out because I've only got one

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.590 
quite work out because I've only got one
option<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.430> yet<00:02:51.640> we've<00:02:51.760> got<00:02:51.910> two<00:02:52.090> options<00:02:52.420> in

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
option and yet we've got two options in

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.300 
option and yet we've got two options in
so<00:02:53.110> really<00:02:53.500> what<00:02:53.650> we<00:02:53.800> should<00:02:53.980> do<00:02:54.190> is<00:02:56.310> that

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
so really what we should do is that

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.280 
so really what we should do is that
should<00:02:57.550> be<00:02:57.700> two<00:02:58.000> lots<00:02:58.300> of<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.690> plus<00:02:59.080> one

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
should be two lots of that plus one

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.230 
should be two lots of that plus one
oxygen<00:02:59.530> molecule<00:02:59.620> okay<00:03:00.400> in<00:03:00.700> your<00:03:00.820> books<00:03:01.060> it

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
oxygen molecule okay in your books it

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.820 
oxygen molecule okay in your books it
doesn't<00:03:01.510> balance<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.410> equation<00:03:02.770> it

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
doesn't balance that the equation it

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.960 
doesn't balance that the equation it
doesn't<00:03:03.040> matter<00:03:03.160> too<00:03:03.400> much<00:03:03.430> someone's<00:03:03.850> going

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
doesn't matter too much someone's going

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.370 
doesn't matter too much someone's going
to<00:03:04.000> panic<00:03:04.300> about<00:03:04.360> that<00:03:04.630> but<00:03:05.080> just<00:03:05.230> in<00:03:05.350> case

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
to panic about that but just in case

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.870 
to panic about that but just in case
you're<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.890> kind<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.190> person<00:03:06.250> who<00:03:06.550> sits<00:03:06.790> there

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
you're the kind of person who sits there

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.430 
you're the kind of person who sits there
and<00:03:07.000> says<00:03:07.210> where's<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.570> extra<00:03:07.810> oxygen<00:03:07.990> gone

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
and says where's the extra oxygen gone

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.970 
and says where's the extra oxygen gone
well<00:03:09.130> we<00:03:09.610> just<00:03:09.730> have<00:03:09.940> two<00:03:10.210> amino<00:03:10.450> acids<00:03:10.950> okay

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
well we just have two amino acids okay

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.970 
well we just have two amino acids okay
so<00:03:12.970> we<00:03:13.120> end<00:03:13.300> up<00:03:13.450> with<00:03:13.660> course<00:03:16.350> see<00:03:17.350> what<00:03:17.560> so<00:03:18.900> but

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
so we end up with course see what so but

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.000 
so we end up with course see what so but
okay<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:22.080> should<00:03:23.080> do<00:03:23.230> another<00:03:23.470> addition<00:03:23.860> sir

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
okay I should do another addition sir

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.110 
okay I should do another addition sir
nothing<00:03:24.880> else<00:03:25.120> about<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.820> we've<00:03:27.940> removed

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
nothing else about it so we've removed

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.810 
nothing else about it so we've removed
it<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.690> here<00:03:29.020> is<00:03:29.200> called<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.590> keto<00:03:30.100> acid<00:03:30.820> and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
it this here is called a keto acid and

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.580 
it this here is called a keto acid and
lots<00:03:33.820> of<00:03:34.060> hydrogen<00:03:34.720> still<00:03:35.200> knocking<00:03:35.500> around

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
lots of hydrogen still knocking around

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.010 
lots of hydrogen still knocking around
in<00:03:35.860> here<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.820> could<00:03:37.000> be<00:03:37.090> fed<00:03:37.360> into<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
in here this could be fed into a

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.060 
in here this could be fed into a
respiratory<00:03:38.860> process<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.970> use<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.900> as<00:03:41.020> a

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
respiratory process and use it as a

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.530 
respiratory process and use it as a
respiratory<00:03:42.070> substrate<00:03:42.700> so<00:03:42.880> we<00:03:42.940> can<00:03:43.090> get<00:03:43.270> them

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
respiratory substrate so we can get them

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.020 
respiratory substrate so we can get them
release<00:03:44.080> energy<00:03:44.230> from<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.670> key<00:03:45.850> bit

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
release energy from that but the key bit

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.190 
release energy from that but the key bit
here<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:46.330> we've<00:03:46.510> now<00:03:47.019> removed<00:03:47.260> this<00:03:49.200> ammonia

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
here is we've now removed this ammonia

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.220 
here is we've now removed this ammonia
okay<00:03:51.190> now<00:03:52.470> ammonia<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:54.360> very<00:03:55.360> soluble<00:03:55.750> and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
okay now ammonia is very soluble and

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.440 
okay now ammonia is very soluble and
it's<00:03:56.350> also<00:03:56.530> very<00:03:56.830> very<00:03:57.130> toxic<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:58.150> it's<00:03:58.269> not

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
it's also very very toxic so it's not

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.120 
it's also very very toxic so it's not
the<00:03:58.630> good<00:03:58.810> thing<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.200> have<00:03:59.380> floating<00:04:00.100> around

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
the good thing to have floating around

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.410 
the good thing to have floating around
and<00:04:00.630> cook<00:04:01.630> so<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.980> next<00:04:03.250> step<00:04:03.550> to<00:04:03.760> come<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.150> is

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
and cook so the next step to come to is

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.330 
and cook so the next step to come to is
the<00:04:04.720> ala<00:04:05.380> theme<00:04:05.769> cycle

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
the ala theme cycle

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.059 
the ala theme cycle
this<00:04:07.850> was<00:04:08.000> actually<00:04:08.180> discovered<00:04:08.780> by<00:04:09.069> probe

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
this was actually discovered by probe

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.850 
this was actually discovered by probe
transcripts<00:04:10.670> with<00:04:11.270> caution<00:04:11.690> of<00:04:11.900> Krebs<00:04:12.500> cycle

transcripts with caution of Krebs cycle

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.860 
transcripts with caution of Krebs cycle
yes<00:04:13.370> describe<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:13.940> one<00:04:14.090> first<00:04:14.360> this<00:04:14.569> was<00:04:14.750> his

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
yes describe this one first this was his

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.479 
yes describe this one first this was his
first<00:04:15.080> noticed

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
first noticed

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.640 
first noticed
what<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.389> only<00:04:18.539> thing<00:04:18.630> cycle<00:04:19.169> does<00:04:19.319> is<00:04:19.530> it

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
what the only thing cycle does is it

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.279 
what the only thing cycle does is it
converts<00:04:19.859> our<00:04:20.459> ammonia<00:04:21.209> into<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:22.340> safer<00:04:23.340> form

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
converts our ammonia into a safer form

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.990 
converts our ammonia into a safer form
so<00:04:25.289> it's<00:04:25.620> going<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:25.919> convert<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.550> we've<00:04:26.849> got

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
so it's going to convert and we've got

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.580 
so it's going to convert and we've got
to<00:04:27.300> lots<00:04:27.539> of<00:04:29.120> ammonia<00:04:30.120> from<00:04:30.419> our<00:04:30.810> originally

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
to lots of ammonia from our originally

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.029 
to lots of ammonia from our originally
emanation<00:04:32.039> and<00:04:33.440> again<00:04:34.440> it's<00:04:34.650> one<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.919> these

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
emanation and again it's one of these

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.110 
emanation and again it's one of these
things<00:04:35.340> where<00:04:35.550> the<00:04:35.669> actual<00:04:35.759> reaction<00:04:36.479> is<00:04:36.690> a

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
things where the actual reaction is a

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.159 
things where the actual reaction is a
lot<00:04:39.120> more<00:04:39.240> complicated<00:04:39.630> than<00:04:39.930> what<00:04:40.020> we're

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
lot more complicated than what we're

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.629 
lot more complicated than what we're
showing<00:04:40.319> but<00:04:40.590> this<00:04:40.740> is<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.979> summary<00:04:41.310> of<00:04:41.400> it

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
showing but this is the summary of it

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.249 
showing but this is the summary of it
so<00:04:42.030> our<00:04:42.360> soluble<00:04:42.840> ammonia<00:04:44.840> plus<00:04:45.840> carbon

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
so our soluble ammonia plus carbon

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
you look at it structurally what you

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.620 
you look at it structurally what you
have<00:04:57.930> is

citrulline<00:06:04.650> arginine<00:06:05.650> I've<00:06:06.580> tried<00:06:06.819> to<00:06:06.909> think

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
citrulline arginine I've tried to think

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.540 
citrulline arginine I've tried to think
of<00:06:07.240> some<00:06:08.169> gallon<00:06:08.409> mnemonic<00:06:08.830> for<00:06:08.860> these<00:06:09.190> and<00:06:09.520> I

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
of some gallon mnemonic for these and I

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.450 
of some gallon mnemonic for these and I
think<00:06:09.789> of<00:06:09.909> citrus<00:06:10.389> and<00:06:10.539> Argentina<00:06:11.110> and<00:06:11.460> bird

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
think of citrus and Argentina and bird

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.420 
think of citrus and Argentina and bird
watching<00:06:12.759> unfold<00:06:14.650> in<00:06:15.099> particularly

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
good easy wedge remember it's OC a come

good easy wedge remember it's OC a come
up<00:06:18.280> with<00:06:18.430> your<00:06:18.550> own<00:06:18.580> mnemonic<00:06:19.060> for<00:06:19.090> is<00:06:19.330> right

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
up with your own mnemonic for is right

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.330 
up with your own mnemonic for is right
so<00:06:22.120> this<00:06:22.780> is<00:06:22.840> what's<00:06:23.169> happening<00:06:23.560> again<00:06:24.129> it's<00:06:24.280> a

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
so this is what's happening again it's a

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.459 
so this is what's happening again it's a
bit<00:06:24.550> like<00:06:24.729> Krebs<00:06:25.150> cycle<00:06:25.240> you<00:06:26.020> put<00:06:26.289> these

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
bit like Krebs cycle you put these

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.959 
bit like Krebs cycle you put these
chemicals<00:06:26.770> in<00:06:27.250> what's<00:06:27.520> really<00:06:27.759> happening<00:06:28.180> is

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:29.969 
chemicals in what's really happening is

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.029 
chemicals in what's really happening is
molecules<00:06:30.969> are<00:06:31.780> being<00:06:32.080> added<00:06:32.319> to<00:06:32.620> these<00:06:32.770> and

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
molecules are being added to these and

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.219 
molecules are being added to these and
take<00:06:33.250> it<00:06:33.400> off<00:06:33.490> and<00:06:33.669> this<00:06:34.180> is<00:06:34.389> just<00:06:34.629> a<00:06:34.750> summary

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
take it off and this is just a summary

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.589 
take it off and this is just a summary
of<00:06:35.440> what's<00:06:35.650> going<00:06:35.919> on<00:06:36.009> but<00:06:36.129> it's<00:06:36.370> this<00:06:37.300> is<00:06:37.479> all

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
of what's going on but it's this is all

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.589 
of what's going on but it's this is all
we<00:06:37.719> need<00:06:37.840> to<00:06:37.960> the<00:06:38.080> file<00:06:38.319> for<00:06:38.620> your<00:06:38.710> exam<00:06:39.300> so<00:06:40.300> we

we need to the file for your exam so we

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:47.490 
we need to the file for your exam so we

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.390 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:34.340 

urea<00:07:28.390> coming<00:07:28.750> up

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.350 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.290 

okay

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 
okay

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.050 
okay
so<00:07:36.930> if<00:07:37.410> you<00:07:37.590> remember<00:07:37.830> all<00:07:38.730> the<00:07:39.000> things

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
so if you remember all the things

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.130 
so if you remember all the things
citrulline<00:07:39.570> arginine<00:07:40.110> and<00:07:40.340> then<00:07:41.340> think

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.140 
citrulline arginine and then think

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.960 
citrulline arginine and then think
ammonia<00:07:43.140> goes<00:07:43.350> in<00:07:43.530> the<00:07:43.650> first<00:07:43.860> two<00:07:44.190> water

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970 
ammonia goes in the first two water

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.810 
ammonia goes in the first two water
comes<00:07:45.270> out<00:07:45.390> the<00:07:45.450> first<00:07:45.780> two<00:07:46.430> carbon<00:07:47.430> dioxide

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:47.820 
comes out the first two carbon dioxide

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.940 
comes out the first two carbon dioxide
goes<00:07:48.060> in<00:07:48.180> on<00:07:48.270> the<00:07:48.360> first<00:07:48.600> one<00:07:48.840> and<00:07:49.440> water<00:07:49.710> goes

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:49.950 
goes in on the first one and water goes

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.020 
goes in on the first one and water goes
in<00:07:50.220> on<00:07:50.340> the<00:07:50.430> last<00:07:50.610> one

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.030 
in on the last one

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.530 
in on the last one
after<00:07:51.390> some<00:07:51.510> summaries<00:07:51.930> it<00:07:52.350> there's<00:07:52.530> no<00:07:52.770> quite

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:53.540 
after some summaries it there's no quite

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.790 
after some summaries it there's no quite
there's<00:07:54.540> no<00:07:54.660> simple<00:07:55.110> method<00:07:55.440> on<00:07:55.530> my<00:07:55.590> throat

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 
there's no simple method on my throat

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.250 
there's no simple method on my throat
remember<00:07:56.160> and<00:07:56.250> it's<00:07:56.340> just<00:07:56.490> one<00:07:56.670> you<00:07:56.820> have<00:07:57.060> to

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:57.260 
remember and it's just one you have to

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.650 
remember and it's just one you have to
grasp<00:07:58.260> through
