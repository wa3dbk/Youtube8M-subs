00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
I left one bundle which this is the 22

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.010 
I left one bundle which this is the 22
inside<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.760> packaging<00:02:39.300> just<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.870> you

knew me and nicely put together so this
is<00:02:50.550> my<00:02:51.110> 22<00:02:54.290> comes<00:02:55.290> out<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.190> bundle

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
is my 22 comes out like that a bundle

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.250 
is my 22 comes out like that a bundle
sperm<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.030> tie<00:02:57.209> together<00:02:57.450> with<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:57.959> rubber

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
sperm to tie together with this rubber

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.430 
sperm to tie together with this rubber
band<00:02:58.590> all<00:02:58.920> three<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.400> them<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.540> i<00:03:00.720> skip<00:03:01.140> down<00:03:01.380> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
band all three of them so i skip down to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.330 
band all three of them so i skip down to
my<00:03:01.830> 24<00:03:02.700> inch<00:03:03.000> why<00:03:03.570> because<00:03:04.080> i<00:03:04.110> want<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.920> compare

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
my 24 inch why because i want to compare

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.880 
my 24 inch why because i want to compare
the<00:03:05.370> 20<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.180> 24<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.380> can<00:03:07.590> see<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
the 20 and the 24 so you can see the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.830 
the 20 and the 24 so you can see the
difference<00:03:08.310> one<00:03:08.850> thing<00:03:09.000> i<00:03:09.120> will<00:03:09.180> say<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.660> that

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
difference one thing i will say is that

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.990 
difference one thing i will say is that
as<00:03:09.989> we<00:03:10.440> went<00:03:10.680> up<00:03:10.800> in<00:03:10.980> bundles<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.700> bundle

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
as we went up in bundles this bundle

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.060 
as we went up in bundles this bundle
does<00:03:12.330> look<00:03:12.570> away<00:03:12.900> dinner<00:03:13.260> compared<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
does look away dinner compared to the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.390 
does look away dinner compared to the
last<00:03:14.250> one<00:03:15.079> but<00:03:16.079> otherwise<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.950> bundle<00:03:17.250> is

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
last one but otherwise the bundle is

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.229 
last one but otherwise the bundle is
still<00:03:17.820> really<00:03:18.209> soft<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:19.500> really<00:03:20.400> really

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
still really soft it is really really

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.300 
still really soft it is really really
long<00:03:21.450> um<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:24.450> hair<00:03:24.690> still<00:03:25.160> even<00:03:26.160> as

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
long um but the the hair still even as

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.400 
long um but the the hair still even as
you<00:03:26.489> went<00:03:26.670> up<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:26.910> bundles<00:03:27.209> has<00:03:27.510> has<00:03:27.959> great

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
you went up in bundles has has great

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.280 
you went up in bundles has has great
luster<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:30.140> texture<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.980> really

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
luster and texture to it it's really

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.979 
luster and texture to it it's really
nice<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:35.100> comparing<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.120> two<00:03:36.329> bundles<00:03:36.750> there

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
nice so comparing the two bundles there

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.910 
nice so comparing the two bundles there
is<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.590> clear<00:03:38.630> 4<00:03:39.630> inch<00:03:39.900> difference<00:03:40.260> at<00:03:40.709> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
is a clear 4 inch difference at the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.350 
is a clear 4 inch difference at the
bottom<00:03:41.280> if<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.700> can<00:03:42.060> see<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:44.670> the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
bottom if you can see that and the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.140 
bottom if you can see that and the
texture<00:03:45.900> issues<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:46.739> pretty<00:03:47.610> now<00:03:47.910> i<00:03:47.940> do

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
texture issues so pretty now i do

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.550 
texture issues so pretty now i do
believe<00:03:48.450> i'm<00:03:48.690> going<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.870> bleach<00:03:49.079> this<00:03:49.320> hair

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
believe i'm going to bleach this hair

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.910 
believe i'm going to bleach this hair
which<00:03:49.890> will<00:03:50.459> probably<00:03:50.700> mess<00:03:51.030> up<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.390> texture

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
which will probably mess up the texture

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.090 
which will probably mess up the texture
just<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:53.100> little<00:03:53.370> bit<00:03:53.610> maybe<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.180> lot<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:55.100> so

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
just a little bit maybe a lot but so

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.020 
just a little bit maybe a lot but so
maybe<00:03:56.400> i<00:03:56.489> won't<00:03:56.670> um<00:03:58.070> but<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.280> know<00:03:59.310> i<00:03:59.459> want<00:03:59.940> to
