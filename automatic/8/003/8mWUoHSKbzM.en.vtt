00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 release sponsor channel power at bay on 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.000
 where you can see reviews of various 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.710
 mobile operating system applications 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.230
 and industry news 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.599
 if you all this is interesting and close 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.599
 welcome to the reference in the description 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.920
 in this world things may not be like this 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.289
 how it seems at first glance 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.810
 if the kids quietly quietly play with 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.840
 with your toys it does not mean that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.980
 they are safe welcome this 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.670
 10 toys that can kill 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.370
 in 1951 one unusual physicist was 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.710
 nuclear power plant model created 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.920
 fully working and most interesting with 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.480
 real radioactive substances 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.180
 the scientist really believed that so children 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 much better understand the complex science to 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.440
 Fortunately , this toy has been banned less 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 than a year later 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.520
 sports darts for darts pretty 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.300
 heavy even if you ignore the sharp 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.220
 tip 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.619
 they used to be sold without 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 restrictions but for some time it was 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.810
 about 10,000 injuries reported 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.030
 heads due to dart hits 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.400
 Naturally the authorities of some countries 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.619
 realized it and eighty eighth year 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.380
 selling sports darts heavily 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.650
 settled set for investigation 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.080
 crime there are all magnifier gloves 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.680
 tweezers and of course powder to check 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.180
 fingerprint in it is a snag 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.640
 it turned out that this powder is 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.040
 thermolib which can cause cancer in 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.500
 man and when kiddies play 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.880
 everything pulls in your mouth is natural that everything 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.460
 toys recalled 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.850
 the doll is able to come to life and bite it 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.350
 cool she shoved any food I'm on 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.390
 only chews quite often in 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.759
 the hospital treated the children with broken 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.340
 fingers because the doll can not distinguish 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.770
 give her something to eat chewing gum or your 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.079
 finger and the number of children pulled out 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.960
 hair of this doll does not count 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.990
 Naturally that this fascinating 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.050
 the toy was banned 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.489
 You can say this is the first 3d printer in 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.950
 stories created in 1964 essentially the question 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.709
 He heated a metal plate 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.080
 up to 300 degrees evolved 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.930
 the plastic melted and then cooled down 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.940
 got insect figures cool idea 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.670
 but in the process of melting the children breathed 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.670
 toxic meltable plastic and 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.590
 Of course on burned all the fingers I 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.810
 I think most are not even now 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.780
 understand what it is and we in due time 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.840
 using this thing amused them 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.299
 there was a time it is quite dangerous 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.430
 device for a small explosion here 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.799
 the main thing is not to overdo it with gunpowder or 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.380
 gray I personally did not see that someone 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.950
 ripped off fingers but parents scared us 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.750
 it is precisely this austin magic pistol 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.000
 children's toy that in fact 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.769
 is a firearm because what 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.110
 make a shot in this gun 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.930
 chemical reaction occurs with 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.330
 fire substance grade just 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.700
 plastic gun heavy balls 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.380
 and some carbide carbide is extremely 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.630
 unstable substance and so he 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.090
 ignited need only add water 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.280
 Naturally so fun toy 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.109
 had to ban 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.280
 magnetic balls were originally created 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.320
 for adults only 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.840
 but children this invention is very 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.180
 I liked it and as a result of the magnet often 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.820
 turned out to be the stomachs and airways 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.320
 children and it is already dangerous they can 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.170
 block the breath 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.480
 and pull them out quite problematic that 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.850
 same scientist that created child atomic 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.670
 energy laboratory created and 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.319
 Children's chemical set seems pretty 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.540
 safe set but it has 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.639
 potentially deadly substances 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.400
 for example combustible potassium permanganate 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:54.160
 ammonium nitrate which is used for 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.590
 making bombs judging by inventions 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.200
 the scientist underestimated inquisitive minds 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.170
 kiddies as a result and this is it 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.299
 invention banned children's stove in 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.480
 which is placed with a spatula 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.700
 dough baking after baking then 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.530
 have you understand there is gingerbread 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.120
 heat heating or 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.280
 n and all this is a children's toy with 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.829
 age limit 8 years 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.380
 no wonder that curious children instead 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.780
 dough shoved their hands into the oven and 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.150
 such toys were burned badly 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.460
 be careful and wisdom to you from me 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.980
 not always if the child keep quiet you are busy 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.980
 doing it is good at it all
