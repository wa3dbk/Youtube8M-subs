doesn't have to be pretty because those
are<00:00:56.399> gonna<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.579> hidden<00:00:56.910> later<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.719> your

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
are gonna be hidden later on in your

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.979 
are gonna be hidden later on in your
bead<00:00:58.320> cones<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.460> I'm<00:00:59.879> basically<00:01:00.239> I'm<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
bead cones so I'm basically I'm going to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.520 
bead cones so I'm basically I'm going to
take<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.410> board<00:01:01.710> course<00:01:02.370> number<00:01:02.699> sides<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.210> and

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
take my board course number sides up and

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.840 
take my board course number sides up and
I'm<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> kind<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.309> hold<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.729> with

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
I'm just going to kind of hold it with

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.929 
I'm just going to kind of hold it with
my<00:01:06.000> finger<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.659> back<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.549> I'm<00:01:08.549> gonna<00:01:08.640> take

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
my finger on the back and I'm gonna take

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
my finger on the back and I'm gonna take
my<00:01:08.970> strands<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.140> probably<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.560> of

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
my strands and this is probably one of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.710 
my strands and this is probably one of
the<00:01:10.710> hardest<00:01:11.010> things<00:01:11.280> getting<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.090> started

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the hardest things getting it started

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.520 
the hardest things getting it started
kumihimo<00:01:13.320> stands<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.670> Japanese<00:01:15.479> braiding<00:01:16.140> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
kumihimo stands for Japanese braiding so

four<00:02:14.019> then<00:02:15.040> goes<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.069> B<00:02:16.690> so<00:02:17.690> we're<00:02:17.840> going<00:02:17.930> to

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
four then goes to B so we're going to

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.309 
four then goes to B so we're going to
continue<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.620> do<00:02:18.799> that<00:02:18.830> repetitive<00:02:20.319> braiding

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
continue to do that repetitive braiding

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.930 
continue to do that repetitive braiding
and<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.830> good<00:02:21.980> thing<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.489> if<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.730> wire

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
and the good thing is is if the wire

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.089 
and the good thing is is if the wire
pops<00:02:23.269> out<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.660> can<00:02:23.840> usually<00:02:24.200> tell<00:02:24.590> exactly

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
pops out you can usually tell exactly

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.180 
pops out you can usually tell exactly
where<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.819> were<00:02:25.940> at<00:02:26.709> by<00:02:27.709> your<00:02:27.829> number

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
where you were at by your number

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.520 
where you were at by your number
sequence<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:29.780> fun<00:02:30.019> because<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.500> can

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
sequence and it's so fun because you can

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.400 
sequence and it's so fun because you can
start<00:02:30.920> seeing<00:02:31.299> your<00:02:32.299> braiding<00:02:32.810> from<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> back

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
start seeing your braiding from the back

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.309 
start seeing your braiding from the back
and<00:02:33.950> it's<00:02:34.489> just<00:02:34.610> um<00:02:35.090> it's<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:35.599> pretty<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.140> see

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
and it's just um it's so pretty to see

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.839 
and it's just um it's so pretty to see
it<00:02:36.410> come<00:02:36.620> together<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:37.130> can<00:02:37.250> even<00:02:37.519> just<00:02:37.670> see

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
it come together you can even just see

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.670 
it come together you can even just see
like<00:02:38.000> little<00:02:38.329> tiny<00:02:38.720> bit<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.170> braid<00:02:39.410> right

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
like little tiny bit of the braid right

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.300 
like little tiny bit of the braid right
there<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.250> what<00:02:41.180> I'm<00:02:41.269> gonna<00:02:41.390> do<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:42.130> I'm<00:02:43.130> gonna

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
there and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.120 
there and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take<00:02:43.569> since<00:02:44.569> since<00:02:45.049> this<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.500> finer<00:02:45.860> gauge

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
take since since this is a finer gauge

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.360 
take since since this is a finer gauge
wire<00:02:46.459> if<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.720> fed<00:02:48.049> this<00:02:48.530> wire<00:02:48.799> through<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.190> bead

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
wire if you fed this wire through a bead

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.490 
wire if you fed this wire through a bead
cone<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.819> could<00:02:50.120> if<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.780> if<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.110> wanted<00:02:51.349> to

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
cone you could if you if you wanted to

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.160 
cone you could if you if you wanted to
use<00:02:51.769> like<00:02:52.280> all<00:02:52.730> your<00:02:53.239> wires<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.810> fed<00:02:53.989> that

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
use like all your wires and fed that

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.559 
use like all your wires and fed that
through<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.440> bead<00:02:54.590> cone<00:02:54.829> I<00:02:55.069> prefer<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:56.120> use<00:02:56.150> an

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
through the bead cone I prefer to use an

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.990 
through the bead cone I prefer to use an
eye<00:02:56.750> pin<00:02:57.019> so<00:02:57.590> we're<00:02:57.739> going<00:02:57.889> to<00:02:57.980> wire<00:02:58.160> wrap<00:02:58.280> this

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
eye pin so we're going to wire wrap this

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.009 
eye pin so we're going to wire wrap this
little<00:02:59.060> end<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:01.220> an<00:03:01.340> eye<00:03:01.519> pin<00:03:01.819> so<00:03:02.690> I'm<00:03:02.750> gonna<00:03:02.840> go

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
little end to an eye pin so I'm gonna go

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.650 
little end to an eye pin so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:03.380> open<00:03:03.799> up<00:03:03.859> my<00:03:04.010> eye<00:03:04.040> pin<00:03:04.459> here

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.090 

open<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:08.720> up<00:03:08.870> I'm<00:03:09.109> just<00:03:09.139> gonna<00:03:09.530> kind<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:09.769> place

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
open it up I'm just gonna kind of place

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.220 
open it up I'm just gonna kind of place
my<00:03:10.489> wire<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.109> there<00:03:12.109> kind<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.440> fold<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.829> over

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
my wire and there kind of fold it over

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.879 
my wire and there kind of fold it over
I'm<00:03:15.230> gonna<00:03:15.319> close<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:15.739> eye<00:03:16.160> pin<00:03:16.430> up<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.959> then

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
I'm gonna close that eye pin up and then

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.710 
I'm gonna close that eye pin up and then
you<00:03:19.459> don't<00:03:19.639> have<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.850> make<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.120> pretty<00:03:20.420> wrap

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
you don't have to make a pretty wrap

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.170 
you don't have to make a pretty wrap
this<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.319> all<00:03:21.470> gonna<00:03:21.620> be<00:03:21.799> hidden<00:03:22.040> so<00:03:23.030> we're

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
this is all gonna be hidden so we're

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.470 
this is all gonna be hidden so we're
just

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
just

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.360 
just
I'm<00:03:23.660> just<00:03:24.019> smishing<00:03:24.290> this<00:03:24.620> with<00:03:24.799> my<00:03:24.950> fingers

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
I'm just smishing this with my fingers

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.129 
I'm just smishing this with my fingers
especially<00:03:26.209> because<00:03:26.329> it's<00:03:26.660> such<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> fine

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
especially because it's such a fine

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.160 
especially because it's such a fine
gauge<00:03:27.319> wire<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.620> can<00:03:28.130> I<00:03:28.370> can<00:03:28.760> do<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:30.049> we're

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
gauge wire I can I can do that so we're

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.690 
gauge wire I can I can do that so we're
using<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:30.739> know<00:03:30.829> technical<00:03:31.400> term<00:03:31.670> of

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
using you know technical term of

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.960 
using you know technical term of
smishing<00:03:32.209> there<00:03:32.920> I'm<00:03:33.920> gonna<00:03:34.400> cut<00:03:34.670> off<00:03:34.700> my

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
smishing there I'm gonna cut off my

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.650 
smishing there I'm gonna cut off my
excess<00:03:37.389> okay<00:03:38.389> and<00:03:38.989> then<00:03:39.109> I'm<00:03:39.200> gonna<00:03:39.290> feed<00:03:39.650> that

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
excess okay and then I'm gonna feed that

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.390 
excess okay and then I'm gonna feed that
into<00:03:42.160> a<00:03:43.160> bead<00:03:43.370> cone<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:44.829> then<00:03:45.829> what<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.040> can<00:03:46.280> do

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
into a bead cone and then what I can do

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.699 
into a bead cone and then what I can do
is<00:03:46.519> I<00:03:46.700> can<00:03:46.760> use<00:03:46.940> this<00:03:47.480> then<00:03:48.139> to<00:03:48.590> wire<00:03:48.799> wrap<00:03:49.810> on<00:03:50.810> -

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
is I can use this then to wire wrap on -

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.410 
is I can use this then to wire wrap on -
I<00:03:53.019> could<00:03:54.019> use<00:03:54.049> a<00:03:54.380> clasp<00:03:54.709> like<00:03:55.069> this<00:03:55.370> to<00:03:56.269> wire

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
I could use a clasp like this to wire

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.089 
I could use a clasp like this to wire
wrap<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.840> on<00:03:56.989> -<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.560> then<00:03:57.829> it's<00:03:57.950> going<00:03:58.040> to

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
wrap that on - and then it's going to

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.640 
wrap that on - and then it's going to
finish<00:03:58.430> off<00:03:58.579> my<00:03:58.610> bracelet<00:03:59.299> and<00:03:59.720> you<00:04:00.500> could

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
finish off my bracelet and you could

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.240 
finish off my bracelet and you could
actually

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
actually

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.160 
actually
and<00:04:01.400> take<00:04:01.640> your<00:04:01.880> your<00:04:02.240> eye<00:04:02.300> pin<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:02.990> add

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
and take your your eye pin and add

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.070 
and take your your eye pin and add
additional<00:04:03.380> beads<00:04:04.210> to<00:04:05.210> the<00:04:05.300> end<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.870> further

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
additional beads to the end to further

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.870 
additional beads to the end to further
embellish<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.710> and<00:04:06.770> then<00:04:07.040> you<00:04:07.130> can<00:04:07.310> see<00:04:07.490> -<00:04:07.670> I've

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
embellish it and then you can see - I've

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.840 
embellish it and then you can see - I've
kind<00:04:08.060> of<00:04:08.180> taken<00:04:08.900> some<00:04:09.860> additional<00:04:10.310> head<00:04:10.520> pins

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
kind of taken some additional head pins

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.020 
kind of taken some additional head pins
and<00:04:11.590> you<00:04:12.590> know<00:04:12.710> every<00:04:13.190> opportunity<00:04:13.490> for

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
and you know every opportunity for

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.760 
and you know every opportunity for
further<00:04:14.210> embellishment<00:04:14.990> is<00:04:15.110> always<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.500> good

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
further embellishment is always a good

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.240 
further embellishment is always a good
thing

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
thing
