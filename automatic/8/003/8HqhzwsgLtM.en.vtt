00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
right here to your left is a corner

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.779 
right here to your left is a corner
piece<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.710> has<00:00:49.829> three<00:00:50.129> stickers<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.700> have

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
piece as it has three stickers we have

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.910 
piece as it has three stickers we have
the<00:00:50.910> green<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:52.199> orange<00:00:52.530> one<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.739> the

the green one the orange one and the
white<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> little<00:00:53.940> Center<00:00:54.300> ones

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
white one and the little Center ones

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.240 
white one and the little Center ones
showing<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.079> two<00:00:55.260> stickers<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> green

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
showing up two stickers I have a green

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.479 
showing up two stickers I have a green
and<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> white<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.170> I'm<00:00:58.170> sort<00:00:59.100> those<00:00:59.280> out

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and a white one here I'm sort those out

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.720 
and a white one here I'm sort those out
separate<00:01:00.390> them<00:01:00.629> um<00:01:00.920> what<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> typically<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.699> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
separate them um what I typically do I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.939 
separate them um what I typically do I
start<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.570> one<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> center<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.710> so

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
start with one in the center one so

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.260 
start with one in the center one so
we'll<00:01:05.070> take<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.400> green<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.850> white<00:01:06.060> one

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
we'll take the green in the white one

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.890 
we'll take the green in the white one
and<00:01:07.430> to<00:01:08.430> make<00:01:08.580> sure<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:09.210> cube<00:01:09.570> is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and to make sure that your cube is

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.929 
and to make sure that your cube is
looking<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:13.670> our<00:01:14.670> white

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
looking like this we have a our white

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.270 
looking like this we have a our white
side<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.360> kind<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.600> little<00:01:16.409> Center<00:01:16.770> Q<00:01:17.009> B<00:01:17.100> there

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
side is kind of little Center Q B there

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.940 
side is kind of little Center Q B there
is<00:01:17.630> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.930> guess<00:01:19.080> parallel<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:19.860> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
is kind of I guess parallel what you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.730 
is kind of I guess parallel what you
want<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.159> say<00:01:20.420> to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.630> whole<00:01:21.900> cube<00:01:22.170> itself<00:01:22.500> I'm

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
want to say to the whole cube itself I'm

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890 
want to say to the whole cube itself I'm
going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> give<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.430> little<00:01:23.670> half<00:01:24.420> turn<00:01:24.750> or

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
going to give it a little half turn or

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.730 
going to give it a little half turn or
whatever

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
whatever

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
whatever
45<00:01:26.700> degrees<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.420> established<00:01:27.900> earlier<00:01:28.170> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
45 degrees as we established earlier I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.280 
45 degrees as we established earlier I
guess<00:01:29.509> take<00:01:30.509> our<00:01:30.689> QB<00:01:31.340> put<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.290> like

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
guess take our QB put it in the like

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.760 
guess take our QB put it in the like
that<00:01:35.009> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.970> snaps<00:01:36.360> into<00:01:36.570> place<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.049> then

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that kind of snaps into place and then

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.789 
that kind of snaps into place and then
rotate<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.340> around<00:01:38.990> now<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.350> need<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.619> find

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
rotate that around now we need to find

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.760 
rotate that around now we need to find
let's<00:01:41.460> find<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> corner<00:01:42.119> piece<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.570> goes

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
let's find a corner piece that goes

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.289 
let's find a corner piece that goes
Jason<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.280> we've<00:01:44.520> got<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> red<00:01:44.970> side

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
Jason to that so we've got the red side

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.310 
Jason to that so we've got the red side
here<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.979> we'll<00:01:47.100> need<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> here

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
here so we'll need the it's not it here

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.510 
here so we'll need the it's not it here
we<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:51.259> what<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> Q<00:01:52.680> B<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
we go what the Q B and just like that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
we go what the Q B and just like that
the<00:01:53.670> corner<00:01:53.939> pieces<00:01:54.119> are<00:01:54.390> crazy<00:01:54.869> easy<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.350> put

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the corner pieces are crazy easy to put

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.999 
the corner pieces are crazy easy to put
in<00:01:55.649> there<00:01:56.479> let's<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:58.579> white<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.850> red<00:02:00.119> side

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
in there let's do the white and red side

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.649 
in there let's do the white and red side
just<00:02:02.009> give<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:02.490> quick<00:02:02.939> turn<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.509> get

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
just give it a little quick turn to get

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.230 
just give it a little quick turn to get
this<00:02:03.899> bugger<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.469> there<00:02:04.860> easier<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.000> you

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
this bugger in there easier and you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.710 
this bugger in there easier and you
snips<00:02:06.780> right<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.170> there<00:02:07.970> all<00:02:08.970> right<00:02:09.239> corner

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
snips right in there all right corner

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.330 
snips right in there all right corner
piece<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.229> need<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.800> blue<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.310> red

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
piece we need is the blue and the red

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.490 
piece we need is the blue and the red
one

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
one

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.590 
one
to<00:02:12.820> make<00:02:13.820> sure<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.060> you're<00:02:14.210> putting<00:02:14.330> all

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
to make sure that you're putting all

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.370 
to make sure that you're putting all
these<00:02:14.750> in<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.990> correct<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.020> correct

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
these in the correct in the correct

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.310 
these in the correct in the correct
order<00:02:18.740> because<00:02:19.280> otherwise<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:19.610> cube<00:02:19.970> can<00:02:20.150> be

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
order because otherwise a cube can be

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
order because otherwise a cube can be
impossible<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:21.410> solve<00:02:21.620> later<00:02:23.740> here<00:02:24.740> we<00:02:24.800> go

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
impossible to solve later here we go

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.550 
impossible to solve later here we go
white<00:02:25.520> in<00:02:25.790> blue<00:02:27.490> and<00:02:28.720> are<00:02:29.720> going<00:02:30.200> there<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.380> go

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
white in blue and are going there we go

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.440 
white in blue and are going there we go
it's<00:02:31.340> harder<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.670> put<00:02:31.820> them<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.030> than<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.300> take

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
it's harder to put them in than to take

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.920 
it's harder to put them in than to take
them<00:02:32.600> out

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
them out

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.160 
them out
definitely<00:02:34.150> then<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.240> got<00:02:35.360> just<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.750> corner

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
definitely then we got just the corner

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
definitely then we got just the corner
pieces<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.800> worry<00:02:37.010> about<00:02:37.160> now<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.980> then<00:02:39.980> go

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
pieces to worry about now and then go

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.240 
pieces to worry about now and then go
like<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:41.080> last<00:02:42.080> piece<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.500> our<00:02:42.650> center<00:02:43.100> piece

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
like that last piece is our center piece

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.800 
like that last piece is our center piece
I<00:02:43.490> save<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.820> one<00:02:44.000> for<00:02:44.060> last<00:02:44.360> since<00:02:44.630> it's

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
I save that one for last since it's

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.530 
I save that one for last since it's
easiest<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.500> get<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.950> one<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:46.220> last<00:02:46.450> give<00:02:47.450> it

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
easiest to get that one and last give it

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.440 
easiest to get that one and last give it
a<00:02:47.600> little<00:02:47.810> corner<00:02:48.140> turn<00:02:48.640> we'll<00:02:49.640> put<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.000> in

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
a little corner turn we'll put it in

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.120 
a little corner turn we'll put it in
I'll<00:02:50.780> show<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.320> kind<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.590> how<00:02:51.709> we<00:02:51.800> have<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.010> do

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
I'll show you kind of how we have to do

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.740 
I'll show you kind of how we have to do
this<00:02:52.280> we've<00:02:52.940> got<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.120> two<00:02:53.270> stickers<00:02:53.630> like

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
this we've got the two stickers like

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.390 
this we've got the two stickers like
this<00:02:54.020> we're<00:02:54.320> going<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.470> put<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.800> little<00:02:54.950> butt

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
this we're going to put this little butt

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.130 
this we're going to put this little butt
end<00:02:55.670> in<00:02:56.120> first<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.440> set<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:57.860> in<00:02:57.980> there<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:59.000> just

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
end in first so set it in there and just

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.070 
end in first so set it in there and just
push<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.170> down<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.390> there<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:02.900> go

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
push it down and in and there you go

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.400 
push it down and in and there you go
your<00:03:03.800> cube<00:03:04.100> is<00:03:04.220> now<00:03:04.400> solvable<00:03:05.120> again<00:03:05.570> so

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
your cube is now solvable again so

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.850 
your cube is now solvable again so
should<00:03:07.100> it<00:03:07.130> be<00:03:07.220> deemed<00:03:07.730> unsolvable<00:03:08.680> like<00:03:09.680> you

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
should it be deemed unsolvable like you

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.530 
should it be deemed unsolvable like you
can't<00:03:10.070> figure<00:03:10.280> out<00:03:10.400> how<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.550> solve<00:03:10.970> this<00:03:11.180> you

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
can't figure out how to solve this you

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.760 
can't figure out how to solve this you
can<00:03:11.750> just<00:03:11.780> disassemble<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.830> with<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:15.470> movie

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
can just disassemble it with that movie

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.479 
can just disassemble it with that movie
right<00:03:15.890> there<00:03:15.950> or<00:03:17.380> reassemble<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.500> using<00:03:19.190> this

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
right there or reassemble it using this

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.470 
right there or reassemble it using this
movie<00:03:19.910> right<00:03:20.120> here

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
movie right here

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.320 
movie right here
have<00:03:21.470> fun<00:03:21.799> hopefully<00:03:22.280> make<00:03:22.730> some<00:03:22.910> more<00:03:23.030> cube

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
have fun hopefully make some more cube

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.850 
have fun hopefully make some more cube
videos<00:03:23.690> later<00:03:23.989> but<00:03:24.370> that's<00:03:25.370> all<00:03:25.610> for<00:03:25.820> now
