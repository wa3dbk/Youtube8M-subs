00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.740
 very good and welcome to the new video 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.849
 of the aerobic path channel well in the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.220
 previous video I told you that I had 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.970
 scammed with 10 50 euro bills 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.430
 false I went to put the complaint and the 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.079
 police showed me how I could detect 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.329
 those fake banknotes that I had 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.760
 they told me they were very very 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.860
 good ones 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.410
 so they are professionals 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.700
 obviously they taught me how 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.670
 they had seen that those bills 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.080
 they were fake well the tickets that I 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.310
 I had false I do not have them anymore because 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.090
 they have remained the five hundred 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.580
 euros 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.290
 they told me that by simply looking at this 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.239
 50 and doing this by moving it with the 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.690
 camera I do not know if it will be appreciated will appreciate 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.420
 very good but when we move it like this 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.539
 it changes a little beige color that 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.390
 makes an effect and with the camera that 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.700
 you hardly notice it is as if you look at it from 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.110
 front is like pink lilac not then 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.930
 when you move it, it starts to 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.970
 better like silver brown is an effect 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.649
 which makes it strange when moving the ticket well 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.649
 50 bills that I was hung up 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.570
 they did not do that it was simply from a 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.990
 color and no matter how I moved it 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.119
 changed the color of the number is worth 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.179
 another option that I knew was to scratch this 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.770
 from here this line here scratches in 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.659
 theory has to have a small 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.360
 relief when you do that does not happen 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.720
 fingers as hairlines this note of 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.580
 here to see if this focuses I'm here 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.590
 It has some lines and with the nail if you pass 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.960
 the nail above the notes but well 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.679
 the bills that hung me this 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.319
 they had what they did not have was what 50 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.050
 for the fabric so it did not change color and 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.440
 it was the same color so that 's the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.590
 way that at least in my case those 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.360
 tickets can be identified another 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.960
 way that we can also use to 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.210
 to know 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.549
 false is not simply with a marker 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.250
 that there are on purpose for these things I 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.069
 I'm going to buy one in amazon same sell 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.590
 there is a stationery left and they did not have 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.720
 if you notice you put the marker 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.910
 counterfeit detector and in amazon 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.030
 same level I for everything there are markers 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.670
 and see how cheap they are 1.65 euros 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.530
 sent included there are other prices but 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.050
 well I maybe bought this one for 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.989
 try it out and how these work 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.570
 markers you take the pen you take the 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.250
 ticket you paint the ticket is painted 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.320
 black color is that it is false if the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.019
 ticket is not painted or painted a 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.450
 yellow very weak according to the ejido 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.040
 the ticket is true so I 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.530
 I'm going to buy some of these so that 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.030
 do not scam me at least from 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.280
 this way because she has told me 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.170
 Also there are people who take the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.239
 tickets so that those markers do not 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.880
 paint but well imagine that if you give them 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.459
 an exact lacquer layer will also be very 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.140
 different but good I'm not a 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.030
 expert of this I tell you what has 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.860
 commented the police 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.569
 the comments that the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.459
 people with their advice in the video 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.670
 earlier so I hope you can help 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:17.080
 someone already know the number of this 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.970
 50 the lines are here and if you can 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.330
 buy a marker of these that 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.300
 By painting the ticket you can know if it is 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.300
 authentic or false is worth for nothing else 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.500
 up to here the video and see you in the 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.500
 next a greeting
