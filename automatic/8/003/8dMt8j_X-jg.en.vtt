00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
are you there it is a flower spike

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.470 
are you there it is a flower spike
emerging<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.489> seems<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.120> orchid

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
emerging it seems that this orchid

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.229 
emerging it seems that this orchid
produces<00:00:48.989> flower<00:00:49.289> spikes<00:00:49.680> quite<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.700> top<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
produces flower spikes quite on top of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.479 
produces flower spikes quite on top of
the<00:00:51.390> cane<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.350> some<00:00:52.949> cata<00:00:53.190> sedum

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the cane as you can see some cata sedum

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.130 
the cane as you can see some cata sedum
type<00:00:53.670> orchids<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.210> produce<00:00:54.390> them<00:00:54.690> at<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
type orchids can produce them at the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.380 
type orchids can produce them at the
bottom<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.520> think<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.879> depends<00:00:57.239> on

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
bottom really I think it depends on

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.420 
bottom really I think it depends on
genetics<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.230> don't<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.620> maybe<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.039> guy<00:00:59.190> can

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
genetics I don't know maybe this guy can

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
genetics I don't know maybe this guy can
create<00:00:59.730> flower<00:00:59.940> spikes<00:01:00.329> towards<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.780> bottom

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
create flower spikes towards the bottom

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.260 
create flower spikes towards the bottom
and<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.350> well<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.399> his<00:01:02.579> own<00:01:02.760> decision

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
and so well it's really his own decision

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.969 
and so well it's really his own decision
so<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.780> gonna<00:01:03.930> interfere<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.710> least

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
so I'm not gonna interfere but at least

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.980 
so I'm not gonna interfere but at least
one<00:01:05.220> flower<00:01:05.549> spike<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.060> will<00:01:06.360> have<00:01:06.570> from<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
one flower spike I will have from this

it appears cata cita markets are really
not<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.270> hard<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.570> keep<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
not that hard to keep this is the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.800 
not that hard to keep this is the
Millennium<00:01:23.009> Magic<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> received<00:01:24.540> from

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
Millennium Magic that I received from

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.499 
Millennium Magic that I received from

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
Canada from Karina and I was hoping that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.390 
Canada from Karina and I was hoping that
the<00:01:27.630> new<00:01:27.750> suitor<00:01:28.140> bulb<00:01:28.380> would<00:01:28.770> be<00:01:28.950> bigger<00:01:29.159> than

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the new suitor bulb would be bigger than

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.429 
the new suitor bulb would be bigger than
the<00:01:29.579> older<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.210> because<00:01:30.750> apparently<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the older one because apparently this

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.249 
the older one because apparently this
guy<00:01:31.770> went<00:01:32.579> through<00:01:32.670> some<00:01:33.030> stuff<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.410 
it might not bloom for me this year it
doesn't<00:01:50.310> really<00:01:50.399> matter<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> am

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
doesn't really matter because I am

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.330 
doesn't really matter because I am
patient<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.409> wait<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.009> really

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
patient and I will wait but I really

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.069 
patient and I will wait but I really
wanted<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.909> some<00:01:54.119> black<00:01:54.329> flowers<00:01:54.750> who

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
wanted to see some black flowers who

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.520 
wanted to see some black flowers who
knows<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.159> far<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:57.030> guy<00:01:57.240> doesn't<00:01:57.990> show<00:01:58.049> signs

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
knows so far the guy doesn't show signs

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.039 
knows so far the guy doesn't show signs
of<00:01:58.860> producing<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.640> flower<00:01:59.909> spike<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.600> take<00:02:00.869> him

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
of producing a flower spike I take him

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.490 
of producing a flower spike I take him
every<00:02:01.320> day<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.799> give<00:02:02.520> him<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.790> love<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.210> yeah<00:02:04.140> who

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
every day I give him a love and yeah who

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.399 
every day I give him a love and yeah who
knows<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.579> pseudo<00:02:06.390> bulb<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.750> quite<00:02:07.049> tiny

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
knows but this pseudo bulb is quite tiny

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.430 
knows but this pseudo bulb is quite tiny
so<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.099> doesn't<00:02:08.520> bloom<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.030> will<00:02:09.780> not<00:02:09.959> mind<00:02:10.229> I

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
so if it doesn't bloom I will not mind I

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.930 
so if it doesn't bloom I will not mind I
will<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.770> try<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> give<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> best

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
will just try to give it the best

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.510 
will just try to give it the best
that<00:02:12.210> I<00:02:12.240> can<00:02:12.570> hopefully<00:02:12.890> help<00:02:13.890> him<00:02:14.190> store

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
that I can hopefully help him store

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.850 
that I can hopefully help him store
nutrients<00:02:15.210> in<00:02:15.450> these<00:02:15.750> suta<00:02:16.080> bulbs<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.500> create

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
nutrients in these suta bulbs and create

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.160 
nutrients in these suta bulbs and create
a<00:02:16.890> larger<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.550> larger<00:02:17.730> pseudobulbs<00:02:18.570> in<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
a larger and larger pseudobulbs in the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.220 
a larger and larger pseudobulbs in the
years<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.560> come<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.040> yeah<00:02:20.730> finally<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.750> flower

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
years to come and yeah finally a flower

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.410 
years to come and yeah finally a flower
spike<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:23.130> then<00:02:23.280> again<00:02:23.400> there's<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.970> long<00:02:24.150> time

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
spike but then again there's a long time

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.960 
spike but then again there's a long time
until<00:02:24.780> autumn<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.500> hope<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.920> not<00:02:26.100> lost<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.940> I

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
until autumn so hope is not lost but I

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.330 
until autumn so hope is not lost but I
am<00:02:27.180> considering<00:02:27.720> that<00:02:28.020> he<00:02:28.290> will<00:02:28.440> not<00:02:28.590> bloom<00:02:28.860> at

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
am considering that he will not bloom at

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.340 
am considering that he will not bloom at
this<00:02:29.520> time<00:02:29.820> now<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.360> guys<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.840> asked<00:02:31.110> me<00:02:31.200> to

orchids to be honest this guy I have him

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.230 
orchids to be honest this guy I have him

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
for almost one year now and this is the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.830 
for almost one year now and this is the
first<00:02:39.420> time<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.660> would<00:02:39.930> bloom<00:02:40.170> him<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:42.000> really

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
first time I would bloom him so really

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.260 
first time I would bloom him so really
experience<00:02:43.410> wise<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:44.010> don't<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.580> lot<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:44.970> it

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
experience wise I don't have a lot of it

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.260 
experience wise I don't have a lot of it
I<00:02:45.510> seem<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.200> do<00:02:46.440> ok<00:02:47.010> with<00:02:47.280> them<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.090> fact

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
I seem to do ok with them and the fact

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.200 
I seem to do ok with them and the fact
that<00:02:48.420> they<00:02:48.720> rebloom<00:02:49.320> means<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.160> did<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.880> bit

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
that they rebloom means that I did a bit

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.070 
that they rebloom means that I did a bit
more<00:02:51.420> than<00:02:51.690> okay<00:02:52.110> which<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.890> good<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.750> don't

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
more than okay which is good but I don't

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.200 
more than okay which is good but I don't
know<00:02:55.170> maybe<00:02:55.410> I'm<00:02:55.680> gonna<00:02:55.920> do<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.190> how<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.730> care

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
know maybe I'm gonna do a how to care

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.270 
know maybe I'm gonna do a how to care
for<00:02:57.630> these<00:02:57.870> types<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.320> orchids<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.980> autumn

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
for these types of orchids in the autumn

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.070 
for these types of orchids in the autumn
when<00:02:59.310> this<00:02:59.700> guy<00:02:59.880> blooms<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.450> at<00:03:00.660> least<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.960> have

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
when this guy blooms so at least I have

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.320 
when this guy blooms so at least I have
a<00:03:01.110> confirmation<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.220> did<00:03:02.640> good<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.120> this

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
a confirmation that I did good in this

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.510 
a confirmation that I did good in this
season<00:03:04.080> but<00:03:04.560> usually<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.040> don't<00:03:05.250> know<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.430> you

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
season but usually I don't know if you

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.000 
season but usually I don't know if you
noticed<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:06.000> don't<00:03:06.300> do<00:03:06.570> videos<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.350> how<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.710> care

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
noticed I don't do videos on how to care

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.270 
noticed I don't do videos on how to care
for<00:03:08.040> specific<00:03:08.700> species<00:03:09.450> let's<00:03:10.080> say<00:03:10.350> unless<00:03:11.100> I

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
for specific species let's say unless I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.310 
for specific species let's say unless I
do<00:03:11.400> have<00:03:11.850> some<00:03:12.150> experience<00:03:12.690> with<00:03:12.810> them<00:03:13.080> there

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
do have some experience with them there

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.720 
do have some experience with them there
are<00:03:13.440> those<00:03:13.620> types<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.980> orchids<00:03:14.340> which<00:03:14.520> are

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
are those types of orchids which are

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.560 
are those types of orchids which are
like<00:03:14.910> an<00:03:15.060> open<00:03:15.330> book

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
like an open book

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.570 
like an open book
I<00:03:15.720> don't<00:03:15.959> know<00:03:16.050> oncidium<00:03:16.740> types<00:03:17.070> orchids<00:03:17.490> and

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
I don't know oncidium types orchids and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.040 
I don't know oncidium types orchids and
so<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:17.880> they're<00:03:18.120> all<00:03:18.300> pretty<00:03:18.600> much<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> same

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
so on they're all pretty much the same

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.170 
so on they're all pretty much the same
but<00:03:19.380> when<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.590> comes<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.370> these<00:03:20.700> species

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
but when it comes to like these species

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.449 
but when it comes to like these species
that<00:03:21.390> I've<00:03:21.510> never<00:03:21.780> dealt<00:03:22.080> with<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:23.070> prefer

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
that I've never dealt with I just prefer

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.330 
that I've never dealt with I just prefer
to<00:03:23.540> give<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.720> at<00:03:24.840> least<00:03:24.870> two<00:03:25.260> seasons<00:03:25.890> see<00:03:26.220> how

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
to give it at least two seasons see how

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.420 
to give it at least two seasons see how
it<00:03:26.490> does<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.060> also<00:03:27.900> see<00:03:28.170> what<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.350> do<00:03:28.500> wrong<00:03:28.950> so

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
it does and also see what I do wrong so

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.130 
it does and also see what I do wrong so
you<00:03:29.700> know<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:29.910> can<00:03:30.209> give<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.480> better<00:03:30.870> how<00:03:31.110> to

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
you know I can give you a better how to
