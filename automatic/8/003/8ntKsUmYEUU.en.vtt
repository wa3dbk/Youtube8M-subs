 also for mirrors 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.730
 let's start by taking very few really 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.410
 all natural ingredients as always 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.260
 as for all our michelle e 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.140
 we will need water 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.949
 we need alcohol and vinegar 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.219
 white as it is prepared 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.670
 take 250 milliliters of water 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.530
 obviously a linen jug is added 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.530
 half a cup of white vinegar 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:13.970
 and half a cup of alcohol mixed with a 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.090
 spoon and once this is prepared 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.000
 mixture you will have to transfer with the help 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.850
 of a funnel in a spray container 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.360
 you can safely use those 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:30.530
 that you have this spray at home 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.390
 can be exploited on the glasses and also 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.410
 on the mirrors but what is the element 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.440
 fundamental for this recipe and for 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.480
