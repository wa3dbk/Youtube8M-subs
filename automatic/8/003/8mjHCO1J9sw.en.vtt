00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.350
 and what happens, I'm watering and today I 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.419
 I bring another one that in play the modern 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.640
 warfare2 this time with the tar 21 with 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.919
 silencer and what am I going to talk about today 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.940
 of the sub-machine guns in the call of 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:16.460
 duty since good this weapon the tar 21 a 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.290
 my opinion if it is not the best the second 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.760
 better fixed because it is bestial or is this 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.290
 weapon what happens is that with the 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.570
 silencer and I think without him too 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.970
 right now I do not remember has 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.400
 as a kind of failure or advantage 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.970
 depending on how you look at it is that you shoot at 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.670
 chest or to the culture of the enemies and 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.490
 she goes straight to the head no 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.780
 I know if some of you have already checked 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.660
 I the truth is that it is the only weapon that 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.530
 has got the emblem of 2007 is 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.760
 legal or without looting it 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.940
 and that's how it is a weapon that is almost 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.059
 lethal swim of witnesses if you do not kill 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.170
 with the witnesses guessing it is very rare 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.670
 because there is old the second one does not 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.409
 He drove to the head and finished everything 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.659
 and what else 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.069
 I said before that the second best not 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.369
 the best because I think that as the 

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:13.229
 ak-47 of the call of duty 4 in the modern 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.359
 warfare that I believe that there is none to 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.690
 throughout the call of duty they have gone 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.700
 to ruin I walk to the ak-47 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.480
 so yes without a doubt the best would be that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.120
 the ak-47 of 4 I have several gameplays 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.270
 Over there 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.130
 I do not know how to leave your opinions I already 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.200
 I say after tonight possibly 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.630
 the observes fagan any of rafa that 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.270
 the m16 of the call of duty 4 is bestial 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.270
 it's also a two-gun cucumber 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.520
 bursts killed him to scioli and attentive to 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.710
 the triple of the predictor that leads 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.810
 several that I see seeing there triple 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.689
 there is always something solved 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.020
 and the cars that the disaster I think I 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.470
 they will kill some they did 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.500
 but good at the end I'm lucky and finished 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.570
 out with the apache and they kill me two 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.750
 times but good is always the typical 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.420
 Once you alter you celebrate it and it kills you 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.560
 the typical final asshole there is if he was 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.560
 a little bit cool but good 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.380
 I have already left 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.700
 but nothing is what happens when 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.850
 we try to follow the gusts always 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.960
 you're a little freaked out and I'm scared and 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.420
 I'm champion but nothing now made up for it and 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.710
 I already go crazy in plan rambo and the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.260
 nice that do not kill me do not kill me 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.510
 until now all parties 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.750
 as always I have always said 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.970
 Well, the trick of the Apaches and 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:45.310
 the gentiles ac-130 to fuck are to put them 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.579
 and put on a class with a danger 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.650
 close if you put near danger and you use 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.660
 a support of these because you will kill a lot 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.110
 plus 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.250
 and here we come back with the Apache in which 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.140
 yesterday two days two days ago in a france 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.020
 he will respond amazing 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.760
 and here more of the same is not a thing 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.010
 so beast but practically the same 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.250
 fixes keep appearing there they appear 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.959
 they keep showing up when they leave 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.000
 You take a chat then separate in back or 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.520
 forward and the beautiful escalante I kill it and 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.920
 You see, they are failures of the call of duty 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.320
 that are still not fixed and do not 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.090
 they'll never ever fix and I'll play 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.810
 I play the eggs here in a taco that 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.720
 two will be even worse 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.120
 because this combined with 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.280
 is that it is also foolish because 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.960
 maps tell the latest example each 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.960
 they are bigger and 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.840
 and if it's bad, it's a thing 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.760
 incredible because let's see is logical 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.380
 if the maps are larger than normal 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.600
 would be that the respado was divided more 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.820
 because there is more room to appear then 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.460
 they do not do it the other way around they are it seems to me not 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.680
 I know what you think and nothing is already 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.580
 is ending now is when I get 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.150
 flipó there and I want to go pimp and the lió 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.150
 brown and kill me 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.930
 is the gameplay is a 27 to 2 in itself 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.790
 send someone wants it and nothing to 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.110
 here we have arrived for today leave me if 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.370
 you want in the comments some topic 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.420
 to talk about the next videos 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.850
 because the truth is that I was 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.070
 complaining and it's always interesting to talk 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.090
 of new things and nothing will be going 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.350
 saying goodbye and I hope that I have 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.940
 liked the video vote it favorites and 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.170
 voting favorites do not vote and add it to 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.400
 favorites if you liked it and want more 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.040
 And until next time 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.330
 goodbye 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.330
 but the thing
