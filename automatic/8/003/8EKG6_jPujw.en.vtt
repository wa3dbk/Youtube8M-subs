 24 how are you welcome to a new 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.040
 video this time of a special video today 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.559
 the day will be remembered because he has already 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.570
 come out the third and I hope not last 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.130
 adventure minecraft map this time 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.289
 created by me is worth the map is called 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.150
 avalanche is based on a story 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.699
 ok they are not real stories but although 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.650
 may have happened in the clear world 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.869
 fantastic from minecraft according to 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.939
 this map has been created entirely by 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.740
 I wanted to know how far I could 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.300
 arrive that I could create although the next 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.489
 map probably the safest thing is that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.530
 count on the help of several people 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.600
 but good this map is created by me 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.920
 you have a tutorial at the end of the video 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.410
 so you know how to download it 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.320
 install it without problems and now I leave you 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.629
 with the expected trailer of the map in 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.899
 seriously comment please what do you think 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.969
 when gays and remember you can not 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.410
 impart blocks and good to follow the 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.390
 instructions of the posters for 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.570
 follow the story a greeting and even the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.570
 next 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:15.260
 [Music] 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.110
 one 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.290
 [Music] 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.930
 [Music] 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:02:16.430
 [Music] 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.169
 [Music] 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.410
 well now comes the long-awaited question 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.090
 how do we download the avalanche map and what 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.190
 We install in our minecraft very 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.440
 simple go to the description of this 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.810
 video and you will find two links two 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.480
 links to download the two are 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.360
 exactly the same, take one of the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.670
 two to download what you put in your 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.930
 address bar of your browser 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.050
 I in this case I have it here I'm going to 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.050
 copy 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.980
 I have not copied you have to wait 5 seconds 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:01.500
 of advertising here you see it 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.060
 and once the five seconds have waited 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.340
 in the jump list advertising 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.170
 when you see it you can download it in 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.690
 the web that you have chosen 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.000
 in this case in game front you have to 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.280
 wait 5 seconds again for 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.110
 download once the window is open in 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.180
 the open with depends on the browser 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.489
 have I have the firefox mozilla 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.250
 firefox and here we have in the folder 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.700
 new world to install it is very 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:33.410
 simple let's start copying but from 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.080
 % app data yes 9% in case 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.090
 we want to play in individual we have 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.980
 I point minecraft open the folder 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.230
 we give to save that they are the departures 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.080
 saved in individual we go to the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.650
 winrar folder and we give here 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.680
 control more ce to copy we go to the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.260
 folder 6 we give control more v to 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.280
 paste and here we have folder 6 already 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.280
 we can enjoy it 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.470
 But now comes the other question how 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.659
 play online and put this map to 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.030
 other people to play with your friends 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.380
 very simple we go to the folder where 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.870
 have your server installed 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.770
 and in my case I have here several we are going to 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.600
 that of version 1.2 point 2 and here 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.220
 I have the folders 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.270
 in this case I'm going to save my folders 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.270
 so as not to lose any 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.390
 let's go winrar here we have the world 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:38.510
 again let's give ctrl that is 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:41.790
 control ce and here control more uve 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.600
 here we have the new world 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.120
 the renowned ones we put world 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.460
 and finally we open the server and the 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.590
 server will be responsible for transforming the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.590
 map for the multiplayer 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.530
 that has been a greeting and enjoy 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.530
 from the map until next time
