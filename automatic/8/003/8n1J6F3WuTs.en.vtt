00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
us and they're a bunch of a bunch of I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.100 
us and they're a bunch of a bunch of I
don't<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.759> doughnut<00:00:32.759> eaten<00:00:33.210> coffee

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
don't know doughnut eaten coffee

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.600 
don't know doughnut eaten coffee
drinking<00:00:34.649> bastards<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.460> guess<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.660> yes<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.950> would

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
drinking bastards I guess so yes I would

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.450 
drinking bastards I guess so yes I would
say<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:40.379> more<00:00:40.590> difficult<00:00:40.770> I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
say it's a little it's more difficult I

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.420 
say it's a little it's more difficult I
would<00:00:42.300> say<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.899> car<00:00:43.260> than<00:00:43.920> most<00:00:44.219> cars

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
would say with this car than most cars

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.450 
would say with this car than most cars
to<00:00:44.730> get<00:00:44.940> away<00:00:45.149> from<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.450> cops<00:00:45.629> because<00:00:45.899> it's

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
to get away from the cops because it's

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.389 
to get away from the cops because it's
heavier<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:47.940> slower<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.190> I've<00:00:50.190> talked

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
heavier and it's slower and I've talked

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.430 
heavier and it's slower and I've talked
about<00:00:50.640> both<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.149> benefits<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> heavy<00:00:52.170> car

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
about both the benefits of the heavy car

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.310 
about both the benefits of the heavy car
and<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.370> benefits<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> lightweight<00:00:54.899> car

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and the benefits of a lightweight car

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200 
and the benefits of a lightweight car
and<00:00:55.559> although<00:00:56.340> it's<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> benefit<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and although it's a benefit to have a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.319 
and although it's a benefit to have a
heavy<00:00:57.360> car<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.739> ram<00:00:59.670> cops<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
heavy car because you can ram cops and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.520 
heavy car because you can ram cops and
what<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:02.670> know<00:01:03.019> take<00:01:04.019> them<00:01:04.229> out<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
what not and you know take them out of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.940 
what not and you know take them out of
the<00:01:04.769> pursuit<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.430> also<00:01:06.270> i'd<00:01:06.810> say<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.650> fact

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the pursuit it's also i'd say the fact

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.640 
the pursuit it's also i'd say the fact
that<00:01:08.070> heavier<00:01:08.580> cars<00:01:08.960> artist<00:01:09.960> fast<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.530> are

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that heavier cars artist fast and are

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.370 
that heavier cars artist fast and are
harder<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.010> handle<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:12.210> ways<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.600> benefit

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
harder to handle out ways that benefit

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.149 
harder to handle out ways that benefit
of<00:01:13.890> being<00:01:14.130> able<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.430> take<00:01:14.610> them<00:01:14.790> out<00:01:14.939> but

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
of being able to take them out but

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
of being able to take them out but
basically<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.939> best<00:01:18.150> tips<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.479> give<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
basically I the best tips I can give you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.380 
basically I the best tips I can give you
for<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.740> running<00:01:20.189> cops<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.790> heavy<00:01:21.060> cars

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
for out running cops and heavy cars

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.710 
for out running cops and heavy cars
would<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:23.009> find<00:01:23.610> some<00:01:23.909> kind<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.240> roundabout

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
would be to find some kind of roundabout

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.770 
would be to find some kind of roundabout
like<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.290> did<00:01:25.530> right<00:01:25.650> there<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.340> where

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
like I just did right there like where

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
like I just did right there like where
the<00:01:27.780> roads<00:01:28.080> kind<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.500> twist<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.189> turn<00:01:29.400> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the roads kind of twist and turn and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.160 
the roads kind of twist and turn and
swerve<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> there's<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.750> lot<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.020> different

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
swerve and there's a lot of different

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.390 
swerve and there's a lot of different
ramps<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:34.020> an<00:01:34.140> easy<00:01:34.439> easy<00:01:34.710> way<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.280> rid

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
ramps it's an easy easy way to get rid

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300 
ramps it's an easy easy way to get rid
of<00:01:35.430> cops<00:01:35.729> there's<00:01:36.689> also<00:01:36.900> i<00:01:37.079> don't<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.890> i'm

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310

sure i'll show it to you guys eventually
i'll<00:01:40.110> point<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.439> out<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:40.860> there<00:01:41.549> was<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> video

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
i'll point it out but there was a video

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.929 
i'll point it out but there was a video
i<00:01:42.600> can't<00:01:42.930> remember<00:01:43.020> which<00:01:43.470> car<00:01:44.430> i<00:01:44.460> was<00:01:44.729> using
