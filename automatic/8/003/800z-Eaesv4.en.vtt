in<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:03.870> video<00:00:04.080> just<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.620> do<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.710> very

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
in this video just going to do a very

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.740 
in this video just going to do a very
quick<00:00:05.100> hardware<00:00:05.670> comparison<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.420> Sony

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
quick hardware comparison of the Sony

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.839 
quick hardware comparison of the Sony
Xperia<00:00:06.870> T<00:00:07.620> get<00:00:07.859> some<00:00:08.040> other<00:00:08.250> leading

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
Xperia T get some other leading

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.810 
Xperia T get some other leading
smartphones<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:10.349> starting<00:00:10.800> with<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.130> iphone

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
smartphones so starting with the iphone

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.999 
smartphones so starting with the iphone
5<00:00:12.269> let's<00:00:12.599> have<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.840> look<00:00:13.019> at<00:00:13.200> how<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.559> compares

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
5 let's have a look at how it compares

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.599 
5 let's have a look at how it compares
in<00:00:14.580> physical<00:00:15.450> size<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.590> can<00:00:16.740> see<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.130> T<00:00:17.430> is

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
in physical size so you can see the T is

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.730 
in physical size so you can see the T is
actually<00:00:18.060> considerably<00:00:18.960> bigger<00:00:19.199> ok<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
actually considerably bigger ok the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.790 
actually considerably bigger ok the
screen<00:00:20.100> size<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:21.500> quite<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> bit<00:00:22.769> different

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
screen size is quite a bit different

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.519 
screen size is quite a bit different
there's<00:00:23.490> probably<00:00:24.180> about<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.750> centimeters

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
there's probably about a centimeters

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.920 
there's probably about a centimeters
difference<00:00:26.070> they<00:00:27.060> were<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.480> under

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
difference they were just under

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.669 
difference they were just under
thickness<00:00:29.750> it's<00:00:30.750> quite<00:00:30.990> hard<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.410> tell

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
thickness it's quite hard to tell

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.630 
thickness it's quite hard to tell
because<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.669> curvature<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:34.280> Xperia<00:00:35.280> T

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
because the curvature of the Xperia T

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.139 
because the curvature of the Xperia T
slightly<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:36.750> very<00:00:37.079> similar<00:00:37.550> their<00:00:38.550> weight

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
slightly but very similar their weight

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.569 
slightly but very similar their weight
wise<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.750> iphone<00:00:40.170> 5<00:00:40.469> does<00:00:40.800> feel<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.370> little

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
wise the iphone 5 does feel that little

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.760 
wise the iphone 5 does feel that little
bit<00:00:41.879> lighter<00:00:42.510> here's<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.590> iphone<00:00:44.190> 4s<00:00:45.770> pair

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
bit lighter here's the iphone 4s pair

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.029 
bit lighter here's the iphone 4s pair
that<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.430> sort<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.360> similar<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
that up there sort of similar to the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.670 
that up there sort of similar to the
iphone<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.640> terms<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.079> iphone<00:00:52.440> 5

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
iphone in terms of the so the iphone 5

iphone in terms of the so the iphone 5
in<00:00:52.829> terms<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> width<00:00:53.520> difference<00:00:54.510> lot

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
in terms of the width difference lot

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.330 
in terms of the width difference lot
shorter<00:00:56.399> their<00:00:56.610> weight<00:00:57.770> more<00:00:58.770> comparable

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
shorter their weight more comparable

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.070 
shorter their weight more comparable
possibly<00:00:59.910> iphone<00:01:00.559> 4s<00:01:01.559> weighing<00:01:02.039> slightly

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
possibly iphone 4s weighing slightly

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.520 
possibly iphone 4s weighing slightly
slightly<00:01:04.080> more<00:01:04.970> thickness<00:01:05.970> wise<00:01:06.530> fairly

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
slightly more thickness wise fairly

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.370 
slightly more thickness wise fairly
similar<00:01:08.070> not<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> lot<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.330> speak<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.229> in

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
similar not a lot to speak of it in

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.109 
similar not a lot to speak of it in
terms<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.740> differences<00:01:11.280> got<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> HTC<00:01:12.240> One<00:01:13.140> X

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
terms of differences got the HTC One X

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.670 
terms of differences got the HTC One X
much<00:01:15.119> more<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.540> par<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.290> terms<00:01:16.530> of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
much more on par with that in terms of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.820 
much more on par with that in terms of
actual<00:01:17.040> size<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.549> Xperia<00:01:18.119> T<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.830> squarer

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
actual size the Xperia T is squarer

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.179 
actual size the Xperia T is squarer
thickness<00:01:20.960> sort<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.049> fairly<00:01:22.710> comparable

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
thickness sort of fairly comparable

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.760 
thickness sort of fairly comparable
again<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.000> say<00:01:24.770> weight-wise

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
again I would actually say weight-wise

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.969 
again I would actually say weight-wise
probably<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> Xperia<00:01:27.420> feels<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.020> heavier<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
probably the Xperia feels the heavier of

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.100 
probably the Xperia feels the heavier of
the<00:01:29.340> two<00:01:29.689> got<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> samsung<00:01:31.020> galaxy<00:01:31.229> s3<00:01:32.869> so<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the two got the samsung galaxy s3 so the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.980 
the two got the samsung galaxy s3 so the
Xperia<00:01:34.560> T<00:01:34.740> agains<00:01:35.130> much<00:01:35.460> squarer<00:01:36.030> you've<00:01:36.869> got

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
Xperia T agains much squarer you've got

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
Xperia T agains much squarer you've got
the<00:01:37.079> corner<00:01:37.439> sort<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.650> poking<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.250> side<00:01:38.549> here

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the corner sort of poking out side here

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.270 
the corner sort of poking out side here
but<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> s3<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.020> what<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.350> curvature<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.100> do

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
but the s3 is what this curvature and do

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.300 
but the s3 is what this curvature and do
bear<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.579> mind<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.030> has<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> bigger<00:01:42.780> screen

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
bear in mind it has a bigger screen

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.920 
bear in mind it has a bigger screen
thickness<00:01:44.310> wise<00:01:45.140> again<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.759> similar<00:01:47.930> weight

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
thickness wise again it's similar weight

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.160 
thickness wise again it's similar weight
wise<00:01:49.110> very<00:01:49.530> similar<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:51.689> finally

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
wise very similar to and then finally

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.880 
wise very similar to and then finally
the<00:01:52.409> samsung<00:01:53.159> galaxy<00:01:53.189> s2<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> screen<00:01:55.680> on

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
the samsung galaxy s2 so the screen on

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.740 
the samsung galaxy s2 so the screen on
the<00:01:56.009> exterior<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:57.000> bit<00:01:57.240> bigger<00:01:57.509> than<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
the exterior is a bit bigger than the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.160 
the exterior is a bit bigger than the
galaxy<00:01:58.290> s2<00:01:58.700> size-wise<00:01:59.700> though<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.420> very

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
galaxy s2 size-wise though very very

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.359 
galaxy s2 size-wise though very very
similar<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:02.460> an<00:02:02.579> awful<00:02:03.030> lot<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.750> difference

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
similar not an awful lot of difference

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.580 
similar not an awful lot of difference
thickness<00:02:05.369> wise<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.110> think<00:02:07.110> probably<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
thickness wise I think probably the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.750 
thickness wise I think probably the
galaxy<00:02:08.280> s2<00:02:09.110> just<00:02:10.110> has<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> curvature

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
galaxy s2 just has it but the curvature

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
galaxy s2 just has it but the curvature
again<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.150> deceptive

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
again is deceptive

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
again is deceptive
in<00:02:13.710> terms<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.130> one<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.700> wait<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.210> Xperia

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
in terms of that one and wait the Xperia

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.780 
in terms of that one and wait the Xperia
feels<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.560> heavier<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.370> that's<00:02:17.490> just<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.760> quick

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
feels the heavier so that's just a quick

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.640 
feels the heavier so that's just a quick
hardware<00:02:18.450> comparison<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.170> expiry

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
hardware comparison of the expiry

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.480 
hardware comparison of the expiry
against<00:02:20.130> some<00:02:20.310> other<00:02:20.490> smartphones
