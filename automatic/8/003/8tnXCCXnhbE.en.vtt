on the dev server the information known

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.000 
on the dev server the information known
about<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.360> simple<00:00:15.750> Isle<00:00:16.260> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
about it is that it's a simple Isle to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.250 
about it is that it's a simple Isle to
em<00:00:17.240> just<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> ones<00:00:18.720> already<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
em just like the ones already in the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.150 
em just like the ones already in the
game<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:20.070> only<00:00:20.310> difference<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.859> know<00:00:22.859> so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
game the only difference that I know so

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.029 
game the only difference that I know so
far<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.269> has<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.720> custom<00:00:25.560> paint<00:00:25.740> scheme

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
far is that it has a custom paint scheme

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.509 
far is that it has a custom paint scheme
on<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.539> case<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:28.109> called<00:00:28.519> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
on it and in this case it's called the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.179 
on it and in this case it's called the
Avenger<00:00:30.029> paint<00:00:30.510> scheme<00:00:30.750> I'm<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:31.740> sure<00:00:31.949> what

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
Avenger paint scheme I'm not sure what

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.479 
Avenger paint scheme I'm not sure what
it<00:00:32.340> says<00:00:32.489> inside<00:00:33.140> I<00:00:34.140> tried<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.309> some

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
it says inside I tried to do some

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.440 
it says inside I tried to do some
research<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
research on it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.630 
research on it
couldn't<00:00:37.170> find<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.620> much<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> most<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
couldn't find very much on it the most I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.810 
couldn't find very much on it the most I
could<00:00:38.790> find<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> model<00:00:40.170> kit<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.890> has<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
could find is a model kit that has the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.450 
could find is a model kit that has the
same<00:00:42.030> paint<00:00:42.300> scheme<00:00:42.540> as<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.800> which<00:00:43.800> has<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
same paint scheme as it which has the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.450 
same paint scheme as it which has the
markings<00:00:44.879> apparently<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:46.160> tactical<00:00:47.160> number

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460

regiment of the Soviet Union of 1944 and
1945<00:00:56.160> which<00:00:56.670> seems<00:00:56.910> fairly<00:00:57.149> accurate<00:00:57.690> but

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
1945 which seems fairly accurate but

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.139 
1945 which seems fairly accurate but
then<00:00:58.079> again<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.739> simply<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.250> model<00:00:59.730> website

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
then again it is simply a model website

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.939 
then again it is simply a model website
and<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.660> can't<00:01:00.960> verify<00:01:01.699> those<00:01:02.699> details<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.949> I'm

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
and I can't verify those details so I'm

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.289 
and I can't verify those details so I'm
just<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.000> normal<00:01:06.180> il-2<00:01:06.780> M<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.200> has<00:01:08.299> 223

so<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:02.970> I'm<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.170> simply<00:02:04.620> go<00:02:05.010> and<00:02:05.250> take

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
so now I'm going to simply go and take

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.139 
so now I'm going to simply go and take
out<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.700> Eagle<00:02:06.320> as<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:08.010> said<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:09.000> not

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
out of Eagle as I said it's not

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
out of Eagle as I said it's not
different<00:02:09.869> from<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.140> dome<00:02:10.290> while<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.980> them<00:02:11.160> as

different from the dome while to them as

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.560 
different from the dome while to them as
far<00:02:11.640> as<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.820> can<00:02:11.880> tell<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.980> simply<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:15.030> paint

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
far as I can tell it's simply a paint

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.850 
far as I can tell it's simply a paint
scheme<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:16.770> course<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:18.050> Russian<00:02:19.050> premium

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
scheme of course it is a Russian premium

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.080 
scheme of course it is a Russian premium
plane<00:02:21.680> not<00:02:22.680> sure<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.190> cost<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.880> right<00:02:24.060> now
