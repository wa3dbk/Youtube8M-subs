 for Alejandro arribas la tapo kiko 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.700
 box at the moment the clearest the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 party of a thing of the system the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.910
 replica of the Spanish serves there may be 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.619
 get the first one saves sevilla the ground 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.560
 the collegiate hospital is asked for a penalty 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.660
 vice penalty and we'll see if yellow who 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.520
 it's from the yellow veto grill 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.620
 hope and favorable in Spanish 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 we already have typical mess played in which 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.430
 no one left contains that yellow 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.410
 very clear that yellow goes to the corner 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.410
 it goes to the corner that yellow 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.860
 the footballers of espanyol eat it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.010
 understanding that it is a red card for the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.200
 seville goalkeeper protests the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.730
 local team of the hispalenses go in 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.530
 contrary direction understand that no 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.460
 there was a penalty that there was no lack of veto 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.460
 let's not give again 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 without the lack of more than obvious will go with 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.030
 the foot up and I think it 's up 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.060
 even above the waist if the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.850
 protest can be what to ask for red 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.550
 has more arguments where to put the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.920
 foot the boot where the ball goes 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.960
 I played goal manifest is not so much 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.000
 because it goes to the corneal with it 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.490
 pull the car very long pass for that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.760
 sure it is not red now well if the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.490
 impact of the boot is at the height of the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.259
 knee then there they can ask 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.259
 I started stuart and for the first one this 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.560
 but with the 15th match where 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.420
 christian stuani executed from the inside 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.460
 of the right foot adjusted to the pole 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.190
 Beto guesses the intention but not 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.840
 manages to cover the shot, the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.240
 espanyol in seville brand christian 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.180
 stuani sevilla 0 espanyol 1 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.210
 once protesting as you said nobody and 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.850
 happy in the previous action but the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.090
 espanyol with advantage we will not see what 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.780
 incidence has he who stays in 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.850
 11 against 11 is clear if on goal 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.090
 they have superior to numerical you get 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.090
 much
