00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
so because it's a cabbage and not a leaf

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.400 
so because it's a cabbage and not a leaf
it<00:01:00.340> has<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.579> really<00:01:00.850> tough<00:01:01.239> outer<00:01:01.600> layer<00:01:02.020> so<00:01:02.350> if

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
it has a really tough outer layer so if

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.770 
it has a really tough outer layer so if
you<00:01:02.530> put<00:01:02.710> it<00:01:02.860> in<00:01:02.950> salads<00:01:03.520> and<00:01:03.610> things<00:01:03.670> raw<00:01:04.149> get

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.339 
it does is that it weakens that tough
outer<00:01:42.670> membrane<00:01:43.119> and<00:01:43.329> makes<00:01:43.509> it<00:01:43.659> easier<00:01:44.079> to

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:44.349 
outer membrane and makes it easier to

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:46.230 
outer membrane and makes it easier to
eat<00:01:44.560> raw<00:01:45.039> so<00:01:45.700> you're<00:01:45.789> going<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:45.969> need<00:01:46.060> some

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
eat raw so you're going to need some

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.909 
eat raw so you're going to need some
salt<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.689> pepper<00:01:46.869> I<00:01:47.169> have<00:01:47.349> just<00:01:47.499> assault<00:01:47.799> and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:47.919 
salt and pepper I have just assault and

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:50.609 
salt and pepper I have just assault and
pepper<00:01:48.069> mix<00:01:48.399> just<00:01:49.119> sprinkle<00:01:49.599> it<00:01:49.659> around<00:01:49.749> and

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
pepper mix just sprinkle it around and

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.679 
pepper mix just sprinkle it around and
then<00:01:50.740> you're<00:01:50.859> going<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.039> need<00:01:51.279> oil<00:01:51.969> so<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.270> can

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
then you're going to need oil so you can

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.379 
then you're going to need oil so you can
use<00:01:52.990> olive<00:01:53.649> oil<00:01:53.799> coconut<00:01:54.340> oil<00:01:54.609> that's<00:01:54.969> melted

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:55.389 
use olive oil coconut oil that's melted

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.449 
use olive oil coconut oil that's melted
which<00:01:55.539> is<00:01:55.659> what<00:01:55.779> I'm<00:01:55.959> using<00:01:56.369> walnut<00:01:57.369> oil

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
which is what I'm using walnut oil

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.580 
which is what I'm using walnut oil
peanut<00:01:57.939> oil<00:01:58.209> any<00:01:58.569> oil<00:01:58.869> that<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.169> want<00:01:59.380> you

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
peanut oil any oil that you want you

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.719 
peanut oil any oil that you want you
just<00:01:59.799> want<00:02:00.009> something<00:02:00.279> that<00:02:00.399> is<00:02:00.429> going<00:02:00.549> to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
just want something that is going to

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.269 
just want something that is going to
lubricate<00:02:01.419> the<00:02:01.479> experience<00:02:02.169> and<00:02:02.380> make<00:02:02.829> the

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:03.279 
lubricate the experience and make the

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:05.669 
lubricate the experience and make the
kale<00:02:03.489> sort<00:02:03.759> of<00:02:03.819> yield<00:02:04.090> more<00:02:04.450> easily<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:05.529> I'm

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
kale sort of yield more easily so I'm

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:06.520 
kale sort of yield more easily so I'm
using<00:02:05.889> coconut

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
using coconut

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.630

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
oil melted or raw and massaging tail is

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.000 
oil melted or raw and massaging tail is
exactly<00:02:11.090> what<00:02:11.240> it<00:02:11.330> sounds<00:02:11.720> like<00:02:12.010> massaging

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
exactly what it sounds like massaging

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.600

one<00:05:45.050> of<00:05:45.080> those<00:05:45.229> vegetable<00:05:45.740> washes<00:05:46.070> that

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
one of those vegetable washes that

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.710 
one of those vegetable washes that
you're<00:05:46.310> able<00:05:46.430> to<00:05:46.610> wash<00:05:46.880> away<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.150> pesticide

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
you're able to wash away the pesticide

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.990 
you're able to wash away the pesticide
residue<00:05:48.139> that's<00:05:48.289> not<00:05:48.620> possible<00:05:49.000> because

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
residue that's not possible because

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.149 
residue that's not possible because
they're<00:05:50.360> sprayed<00:05:50.780> continually<00:05:51.560> so<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.889> skin

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
they're sprayed continually so the skin

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.670 
they're sprayed continually so the skin
grows<00:05:52.550> with<00:05:53.330> pesticides<00:05:53.930> in<00:05:54.110> it<00:05:54.199> so<00:05:54.380> it's<00:05:54.500> more

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
grows with pesticides in it so it's more

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.430 
grows with pesticides in it so it's more
than<00:05:54.860> just<00:05:54.919> a<00:05:55.220> light<00:05:55.699> can<00:05:55.970> scrub<00:05:56.360> it<00:05:56.479> away<00:05:56.659> so

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
than just a light can scrub it away so

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.310 
than just a light can scrub it away so
