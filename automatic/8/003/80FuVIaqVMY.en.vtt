00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
which are on the side because they do

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.429 
which are on the side because they do
look<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.759> bit<00:01:56.789> spammy<00:01:57.329> especially<00:01:57.960> links<00:01:58.259> which

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
look a bit spammy especially links which

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.609 
look a bit spammy especially links which
are<00:01:58.680> way<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.640> footer<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.689> same<00:02:01.020> deal

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
are way in the footer the same deal

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.340 
are way in the footer the same deal
comes<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.640> as<00:02:02.909> well<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.140> really

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
comes with that as well so if you really

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.039 
comes with that as well so if you really
want<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.159> get<00:02:05.759> good<00:02:05.939> backlinks<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.810> need

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
want to get good backlinks you need

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.080 
want to get good backlinks you need
something<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:07.799> relevant<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.520> your<00:02:08.820> site

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
something that's relevant to your site

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.660 
something that's relevant to your site
so<00:02:09.810> say<00:02:10.019> for<00:02:10.050> example<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> web

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so say for example if you have a web

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.550 
so say for example if you have a web
development<00:02:12.269> site<00:02:12.480> having<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.989> link<00:02:13.230> on

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
development site having a link on

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.559 
development site having a link on
page<00:02:13.739> which<00:02:14.099> is<00:02:14.130> do<00:02:14.580> follow<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.239> have<00:02:15.390> two

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
of their links as nofollow so it's very

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.280

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
founders of google page but a lot of

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.020 
founders of google page but a lot of
people<00:03:25.530> do<00:03:25.680> get<00:03:25.920> tricked<00:03:26.250> into<00:03:26.340> thinking<00:03:26.549> it's

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
people do get tricked into thinking it's

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.840 
people do get tricked into thinking it's
to<00:03:27.180> do<00:03:27.359> with<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:28.109> actual<00:03:28.290> page<00:03:28.769> but<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.370> guess

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
to do with the actual page but I guess

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.640 
to do with the actual page but I guess
it<00:03:30.030> does<00:03:30.239> really<00:03:30.780> relate<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.440> page

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
it does really relate to the page

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.349 
it does really relate to the page
because<00:03:31.829> every<00:03:32.190> page<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.670> website<00:03:32.700> does

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
because every page on a website does

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.780 
because every page on a website does
have<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.959> different<00:03:34.709> amount<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.370> page<00:03:35.760> rank

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
have a different amount of page rank

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.650 
have a different amount of page rank
like<00:03:36.540> for<00:03:36.930> example<00:03:37.019> most<00:03:37.950> websites<00:03:38.730> if<00:03:39.299> we

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
like for example most websites if we

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.470 
like for example most websites if we
look<00:03:40.440> at<00:03:40.650> this<00:03:41.010> website<00:03:41.370> I've<00:03:41.730> got<00:03:41.910> over<00:03:42.150> here

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
look at this website I've got over here

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.690 
look at this website I've got over here
it's<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:43.139> page<00:03:43.380> rank<00:03:43.680> three<00:03:44.010> you'll<00:03:44.190> often<00:03:44.489> find

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
it's a page rank three you'll often find

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.960 
it's a page rank three you'll often find
that<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.389> sub<00:03:45.660> pages<00:03:45.959> are<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.889> little<00:03:47.370> bit<00:03:47.639> less

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
that the sub pages are a little bit less

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.349 
that the sub pages are a little bit less
page<00:03:48.690> rank<00:03:49.019> than<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.380> main<00:03:49.590> page<00:03:50.359> anyway

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
page rank than the main page anyway

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.030 
page rank than the main page anyway
that's<00:03:51.540> something<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.079> think<00:03:52.260> about<00:03:52.560> there

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
that's something to think about there

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.160 
that's something to think about there
because<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.239> highest<00:03:54.630> page<00:03:54.810> rank<00:03:55.049> is

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
because the the highest page rank is

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.900 
because the the highest page rank is
normally<00:03:55.680> on<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.889> homepage<00:03:56.100> it's<00:03:56.609> always

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
normally on the homepage it's always

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.000 
normally on the homepage it's always
good<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.150> get<00:03:57.389> a<00:03:57.450> backlink<00:03:58.019> from<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.530> page<00:03:58.739> so

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
good to get a backlink from that page so

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.949 
good to get a backlink from that page so
if<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.310> were<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.489> get<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.910> link<00:04:00.450> from<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.780> main

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
if you were to get a link from the main

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.599 
if you were to get a link from the main
page<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.260> Wikipedia<00:04:01.980> we'll<00:04:02.130> just<00:04:02.250> click<00:04:02.430> on

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
page of Wikipedia we'll just click on

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.030 
page of Wikipedia we'll just click on
the<00:04:02.760> icon<00:04:03.420> here<00:04:03.840> so<00:04:04.230> this<00:04:04.350> is<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.530> main<00:04:04.799> page

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
the icon here so this is the main page

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.849 
the icon here so this is the main page
you'll<00:04:05.670> see<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:06.209> pages<00:04:06.750> actually<00:04:06.900> got<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.440> PR

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
you'll see that pages actually got a PR

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.789 
you'll see that pages actually got a PR
eight<00:04:08.359> so<00:04:09.359> it's<00:04:09.959> either<00:04:10.139> link<00:04:10.470> on<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.709> page

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
eight so it's either link on this page

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.759 
eight so it's either link on this page
would<00:04:11.250> be<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:11.730> much<00:04:11.940> better<00:04:12.150> than<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:13.170> web

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
would be so much better than the web

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.710 
would be so much better than the web
development<00:04:14.190> page<00:04:14.459> however<00:04:14.760> if<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.389> were<00:04:15.540> in

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
development page however if you were in

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.879 
development page however if you were in
the<00:04:15.930> web<00:04:16.620> development<00:04:17.160> me

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
the web development me

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.270 
the web development me
it<00:04:18.370> could<00:04:18.789> actually<00:04:19.620> counter<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:21.249> argument

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
it could actually counter that argument

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.909 
it could actually counter that argument
because<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.360> is<00:04:22.479> more<00:04:22.719> related<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.349> your

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
because it is more related to your

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.600 
because it is more related to your
actual<00:04:24.639> site<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.960> get<00:04:26.110> links<00:04:26.979> on<00:04:27.189> these<00:04:27.370> pages

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
actual site to get links on these pages

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.360 
actual site to get links on these pages
you<00:04:28.029> have<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.509> be<00:04:28.629> such<00:04:28.930> an<00:04:29.139> authority<00:04:29.370> because

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
you have to be such an authority because

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.129 
you have to be such an authority because
Wikipedia<00:04:31.150> doesn't<00:04:31.479> really<00:04:31.599> like<00:04:31.870> giving

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
Wikipedia doesn't really like giving

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.200 
Wikipedia doesn't really like giving
links<00:04:32.409> away<00:04:32.740> because<00:04:33.370> they<00:04:33.550> like<00:04:33.879> to<00:04:33.999> see

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
links away because they like to see

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.659 
links away because they like to see
themselves<00:04:34.419> as<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.139> authority<00:04:35.800> encyclopedia

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
themselves as the authority encyclopedia

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.700 
themselves as the authority encyclopedia
on<00:04:36.879> the<00:04:36.909> web<00:04:36.999> site<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:37.990> anyway<00:04:38.289> I<00:04:38.319> think<00:04:38.469> that

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
on the web site so anyway I think that

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.399 
on the web site so anyway I think that
covers<00:04:38.949> a<00:04:39.310> bit<00:04:39.550> about<00:04:39.759> that<00:04:40.029> also<00:04:40.749> when<00:04:41.229> we're

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
covers a bit about that also when we're

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.950 
covers a bit about that also when we're
talking<00:04:41.590> about<00:04:42.419> relevance<00:04:43.419> you<00:04:43.629> can<00:04:43.779> also

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
talking about relevance you can also

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.070 
talking about relevance you can also
have<00:04:44.259> a<00:04:44.289> look<00:04:44.469> at<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.740> video<00:04:44.979> on<00:04:45.699> anchor<00:04:46.659> text

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
have a look at the video on anchor text

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.589 
have a look at the video on anchor text
and<00:04:47.439> context<00:04:47.560> is<00:04:47.860> very<00:04:48.069> important<00:04:48.789> you<00:04:49.419> want

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
and context is very important you want

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.439 
and context is very important you want
to<00:04:49.689> get<00:04:49.810> variants<00:04:50.319> in<00:04:50.560> that<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:51.009> also<00:04:51.449> you

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
to get variants in that and also you

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:54.480 
to get variants in that and also you
want<00:04:52.659> to<00:04:52.779> get<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.930> variety<00:04:53.409> of<00:04:53.710> IP<00:04:54.250> addresses

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
want to get a variety of IP addresses

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.809 
want to get a variety of IP addresses
linking<00:04:55.360> there<00:04:55.599> to<00:04:56.229> your<00:04:56.349> website<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.129> for

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
linking there to your website so for

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.779 
linking there to your website so for
example<00:04:57.909> if<00:04:58.509> all<00:04:58.779> your<00:04:59.439> links<00:05:00.250> were<00:05:00.460> coming

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
example if all your links were coming

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.719 
example if all your links were coming
from<00:05:00.939> the<00:05:01.029> same<00:05:01.330> ip<00:05:01.659> address<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.500> just<00:05:03.219> looks<00:05:03.490> a

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
from the same ip address it just looks a

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.820 
from the same ip address it just looks a
little<00:05:03.909> very<00:05:04.330> artificial<00:05:04.750> but<00:05:05.469> if<00:05:05.650> it's

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
little very artificial but if it's

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.100 
little very artificial but if it's
coming<00:05:06.069> from<00:05:06.189> a<00:05:06.400> variety<00:05:06.669> of<00:05:07.090> IP<00:05:07.389> addresses<00:05:07.599> it

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
coming from a variety of IP addresses it

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.170 
coming from a variety of IP addresses it
looks<00:05:08.289> more<00:05:08.469> normal<00:05:08.680> same<00:05:09.189> when<00:05:09.400> it<00:05:09.520> comes<00:05:09.789> to

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
looks more normal same when it comes to

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.629 
looks more normal same when it comes to
anchor<00:05:10.779> text<00:05:11.110> variation<00:05:11.830> if<00:05:12.099> you<00:05:12.219> have<00:05:12.400> it<00:05:12.490> all

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
anchor text variation if you have it all

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.490 
anchor text variation if you have it all
from<00:05:12.789> the<00:05:12.969> same<00:05:13.180> keyword<00:05:13.689> it<00:05:14.199> looks

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
from the same keyword it looks

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.439 
from the same keyword it looks
artificial<00:05:15.219> like<00:05:15.370> you've<00:05:15.520> done<00:05:15.580> it<00:05:15.879> using<00:05:16.089> a

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
artificial like you've done it using a

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.589 
artificial like you've done it using a
program<00:05:16.719> if<00:05:17.199> you<00:05:17.740> use<00:05:18.009> many<00:05:18.699> variables<00:05:19.360> and

to put the same anchor text when they

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
variance of anchor text some sites are

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.480 
variance of anchor text some sites are
natural<00:05:38.259> and<00:05:38.469> they<00:05:38.620> do<00:05:38.680> get<00:05:39.039> penalties

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
natural and they do get penalties

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.929 
natural and they do get penalties
because<00:05:40.479> a<00:05:40.779> lot<00:05:41.379> of<00:05:41.409> people<00:05:41.770> have<00:05:42.189> sort<00:05:42.879> of

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:42.939 
because a lot of people have sort of

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:46.170 
because a lot of people have sort of
linked<00:05:43.599> with<00:05:43.779> that<00:05:43.930> same<00:05:44.199> text<00:05:44.560> but<00:05:44.949> in<00:05:45.250> normal

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
linked with that same text but in normal

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.439 
linked with that same text but in normal
occurrence<00:05:46.960> there<00:05:47.680> are<00:05:47.949> very<00:05:48.339> many<00:05:48.639> variables

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
occurrence there are very many variables

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.420 
occurrence there are very many variables
that<00:05:49.539> come<00:05:49.810> out<00:05:50.080> there<00:05:50.680> I<00:05:50.800> think<00:05:50.889> I've<00:05:51.159> sort<00:05:51.399> of

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
that come out there I think I've sort of

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.969 
that come out there I think I've sort of
covered<00:05:51.879> what<00:05:52.659> makes<00:05:52.839> a<00:05:52.990> good<00:05:53.139> backlink<00:05:53.680> I

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
covered what makes a good backlink I

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.070 
covered what makes a good backlink I
guess<00:05:54.399> the<00:05:54.520> key<00:05:54.699> points<00:05:55.089> are<00:05:55.180> here<00:05:55.509> is<00:05:55.689> to<00:05:55.899> get
