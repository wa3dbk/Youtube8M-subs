 future consoles the wii or at least 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.899
 250 euros 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:22.920
 burn out is not dead hi everyone and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:24.930
 the clip of the day after the 3 and the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.160
 some tantalizing demo videos that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.260
 gave us a glimpse of the next 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.119
 generation of living room consoles on 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.900
 now waiting for concrete info from 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.730
 the part of the studios 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.050
 this weekend it's epic games that has 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.940
 clearly stated to be in the process of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.910
 work on titles intended for the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.890
 ps4 and the xbox 3 it's michael 100 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.480
 people president of epic games studio 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.340
 who announced the info he even said 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.700
 very excited by the development in 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.020
 course 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.270
 maybe a young return home 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.160
 theater or a bullet storm 2 are part 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.050
 of the lot it will have to be patient because 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.949
 nothing has been shown by epic yet 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.949
 games at the 30 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.570
 it's the game of the right price on the part of 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.760
 nintendo around his future console 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.619
 salon during the e3 satoru president 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.840
 iwata had indicated that the price of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.580
 wii u would be greater than 200 euros 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.890
 this weekend in an interview granted 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.350
 at the American site ign the boss of 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.939
 Nintendo of America has announced that the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.439
 audience would be pleasantly surprised by 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.090
 the selling price of the console 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.280
 it could thus be sold to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.259
 around 300 dollars in the United States 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.390
 if you convert your tariffs into euros 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.950
 I arrive at around 250 euros 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.630
 but as is often the case 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.040
 in high-tech products the rate of 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.049
 conversion could very well do 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.700
 climb the price to 300 euros 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.200
 it would not be the first time that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.299
 happens the builders having the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 unfortunate tendency to increase the price in 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.970
 from one continent to another is 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.970
 so a case to follow 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.120
 the cult burnout paradise did 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.860
 the beautiful hours of the living room consoles 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.690
 a few years ago and friendly 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.700
 walk in the city of paradise city to 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.680
 looking for a garage of a station 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.180
 essence and of course the most route 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.010
 right possible to succeed the most 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.600
 amazing is that this speed and 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.430
 unfortunately remained without further action 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.020
 there was a burnout crash but that was 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.090
 been endowed with gameplay completely 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.810
 different is sold only in 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.460

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.470
 good news for all fans of 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.360
 speed in open mode criterium studio 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.340
