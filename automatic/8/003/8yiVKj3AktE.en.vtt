00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
now it's really really important to be

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180 
now it's really really important to be
able<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.420> know<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.600> difference<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.440> how<00:00:35.130> to

identify<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:36.149> venomous<00:00:36.660> snake<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:38.430> can

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
identify a venomous snake because it can

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.880 
identify a venomous snake because it can
decipher<00:00:39.239> life<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.899> situation<00:00:40.469> pretty

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
decipher life in this situation pretty

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.510 
decipher life in this situation pretty
quickly

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
quickly

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.750 
quickly
now<00:00:41.790> we're<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> start<00:00:42.360> off<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:43.760> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
now we're going to start off with the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.270 
now we're going to start off with the
head<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.480> head<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.170> venomous<00:00:46.500> snake<00:00:46.559> due<00:00:47.160> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
head the head of a venomous snake due to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.729 
head the head of a venomous snake due to
the<00:00:47.399> venom<00:00:47.730> glands<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.840> caused<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.680> be

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the venom glands it caused it to be

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.180 
the venom glands it caused it to be
shaped<00:00:50.010> triangularly<00:00:51.500> triangularly<00:00:52.500> now

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
shaped triangularly triangularly now

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.610 
shaped triangularly triangularly now
that's<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.579> word<00:00:53.699> we'll<00:00:54.300> go<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.780> anyway<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that's a word we'll go with it anyway it

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.430 
that's a word we'll go with it anyway it
gives<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.070> triangular<00:00:56.850> shape<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
gives it a triangular shape now this is

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.920 
gives it a triangular shape now this is
not<00:00:58.590> always<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.949> foolproof<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.940> because<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> lot

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
not always a foolproof way because a lot

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.770 
not always a foolproof way because a lot
of<00:01:00.960> non-venomous<00:01:01.800> snakes<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.670> lot<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.390> water

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
of non-venomous snakes a lot of water

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.219 
of non-venomous snakes a lot of water
snakes<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.379> found<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.729> than<00:01:05.970> most

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
snakes I found out more so than most

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.810 
snakes I found out more so than most
whenever<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:07.439> become<00:01:07.950> aggressive<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.000 
defensive and they're aggravated they
will<00:01:12.030> spread<00:01:12.390> their<00:01:12.600> body<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:13.110> real<00:01:13.530> flat<00:01:13.860> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
will spread their body out real flat to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.440 
will spread their body out real flat to
make<00:01:14.130> themselves<00:01:14.310> look<00:01:14.610> larger<00:01:15.060> than<00:01:15.090> life<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
make themselves look larger than life to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.950 
make themselves look larger than life to
try<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> scare<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.460> predator<00:01:18.000> away<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.659> in

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
doing that their heads become triangular

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.350 
doing that their heads become triangular
shape<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.640> their<00:01:23.759> jaw<00:01:24.030> bones

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
shape because of their jaw bones

shape because of their jaw bones
protruding<00:01:24.600> outward<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.130> just

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
protruding outward that is just

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.580 
protruding outward that is just
everybody's<00:01:27.150> normal<00:01:27.750> way<00:01:28.110> there's<00:01:28.439> a
