your<00:02:48.710> math<00:02:48.860> days<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:50.600> if<00:02:50.960> I<00:02:51.200> increase<00:02:51.710> these

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
your math days so if I increase these

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.420 
your math days so if I increase these
numbers<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:53.150> can<00:02:53.360> see<00:02:53.690> that<00:02:54.430> watermark

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
it's not quite in position you can take

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.920 
it's not quite in position you can take
these<00:03:02.240> offsets<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.230> really<00:03:04.220> set<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.940> where

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
these offsets and really set it where

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.530 
these offsets and really set it where
you'd<00:03:06.110> like<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.380> watermark<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.310> be<00:03:07.540> located

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
if you have your watermark in the lower

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
maybe what you want to do is put it in

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.570 
maybe what you want to do is put it in
the<00:03:18.200> center<00:03:19.450> but<00:03:20.450> we<00:03:20.660> want<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:20.990> make<00:03:21.140> this

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
the center but we want to make this

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.699 
the center but we want to make this
image<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:24.880> little<00:03:25.880> less<00:03:26.150> dark<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:27.440> it

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
image a little less dark so that it

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.540 
image a little less dark so that it

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
doesn't take away from the image itself

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.530 
doesn't take away from the image itself
but<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.780> still<00:03:33.410> protects<00:03:33.950> our<00:03:34.280> digital<00:03:35.060> copy

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.010 
there it is and it looks like I might
need<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.600> scale<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.650> just<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.950> little<00:04:32.190> bit<00:04:33.020> make

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
need to scale it just a little bit make

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.430 
need to scale it just a little bit make
it<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.170> little<00:04:34.200> bigger<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.570> then<00:04:36.570> I<00:04:36.600> can<00:04:36.870> reduce

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
it a little bigger and then I can reduce

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.510 
it a little bigger and then I can reduce
