it's that easy so in this current
configuration<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.110> have<00:01:06.290> your<00:01:06.500> bullet

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
configuration you have your bullet

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.510 
configuration you have your bullet

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
most configurations your bullet weight

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.350 
most configurations your bullet weight
is<00:01:13.810> right<00:01:14.810> on<00:01:15.080> top<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.680> your<00:01:16.160> soft<00:01:16.730> plastic

out<00:01:21.980> of<00:01:22.130> this<00:01:22.250> particular<00:01:22.790> configuration

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
out of this particular configuration

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.230 
out of this particular configuration
it's<00:01:25.130> not<00:01:25.400> gonna<00:01:25.550> make<00:01:25.760> a<00:01:25.820> lot<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.030> noise

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
it's not gonna make a lot of noise

I like to do is I like to get a glass

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.700 
I like to do is I like to get a glass
bead<00:01:38.900> I<00:01:39.910> didn't<00:01:40.910> use<00:01:41.030> clear<00:01:41.600> something<00:01:42.470> that's

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
bead I didn't use clear something that's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.300 
bead I didn't use clear something that's
kind<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:42.950> reflective<00:01:43.490> I<00:01:44.590> will<00:01:45.590> use<00:01:45.800> this<00:01:45.980> more

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
kind of reflective I will use this more

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.330 
kind of reflective I will use this more
in<00:01:46.690> murkier<00:01:47.690> water<00:01:48.020> than<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.590> do<00:01:48.710> in<00:01:49.010> clear

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
in murkier water than I do in clear

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.330 
in murkier water than I do in clear
water<00:01:49.900> but<00:01:50.900> for<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.110> most<00:01:51.290> part<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:51.650> fish<00:01:52.130> this

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
water but for the most part I fish this

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.540 
water but for the most part I fish this
configuration<00:01:52.730> all<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.330> time<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:55.460> what

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
configuration all the time so what

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.400 
configuration all the time so what
happens<00:01:55.790> when<00:01:55.910> you<00:01:56.000> add<00:01:56.150> a<00:01:56.180> glass<00:01:56.600> bead<00:01:56.930> into

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
happens when you add a glass bead into

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.460 
happens when you add a glass bead into
the<00:01:57.530> mix<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.950> your<00:01:58.490> weight<00:01:58.790> is<00:01:59.030> gonna<00:01:59.470> chatter

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
the mix is your weight is gonna chatter

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.400 
the mix is your weight is gonna chatter
up<00:02:00.920> against<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.490> glass<00:02:01.670> bead<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.420> like<00:02:03.260> them

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
up against that glass bead I like them

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.870 
up against that glass bead I like them
to<00:02:03.500> be<00:02:03.560> free-floating<00:02:06.010> as<00:02:07.010> that<00:02:07.340> weight<00:02:07.580> hits

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
to be free-floating as that weight hits

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.320 
to be free-floating as that weight hits
rock<00:02:08.209> or<00:02:08.539> wood<00:02:08.959> or<00:02:08.989> whatever<00:02:09.940> it's<00:02:10.940> gonna<00:02:11.060> put

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
rock or wood or whatever it's gonna put

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.699 
rock or wood or whatever it's gonna put
force<00:02:11.599> into<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:11.989> glass<00:02:12.200> bead<00:02:12.499> and<00:02:12.620> it's

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
force into that glass bead and it's

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.709 
force into that glass bead and it's
gonna<00:02:12.799> make<00:02:13.040> noise<00:02:13.219> this<00:02:13.939> adds<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.540> whole

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:14.719 
gonna make noise this adds a whole

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:16.729 
gonna make noise this adds a whole
nother<00:02:14.900> dynamic<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.650> your<00:02:15.799> Texas<00:02:16.189> rig

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
nother dynamic to your Texas rig

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.699 
nother dynamic to your Texas rig
and<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:18.390> my<00:02:18.569> experience<00:02:18.750> I've<00:02:19.319> caught<00:02:19.530> more

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
and in my experience I've caught more

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.119 
and in my experience I've caught more
fish<00:02:19.769> with<00:02:20.069> this<00:02:20.430> configuration<00:02:22.069> now<00:02:23.069> you

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
fish with this configuration now you

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.250 
fish with this configuration now you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
always want to trim your tagline to your

always want to trim your tagline to your
clinch<00:02:25.560> not<00:02:25.799> on<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.670> hook<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:28.500> always

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
clinch not on the hook and I always

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.050 
clinch not on the hook and I always
cover<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.250> soft<00:02:29.489> plastic<00:02:30.829> cover<00:02:31.829> that<00:02:32.069> not<00:02:32.760> up

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
cover the soft plastic cover that not up

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.809 
cover the soft plastic cover that not up
because<00:02:34.010> sometimes<00:02:35.010> your<00:02:35.310> weight<00:02:35.489> or<00:02:35.790> your

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
because sometimes your weight or your

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.569 
because sometimes your weight or your
bead<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.930> knot<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.469> slide<00:02:37.920> into<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> hole

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
bead that knot can slide into the hole

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.390 
bead that knot can slide into the hole
there<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.629> will<00:02:39.810> get<00:02:39.930> stuck<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.590> keep<00:02:41.250> it

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
there and it will get stuck and keep it

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.000 
there and it will get stuck and keep it
from<00:02:41.549> free-floating<00:02:42.469> so<00:02:43.469> that<00:02:43.620> was<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> lead

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
from free-floating so that was a lead

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.149 
from free-floating so that was a lead
weight<00:02:45.079> lead<00:02:46.079> weights<00:02:46.319> work<00:02:46.530> well<00:02:46.769> they<00:02:47.099> do

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
weight lead weights work well they do

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.140 
weight lead weights work well they do
make<00:02:47.459> noise<00:02:48.620> tungsten<00:02:49.620> weights<00:02:49.859> make<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.760> much

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
make noise tungsten weights make a much

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.490 
make noise tungsten weights make a much
better<00:02:51.510> sound<00:02:51.959> than<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:53.280> lead<00:02:53.519> weights<00:02:53.819> do<00:02:54.500> so

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
better sound than the lead weights do so

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.860 
better sound than the lead weights do so
I<00:02:55.859> highly<00:02:56.430> recommend<00:02:56.459> giving<00:02:57.120> these<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.269> try<00:02:57.540> I

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
I highly recommend giving these a try I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.440 
I highly recommend giving these a try I
like<00:02:58.049> using<00:02:58.319> tungsten<00:02:58.889> weights<00:02:59.269> you<00:03:00.269> get<00:03:00.419> a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
like using tungsten weights you get a

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.659 
like using tungsten weights you get a
high<00:03:00.780> pitch<00:03:02.209> shatter<00:03:03.829> when<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:04.889> glass<00:03:05.280> hits

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
high pitch shatter when the glass hits

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:12.480 
high pitch shatter when the glass hits
the<00:03:05.879> tungsten

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.580 

I<00:03:12.520> was<00:03:13.180> trying

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.400 

so<00:03:20.300> yep<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.450> like<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.720> have<00:03:21.840> them<00:03:21.930> free-floating

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
so yep I like to have them free-floating

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.920 
so yep I like to have them free-floating
I<00:03:23.220> like<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.790> get<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.940> nice<00:03:24.090> little<00:03:24.270> chatter<00:03:24.660> out

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
I like to get a nice little chatter out

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.510 
I like to get a nice little chatter out
of<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.110> bait<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.680> have<00:03:25.920> noticed<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.400> I

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
of the bait and I have noticed that I

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.270 
of the bait and I have noticed that I
catch<00:03:26.819> more<00:03:27.000> fish<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.390> way<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:29.130> know<00:03:29.220> you

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
catch more fish this way you know you

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.100 
catch more fish this way you know you
can<00:03:29.520> call<00:03:29.760> fish<00:03:30.060> from<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.540> further<00:03:30.989> distance

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
can call fish from a further distance

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.880 
can call fish from a further distance
with<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.069> little<00:03:32.310> bit<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.459> chatter<00:03:32.640> going<00:03:32.910> on

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890
