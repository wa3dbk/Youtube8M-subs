one hundred years later there was still
so<00:00:19.020> much<00:00:19.050> shame<00:00:19.470> associated<00:00:19.970> with<00:00:20.970> having

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
saying generally quite a few people

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.420 
saying generally quite a few people
shouldn't<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.600> been<00:00:33.870> executed<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:35.100> seemed

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430

like<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> very<00:00:35.850> important<00:00:36.510> moment<00:00:36.870> fell<00:00:37.350> off

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
like a very important moment fell off

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.970 
like a very important moment fell off
how<00:00:37.710> many<00:00:37.890> members<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.540> kind<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.600> hope<00:00:39.980> that

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
how many members I kind of hope that

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.119 
how many members I kind of hope that
people<00:00:41.510> yeah<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.930> given<00:00:43.200> space<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.739> think

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
people yeah just a given space to think

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.310 
people yeah just a given space to think
about<00:00:44.520> those<00:00:44.700> people<00:00:45.120> rather<00:00:45.300> than<00:00:45.600> let<00:00:46.170> them

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
about those people rather than let them

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.160 
about those people rather than let them
be<00:00:47.039> forgotten

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.780 

the<00:00:52.170> whole<00:00:52.380> series<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.010> called<00:00:53.190> shot<00:00:53.490> at<00:00:53.640> dawn

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
the whole series is called shot at dawn

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.060 
the whole series is called shot at dawn
and<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.660> because<00:00:55.020> these<00:00:55.590> people<00:00:55.830> were

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and that's because these people were

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.400 
and that's because these people were
always<00:00:56.340> executed<00:00:56.970> very<00:00:57.810> early<00:00:58.080> morning

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
always executed very early morning

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.490 
always executed very early morning
before<00:00:58.560> the<00:00:59.040> rest<00:00:59.220> of<00:00:59.720> warfare<00:01:00.720> continued<00:01:01.350> for

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
before the rest of warfare continued for

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.330 
before the rest of warfare continued for
the<00:01:01.560> rest<00:01:01.650> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.890> day<00:01:03.559> but<00:01:04.559> first<00:01:04.770> I<00:01:04.949> wondered

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
the rest of the day but first I wondered

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.880 
the rest of the day but first I wondered
whether<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:06.180> know<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.480> having<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:07.020> family

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
whether you know not having a family

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.030 
whether you know not having a family
connection<00:01:08.310> with<00:01:08.790> world<00:01:09.000> war<00:01:09.300> was<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> problem

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
connection with world war was a problem

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.820 
connection with world war was a problem
it<00:01:11.040> felt<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.750> difficult<00:01:13.200> huge

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
it felt like a really difficult huge

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.500 
it felt like a really difficult huge
subject<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.490> find<00:01:14.700> something<00:01:15.120> I<00:01:15.240> might<00:01:15.450> be

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
subject to find something I might be

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.500 
subject to find something I might be
able<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.930> comment<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.190> or<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.910> some<00:01:18.180> sort<00:01:18.480> of

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
able to comment on or have some sort of

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.870 
able to comment on or have some sort of
input<00:01:18.870> on<00:01:18.900> after<00:01:19.530> quite<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> lot<00:01:19.980> of<00:01:20.040> research<00:01:20.400> I

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
input on after quite a lot of research I

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240 
input on after quite a lot of research I
found<00:01:21.480> out<00:01:21.690> about<00:01:21.870> people<00:01:22.380> who<00:01:22.560> were<00:01:22.770> executed

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
found out about people who were executed

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.690 
found out about people who were executed
for<00:01:23.940> cowardice<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.390> desertion<00:01:25.050> I<00:01:25.610> thought<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
for cowardice and desertion I thought it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490 
for cowardice and desertion I thought it
was<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:26.910> important<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.570> photograph<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
was really important to photograph the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.310 
was really important to photograph the
sites<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.070> same<00:01:29.390> season<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:30.990> well<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
sites at the same season as well and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.660 
sites at the same season as well and
keep<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> execution<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.160> happened<00:01:32.550> and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
keep the execution that happened and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.359 
keep the execution that happened and
also<00:01:32.910> the<00:01:33.090> same<00:01:33.600> time<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.020> day<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.920> went<00:01:35.220> back

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
also the same time of day so I went back

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.940 
also the same time of day so I went back
all<00:01:35.820> throughout<00:01:36.150> 2013

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.450

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.999 

so<00:02:01.850> this<00:02:02.030> photograph<00:02:02.780> was<00:02:02.930> taken<00:02:02.990> in<00:02:03.439> West

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.330 
location and in the exhibition it will
be<00:03:03.470> always<00:03:03.830> shown<00:03:04.280> next<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.850> work<00:03:06.340> it's

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
be always shown next to the work it's

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.979 
be always shown next to the work it's
really<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.730> relationship<00:03:07.850> between<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.660> text

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
really the relationship between the text

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.900 
really the relationship between the text
and<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.200> image<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.709> really<00:03:10.160> make<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.730> point

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
and the image that really make the point

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.170 
and the image that really make the point
I'm<00:03:11.180> trying<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.480> make<00:03:12.610> you're<00:03:13.610> stamping<00:03:13.910> the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
I'm trying to make you're stamping the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.150 
I'm trying to make you're stamping the
presence<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:14.840> person<00:03:14.900> back<00:03:15.650> into<00:03:15.920> this

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
presence of that person back into this

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.190 
presence of that person back into this
empty<00:03:16.550> landscape

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
empty landscape

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.869 
empty landscape
so<00:03:18.830> it's<00:03:18.950> really<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:19.250> absence<00:03:19.670> that's<00:03:20.500> that's

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
so it's really the absence that's that's

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.690 
so it's really the absence that's that's
glaringly<00:03:22.879> present
