00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 I'll have a caller that I've had a good 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.940
 start in the turn of italy 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.250
 standing even during the week 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.080
 within the 'top ten' of this competition 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.670
 and to tell us about the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.950
 Andrei's participation is with us 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.010
 where manuel de la cruz murillo for 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.140
 talk about this topic of manuel 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.270
 which specializes in cycling andrey 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.869
 amador making a good start of the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.699
 Turn of Italy is not going to the beginning with 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.150
 it was expectation with android and if it has 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.610
 exceeded expectations clear yes andrey 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.730
 Amador is participating for the fourth time 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.180
 in a turn of Italy 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:42.260
 and has had participations within the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:46.250
 rank of gregarious pawn this time not 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.730
 has accompanying his captains captains 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.290
 of equipment such as iron quintana and 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.870
 Alejandro Valverde , hence, we read a 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.739
 little more freedom in the fourth 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.739
 stage of this turn made an attempt but 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.710
 it was in the fifth stage that he took out a light 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.710
 of 8 minutes in relation to the dowry that 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.890
 chasing these eight minutes 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.030
 they were well placed within the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.009
 lot to arrive and this one with what 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.350
 they had done the team time trial 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.380
 the time you have managed to place yourself 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.619
 among the top ten cyclists has 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.399
 a momentary boss called 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.920
 Giovanni Visconti and Giovanni Visconti 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.490
 is of difference in relation to andrey 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.390
 amador 22 seconds more actually a 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.670
 andrey is minutes 18 seconds from 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.240
 general leader who is Alberto accountant 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.119
 As we all know how to suffer a fall 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.040
 pretty cumbersome and I very much in your 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.040
 clavicle a dislocation of the 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.930
 clavicle therefore there are many 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.939
 game things in this turn 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.770
 taking the role change that you have 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.500
 Andrey Amador because we saw him in 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.909
 previous competitions and good the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.649
 positions maybe they were not the most 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.080
 favorable now if we see it there 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.209
 seeing it in a general way already put 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.970
 among the first 10 fighting even 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.200
 step by step how much the role has changed and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.690
 the development that andrey has had 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.310
 amador in this type of competitions the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.019
 most important around the world is 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.390
 right there are three competitions that are 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.090
 the most important on the planet that are 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.640
 the italy shot I'm from france and in the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.819
 web of spain at this moment has a 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.920
 freedom for not getting the captains 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.130
 of the official team of the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.709
 movistar and it has been given a freedom 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.780
 to not only win stages which is what 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.090
 you're looking for but also 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.260
 this is classification within the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.230
 ten first you found it 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.250
 practically and he is enjoying it but 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.880
 it also has that dynamics of if not 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:57.300
 can be released can not escape it is 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.739
 more difficult to win a stage because all 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.620
 the men who are inside the days 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.959
 first ones that are very marked 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.239
 in the guide when you're in that 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.180
 general classification and always go to the 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.879
 part of the bay the yellow is correct 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.860
 and those in the biggest yellow are with 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:16.019
 carefree brands let's say the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.799
 others that maybe it 's in a difference 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.019
 huge 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.940
 correct general classification and andrew 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.760
 called was in position number 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.099
 30 three or four minutes would have 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.769
 facilities to win a stage now 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.560
 it gets a bit complicated, it narrows 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.970
 that that margin of winning a stage but 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.640
 yes 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.489
 the possibility of making history grows 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.829
 because a Costa Rican has never occupied 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.120
 a place within the top ten of 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.989
 the classification of bass and you want 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.480
 Central American 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.620
 not even Central American the only 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.099
 who have achieved it have been 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.829
 South American and we have as such as 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.530
 example the triumph of Nairo Quintana in 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.870
 the turn of 2014 and the two seconds 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.609
 ntx fat places in the laps 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.609
 of 14 and 13
