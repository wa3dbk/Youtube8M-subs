00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.529
 in the first period the canaries attack attack but it is the Tours that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.669
 open the scoring 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.319
 titi buengo leaves in swaying dribbles and deception or crossfire 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.529
 then we see the 29th minute and the striker blues open his 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.199

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.199

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.540
 the tfc is conducted in the game but leads 2 to 0 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.380
 realizing his only two opportunities 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.880

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.430
 domination in their expectations 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.840
 we corrected this disaster 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.600

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.110
 for his strength remains time head 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.280
 in the second half, the people of Nantes are exposed to the score and the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.520

 try to go that in two stages reduces the mark 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.860
 the end of the meeting was stifling for the Touraine 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.160
 until this last hit of race tino trouble in playtime 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.700
