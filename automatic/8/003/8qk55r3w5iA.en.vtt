00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
one thing that's also interesting is

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.630 
one thing that's also interesting is
build<00:01:51.720> an<00:01:51.840> upgrade<00:01:52.079> your<00:01:52.229> your<00:01:52.590> garrison<00:01:53.369> I'm

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
assuming it's kind of a kind of like the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.380 
assuming it's kind of a kind of like the
farm<00:01:55.380> sort<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.799> deal<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.790> that's<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.060> cool

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
farm sort of deal so that's really cool

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.740 
farm sort of deal so that's really cool
uh<00:01:58.430> yeah<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> mean<00:01:59.700> like<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.149> said<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.540> wasn't

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.660 
much announced nothing I'm not excited
but<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:03.899> hoping<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.680> lot<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> stuff

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
but I'm hoping that a lot of the stuff

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.859 
but I'm hoping that a lot of the stuff
that<00:02:05.700> usually<00:02:05.939> try<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.240> sell<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.659> with<00:02:06.780> an

that usually try to sell you with an

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.999 
that usually try to sell you with an
expansion<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:10.259> know<00:02:10.289> new<00:02:10.560> ma<00:02:10.739> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
they don't have this

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.230 
they don't have this
time<00:02:14.010> which<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.190> good<00:02:14.490> because<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.850> feel<00:02:15.210> like

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
for the leveling and for the raids and I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.280 
for the leveling and for the raids and I
know<00:02:21.450> there's<00:02:21.750> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.930> be<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.050> whole<00:02:22.260> lot

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
know there's going to be a whole lot

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.990 
know there's going to be a whole lot
more<00:02:22.680> than<00:02:22.980> what<00:02:23.460> we<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:23.850> haven't
