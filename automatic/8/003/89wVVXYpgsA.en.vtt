the<00:01:57.380> nitrates<00:01:57.770> stare<00:01:58.010> at<00:01:58.280> 40<00:01:58.790> or<00:01:58.850> 50<00:01:59.300> Wow<00:01:59.900> they

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
the nitrates stare at 40 or 50 Wow they

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.190 
the nitrates stare at 40 or 50 Wow they
need<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.680> be<00:02:00.850> much<00:02:01.850> lower<00:02:02.119> than<00:02:02.300> that<00:02:02.390> for

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
need to be much lower than that for

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.969 
need to be much lower than that for
things<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.830> not<00:02:04.070> get<00:02:07.479> fish<00:02:08.479> as<00:02:08.630> well<00:02:08.810> yeah<00:02:09.560> they

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
things to not get fish as well yeah they

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.310 
things to not get fish as well yeah they
weren't<00:02:10.670> fighting<00:02:11.390> off<00:02:11.690> things<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.230> they

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
weren't fighting off things that they

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.949 
weren't fighting off things that they
normally<00:02:12.740> would<00:02:12.950> like<00:02:13.190> they<00:02:13.690> they<00:02:14.690> would<00:02:14.840> get

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
normally would like they they would get

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.720 
normally would like they they would get
thick<00:02:15.230> but<00:02:15.950> they<00:02:16.070> wouldn't<00:02:16.280> be<00:02:16.370> able<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.580> fight

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
thick but they wouldn't be able to fight

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.290 
thick but they wouldn't be able to fight
it<00:02:16.880> off<00:02:17.000> or<00:02:17.420> get<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.590> little<00:02:18.800> infection

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
it off or get like a little infection

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.140 
it off or get like a little infection
from<00:02:20.300> getting<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.020> scratch<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:22.060> they're<00:02:23.060> just

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
from getting a scratch and they're just

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.790 
from getting a scratch and they're just
not<00:02:23.330> fighting<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.810> off<00:02:23.930> as<00:02:24.140> easily<00:02:24.320> as<00:02:24.650> they

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
not fighting it off as easily as they

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.890 
not fighting it off as easily as they
were<00:02:25.010> before

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
were before

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.390 
were before
for<00:02:26.900> Dirk's<00:02:27.080> tank<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.650> knew<00:02:27.860> he<00:02:28.040> was<00:02:28.160> over

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
for Dirk's tank I knew he was over

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.940 
for Dirk's tank I knew he was over
stocked<00:02:28.670> but<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.330> did<00:02:29.540> stop<00:02:29.840> there<00:02:30.110> I<00:02:30.320> looked

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
stocked but I did stop there I looked

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.770 
stocked but I did stop there I looked
over<00:02:31.040> his<00:02:31.280> whole<00:02:31.430> system<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.120> his<00:02:32.450> skimmer

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
over his whole system and his skimmer

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.990 
over his whole system and his skimmer
was<00:02:32.989> underrated<00:02:33.440> for<00:02:33.680> his<00:02:33.800> tank<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.280> his

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
was underrated for his tank and his

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.270 
was underrated for his tank and his
aquascaping<00:02:35.630> was<00:02:35.840> very<00:02:36.050> closed<00:02:36.410> which<00:02:37.070> meant

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
aquascaping was very closed which meant

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.770 
aquascaping was very closed which meant
that<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.489> try<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:37.790> was<00:02:38.060> getting<00:02:38.300> stuck<00:02:38.540> in

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
that the try this was getting stuck in

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.040

a<00:02:47.310> problem<00:02:47.670> tank<00:02:47.940> always<00:02:48.870> make<00:02:49.050> sure<00:02:49.080> that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
a problem tank always make sure that

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.770 
a problem tank always make sure that
your<00:02:49.440> test<00:02:49.680> kits<00:02:50.070> are<00:02:50.310> very<00:02:50.550> very<00:02:50.820> accurate<00:02:51.300> if

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
your test kits are very very accurate if

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.420 
your test kits are very very accurate if

you use an inaccurate test kit you're

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.130 
you use an inaccurate test kit you're

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
getting an accurate result which can

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.140 
getting an accurate result which can
lead<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.620> down<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.800> wrong<00:02:55.950> path<00:02:56.460> when<00:02:57.060> it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
lead you down the wrong path when it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
lead you down the wrong path when it
comes<00:02:57.330> to<00:02:57.450> finding<00:02:57.660> out<00:02:57.780> what's<00:02:57.990> wrong<00:02:58.110> with

nitrate test from the same manufacturer

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.040 
nitrate test from the same manufacturer
I<00:03:04.350> ran<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.070> nitrate<00:03:05.520> test<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:05.940> his<00:03:06.060> Hank<00:03:06.300> one<00:03:06.930> of

I ran a nitrate test on his Hank one of

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.900 
I ran a nitrate test on his Hank one of
those<00:03:07.170> kits<00:03:07.440> gave<00:03:07.680> me<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.800> reading<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.160> zero<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
those kits gave me a reading to zero the

those kits gave me a reading to zero the
other<00:03:09.120> one<00:03:09.300> gave<00:03:09.600> me<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.750> reading<00:03:09.990> of<00:03:10.110> 20<00:03:10.440> 0<00:03:11.220> and

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
other one gave me a reading of 20 0 and

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.210 
other one gave me a reading of 20 0 and
20<00:03:11.940> or<00:03:12.120> two<00:03:12.300> wildly<00:03:12.840> different<00:03:12.930> results<00:03:13.230> now

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
if I had only gotten a zero result from

if I had only gotten a zero result from
that<00:03:16.260> one<00:03:16.410> test<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.890> would<00:03:16.950> have<00:03:17.130> said<00:03:17.280> oh

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
that one test I would have said oh

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.070 
that one test I would have said oh
there's<00:03:17.610> no<00:03:17.670> nitrates<00:03:18.210> in<00:03:18.390> this<00:03:18.480> tank<00:03:18.690> that's

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
there's no nitrates in this tank that's

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.360 
there's no nitrates in this tank that's
not<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.350> problem<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.860> would<00:03:20.130> have<00:03:20.280> gone

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
not the problem I would have gone

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.280 
not the problem I would have gone
somewhere<00:03:20.700> else<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.240> probably<00:03:21.390> not<00:03:21.750> found<00:03:22.050> a

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
somewhere else and probably not found a

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.420 
somewhere else and probably not found a
real<00:03:22.530> problem<00:03:22.770> that<00:03:23.010> was<00:03:23.100> wrong<00:03:23.280> with<00:03:23.400> that

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
real problem that was wrong with that

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.670 
real problem that was wrong with that
tank<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.540> always<00:03:24.750> make<00:03:24.900> sure<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.320> your<00:03:25.470> test

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
tank so always make sure that your test

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.860 
tank so always make sure that your test
kits<00:03:25.920> are<00:03:26.040> very<00:03:26.250> very<00:03:26.490> accurate<00:03:26.750> for<00:03:27.750> that

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
kits are very very accurate for that

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.600 
kits are very very accurate for that
reason<00:03:28.260> that's<00:03:28.680> why<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:28.920> use<00:03:29.160> my<00:03:29.340> hand<00:03:29.550> in

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
reason that's why I use my hand in

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.250 
reason that's why I use my hand in
