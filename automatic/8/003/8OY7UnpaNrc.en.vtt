magnesium fire starter we've got video
with<00:00:27.500> using<00:00:28.580> fine<00:00:29.580> steel<00:00:30.000> wool<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:31.640> this<00:00:32.640> time

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
with using fine steel wool and this time

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.290 
with using fine steel wool and this time
I'd<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.270> use<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:34.489> combination<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.850> methods

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
I'd like to use a combination of methods

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.869 
I'd like to use a combination of methods
but<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.350> want<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.739> show<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.730> little

something<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.920> we<00:00:40.920> came<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
something that we came up with the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.950 
something that we came up with the
number<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.390> years<00:00:42.570> ago<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:44.640> will<00:00:45.629> allow<00:00:45.899> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
number of years ago that will allow you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.299 
number of years ago that will allow you
a<00:00:46.440> long<00:00:46.860> burn<00:00:47.219> time<00:00:48.829> when<00:00:49.829> you're<00:00:49.980> trying<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
a long burn time when you're trying to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.350 
a long burn time when you're trying to
start<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.640> what<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.180> would<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:52.250> take<00:00:53.360> pieces

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
start it what we would do is take pieces

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.430 
start it what we would do is take pieces
of<00:00:54.570> rope<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:56.210> we'd<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> double<00:00:58.289> boiler

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
of rope and we'd get a double boiler

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.529 
of rope and we'd get a double boiler
going<00:00:58.920> some<00:00:59.160> boiling<00:00:59.520> water<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.329> top

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
going some boiling water and then on top

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.910 
going some boiling water and then on top
of<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.070> container<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.539> paraffin<00:01:03.539> wax

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
of that container with some paraffin wax

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.490 
of that container with some paraffin wax
and<00:01:04.920> when<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> wax<00:01:06.119> gets<00:01:06.450> all<00:01:06.659> melted

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
and when the one the wax gets all melted

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.030 
and when the one the wax gets all melted
and<00:01:07.560> everything<00:01:08.689> we<00:01:09.689> had<00:01:09.840> dipped<00:01:10.110> chunks<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
and everything we had dipped chunks of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.460 
and everything we had dipped chunks of
rope<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> wax<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.960> let<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.080> soak<00:01:13.409> in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
rope down in the wax and let it soak in

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.510 
rope down in the wax and let it soak in
there<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.100> good<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.210> pull<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
there really good and we pull that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.499 
there really good and we pull that
material<00:01:17.520> back<00:01:17.700> out<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.810> use<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:20.509> like

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
material back out and we use just like

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.840 
material back out and we use just like
some<00:01:21.810> pruning<00:01:22.710> shears<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.400> you'd<00:01:23.610> use<00:01:23.640> for

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
some pruning shears like you'd use for

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.940 
some pruning shears like you'd use for
pruning<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:24.960> fruit<00:01:25.229> trees<00:01:25.560> or<00:01:26.450> bushes<00:01:27.450> or

roses<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.070> whatever<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.509> take<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
roses or whatever and then just take the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.999 
roses or whatever and then just take the
rope<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.409> snip<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.590> down<00:01:34.740> into

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
rope and just and just snip it down into

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.390 
rope and just and just snip it down into
shorter<00:01:35.340> pieces<00:01:35.720> it's<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.140> help<00:01:37.400> get

shorter pieces it's just to help get

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.359 
shorter pieces it's just to help get
this<00:01:38.610> thing<00:01:38.670> started<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> very<00:01:39.840> very

a<00:02:47.579> bar<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.819> magnesium<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.629> one<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.049> then<00:02:49.290> on

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
a bar of magnesium on one and then on

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:54.020 
a bar of magnesium on one and then on
one<00:02:49.650> side<00:02:49.950> there's<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:51.140> spark<00:02:52.140> rod<00:02:53.030> embedded

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
one side there's a spark rod embedded

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.809 
one side there's a spark rod embedded
into<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.390> stick<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:56.010> we<00:02:56.129> just<00:02:56.280> want<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.579> start

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
into the stick so we just want to start

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.050 
into the stick so we just want to start
on<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.590> magnesium<00:02:58.590> bar<00:02:58.980> side<00:02:59.340> first<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.909> all

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
on the magnesium bar side first of all

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.140 
on the magnesium bar side first of all
and<00:03:03.439> we're<00:03:04.439> just<00:03:04.560> going<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.969> put<00:03:05.969> a<00:03:06.000> little

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
and we're just going to put a little

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.979 
and we're just going to put a little
pile<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.450> shavings<00:03:08.569> carry<00:03:09.569> through<00:03:09.900> the

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
pile of shavings carry through the

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.940 
pile of shavings carry through the
squeaking<00:03:10.439> sound<00:03:10.799> but<00:03:12.290> that's<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.560> way<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.739> is

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
squeaking sound but that's the way it is

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:25.580 
squeaking sound but that's the way it is
get<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:16.980> little<00:03:17.099> bit<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.459> here<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.409> see

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
get a little bit in here and you see

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.809 
get a little bit in here and you see
I've<00:03:25.680> kind<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.569> formed<00:03:27.569> this<00:03:27.689> into<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.169> little

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
I've kind of formed this into a little

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.539 
I've kind of formed this into a little
kind<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:29.969> cone<00:03:30.239> shape<00:03:30.269> here<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.980> shavings

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
kind of a cone shape here and shavings

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.220 
kind of a cone shape here and shavings
are<00:03:32.669> all<00:03:32.760> concentrated<00:03:33.629> right<00:03:33.870> in<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.079> bottom

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
are all concentrated right in the bottom

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.589 
are all concentrated right in the bottom
of<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:35.599> if<00:03:36.599> I<00:03:36.840> do<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:37.200> right<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:39.180> should<00:03:39.450> be

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
of it if I do this right it should be

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:46.610 
of it if I do this right it should be
good<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.810> go<00:03:39.930> here<00:03:41.060> if<00:03:42.060> not<00:03:42.299> we'll<00:03:42.750> do<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:42.989> over

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.470 

I'm<00:03:47.129> just<00:03:47.220> going<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.549> throw<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.819> spark<00:03:48.239> right

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
I'm just going to throw a spark right

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.430 
I'm just going to throw a spark right
down<00:03:48.720> into<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.790> concentration<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.909> shavings

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
down into that concentration of shavings

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.050 
down into that concentration of shavings
you'll<00:03:52.440> see<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.739> flash<00:03:53.069> up<00:03:53.370> kind<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.849> white

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
you'll see it flash up kind of a white

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:02.930 
you'll see it flash up kind of a white
flash<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.830> we<00:04:00.019> want<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.110> get<00:04:01.200> our<00:04:01.670> rope<00:04:02.670> down

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
flash and we want to get our rope down

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.949 
flash and we want to get our rope down
in<00:04:03.090> here<00:04:03.650> see<00:04:04.650> our<00:04:04.709> ropes<00:04:05.010> burning<00:04:05.599> now<00:04:06.599> see

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
in here see our ropes burning now see

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.680 
in here see our ropes burning now see
that<00:04:07.170> we<00:04:07.590> got<00:04:07.739> it<00:04:07.920> started<00:04:08.310> like<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.760> this

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
that we got it started like that this

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.380 
that we got it started like that this
thing<00:04:09.989> will<00:04:10.079> burn<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.290> long<00:04:10.560> time<00:04:10.890> if<00:04:11.849> I<00:04:12.060> want<00:04:12.299> to

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
thing will burn a long time if I want to

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.939 
thing will burn a long time if I want to
I<00:04:12.659> can<00:04:12.750> also<00:04:13.110> add<00:04:13.590> another<00:04:13.909> piece<00:04:14.909> to<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.949> this

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
I can also add another piece to it this

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.670 
I can also add another piece to it this
stuff<00:04:17.190> right<00:04:17.430> here<00:04:17.930> this'll<00:04:18.930> burn<00:04:19.049> for<00:04:19.410> five

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
stuff right here this'll burn for five

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.490 
stuff right here this'll burn for five
or<00:04:19.709> ten<00:04:20.010> minutes<00:04:20.039> like<00:04:20.519> this<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:22.049> can't<00:04:22.289> build

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
or ten minutes like this you can't build

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.890 
or ten minutes like this you can't build
a<00:04:22.680> fire<00:04:23.090> well<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.240> method<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.750> got<00:04:24.870> a

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
a fire well this method you got a

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.070 
a fire well this method you got a
problem<00:04:25.729> when<00:04:26.729> you<00:04:26.789> just<00:04:26.940> take<00:04:27.150> our<00:04:27.389> take<00:04:27.870> this

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
problem when you just take our take this

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:37.610 
problem when you just take our take this
into<00:04:28.350> our<00:04:28.530> leaves<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:35.220> we<00:04:35.810> got<00:04:36.810> us<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:37.050> fire<00:04:37.320> we

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
into our leaves and we got us a fire we

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:51.540 
into our leaves and we got us a fire we
can<00:04:37.860> throw<00:04:38.070> our<00:04:38.190> sticks<00:04:38.490> on<00:04:38.729> there

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:05:04.930 

ah

and anyway

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.740 
and anyway
you've<00:05:09.290> got<00:05:09.470> us<00:05:09.620> a<00:05:09.740> fire<00:05:10.270> that's<00:05:11.270> all<00:05:11.540> there<00:05:11.720> is

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
you've got us a fire that's all there is

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.480 
you've got us a fire that's all there is
to<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:13.090> like<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.270> say<00:05:14.480> that's<00:05:15.040> that's<00:05:16.040> using

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
to it like I say that's that's using

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.870 
to it like I say that's that's using
that<00:05:16.610> little<00:05:16.880> rope<00:05:17.060> method<00:05:18.040> it's<00:05:19.040> very<00:05:19.310> very

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
that little rope method it's very very

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.110 
that little rope method it's very very
simple<00:05:19.970> way<00:05:20.480> to<00:05:20.510> build<00:05:20.810> a<00:05:20.900> fire
