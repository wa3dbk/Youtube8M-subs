okay you guys we're here with muy and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.830 
okay you guys we're here with muy and
this<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:03.799> our<00:01:03.890> design<00:01:04.220> basically<00:01:05.150> we<00:01:05.269> had<00:01:05.510> the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
this is our design basically we had the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.399 
this is our design basically we had the
longer<00:01:06.680> arm<00:01:06.830> pivot<00:01:07.509> pivot<00:01:08.509> arm<00:01:08.810> if<00:01:09.079> you<00:01:09.259> will

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
longer arm pivot pivot arm if you will

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.609 
longer arm pivot pivot arm if you will
on<00:01:09.649> the<00:01:10.490> bottom<00:01:10.880> first<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.899> then<00:01:12.140> we<00:01:12.289> had<00:01:12.469> the

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
on the bottom first and then we had the

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.310 
on the bottom first and then we had the
shorter<00:01:12.979> on<00:01:13.100> pivot<00:01:13.430> on<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.180> top<00:01:14.420> now<00:01:15.259> we

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
shorter on pivot on the top now we

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.929 
shorter on pivot on the top now we
arrange<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.920> screws<00:01:16.189> in<00:01:16.399> a<00:01:16.490> way<00:01:16.640> that

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
arrange the screws in a way that

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.550 
arrange the screws in a way that
wouldn't<00:01:17.119> get<00:01:17.299> in<00:01:17.539> the<00:01:17.630> way<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.930> camera<00:01:18.170> or

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
wouldn't get in the way of the camera or

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.380 
wouldn't get in the way of the camera or
in<00:01:18.829> the<00:01:18.890> way<00:01:18.979> of<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.159> gun<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.149> can<00:01:20.299> see

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
in the way of the gun and you can see

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.520 
in the way of the gun and you can see
here<00:01:20.539> we<00:01:20.630> have<00:01:20.719> taped<00:01:20.960> down<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:21.170> sling<00:01:21.380> mount

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
here we have taped down the sling mount

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.959 
here we have taped down the sling mount
because<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:21.920> would<00:01:22.130> making<00:01:22.399> it<00:01:22.640> was<00:01:22.759> making

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
because I would making it was making

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.029 
because I would making it was making
like<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.090> little<00:01:23.329> tapping<00:01:23.929> noise<00:01:24.109> because<00:01:24.950> it

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
like a little tapping noise because it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.770 
like a little tapping noise because it
would<00:01:25.159> fling<00:01:25.399> it<00:01:25.759> would<00:01:25.880> sling<00:01:26.119> up<00:01:26.329> and<00:01:26.630> down

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
would fling it would sling up and down

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.050 
would fling it would sling up and down
and<00:01:26.810> up<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.140> down<00:01:27.229> no<00:01:27.439> very<00:01:27.710> annoying<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.850> this

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
and up and down no very annoying so this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.300 
and up and down no very annoying so this
is<00:01:29.179> basically<00:01:29.270> our<00:01:29.539> design<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.920> let's<00:01:31.100> see<00:01:31.219> how

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
is basically our design so let's see how

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:45.969 
is basically our design so let's see how
it<00:01:31.340> sounds<00:01:33.189> listen<00:01:34.189> all<00:01:34.310> this<00:01:34.460> yeah<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:44.979> tiny

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
it sounds listen all this yeah a tiny

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.590 
it sounds listen all this yeah a tiny
little<00:01:46.280> all<00:01:46.579> right<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:46.819> here<00:01:47.119> we<00:01:47.210> go<00:01:47.240> for<00:01:47.569> a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
little all right and here we go for a
