due to the softer surfaces and uneven

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.799 
due to the softer surfaces and uneven
terrain<00:00:46.190> you'll<00:00:47.000> run<00:00:47.210> a<00:00:47.239> little<00:00:47.480> bit<00:00:47.660> more

slowly<00:00:48.250> also<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.309> encounter<00:00:49.820> roots<00:00:50.149> rocks

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
slowly also you encounter roots rocks

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.779 
slowly also you encounter roots rocks
and<00:00:51.140> other<00:00:51.230> obstacles<00:00:51.890> so<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:52.129> need<00:00:52.339> to<00:00:52.429> slow

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
and other obstacles so you need to slow
