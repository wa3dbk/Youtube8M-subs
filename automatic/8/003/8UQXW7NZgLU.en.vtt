00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
I mean it's a great piece of equipment

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.559 
I mean it's a great piece of equipment
for<00:01:52.279> the<00:01:52.369> average<00:01:52.549> consumer<00:01:52.700> that's<00:01:53.329> looking

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
for the average consumer that's looking

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.659 
for the average consumer that's looking
to<00:01:53.659> be<00:01:53.779> able<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.049> get<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.229> better<00:01:54.469> shot<00:01:54.590> from<00:01:55.549> a

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:55.669 
to be able to get a better shot from a

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.039 
to be able to get a better shot from a
farther<00:01:55.939> distance<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.569> to<00:01:56.630> make<00:01:56.779> sure<00:01:56.899> they

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
farther distance and to make sure they

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.559 
farther distance and to make sure they
get<00:01:57.169> more<00:01:57.469> of<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.739> subject<00:01:58.159> into<00:01:58.549> that<00:01:58.579> image

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
get more of the subject into that image

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.409 
get more of the subject into that image
so<00:01:59.869> it<00:02:00.679> also<00:02:00.799> has<00:02:01.069> a<00:02:01.099> 3-inch<00:02:01.579> LCD<00:02:01.729> on<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.239> back

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:02.419 
so it also has a 3-inch LCD on the back

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:03.819 
so it also has a 3-inch LCD on the back
which<00:02:02.719> is<00:02:02.869> pretty<00:02:02.989> exciting<00:02:03.319> because<00:02:03.529> you<00:02:03.679> can

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
which is pretty exciting because you can

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.080 
which is pretty exciting because you can
see<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.009> larger<00:02:04.399> image<00:02:04.609> when<00:02:04.789> you're<00:02:04.909> viewing

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
see a larger image when you're viewing

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.989 
see a larger image when you're viewing
it<00:02:05.329> as<00:02:05.479> well<00:02:06.079> as<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.439> high-definition<00:02:07.340> video

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
it as well as the high-definition video

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.660 
it as well as the high-definition video
recording<00:02:08.539> capability<00:02:09.140> with<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.740> hdmi

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
recording capability with the hdmi

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.220 
recording capability with the hdmi
but<00:02:10.849> okay<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.540> can<00:02:11.690> also<00:02:11.780> have<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.050> new

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
NX series is a great opportunity for us

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.720 
NX series is a great opportunity for us
as<00:02:20.620> here<00:02:21.620> at<00:02:21.709> PMA<00:02:22.040> it's<00:02:22.190> our<00:02:22.310> global

information as a part of this show in

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.309 
information as a part of this show in
this<00:02:28.220> event<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:29.209> NX<00:02:29.480> series<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.989> really

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
this event the NX series is really

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.620 
this event the NX series is really
allowing<00:02:30.650> Samsung<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.880> bridge<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.450> gap

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
allowing Samsung to bridge the gap

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.690 
allowing Samsung to bridge the gap
between<00:02:32.739> point-and-shoot<00:02:33.739> technology<00:02:34.430> and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
between point-and-shoot technology and

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.000 
between point-and-shoot technology and
the<00:02:35.000> SLR<00:02:35.390> technology<00:02:36.080> it's<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.800> be<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:36.950> a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
the SLR technology it's going to be in a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.650 
the SLR technology it's going to be in a
smaller<00:02:37.310> form<00:02:37.400> factor<00:02:37.700> so<00:02:38.180> there's<00:02:38.330> no<00:02:38.480> mirror

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
smaller form factor so there's no mirror

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.870 
smaller form factor so there's no mirror
box<00:02:38.959> but<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:39.950> an<00:02:40.069> interchangeable<00:02:40.550> lens

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
box but it is an interchangeable lens

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.330 
box but it is an interchangeable lens
system<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.780> will<00:02:41.959> be<00:02:42.200> able<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.470> provide<00:02:43.160> a

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
system and it will be able to provide a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.610 
system and it will be able to provide a
better<00:02:43.910> experience<00:02:44.390> for<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:45.440> average

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
better experience for the average

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.170 
better experience for the average
consumer<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:46.370> be<00:02:46.430> able<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.610> eliminate<00:02:46.760> at<00:02:47.090> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
consumer and be able to eliminate at the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.670 
consumer and be able to eliminate at the
mirror<00:02:47.360> box<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:48.019> tell<00:02:48.380> me<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.470> little<00:02:48.560> bit

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
mirror box and tell me a little bit

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.289 
mirror box and tell me a little bit
about<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.069> what<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.519> advantages<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:50.090> there

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
about that what the advantages is there

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.390 
about that what the advantages is there
are<00:02:50.540> there<00:02:50.600> well<00:02:51.110> it'll<00:02:51.290> reduce<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.860> size<00:02:52.069> and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
are there well it'll reduce the size and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.390 
are there well it'll reduce the size and
then<00:02:52.519> we<00:02:52.640> have<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:53.860> electronic<00:02:54.860> viewfinder

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
then we have a electronic viewfinder

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.680 
then we have a electronic viewfinder
which<00:02:55.430> will<00:02:55.760> allow<00:02:55.819> you<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.150> be<00:02:56.269> able<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.510> you

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
which will allow you to be able to you

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.410 
which will allow you to be able to you
know<00:02:56.780> frame<00:02:57.140> and<00:02:57.319> view<00:02:57.440> your<00:02:57.470> image<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.459> it

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
know frame and view your image so it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.699 
know frame and view your image so it
definitely<00:02:59.660> will<00:02:59.930> allow<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.500> have<00:03:00.650> a

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
definitely will allow you to have a

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.820 
definitely will allow you to have a
smaller<00:03:01.190> compact<00:03:01.660> form<00:03:02.660> with<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.200> type<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.620> a

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
smaller compact form with that type of a

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.710 
smaller compact form with that type of a
system<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.340> interchangeable<00:03:05.269> lenses<00:03:05.540> as

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
system and interchangeable lenses as

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.920 
system and interchangeable lenses as
well<00:03:05.930> yes<00:03:06.319> when<00:03:07.100> will<00:03:07.310> we<00:03:07.400> know<00:03:07.430> more<00:03:07.930> stay

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
well yes when will we know more stay

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.410 
well yes when will we know more stay
