that Milan of no I think there's no

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.210 
that Milan of no I think there's no
right<00:01:34.259> winger<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.560> they've<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.979> really

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
right winger and they've just a really

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
right winger and they've just a really
 left<00:01:35.670> winger<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> need<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.479> change<00:01:36.780> the

 left winger so I need to change the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.539 
 left winger so I need to change the
formation<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.500> an<00:01:37.590> absolute<00:01:37.860> area<00:01:38.070> will<00:01:38.400> be

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
formation so an absolute area will be

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.090 
formation so an absolute area will be
changed<00:01:38.880> information<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.770> squad
