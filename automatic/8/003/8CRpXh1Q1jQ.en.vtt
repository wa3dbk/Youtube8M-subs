00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.030
 I hope you like it I know I've 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.030
 neglected my channel in Spanish but it's 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.490
 very difficult for me follow these videos 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.890
 in English and in Spanish but I will try 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.689
 to keep doing good if they want 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.019
 see how this look keep seeing the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.019
 I want so much 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.360
 let's start with this palette that 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:34.950
 palette this is I'm going and I'm going to use this 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.590
 color that is color a little skin 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.390
 you grab it or something like that but I'm going to 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.750
 apply is on the inside of the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.400
 eyelid mobile and this is only going to be 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.270
 so you're not alone 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.559
 the eye without the eyelid without color and from there 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.530
 I go with this color that is like a gray 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.620
 mate and it's short too and that's where I'm going 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.080
 with this color that is like a little purple 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.910
 gray something like that has a tone like that and that's not 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.700
 It is applied on the outside of the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.410
 eyelid mobile and from there I'll go back to 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.690
 apply the colors and I'm going to 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.610
 blur from eweek with the first color 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.580
 that we are and I will use that color to 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.180
 blur all the colors in the basin 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.400
 of the eye only so that they do not look 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.979
 the lines that remain when we apply 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.259
 the colors and the bad I will blur 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.270
 so that it looks nice and then I go to 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.119
 re- apply the cloud colors 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.490
 again and blur they want to do 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.000
 that every time they apply color so that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.680
 if you look 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.210
 blur the colors and do not look at 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.010
 horrible lines that remain as they see me 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.530
 it diffused I apply color and it blurred and 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.780
 I apply color so it has to be girls 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.940
 so that they look beautiful the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.860
 makeup they want to make sure that 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.440
 Blur everything so you do not look 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.470
 the lines good as you can see here already 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.590
 you're seeing the blur and the umad or 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.930
 of the color I'm only applying it and 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.630
 what diffused he applied it blurred 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.960
 just so you can see the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.250
 good pretty color blurred good 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.910
 there I will apply the same colors as 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.190
 I applied on the outside of the 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.190
 tabs below and I'm blurring it 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.550
 as you can see it is not so heavy this 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.980
 worse I wanted something smoked but neither 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.230
 very exaggerated from there explain your two 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.450
 colors that are have a little bit of 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.570
 shine and apply the inner part 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.340
 of the eye only to illuminate a 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.489
 little bit more the look 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.620
 and from there I'm going to apply my eyeliner 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.830

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.450

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.069
 if you look at my channel in English but I do not 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.580
 I like to use black a lot because I 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.709

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.629
