going right through it and it's really

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.590 
going right through it and it's really
rigid<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:49.350> legs<00:01:49.619> not<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.520> much<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:51.270> they're

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
rigid the legs not so much it's they're

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.940 
rigid the legs not so much it's they're
kind<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.930> fragile<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.380> course<00:01:52.619> they're<00:01:52.799> made

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
kind of fragile of course they're made

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.130 
kind of fragile of course they're made
out<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> plastic<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.450> break<00:01:54.689> really

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
out of plastic and they can break really

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.080 
out of plastic and they can break really
easily<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:57.799> here's<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.890> crash<00:01:59.310> from<00:01:59.880> where<00:02:00.060> I
