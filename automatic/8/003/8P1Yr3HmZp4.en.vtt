save my recordings on so let's move on
to<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> settings<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.110> move<00:01:46.439> my<00:01:46.590> settings

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to the settings I move my settings

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.030 
to the settings I move my settings
around<00:01:47.100> quite<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.610> bit<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.450> don't<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:49.079> copy<00:01:49.590> but

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
around quite a bit and don't a copy but

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.370 
around quite a bit and don't a copy but
just<00:01:50.280> try<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> understand<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.750> settings<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
just try to understand the settings of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.800 
just try to understand the settings of
daisy<00:01:52.649> i<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:53.189> that's<00:01:53.369> most<00:01:53.549> important<00:01:54.210> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
daisy i think that's most important so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.080 
daisy i think that's most important so
at<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> first<00:01:55.079> screen<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.619> daisy<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.610> will

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
at the first screen of daisy you will

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.660 
at the first screen of daisy you will
find<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> volume<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.740> game<00:01:59.009> settings<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
find the volume the game settings and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.330 
find the volume the game settings and
stuff<00:01:59.759> like<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.290> just<00:02:01.290> make<00:02:01.469> sure<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.890> put<00:02:02.100> to

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
stuff like that just make sure to put to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.069 
stuff like that just make sure to put to
wipe<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.850> all<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> way<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.899> hear

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
wipe up all the way so you can hear

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.109 
wipe up all the way so you can hear
people<00:02:04.469> better<00:02:04.680> i<00:02:04.979> think<00:02:05.670> that's<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> most

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
people better i think that's the most

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.180 
people better i think that's the most
important<00:02:06.750> one<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.530> next<00:02:07.740> screen<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
important one for the next screen you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.630 
important one for the next screen you
want<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.610> basically<00:02:08.849> avoid<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.840> click

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
want to basically avoid it click

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.550 
want to basically avoid it click
default<00:02:11.000> that's<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.660> main<00:02:11.870> thing<00:02:11.900> avoid

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
default that's the main thing avoid

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.760 
default that's the main thing avoid
click<00:02:12.890> non-lethal<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.700> have<00:02:14.450> vsync<00:02:15.170> disabled

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
click non-lethal and have vsync disabled

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.800 
click non-lethal and have vsync disabled
it<00:02:15.950> will<00:02:16.100> increase<00:02:16.430> your<00:02:16.610> FPS<00:02:16.940> immense<00:02:17.630> with

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
it will increase your FPS immense with

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.110 
it will increase your FPS immense with
me<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.470> my<00:02:18.620> opinion<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.340> most<00:02:19.430> important

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
me and my opinion is the most important

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.530 
me and my opinion is the most important
screen<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.930> quality<00:02:21.410> settings<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.520> in<00:02:22.970> cities

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
screen the quality settings so in cities

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.740 
screen the quality settings so in cities
you<00:02:23.870> want<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.740> object<00:02:25.400> detail<00:02:25.880> on<00:02:26.180> very

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
you want to have object detail on very

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.230 
you want to have object detail on very
low<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.740> at<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.100> moment<00:02:28.250> outside<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.940> cities

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
low but at the moment outside of cities

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.449 
low but at the moment outside of cities
you<00:02:29.360> can<00:02:29.540> just<00:02:29.780> leave<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.170> too<00:02:30.290> high<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:31.310> can

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
you can just leave it too high you can

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.430 
you can just leave it too high you can
always<00:02:31.670> leave<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.209> very<00:02:32.450> low<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.990> downside

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
always leave it to very low the downside

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.140 
always leave it to very low the downside
of<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.280> cannot<00:02:34.610> see<00:02:34.880> players

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
of that is that you cannot see players

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.470 
of that is that you cannot see players
after<00:02:36.010> 300<00:02:37.010> meters<00:02:37.310> or<00:02:37.520> something<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.330> can

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
after 300 meters or something you can

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.270 
after 300 meters or something you can
see<00:02:38.660> them<00:02:38.750> with<00:02:38.900> scope<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:39.560> not<00:02:39.800> with<00:02:40.069> your

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
see them with scope but not with your

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.970 
see them with scope but not with your
bare<00:02:40.640> eyes<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.239> usually<00:02:41.660> have<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.650> clouds

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
bare eyes I usually have to the clouds

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.040 
bare eyes I usually have to the clouds
and<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.370> shadows<00:02:43.760> too<00:02:44.030> high<00:02:44.270> but<00:02:44.810> if<00:02:44.930> you're

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
and the shadows too high but if you're

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.870 
and the shadows too high but if you're
struggling<00:02:45.410> for<00:02:45.709> FB<00:02:46.070> has<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.489> turn<00:02:46.700> them

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
struggling for FB has just turn them

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.110 
struggling for FB has just turn them
both<00:02:47.060> off<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.830> shadows<00:02:48.830> make<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.880> game<00:02:50.090> look

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
both off the shadows make the game look

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.430 
both off the shadows make the game look
nicer<00:02:50.870> though<00:02:51.050> so<00:02:51.500> if<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:52.540> if<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.750> can<00:02:53.959> push

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
nicer though so if you if you can push

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.160 
nicer though so if you if you can push
it<00:02:54.709> at<00:02:55.130> least<00:02:55.489> put<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.060> very<00:02:56.300> low<00:02:56.480> I<00:02:56.750> think

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
it at least put it to very low I think

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.440 
it at least put it to very low I think
the<00:02:57.620> game<00:02:57.800> looks<00:02:58.010> much<00:02:58.310> nicer<00:02:58.580> with<00:02:59.060> shadows

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
the game looks much nicer with shadows

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.660 
the game looks much nicer with shadows
on<00:02:59.630> at<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.380> rendering<00:03:00.590> settings<00:03:00.980> i<00:03:01.430> have

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
on at the rendering settings i have

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.180 
on at the rendering settings i have
anti-aliasing<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:02.690> go<00:03:03.019> too<00:03:03.170> high<00:03:03.200> but<00:03:04.100> if

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
anti-aliasing to go too high but if

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.949 
anti-aliasing to go too high but if
you're<00:03:04.280> struggling<00:03:04.640> for<00:03:04.880> FPS<00:03:05.330> just<00:03:05.630> turn<00:03:05.840> it

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
you're struggling for FPS just turn it

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.199 
you're struggling for FPS just turn it
off<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.709> makes<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.250> game<00:03:07.400> look<00:03:07.459> very<00:03:07.970> nice

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
off it makes the game look very nice

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.150 
off it makes the game look very nice
though<00:03:08.570> with<00:03:08.930> high<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.590> gives<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.130> a

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
though with high and it gives you a

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.400 
though with high and it gives you a
relaxed<00:03:10.970> view<00:03:11.180> because<00:03:11.420> if<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.110> look<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.380> the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
relaxed view because if you look in the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.100 
relaxed view because if you look in the
distance<00:03:12.709> with<00:03:13.040> anti-aliasing<00:03:13.430> up<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.780> can

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
distance with anti-aliasing up you can

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.110 
distance with anti-aliasing up you can
see<00:03:15.350> everything<00:03:15.739> flickering<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.940> that's

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
see everything flickering so and that's

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.050 
see everything flickering so and that's
not<00:03:17.329> very<00:03:17.540> nice<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:18.140> have<00:03:18.890> alpha<00:03:19.250> 2<00:03:19.400> coverage<00:03:19.790> to

not very nice I have alpha 2 coverage to

not very nice I have alpha 2 coverage to

fxaa very high I don't ignore the exact

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.600 
fxaa very high I don't ignore the exact
details<00:03:31.040> but<00:03:31.930> you<00:03:32.930> need<00:03:33.079> H<00:03:33.290> moving<00:03:33.920> because<00:03:34.400> it

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
details but you need H moving because it

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.890 
details but you need H moving because it
also<00:03:34.790> helps<00:03:35.299> together<00:03:35.630> with<00:03:35.810> the

also helps together with the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.720 
also helps together with the
anti-aliasing<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.739> reduce<00:03:37.040> flickering<00:03:37.610> in

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
anti-aliasing to reduce flickering in

anti-aliasing to reduce flickering in
the<00:03:37.820> distance<00:03:38.560> HDR<00:03:39.560> quality<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:40.220> can<00:03:40.250> put<00:03:40.640> to

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
the distance HDR quality you can put to

the distance HDR quality you can put to
very<00:03:41.060> low<00:03:41.329> doesn't<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.010> big<00:03:43.310> difference<00:03:43.850> i

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
very low doesn't have a big difference i

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.870 
very low doesn't have a big difference i
currently<00:03:44.720> i<00:03:44.780> have<00:03:45.489> post-processing<00:03:46.489> too

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
currently i have post-processing too

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.720 
currently i have post-processing too
high<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:47.840> means<00:03:48.079> you<00:03:48.170> can<00:03:48.230> also<00:03:48.500> set<00:03:48.860> blue<00:03:49.459> as

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
high this means you can also set blue as

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.880 
high this means you can also set blue as
you<00:03:50.090> can<00:03:50.239> see<00:03:50.540> but<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:50.810> like<00:03:51.320> Blum<00:03:51.620> when<00:03:51.799> the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
you can see but I like Blum when the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.190 
you can see but I like Blum when the
lowest<00:03:52.250> setting<00:03:52.519> anyway<00:03:54.790> post-processing

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
lowest setting anyway post-processing

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.080 
lowest setting anyway post-processing
actually<00:03:57.200> makes<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.890> edges<00:03:58.459> of<00:03:58.610> your<00:03:58.640> screen

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
actually makes the edges of your screen

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.060 
actually makes the edges of your screen
blurry<00:03:59.540> if<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.230> are<00:04:01.180> running<00:04:02.180> for<00:04:02.930> example<00:04:03.440> or

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
blurry if you are running for example or

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.380

if<00:04:04.579> you<00:04:04.820> are<00:04:04.850> zoomed<00:04:05.570> in<00:04:05.989> or<00:04:06.170> if<00:04:07.100> you<00:04:07.340> are<00:04:07.400> not

if you are zoomed in or if you are not
healthy<00:04:08.890> as<00:04:09.890> you<00:04:09.950> see<00:04:10.340> in<00:04:10.549> game<00:04:10.820> I've<00:04:11.090> made

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
healthy as you see in game I've made

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.500 
healthy as you see in game I've made
shot<00:04:11.660> here<00:04:12.100> recently<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.370> it<00:04:13.880> means<00:04:14.120> that

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
shot here recently and it means that

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.229 
shot here recently and it means that
with<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.350> post-processing<00:04:16.039> on<00:04:16.310> I<00:04:16.519> can<00:04:16.910> see<00:04:17.090> my

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
with the post-processing on I can see my

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.360 
with the post-processing on I can see my
health<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.410> screen<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:18.799> blurry<00:04:19.010> at<00:04:19.220> the

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
health so the screen is blurry at the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.699 
health so the screen is blurry at the
moment<00:04:19.760> but<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:20.690> can<00:04:20.840> actually<00:04:20.989> turn<00:04:21.410> it<00:04:21.560> off

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
moment but you can actually turn it off

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.530 
moment but you can actually turn it off
by<00:04:22.010> going<00:04:22.640> your<00:04:22.910> settings

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
by going your settings

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.950 
by going your settings
at<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.960> moment<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.560> just<00:04:25.010> click<00:04:25.400> on<00:04:25.430> video<00:04:25.960> in

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
at the moment and just click on video in

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.710 
at the moment and just click on video in
your<00:04:27.290> inventory<00:04:28.220> screen<00:04:28.520> like<00:04:29.450> I<00:04:29.570> do<00:04:29.690> right

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
your inventory screen like I do right

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.520 
your inventory screen like I do right
now<00:04:30.430> so<00:04:31.430> now<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:31.730> basically<00:04:32.390> have<00:04:33.050> turn<00:04:33.350> it

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
now so now you basically have turn it

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.100 
now so now you basically have turn it
off<00:04:33.710> if<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:34.310> go<00:04:34.580> back<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.120> texture<00:04:35.540> menu

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
off if you go back to the texture menu

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.700 
off if you go back to the texture menu
for<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.560> second<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:38.000> have<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.990> video<00:04:39.320> memory

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
for a second you have the video memory

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.030 
for a second you have the video memory
just<00:04:40.100> put<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.340> on<00:04:40.580> auto<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.590> put<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.890> rest

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
just put that on auto and put the rest

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.520 
just put that on auto and put the rest
too<00:04:43.310> high<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:44.360> can<00:04:44.540> probably<00:04:44.750> alter<00:04:45.350> these

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
too high you can probably alter these

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.230 
too high you can probably alter these
but<00:04:45.860> I<00:04:45.890> don't<00:04:46.220> think<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.550> makes<00:04:46.730> a<00:04:46.910> lot<00:04:47.180> of

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
but I don't think it makes a lot of

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.220 
but I don't think it makes a lot of

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
to 1300 you can even put them down to

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.720 
to 1300 you can even put them down to
thousands<00:06:14.720> and<00:06:14.900> if<00:06:15.710> you<00:06:15.860> want<00:06:16.160> to<00:06:16.310> put<00:06:16.580> them

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
thousands and if you want to put them

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.460 
thousands and if you want to put them
lower<00:06:17.060> than<00:06:17.240> thousands<00:06:18.170> you<00:06:18.860> can<00:06:19.040> actually

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
lower than thousands you can actually

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.130 
lower than thousands you can actually
gain<00:06:21.470> FPS<00:06:22.130> with<00:06:22.370> you<00:06:22.610> you<00:06:23.180> actually<00:06:23.480> you<00:06:23.990> know

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
gain FPS with you you actually you know

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.310 
gain FPS with you you actually you know
for<00:06:24.410> example<00:06:24.470> if<00:06:25.190> I<00:06:25.400> look<00:06:25.610> to<00:06:25.790> those<00:06:26.320> apartment

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
for example if I look to those apartment

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.410 
for example if I look to those apartment
flats<00:06:27.560> to<00:06:27.770> my<00:06:27.890> left<00:06:28.190> right<00:06:28.460> now<00:06:28.520> I<00:06:28.940> would

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
flats to my left right now I would

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.990 
flats to my left right now I would
probably<00:06:29.900> not<00:06:30.110> see<00:06:30.380> them<00:06:30.560> because<00:06:30.850> they<00:06:31.850> won't

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
probably not see them because they won't

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.350 
probably not see them because they won't
even<00:06:32.240> render<00:06:33.020> in<00:06:33.320> it<00:06:34.010> will<00:06:34.220> increase<00:06:34.490> your<00:06:34.610> FPS

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
even render in it will increase your FPS

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.200 
even render in it will increase your FPS
I've<00:06:36.020> seen<00:06:36.349> people<00:06:36.669> playing<00:06:37.669> with<00:06:37.939> it<00:06:38.090> and

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
I've seen people playing with it and

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.179 
I've seen people playing with it and

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:40.189 
they could not see the other side of

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.240 
they could not see the other side of
Northwest<00:06:40.879> airfield<00:06:41.300> for<00:06:41.389> example<00:06:42.050> anyway<00:06:43.039> I
