00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.120
 2 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.000
 and good morning to all that I doubt 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.349
 of his maxi tutorial for a tauriel tool 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.239
 android and more particularly 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.590
 minecraft pocket edition is today 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.040
 I will show you how to join 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.690
 a server on mc can therefore we know that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.770
 the realm are paused but it wants 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.410
 not say that you can not 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.339
 join from minecraft server so here 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.230
 I will put you read it in the 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.750
 description of a site that requires end 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.100
 who gives you all the things that are 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.360
 possible in level 2 servers so we 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.769
 for example go on the live good on 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.690
 evene games that allows you to make 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.329
 hunger games so it's pretty cool 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.400
 so you will land on this page you 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.900
 can see here that you have some 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.360
 thing called address so here 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.560
 the one ip is here it's the port it takes 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.369
 especially not wrong when not returning 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.080
 what one would think that the address 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.140
 IP is not all that but that's 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.400
 ip addresses and this is the port so we 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.710
 ends up on the phone I click 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.070
 on play and once I clicked on 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.850
 place I click on external edit al in 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.110
 servern m 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.970
 we will put test in address 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.720
 we will put the address we 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:36.119
 can find or just here 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.119

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.900

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.890
 nothing has changed you click add 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.120
 server you click on test will you 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.050
 say rather on your server is there 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.220
 you can see that it's in the process of 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.760
 to transfer the loads of the ground so that there 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.380
 is 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.240
 normally we are on the server 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.040
 so we're waiting for them to download 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.320
 field we expected a few seconds 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.960

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.200
 waiter this to the usa you wait is 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.850
 normally you will land on the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.290
 server so here's where you can 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.170
