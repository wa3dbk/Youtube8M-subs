 holding a number of tools for 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.220
 people with disabilities 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.250
 in particular for those who see him badly 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.140
 it will be useful already considered earlier 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.369
 screen pack 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:10.689
 simplified version 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.019
 virtual keyboard and 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.649
 increase contrast 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:15.739
 as well as the so-called and crown 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:16.609
 speaker 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.259
 Alas, Russian is the last 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.230
 instrument is not recognized and not 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.149
 maintained and useful it will be 

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:24.219
 Is that those who are going back to back 

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.320
 to improve their knowledge 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.489
 English 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.639
 screen speaker features come down to 

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:32.329
 to read the name of the elements on 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.230
 which indicates a piece of the current moment 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.760
 you can choose how speed 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.980
 pronunciation as a number of such parameters as 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.190
 for example voice timbre 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.690
 even new features are provided in the new 90 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.290
 like using a computer blind 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.180
 deaf and users of 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.660
 many other perceptual disorders 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.560
 used in these settings we do not 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.580
 it will be a move on to work with 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.650
 in streams 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.480
 and in this block of settings you can 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.490
 adjust the way the folders open 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.950
 in the same as no 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.510
 for every time a lot 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.160
 open with single or double click 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.090
 as well as the way to work with transported 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.050
 mapping progress 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.380
 anything to change in this help me tips 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.830
 in the view tab, you can customize the nuances as 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.430
 reflection of documents 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980
 list all the elements 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.260
 of this subsection of the settings we also 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.500
 due to their multiplicity and 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.310
 evidence of application 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.369
 let's pay only a few attention to 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.509
 item dedicated to working with hidden 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.520
 pack 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.090
 by allowing the system to show the party you are 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.340
 can even see the hidden systemically 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.520
 items 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.030
 in the search tab are configured nuances 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.720
 Search 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.120
 default train means or spa 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.230
 will pass only by file names 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.740
 affecting the contents of these 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.810
 files only if these 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.940
 documents were indexed 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.200
 appropriate service 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.579
 however full text search 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.930
 can be carried out and among not renewed 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.110
 universes files 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.080
 the latter however may not take 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.460
 just a few minutes 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.080
 but also many hours 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.240
 so enable this option we would not 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.080
 recommended 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.910
 below is a number of options 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.459
 regulatory search algorithms 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.399
 for example by default 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.849
 supposed to be included in the search for those 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.580
 folders what is in that 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.759
 with which the search was started 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:17.980
 in the results 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.920
 can also be issued and found 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.659
 partial match queries 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.859
 user 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.859
 you can separately include language 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.309
 search allowing the introduction of complex 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.049
 algorithms and cancel the use of the index 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:30.670
 mebaza 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.939
 when searching for system files 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.519
 also the kind will be able to sue bear cubs 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.919
 files 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.399
 well, finally the last item 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.299
 of this block of settings and go 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.709
 forward installed in the system 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.930
 in the window that opens we will see samples 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.279
 already installed system fonts 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:50.929
 horizontal menu bar 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.489
 There are a number of options that allow 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.319
 customize how to display that or 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.529
 other font 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.529
 their view function is displaying such a window 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.499
 I press the key further we can now 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.540
 source are you looking at 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.499
 An example of an abstract phrase immediately in 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.769
 several sizes 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.040
 it is very convenient in comparison with early to 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.999
 implementation of meta tools 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.019
 but still inferior to some 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.799
 specialized applications for 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.489
 work with fonts 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.620
 highlighting several fonts at once we 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.989
 can open at the same time 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.009
 several windows during inspections 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:24.799
 and every sixth can 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.969
 fit several windows at once 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.259
 This is due to the fact that a number of fonts 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.139
 savely palette many different 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.069
 styles and layout 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.999
 highlighting unclaimed dressings 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.669
 You can also remove it from 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.609
 the corresponding button but delete 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.689
 the default fonts we set 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.449
 would not advise 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.599
 many of them 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.999
 involved in the system and deleting them you 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.009
 risk getting markedly changed 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.479
 UPC species interface 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.339
 if annoying you are abundant 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:55.050
 fonts in election boxes 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.000
 in text and graphic 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.609
 editors 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.749
 now you can simply useless six 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:00.589
 to hide 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:02.709
 To do this, simply select 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.379
 error and press the hide key 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.409
 if you select fonts that have already been 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.900
 opened then this button there will be indicated 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.669
 word show 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.749
 the find symbol function will open for us 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.120
 symbol table 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.320
 allowing to extract that any special 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.150
 character from any font 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.799
 don't go over hundreds 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.300
 key combinations waiting when in 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.210
 a text editor line will appear 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.860
 new character 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.500
 clicking on the icon you like 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.800
 twice get this character in the string 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.900
 to copy 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.850
 where you can cure either 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.139
 standard hotkeys 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.219
 or by pressing the copy button 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.379
 drop down menu on top it will allow 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.209
 also select special characters in different 

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:43.849
 font types 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.399
 installation of new sheets 

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.580
 carried simple 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.629
 dragging but washington into this window 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:51.099
 in case you try 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.899
 drag something non 

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:55.649
 supported font type, the system will display 

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.150
 error message 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.699
 on this perhaps all that can be said about 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.710
 this unit in the control panel
