00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.660
 youtube action on this occasion 

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:07.299
 I bring an application which we 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.789
 will allow us to change our blocking 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.670
 screen on our cell phone this lock 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:15.879
 is not like those that are 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.919
 normally as patron of some wine 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.910
 but this is one of the ones that bring 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:26.019
 the last and how is the hit and three the 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.850
 he and 91 of the most recent that have 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.640
 stepped out 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.280
 this application is called a blog 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.629
 and the original one that I tell you is 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.550
 of him and it is called that no code good what 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.290
 The only thing we have to do is go to 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.660
 the description of the video where I give them 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.290
 I will let the file download it 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.080
 install it 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.850
 this application serves in most 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.500
 the android as you can see here with a 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:57.440
 samsung galaxy s 4 and good also what 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.390
 testing in 1 sergi and so this for this 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.180
 application does not need to be root user 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.280
 nor any special requirement 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.910
 just download it from the description of 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:11.450
 video and be able to install our our 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.920
 applications already of unknown origins 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.660
 good to do that the only thing that 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.650
 we have to do is go to our 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.650
 configurations 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.270
 here and we go to what is this my 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.270
 device 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.020
 and we give here in safety 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.149
 and here we look where it says origins 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.579
 strangers as they could already notice the 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.079
 I had been called good by the humidity and 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.149

 message is something like belonging but 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.750
 Actually this does not happen anything I've 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.179
 installed many applications towards my 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.159
 telephones and the truth is that they run 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.069
 pretty good without any problem and 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.280
 we accept you and we go out now 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.479
 then we download the application 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.689
