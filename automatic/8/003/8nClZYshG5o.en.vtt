over years the plasmas had burn-in
issues<00:00:09.450> there<00:00:10.019> was<00:00:10.139> glare<00:00:10.500> on<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.800> screen<00:00:11.360> and

issues there was glare on the screen and
they<00:00:12.480> weren't<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:12.870> great<00:00:13.110> for<00:00:13.349> gaming<00:00:13.590> because

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
they weren't so great for gaming because

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.950

done it I want to do that we don't have
time<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.250> silly<00:00:50.460> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
time to be I have and it's just silly I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.189 
time to be I have and it's just silly I
mean<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.480> try<00:00:51.660> hard<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> burn

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
mean you really have to try hard to burn

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.040 
mean you really have to try hard to burn
it<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.739> take<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.850> whole<00:00:54.000> burnin<00:00:54.449> issue<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
it so take that whole burnin issue and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.049 
it so take that whole burnin issue and
throw<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> trash<00:00:56.190> that's<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:56.940> we've

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
throw it in the trash that's what we've

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:57.260 
throw it in the trash that's what we've
done

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
done

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.080 
done
so<00:00:57.570> burnin<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> problem<00:00:58.350> glare<00:00:59.129> also<00:00:59.820> not<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
so burnin not a problem glare also not a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.670 
so burnin not a problem glare also not a
problem<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.600> your<00:01:00.750> better<00:01:00.960> plasmas<00:01:01.469> there's

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
problem for your better plasmas there's

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.470 
problem for your better plasmas there's
usually<00:01:01.859> an<00:01:02.190> anti-glare<00:01:02.699> coating<00:01:02.789> or

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
usually an anti-glare coating or

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.509 
usually an anti-glare coating or
something<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> screen<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.920> make<00:01:04.949> glare<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
something on the screen to make glare a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.609 
something on the screen to make glare a
non-issue<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.140> don't<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.530> need

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
non-issue and so you don't really need

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.620 
non-issue and so you don't really need
to<00:01:07.740> worry<00:01:07.860> about<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.090> contrast

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to worry about that and the contrast

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.320 
to worry about that and the contrast
ratio<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.200> plasma<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> warmth

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
ratio of a plasma and just the warmth

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.450 
ratio of a plasma and just the warmth
and<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.600> color<00:01:12.900> they're<00:01:13.740> beautiful<00:01:14.250> for

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
and the color they're beautiful for

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.510 
and the color they're beautiful for
gaming<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:14.939> really<00:01:15.210> don't<00:01:15.630> worry<00:01:15.900> about<00:01:16.080> it

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
gaming so really don't worry about it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.260 
gaming so really don't worry about it
now<00:01:17.520> there's<00:01:17.729> plenty<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.240> there

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
now there's plenty of you out there

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.230 
now there's plenty of you out there
going<00:01:18.570> about<00:01:19.110> LCDs<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.460> LCD<00:01:20.880> well<00:01:21.060> there's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
going about LCDs I like LCD well there's

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.030 
going about LCDs I like LCD well there's
nothing<00:01:21.509> wrong<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:21.689> an<00:01:21.960> LCD<00:01:22.290> either<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
nothing wrong with an LCD either the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
nothing wrong with an LCD either the
LCDs<00:01:23.549> somebody<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.020> our<00:01:25.170> comments

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
LCDs somebody on one of our comments

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
LCDs somebody on one of our comments
they<00:01:25.710> even<00:01:25.979> said<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.369> LCD<00:01:26.759> seems<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
they even said so LCD seems to be the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.240 
they even said so LCD seems to be the
way<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> future<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.799> does<00:01:28.950> kind<00:01:29.220> of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
way of the future and it does kind of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.700 
way of the future and it does kind of
seem<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.850> LCD<00:01:30.479> TVs<00:01:30.840> are<00:01:31.049> thinner<00:01:31.439> than

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
seem like that LCD TVs are thinner than

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980 
seem like that LCD TVs are thinner than
ever<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.369> mean<00:01:32.729> they're<00:01:33.240> almost<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.659> thin<00:01:33.840> as

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
ever I mean they're almost as thin as

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.319 
ever I mean they're almost as thin as
this<00:01:34.140> clipboard<00:01:34.439> now<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.100> ridiculous

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
this clipboard now it's ridiculous

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.780 
this clipboard now it's ridiculous
and<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.810> look<00:01:37.049> cool<00:01:37.350> they've<00:01:37.710> got<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.759> know

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
and they look cool they've got you know
