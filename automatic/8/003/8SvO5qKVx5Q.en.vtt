00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.210 

okay<00:00:02.070> so<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.909> is<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.240> env2<00:00:04.020> locomotive<00:00:04.859> and

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
okay so this is the env2 locomotive and

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.400 
okay so this is the env2 locomotive and
down<00:00:05.879> inside<00:00:06.299> there<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.720> can<00:00:06.899> see<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.200> motor

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
down inside there you can see the motor

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
down inside there you can see the motor
that<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.809> starter<00:00:09.809> generator<00:00:10.550> star<00:00:11.550> gin<00:00:11.820> for

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
that is a starter generator star gin for

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.390 
that is a starter generator star gin for
short<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.290> can<00:00:13.410> see<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> motor<00:00:13.799> chain<00:00:14.190> in

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
short and you can see the motor chain in

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
short and you can see the motor chain in
there<00:00:14.580> goes<00:00:15.120> down<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.350> output<00:00:16.740> shaft<00:00:17.420> just

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
there goes down to the output shaft just

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.109 
there goes down to the output shaft just
like<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.779> NB<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.320> except<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.550> locomotive

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
like the NB one except this locomotive

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.099 
like the NB one except this locomotive
only<00:00:21.689> has<00:00:22.820> two<00:00:23.820> levels<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.330> reduction<00:00:24.840> instead

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
only has two levels of reduction instead

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.810 
only has two levels of reduction instead
of<00:00:25.230> three<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.039> reason<00:00:26.340> for<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.519> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
of three and the reason for that is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.599 
of three and the reason for that is
because<00:00:27.260> this<00:00:28.260> motor<00:00:28.560> has<00:00:28.890> four<00:00:29.250> sets<00:00:29.490> of

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
because this motor has four sets of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.279 
because this motor has four sets of
brushes<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.210> there's<00:00:30.420> an<00:00:30.570> inherent<00:00:30.720> two<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
brushes so there's an inherent two to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.420 
brushes so there's an inherent two to
one<00:00:31.439> reduction<00:00:31.980> built<00:00:32.189> right<00:00:32.340> into<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> motor

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
one reduction built right into the motor

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.040 
one reduction built right into the motor
there's<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.670> wheel<00:00:35.870> here's<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.910> equalizer

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
there's the wheel here's the equalizer

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
there's the wheel here's the equalizer
