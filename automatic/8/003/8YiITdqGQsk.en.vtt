you're drawing so this is our third
drawer<00:00:47.100> sand<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.899> pretty<00:00:49.110> hard<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> think

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
drawer sand to be pretty hard to think

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.920 
drawer sand to be pretty hard to think
of<00:00:49.920> ideas<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.489> draw<00:00:50.700> things<00:00:51.059> sometimes<00:00:51.660> but

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
of ideas to draw things sometimes but

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.470 
of ideas to draw things sometimes but
right<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:52.680> I'm<00:00:52.800> doing<00:00:53.129> bit<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.910> sand<00:00:54.149> I'm

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
right now I'm doing bit of sand I'm

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.119 
right now I'm doing bit of sand I'm
going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> draw<00:00:54.870> over<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> ocean<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.920> make<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
going to draw over the ocean to make it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.670 
going to draw over the ocean to make it
look<00:00:56.190> kind<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> beach<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.440> sunny<00:00:58.440> day

look kind like the beach and sunny day

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.770 
look kind like the beach and sunny day
so<00:00:59.039> people<00:00:59.219> hopefully<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.879> sand<00:01:00.210> out<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
so people hopefully get sand out of the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.319 
so people hopefully get sand out of the
four<00:01:01.079> choices<00:01:01.609> because<00:01:02.609> they'll<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.940> them<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
four choices because they'll have them a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.420 
four choices because they'll have them a
few<00:01:04.080> words<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.559> pick<00:01:04.769> from<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.309> I'm

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
few words to pick from of what I'm

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.850
