00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
oh uh okay well I ended up having a

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.190 
oh uh okay well I ended up having a
problem<00:00:16.309> with<00:00:16.430> my<00:00:16.580> clutch<00:00:17.030> and<00:00:17.390> I<00:00:17.900> noticed

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
problem with my clutch and I noticed

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.840 
problem with my clutch and I noticed
that<00:00:18.290> it<00:00:18.320> started<00:00:18.680> slipping<00:00:18.920> and<00:00:19.490> what<00:00:19.730> would

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
that it started slipping and what would

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.519 
that it started slipping and what would
happen<00:00:20.000> is<00:00:20.240> I<00:00:20.360> would<00:00:20.480> start<00:00:20.570> to<00:00:20.810> take<00:00:20.960> off<00:00:21.170> and

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
happen is I would start to take off and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.750 
happen is I would start to take off and
it<00:00:21.590> just<00:00:21.740> seemed<00:00:21.890> like<00:00:22.040> the<00:00:22.189> clutch<00:00:22.400> wouldn't

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
it just seemed like the clutch wouldn't

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.990 
it just seemed like the clutch wouldn't
grab<00:00:23.000> at<00:00:23.210> all<00:00:23.360> and<00:00:24.430> so<00:00:25.430> anyway<00:00:25.700> when<00:00:25.880> I<00:00:25.910> took

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
grab at all and so anyway when I took

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.180 
grab at all and so anyway when I took
the<00:00:26.270> clutch<00:00:26.480> off<00:00:26.720> this<00:00:26.990> is<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:27.200> outer<00:00:27.470> Bell

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
the clutch off this is the outer Bell

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.220 
the clutch off this is the outer Bell
housing<00:00:28.730> thing<00:00:28.970> that<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.270> see<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:29.930> clutch

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
housing thing that you see the clutch

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.930 
housing thing that you see the clutch
housing<00:00:30.440> I<00:00:30.890> don't<00:00:31.580> know<00:00:31.640> if<00:00:31.730> that's<00:00:31.880> the

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
housing I don't know if that's the

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.790 
housing I don't know if that's the
proper<00:00:32.210> name<00:00:32.480> but<00:00:32.809> when<00:00:32.989> I<00:00:33.020> took<00:00:33.260> it<00:00:33.379> off<00:00:33.530> I

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
proper name but when I took it off I

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.260 
proper name but when I took it off I

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
noticed that there is a whole lot of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.580 
noticed that there is a whole lot of
grease<00:00:35.510> stains<00:00:35.870> in<00:00:36.140> here<00:00:36.379> and<00:00:36.470> there's

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
grease stains in here and there's

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.229 
grease stains in here and there's
actually<00:00:37.040> if<00:00:37.220> you<00:00:37.430> look<00:00:37.610> right<00:00:37.820> here<00:00:38.030> in<00:00:38.120> the

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
actually if you look right here in the

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.119 
actually if you look right here in the
in<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.629> center<00:00:38.960> of<00:00:39.110> it<00:00:39.260> there's<00:00:39.770> actually

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
in the center of it there's actually

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.240 
in the center of it there's actually
like<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.280> ring<00:00:40.610> of<00:00:40.850> grease<00:00:41.290> that's<00:00:42.290> stuck<00:00:42.949> there

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
like a ring of grease that's stuck there

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.130 
like a ring of grease that's stuck there
and<00:00:43.430> that's<00:00:44.000> just<00:00:44.120> from<00:00:44.540> grease<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:44.900> is

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
and that's just from grease that is

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.869 
and that's just from grease that is
blunt<00:00:45.559> that's<00:00:45.800> flown<00:00:46.100> out<00:00:46.339> of<00:00:46.400> the<00:00:46.519> center

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
blunt that's flown out of the center

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.780 
blunt that's flown out of the center
part<00:00:47.120> of<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:48.260> shaft<00:00:48.559> that<00:00:49.040> goes<00:00:49.250> through<00:00:49.519> here

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
part of the shaft that goes through here

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.640 
part of the shaft that goes through here
we'll<00:00:50.120> show<00:00:50.150> you<00:00:50.330> what<00:00:50.570> that<00:00:50.600> looks<00:00:50.930> like<00:00:51.019> in

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
we'll show you what that looks like in

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.990 
we'll show you what that looks like in
anyway<00:00:51.979> that<00:00:52.190> ended<00:00:52.400> up<00:00:52.460> getting<00:00:52.610> on<00:00:52.879> this

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
anyway that ended up getting on this

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.570 
anyway that ended up getting on this
outer<00:00:53.239> clutch<00:00:53.570> surface<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:54.379> it<00:00:55.010> made<00:00:55.430> it

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
outer clutch surface and it made it

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.180 
outer clutch surface and it made it
slippery<00:00:55.940> in<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.479> and<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:57.350> clutch<00:00:57.890> pads

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
slippery in the and the clutch pads

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.579 
slippery in the and the clutch pads
wouldn't<00:00:58.610> stick<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.600> anyway<00:01:00.199> what<00:01:00.379> I'm<00:01:00.470> gonna

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
wouldn't stick so anyway what I'm gonna

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:01.869 
wouldn't stick so anyway what I'm gonna
have<00:01:00.769> to<00:01:00.860> do<00:01:00.949> is<00:01:01.129> clean<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:01.489> all<00:01:01.610> up

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
and get gasoline or something like that

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.460 
and get gasoline or something like that
and<00:01:04.790> then<00:01:04.940> finish<00:01:05.750> clean<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.080> off<00:01:06.200> with<00:01:06.380> like

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
and then finish clean it off with like

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.440 
and then finish clean it off with like
brake<00:01:06.770> cleaner<00:01:07.040> or<00:01:07.250> something<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:08.180> be<00:01:08.270> able<00:01:08.299> to

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
brake cleaner or something to be able to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.780 
brake cleaner or something to be able to
get<00:01:08.630> all<00:01:08.810> this<00:01:09.110> film<00:01:09.680> stuff<00:01:10.070> off<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:10.549> I<00:01:10.580> have<00:01:10.760> a

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
get all this film stuff off so I have a

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.520 
get all this film stuff off so I have a
nice<00:01:11.030> clean<00:01:11.360> surface<00:01:11.390> on<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.049> clutch<00:01:12.290> bail

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
nice clean surface on the clutch bail

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
nice clean surface on the clutch bail
again<00:01:12.940> so<00:01:14.860> that's<00:01:15.860> going<00:01:15.980> to<00:01:16.070> be<00:01:16.160> one<00:01:16.370> of<00:01:16.490> the

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
again so that's going to be one of the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.460 
again so that's going to be one of the
steps<00:01:17.120> but<00:01:17.390> then<00:01:17.570> also<00:01:17.870> I've<00:01:18.110> got<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.350> be<00:01:18.410> able

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
steps but then also I've got to be able

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.100 
steps but then also I've got to be able
to<00:01:18.590> fix<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.040> leak<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.600> clean<00:01:20.600> off<00:01:20.780> all<00:01:20.930> the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
to fix the leak and clean off all the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.860 
to fix the leak and clean off all the
other<00:01:21.140> parts<00:01:21.590> as<00:01:21.740> well<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:23.390> other<00:01:23.570> part

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
other parts as well so the other part

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.830 
other parts as well so the other part
that<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.430> this<00:01:25.430> is<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.730> actual<00:01:26.030> clutch<00:01:26.420> itself

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
that I this is the actual clutch itself

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.240 
that I this is the actual clutch itself
so<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:27.350> is<00:01:27.440> what<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.650> looks<00:01:27.830> like<00:01:27.890> from<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
so this is what it looks like from the

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.710 
so this is what it looks like from the
outside<00:01:28.610> it's<00:01:28.790> got<00:01:28.910> the<00:01:29.030> big<00:01:29.210> nut<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.540> stuff

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
outside it's got the big nut and stuff

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.380 
outside it's got the big nut and stuff
on<00:01:29.870> it<00:01:30.050> so<00:01:30.730> but<00:01:31.730> you<00:01:32.060> can<00:01:32.090> see<00:01:32.390> inside<00:01:32.750> here<00:01:33.110> the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
on it so but you can see inside here the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.440 
on it so but you can see inside here the
this<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.570> one<00:01:35.840> of<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.730> oil<00:01:37.730> rings<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.390> believe

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
this is one of the oil rings I believe

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.670 
this is one of the oil rings I believe
or<00:01:39.110> not<00:01:39.320> oil<00:01:39.560> rings<00:01:39.890> oil<00:01:40.850> seals<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.630> stuff<00:01:42.500> is

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
or not oil rings oil seals and stuff is

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.050 
or not oil rings oil seals and stuff is
leaked<00:01:42.920> out<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.250> there<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.490> can<00:01:43.610> even<00:01:43.760> see

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
leaked out of there you can even see

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.020 
leaked out of there you can even see
like<00:01:44.300> on<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:44.630> outside<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.260> these<00:01:45.350> things<00:01:46.030> it's

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
like on the outside of these things it's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.150 
like on the outside of these things it's
kind<00:01:47.300> of<00:01:47.360> hard<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.630> see<00:01:47.870> here<00:01:47.900> but<00:01:48.170> here's<00:01:48.950> one

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
kind of hard to see here but here's one

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.090 
kind of hard to see here but here's one
you<00:01:49.790> can<00:01:49.940> see<00:01:50.150> how<00:01:50.360> how<00:01:50.840> oil<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.560> grease<00:01:51.860> is

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100
