00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.580
 except the pâté hénaff and the sausage 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.589
 hénaff all our other products are 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.390
 made from meat bought at 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.849
 outside but rigorously 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.410
 selected to improve the qualities 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.300
 nutritional products 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.660
 we engaged in 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.470
 steps like blue-white-heart ab and 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.230
 red label for other preparations 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.000
 after elaborating the recipe we 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.110
 let's get the scrum into big 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.430
 Dosing as for the block hénaff 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.760
 implementation techniques are 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:49.520
 substantially the same for our paws 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.590
 and in jars we use a chain to 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.460
 slower rate to avoid 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.460
 risk of broken glass 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.620
 here a little storm stage of 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.570
 surface under the heat of resistance 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.339
 heating 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.390
 throughout the production chain 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.709
 we carry out rigorous control 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.539
 we take products so 

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:13.550
 permed 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:15.740
 for example we take jars 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.340
 to analyze the quality of closure 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.340
 of the capsule 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.420
 for our other canned pate the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.100
 process is the same with cadences 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.900
 different according to the type of box 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.900
 here the dosing of rillettes 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.740
 of course the boxes the post verrines 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.850
 also after filling by the 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.850
 landing phase 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.990
 for packaging other pasta 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.390
 and the techniques are often more 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.740
 complex than for the pâté hénaff and 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.660
 requires more manpower 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.660
 especially at the packaging level 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.660
 we allow ourselves to show you these 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.910
 some images from our 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.560
 laboratory where we perform the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.569
 secret mixtures of spices and 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.569
 condiments for all our preparations 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.440
 Finally, we also manufacture 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.900
 cooked meat including the tongue of 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.050
 beef in sauce 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.239
 this chain runs regularly 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.989
 sliced languages ​​come in 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.970
 in the manufacturing circuit 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.560
 the chain is semi automatic and makes 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.300
 call to the hands exercised of doses 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.480
 specialized workers for the implementation 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.480
 box 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.959
 here also a strict control of 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.920
 quality is done at the end of the line 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.709
 just before crimping is necessary 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.870
 acknowledge sorrow that even if you 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:42.970
 passed my reasons for the pure edge they 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.970
 have put all the guinea pig
