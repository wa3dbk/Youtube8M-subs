something<00:01:52.540> that<00:01:53.020> has<00:01:53.230> been<00:01:53.470> feasible<00:01:54.070> on<00:01:54.280> the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
something that has been feasible on the

something that has been feasible on the
oneplus<00:01:54.820> one<00:01:55.150> before<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.840> they've<00:01:55.930> just

oneplus one before and they've just

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.530 
oneplus one before and they've just
carried<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:56.620> over<00:01:56.710> on<00:01:57.700> top<00:01:57.970> here<00:01:58.210> you'll<00:01:58.360> see

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
carried it over on top here you'll see

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.450 
carried it over on top here you'll see
the<00:01:58.659> earpiece<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.080> 5<00:01:59.530> megapixel<00:01:59.860> front-facing

and<00:02:01.850> that's<00:02:02.810> basically<00:02:03.049> it<00:02:03.380> for<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.770> front

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979

piece here and that's the new camera

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.570 
piece here and that's the new camera
it's<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.420> 13<00:02:08.810> megapixel<00:02:08.959> like<00:02:09.560> last<00:02:09.800> year<00:02:10.099> but

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
it's a 13 megapixel like last year but

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.880 
it's a 13 megapixel like last year but
it's<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.759> new<00:02:10.940> sensor<00:02:11.390> by<00:02:11.510> Omni<00:02:11.870> vision<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.379> it

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
it's a new sensor by Omni vision and it

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.130 
it's a new sensor by Omni vision and it
has<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.550> laser<00:02:13.940> autofocus<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.750> can<00:02:14.870> see<00:02:15.110> a

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
has a laser autofocus you can see a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.740 
has a laser autofocus you can see a
sensor<00:02:15.739> there<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.129> it<00:02:16.790> has<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> dual<00:02:17.239> LED<00:02:17.720> flash

sensor there and it has a dual LED flash
it's<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.260> little<00:02:18.500> lower<00:02:18.650> than<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.040> other<00:02:19.400> one

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
it's a little lower than the other one

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.300 
it's a little lower than the other one
from<00:02:20.239> last<00:02:20.450> year<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.590> it's<00:02:22.220> really

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
from last year but it's it's really

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.000 
from last year but it's it's really
great<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.569> camera<00:02:23.870> works<00:02:24.319> really<00:02:24.590> well<00:02:24.800> the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
great the camera works really well the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.580 
great the camera works really well the
hardware<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.880> point<00:02:26.660> in<00:02:26.959> terms<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.349> specs

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
hardware is on point in terms of specs

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.680 
hardware is on point in terms of specs
the<00:02:28.190> only<00:02:28.430> disappointment<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.269> software

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
the only disappointment is the software

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.660 
the only disappointment is the software
just<00:02:29.810> doesn't<00:02:30.319> live<00:02:30.440> up<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.620> what<00:02:31.549> the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
just doesn't live up to what the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.550 
just doesn't live up to what the
hardware<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.209> do<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.690> one<00:02:33.140> plus<00:02:33.349> one<00:02:33.500> is

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
hardware can do and one plus one is

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.020 
hardware can do and one plus one is
promised<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:34.160> update<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.700> right<00:02:34.849> now<00:02:34.970> the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
promised to update it right now the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.699 
promised to update it right now the
camera<00:02:35.420> app<00:02:35.569> is<00:02:35.720> very<00:02:35.750> basic<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.560> can

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
camera app is very basic you can

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.100 
camera app is very basic you can
obviously<00:02:37.160> use<00:02:37.280> manual<00:02:37.819> camera<00:02:38.030> or<00:02:38.330> fe5<00:02:38.840> if

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
obviously use manual camera or fe5 if

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.780 
obviously use manual camera or fe5 if
you<00:02:39.230> prefer<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.799> have<00:02:40.099> a<00:02:40.250> little<00:02:40.310> bit<00:02:40.610> more

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
you prefer to have a little bit more

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.479 
you prefer to have a little bit more
control<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.360> frankly<00:02:41.950> what<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:42.980> want<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.340> see

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
control but frankly what I want to see

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.160 
control but frankly what I want to see
is<00:02:43.610> something<00:02:43.819> like<00:02:43.970> what<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.390> g4<00:02:44.780> offers

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
is something like what the g4 offers

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
cool I hope this is programmable so you

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.659 
cool I hope this is programmable so you
can<00:04:18.340> maybe<00:04:18.489> turn<00:04:18.789> it<00:04:18.849> into<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.829> sound<00:04:20.829> on<00:04:21.340> and

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
can maybe turn it into a sound on and

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.249 
can maybe turn it into a sound on and
off<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:22.150> rocker<00:04:22.449> just<00:04:22.810> like<00:04:22.930> on<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.139> iPhone

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
off a rocker just like on the iPhone

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.010 
off a rocker just like on the iPhone
that<00:04:23.650> would<00:04:23.770> be<00:04:23.860> really<00:04:24.099> cool<00:04:24.690> what<00:04:25.690> else<00:04:25.840> is

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
that would be really cool what else is

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.870 
that would be really cool what else is
there<00:04:26.139> to<00:04:26.320> say<00:04:26.349> the<00:04:26.800> innards<00:04:27.160> of<00:04:27.400> this<00:04:27.580> phone

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
there to say the innards of this phone

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.170 
there to say the innards of this phone
are<00:04:28.800> Snapdragon<00:04:29.800> 810<00:04:30.190> it's<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.550> version<00:04:30.940> 2<00:04:31.150> of

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
are Snapdragon 810 it's the version 2 of

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.990 
are Snapdragon 810 it's the version 2 of
the<00:04:31.389> 810<00:04:31.780> so<00:04:31.960> it's<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.259> little<00:04:32.470> bit<00:04:32.710> more

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
the 810 so it's a little bit more

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.480 
the 810 so it's a little bit more
efficient<00:04:34.000> in<00:04:34.180> terms<00:04:34.479> of<00:04:35.099> power<00:04:36.099> management

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
efficient in terms of power management

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.820 
efficient in terms of power management
better<00:04:36.910> battery<00:04:37.330> life<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.810> potentially<00:04:38.800> a

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
better battery life and potentially a

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.580 
better battery life and potentially a
little<00:04:39.460> bit<00:04:39.580> less<00:04:39.789> hot<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.419> didn't<00:04:41.259> notice<00:04:41.470> it

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
little bit less hot I didn't notice it

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.980 
little bit less hot I didn't notice it
running<00:04:41.889> warm<00:04:42.160> but<00:04:42.430> nothing<00:04:42.759> too<00:04:43.030> alarming<00:04:43.780> so

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
running warm but nothing too alarming so

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.300 
running warm but nothing too alarming so
that<00:04:44.139> seems<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.620> be<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.919> case<00:04:45.070> 4<00:04:46.000> gigs<00:04:46.240> of<00:04:46.419> ram

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
that seems to be the case 4 gigs of ram

particular unit there's going to be a

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.230 
particular unit there's going to be a
cheaper<00:04:52.800> $329<00:04:53.800> unit<00:04:54.190> with<00:04:54.370> 16<00:04:54.849> gigs<00:04:55.090> of
