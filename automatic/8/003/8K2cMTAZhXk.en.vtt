00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.960 
so I'm going to teach you some really
simple<00:00:22.840> techniques<00:00:23.560> today<00:00:23.980> it's<00:00:24.430> the<00:00:24.550> basic

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
simple techniques today it's the basic

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.109 
simple techniques today it's the basic
class<00:00:25.210> so<00:00:26.050> I'm<00:00:27.040> going<00:00:27.250> to<00:00:27.310> do<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.790> teach<00:00:28.000> you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
class so I'm going to do is teach you

class so I'm going to do is teach you
how<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.300> do<00:00:28.510> a<00:00:28.540> classic<00:00:28.840> swirl

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
how to do a classic swirl

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.300 
how to do a classic swirl
when<00:00:31.130> we<00:00:31.310> work<00:00:32.110> we<00:00:33.110> actually<00:00:33.140> even<00:00:34.070> though<00:00:34.190> in

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
when we work we actually even though in

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.830 
when we work we actually even though in
photos<00:00:34.790> are<00:00:34.940> always<00:00:35.060> less<00:00:35.330> like<00:00:35.540> people

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
photos are always less like people

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.570 
photos are always less like people
poking<00:00:36.080> like<00:00:36.350> that<00:00:36.560> we<00:00:36.980> have<00:00:37.130> to<00:00:37.250> be<00:00:37.340> quite

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
poking like that we have to be quite

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.710 
poking like that we have to be quite
like<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:38.060> okay<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.110> we<00:00:39.350> keep<00:00:39.620> me

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
like this okay so we keep me

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.479 
like this okay so we keep me
at<00:00:42.720> the<00:00:43.580> cupcake

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
at the cupcake

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.479 
at the cupcake
okay

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
okay

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.970 
okay
so<00:00:47.790> we'll<00:00:48.090> show<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.270> what<00:00:48.480> man

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
so we'll show you what man

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.730 
so we'll show you what man
we<00:00:50.250> put<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.640> icing<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> cake<00:00:51.450> and<00:00:51.810> then

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
we put on the icing on the cake and then

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.040 
we put on the icing on the cake and then
we<00:00:52.830> start<00:00:53.130> moving<00:00:53.460> around<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.940> cake<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
we start moving around the cake the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.860 
we start moving around the cake the
circular<00:00:55.650> motion<00:00:56.090> when<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.240> get<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.570> where<00:00:57.750> we

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
circular motion when we get to where we

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.170 
circular motion when we get to where we
started<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.770> stop<00:00:59.040> working<00:00:59.220> over<00:00:59.850> what<00:01:00.000> we've

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
started we stop working over what we've

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.920 
started we stop working over what we've
already<00:01:00.360> fired

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
already fired

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.290 
already fired
allowing<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.520> bring<00:01:02.730> us<00:01:02.850> around<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
allowing that to bring us around in the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.960 
allowing that to bring us around in the
circle<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:04.680> when<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.339> center<00:01:05.580> we

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
circle and when we get to the center we

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.190 
circle and when we get to the center we
push

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.890 

so<00:01:08.620> that's<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.100> classic<00:01:09.610> swirl<00:01:09.990> okay

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
so that's the classic swirl okay

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.630 
so that's the classic swirl okay
consistency<00:01:13.900> speed<00:01:14.310> consistency<00:01:15.310> pressure

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
consistency speed consistency pressure

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.959 
consistency speed consistency pressure
and<00:01:16.090> distance

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
and distance

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.270 
and distance
when<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.539> say<00:01:18.840> consistent<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.560> spear<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.130> are

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
when I say consistent if spear that are

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.669 
when I say consistent if spear that are
actually<00:01:20.640> want<00:01:20.909> me<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> go<00:01:21.329> fast<00:01:21.630> okay<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.669 --> 00:01:22.679 
actually want me to go fast okay the

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.450 
actually want me to go fast okay the
slower<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.399> more<00:01:23.579> control

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
slower you go the more control

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.100 
slower you go the more control
your<00:01:25.670> speed<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.390> your<00:01:26.479> pressure<00:01:26.810> need<00:01:27.080> to

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
your speed and your pressure need to

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.560 
your speed and your pressure need to
work<00:01:27.380> in<00:01:27.560> tandem<00:01:27.830> with<00:01:28.130> each<00:01:28.369> other<00:01:28.700> okay

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
work in tandem with each other okay

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.450 
work in tandem with each other okay
it's<00:01:29.780> no<00:01:29.930> good<00:01:30.200> going<00:01:30.500> really<00:01:30.710> fast<00:01:31.040> but<00:01:31.400> not

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
it's no good going really fast but not

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.450 
it's no good going really fast but not
quite<00:01:31.850> enough<00:01:32.030> pressure<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.390> see<00:01:32.630> rising

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
quite enough pressure to see rising

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.680 
quite enough pressure to see rising
conversely<00:01:34.460> if<00:01:34.580> you<00:01:34.610> know<00:01:34.790> very<00:01:35.030> slow<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.570> you

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
conversely if you know very slow and you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.149 
conversely if you know very slow and you
don't<00:01:35.900> any<00:01:36.229> look<00:01:36.440> why<00:01:36.590> too<00:01:36.650> much<00:01:36.920> pressure

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
don't any look why too much pressure

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.620 
don't any look why too much pressure
you'll<00:01:37.430> end<00:01:37.580> up<00:01:37.640> with<00:01:37.760> a<00:01:38.000> splat<00:01:38.330> or<00:01:38.509> with<00:01:38.600> a

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
you'll end up with a splat or with a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.700 
you'll end up with a splat or with a
very<00:01:38.780> wide<00:01:39.110> line<00:01:39.470> okay<00:01:40.040> so

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.380 

distance<00:01:44.130> from<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.400> cupcake<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.090> want<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.330> be

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
distance from the cupcake you want to be

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.610 
distance from the cupcake you want to be
hovering<00:01:45.659> above<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.140> cupcake

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
hovering above the cupcake

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.370 
hovering above the cupcake
but<00:01:48.220> you<00:01:48.730> don't<00:01:49.030> want<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.450> drop<00:01:49.720> your<00:01:49.930> nozzle

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
but you don't want to drop your nozzle

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.200 
but you don't want to drop your nozzle
if<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.530> drop<00:01:50.740> your<00:01:50.770> nozzle<00:01:51.220> straight<00:01:51.700> for<00:01:51.910> 40

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
if you drop your nozzle straight for 40

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.460 
if you drop your nozzle straight for 40
very<00:01:52.540> polite<00:01:52.900> and<00:01:53.290> if<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.520> go<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.600> -<00:01:55.840> our

that<00:02:01.119> was<00:02:01.329> the<00:02:01.450> classic<00:02:01.840> swap<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.320> next<00:02:02.560> one

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
that was the classic swap the next one

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.289 
that was the classic swap the next one
I'm<00:02:02.799> going<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.009> shave<00:02:03.310> it's<00:02:03.969> the<00:02:04.060> one<00:02:04.210> that

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
I'm going to shave it's the one that

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.789 
I'm going to shave it's the one that
most<00:02:04.479> people<00:02:04.810> find<00:02:04.929> the<00:02:05.079> most<00:02:05.259> challenging

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
most people find the most challenging

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.609 
most people find the most challenging
cut<00:02:06.009> into<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.340> roads<00:02:06.549> okay<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:08.140> we<00:02:08.259> started

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
cut into the roads okay so we started

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.839 
cut into the roads okay so we started
the<00:02:08.679> center<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:09.099> decay

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
the center of decay

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.690 
the center of decay
we<00:02:10.269> have<00:02:10.390> out<00:02:10.569> some<00:02:10.840> ice<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.170> come<00:02:11.470> out<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
we have out some ice to come out and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.140 
we have out some ice to come out and
then<00:02:12.849> we<00:02:12.940> move<00:02:13.150> forward<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.870> round<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.970> then

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
then we move forward and round and then

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.960 
then we move forward and round and then
we<00:02:16.300> just

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.610 

till<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:20.270> run<00:02:20.420> out<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.630> paper<00:02:20.960> we<00:02:21.290> run<00:02:21.440> out<00:02:21.590> of

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
till we run out of paper we run out of

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.710 
till we run out of paper we run out of
cake<00:02:21.830> we<00:02:22.010> keep<00:02:22.250> putting<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.760> icing

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.040 

okay<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.620> that's<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.980> bose<00:02:28.280> well

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
okay so that's the bose well
