L stand just by itself if you see L
stand<00:01:08.130> s<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.750> when<00:01:10.170> you

stand s this is what you get when you

stand s this is what you get when you
place<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> order<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> same<00:01:12.090> thing

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
place the order this is the same thing

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.600 
place the order this is the same thing
we're<00:01:12.450> looking<00:01:12.540> at<00:01:12.810> only<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.200> carbon<00:01:13.560> fiber<00:01:13.830> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
we're looking at only in carbon fiber so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.700 
we're looking at only in carbon fiber so
it<00:01:14.820> would<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:15.030> an<00:01:15.119> L<00:01:15.299> stand<00:01:15.600> s<00:01:15.869> followed<00:01:16.560> by

it would be an L stand s followed by

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.820 
it would be an L stand s followed by
three<00:01:17.189> letters<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.030> case<00:01:18.240> CA<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:19.049> if

three letters to in this case CA are if

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.859 
three letters to in this case CA are if
you're<00:01:20.040> looking<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> line<00:01:20.729> color<00:01:21.180> limas<00:01:21.659> li

you're looking at a line color limas li

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.499 
you're looking at a line color limas li
m<00:01:22.439> part<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.340> confusion<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> read

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
m part of the confusion is when you read

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.390 
m part of the confusion is when you read
that<00:01:24.750> when<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.500> read<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.950> actually<00:01:26.100> looks

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that when you read it it actually looks

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.649 
that when you read it it actually looks
like<00:01:26.549> L<00:01:26.939> stand

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
like L stand

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
like L stand
swim<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.250> reads<00:01:29.640> it's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
swim it's not what that reads it's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.330 
swim it's not what that reads it's
actually<00:01:30.329> saying<00:01:30.570> L<00:01:30.869> stand<00:01:31.229> s

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
actually saying L stand s

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.700 
actually saying L stand s
so<00:01:33.850> if<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.090> see<00:01:34.240> y'all<00:01:34.390> stand<00:01:34.659> s<00:01:34.840> that's<00:01:35.350> stand

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
so if you see y'all stand s that's stand

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.950 
so if you see y'all stand s that's stand
one<00:01:35.950> moving<00:01:36.909> up<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.240> again<00:01:37.450> I'll<00:01:37.570> stand<00:01:37.780> s

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
one moving up and again I'll stand s

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.929 
one moving up and again I'll stand s
this<00:01:38.259> is<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.439> more<00:01:38.710> economical<00:01:39.520> I'll<00:01:39.640> stand

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
this is the more economical I'll stand

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.289 
this is the more economical I'll stand
just<00:01:40.930> by<00:01:41.079> itself<00:01:41.409> if<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:42.220> want<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:42.939> can<00:01:43.119> get

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
just by itself if you want you can get

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.350 
just by itself if you want you can get
the<00:01:43.450> L<00:01:43.630> stand<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.340> clamps<00:01:45.729> included

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
the L stand with the clamps included

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.580 
the L stand with the clamps included
this<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.630> useful<00:01:46.840> if<00:01:47.079> you're<00:01:47.200> going<00:01:47.320> to<00:01:47.409> clamp

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
this is useful if you're going to clamp

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.249 
this is useful if you're going to clamp
this<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> table<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.149> cough<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.750> case<00:01:49.990> it

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
this to a table to a cough in a case it

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:51.840 
this to a table to a cough in a case it
makes<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.560> more<00:01:50.740> versatile<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.549> can<00:01:51.700> actually
