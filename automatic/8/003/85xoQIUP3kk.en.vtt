00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.170
 hello and welcome as you see here I am 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.210
 downloading the four new games of my 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.010
 plaza to show you and make a small 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.200
 review of each of them 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.669
 unfortunately my console was one of the 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.310
 affected by the latest update 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.170
 that made it impossible to buy 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.900
 the games but now several days 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.400
 after they have solved this problem 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.410
 in the video I also wanted to show you 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.170
 new version of my place that's why I've 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.140
 decided to finally upload the video that yes 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.910
 until the fateful error appears 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.829
 thanks for watching this video and remember 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.250
 that soon I will upload the analyzes of each 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.680
 one of these mini games 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.110
 hello and welcome to this new video 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.730
 today an update for the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.850
 nintendo nintendo portable console 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.010
 3ds and in this update there is a 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.470
 important update of my place 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.660
 pretty big update because it's 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.150
 quite remodeled and not only that but 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.240
 that we will have to our exhibition 4 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.430
 games that are now paid and how 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.900
 you see they have already started in my place and 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.630
 let's see what this 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.460
 update I think it does not look very good 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.410
 in the camera and how really the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.690
 bottom screen now does not matter much 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.550
 let's put it so it looks better 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.710
 on camera 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.460
 I updated the console and this 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.740
 tomorrow but for what seems to be in my 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.750
 plaza is not updated at the same time 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.240
 console update so 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.400
 now cut the video accelerate so that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.400
 do not get too long and now we'll see each other 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.909
 update made if you are curious 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.680
 this update of my place has 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.350
 taken about three 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.140
 minutes that has been done much more 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.610
 long as I wanted as you see after 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.619
 the update the console asks 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.899
 restart so I gave it to restart 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.170
 and let's see I guess the new and 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.280
 remodeled my square if it gets 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.280
 start before tomorrow 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.160
 it seems that already it starts I give you the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.710
 welcome thank you I give it to you too 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.050
 to you the square mii of streetpass now is 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.120
 bigger very well and from now 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.680
 there will be two types of games in the square in 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.840
 first place the previous ones in this 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.200
 update second care 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.970
 there is a cart 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.870
 the new games that you can buy 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.870
 from the square 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.220
 do not tell me you have to make another 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.220
 time not 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.900
 there does not seem to be much change around here 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.120
 so it seems there are new achievements 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.950
 as you can see the menu of the touch screen 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.560
 also changed and I guess we have 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.090
 access directly to the games we are going to 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.280
 see what options we have here as 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.310
 you see this has also changed 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.090
 this I do not know what will shop 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.520
 games I had before I also know everything 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.260
 more or less as you see it seems the same 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.610
 so let's try for example these 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.710
 icons below will be first 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.660
 must carry this same screen like this 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.160
 let's try the second 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.370
 in search of chrome it seems that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.730
 the menu has just changed 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.769
 let's see and here should be the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.930
 games that are bought if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.480
 each game costs approximately 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.580
 five euros having a pack that 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.220
 You can buy all four games together 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.930
 an approximate price of 15 euros as 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.209
 really what I want to do is teach 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.000
 the games we are going to choose a spear and 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.040
 let's buy it for example this same 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.150
 I really thought that he is going to buy the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.360
 game can be purchased directly 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.099
 here since you can not see 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.290
 all the options of this new and square 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.970
 before seeing the new games since 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.680
 we have seen how one of the 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.780
 icons let's look at how the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.609
 others although if I'm not wrong if 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.280
 effectively lead directly to 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.680
 game without turning around 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.750
 I was quite struck by the option 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.810
 booth of valdÃ©s can be called yes 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.980
 but it does not work and I think that 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.049
 others we had already seen that it is 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.750
 exactly the same 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.310
 so let's go through the store and 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.600
 let's choose one of the games 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.000
 I do not know which one to start with 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.650
 Enchanted mansion Conquest come 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.900
 conquest 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.310
 to all this some of you can 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.970
 explain why it is a rabbit that 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.970
 sell the games 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.880
 I did not expect this, we give it to 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.740
 accept reboot the console and now 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.750
 see you 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.880
 and we're here after the restart and 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.009
 it seems we have one more thing like that 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.930
 let's see what it is to tell something 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.460
 about the games of the square if 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.960
 You get certain objectives in 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.759
 they will get hats and vouchers 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.139
 only what he was before is left 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.729
 trying to give and it does not work 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.319
 to celebrate the inauguration of the 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.270
 square I will receive something special a 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.639
 interesting mario hat let's see 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.419
 really how is it although surely that 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.419
 it would be foolish 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.740
 land 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.740
 a good giant end 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.499
 and it seems one last thing 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:22.230
 you want to share information about 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:24.850
 not sincerely not 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.320
 it is indeed what I have decided and 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.570
 let's continue where we left off 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.090
 trying to buy one of the new ones 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.010
 four games of my place 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.870
 and for being repetitive I will choose the 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.220
 because it really is what I 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.220
 draws attention at least by 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.600
 well then the restart is and 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.520
 now we see each other 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.660
 it may be that special game that does not 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.280
 it works so we're going to choose 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.280
 example this one and we're going to 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.669
 we're not going to do absolutely anything and 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.710
 up and serious that day I really thought 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.120
 that the problem was mine after I gave 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.219
 he realized that it was a generalized problem 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.870
 and had to wait until nintendo 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:12.340
 fix it with an update 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.949
 thing that he did this morning 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.900
 in fact right now if I can open it 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.810
 As you can see, I'm going down 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.000
 games to be able to do this time if the 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.520
 videos analysis of these little four 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.889
 mini games with each game you buy 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.530
 either individually or not the pack os 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:32.770
 give a hat but as you see 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.500
 they really are not very over there I think it 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.020
 they call for the 3d so we deactivate and 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.849
 we follow 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.050
 the next game this if I do not 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.050
 I'm going to be conquered 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.820
 it is effectively conquering me and we are going 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.130
 walk as in the other cases a hat 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.610
 that will surely be just as ugly as 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.610
 others 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.010
 effectively a good castle cap 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.010
 at least it's better than flowers 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.690
 and to finish that we need a 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.660
 Enchanted mansion that will also give us 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.880
 a new hat 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:10.200
 and how will be the cap witch hat 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.200
 it can be hats 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.800
 they look like the back aspects true 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.970
 to the previous ones in a few days you can see 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.360
 in this same channel 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.880
 the analyzes of this little mini-games 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.150
 specifically this one is not no box 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.900
 my 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.690
 my garden 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.120
 conquer my and to end mansion 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:38.150
 I'm delighted, I hope you liked it 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.430

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:43.180
