00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.660
 welcome to this video review of could i am patrick both players 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.639
 smartphones 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.150
 so nowadays the first have become increasingly important after she plays 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.630
 the afternoon is the ebsa pim this bag has barely 5 megapixel camera and brakel 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.939
 by 2003 you have a unique facebook button on the device 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.330
 but what is going to look closer today in the death of 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.769
 hate is jaxa hit 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.810
 the quick start guide 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.189
 so brave in two tents with excitement 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.080
 m u2 cable 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.250
 he says anp himself 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.500
 and further and west 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.320
 so two screens are on you 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.140
 and i have you to provide the earbuds from shirt 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.850
 reject the front of the councilor gert jaap 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.430
 two classes since schiedam 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.149
 therefore get the four train sets being displayed and being 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.610
 namely the house 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.730
 the menu button 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.760
 the decline 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.110
 and the search button 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.060
 this includes recording and pressing a key 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.910
 beneath it is the cover keyboard 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.380
 in belgium, of course, is equipped with an azerty keyboard 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.850
 for a study of the facebook group that are reintegrating with 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.170
 facebook 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.060
 from a little upwards 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.100
 find at the top the find is a nuclear disaster 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.650
 above that and vennep with you instead of in the background 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.260
 at the top the coin in Almere with the audi and shag 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.560
 be the second metro from Moscow 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.990
 and the on off button 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 because of that, they didn't make the regular man the hit 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.820
 were left 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.300
 criminals volume test 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.320
 and not just at the exit 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 buttons on the right side of the road 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.180
 on the rear and 5 megapixel camera with some flashes 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.100
 and if not the case los angeles at the exit 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.680
 a second microphone for housing 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.300
 according to him a recess has helped to confirm his ability 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.570
 our last time 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.060
 then you come to put out whether you now have hearts 6 6 2 between over and through two 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.800
 points went 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.629
 coincidence because it is asleep 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.529
 named now and that medical condition 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.890
 that also applies to the sixth four pictogram bÃ¶blingen 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.569
 so actually fast course one is there now 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.059
 will you on the internet 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:22.939
 how did you drag internet afterwards 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.579
 at that time a browser was open 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.209
 So basically a quick way to work he certain applications quickly 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.089
 start 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.479
 wernhout to the barracks of others 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.109
 reading for a very long time on the screen 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.149
 anp you go to 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:38.599
 adjust display 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.769
 but my screen listing 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.409
 which you see that looks fashioned at the place there 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.239
 so your posts how to replace 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.159
 by another 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.039
 dishoek 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.039
 then you see that moment that it was going to be less 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.119
 I have gives 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:57.659
 the country 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.109
 the suspension 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.199
 and then you see that now the facebook group history 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.419
 she takes easy way to cook applications quickly 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.129
 and further characterizes councilors characteristics had 6 6 2 points in the win 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.129
 from seven tabs you naturally look at whether there are after three sets 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.189
 meeuwisse do michael or a plus to view or finger your holland screens 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.989
 to hold 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.079
 from us add to start 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.969
 a little bit to feed 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.929
 both want to add the clock 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:29.820
 especially the choice can be read 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.699
 9 take this version 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:32.690
 poor man 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.949
 have the basic version 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.949
 at the current pass 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.419
 pleasure that a bus is currently loaded, then remove it again 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.749
 he has now been on the screen for just as long and ignites and removes that 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.419
 man is profitability 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.620
 and again more information about and through medical blinks two to three times 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:54.769
 at the bottom of the screen 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.959
 have an advanced form of integration after the CFC 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.009
 surface books and condition 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.740
 and is nice for which 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.719
 so if you have one 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.019
 then the music application goes 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.019
 play the song 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.209
 therefore a short print 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.679
 on the facebook group 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:16.779
 rallieff is still according to his friends showing madrid anp with intended 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.069
 party leader 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.109
 but then you can see the way that people can post on Facebook 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.650
 turn this off 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.920
 his second example of that is when you long into the facebook group 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.210
 stronger than checking in at the location where they match 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.360
 and you know where you put that right away 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.000
 and then you are only breast cancer during training 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.830
 a simple one 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.430
 printing costs on the request logo 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.430
 you can place that moment in this message on your own child 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.169
 but the last form 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.520
 this chat session 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.479
 with the request it is in the process of allowing 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.340
 so set 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.340
 middle tumor as one 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.400
 the sender 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.590
 that is very simple for your facebook friends to go to brussels 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.590
 send 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.889
 sweet lake can be young 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.789
 well keep in touch with 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.870
 she already has two horses present 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.529
 yes also on the home screen 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:20.580
 a small it is also a small cabin 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.530
 and 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.569
 the wind itself 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.749
 I would find the fans easier 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:28.300
 why because the president is a bit bigger a second and that himself is also like 

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:29.389
 twitter 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.270
 the elections are coming 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.030
 what do you have easier even a bit easier certainly what is happening 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.349
 is smaller 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.599
 it is nevertheless easy to read 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.599
 of course you can also watch a video with the advertising service 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:45.479
 the song 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.419
 the visit to 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.729
 movie 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.379
 he is going to see is that despite the fact that dati taser is not shooting 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:55.930
 huge screen 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.319
 one that she was the party for words is mandatory 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.409
 8 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.409
 8 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.020
 8 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.439
 8 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.009
 8 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.370
 that is certainly present this also integration we can not allow 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.419
 to become 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.949
 furthermore, therefore, has a 2006 screened 90 screen and 5 megapixel camera 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:39.009
 turns on and never know 3 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.919
 the only thing I miss is that there is no pull cap or at home with a device 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:47.090
 harm sometimes when you're ready crazy intuitive to the middle 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:50.490
 there a small ball the army the next page or column 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.470
 and that is not but that was more than offset by the presence of 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.360
 time schedule and can actually handle it properly 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.780
 thank you very much party in this vision you want more information about 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.259
 his calf record on psv.nl ps point b that next time
