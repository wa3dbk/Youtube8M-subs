boil on about ten minutes or so

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.460 
boil on about ten minutes or so
this<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.770> how<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.040> should<00:04:19.250> look<00:04:20.959> remember

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
this is how it should look remember

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.950 
this is how it should look remember
we're<00:04:21.650> cooking<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.220> in<00:04:22.520> medium<00:04:23.060> low<00:04:23.600> heat

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
we're cooking this in medium low heat

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.390 
we're cooking this in medium low heat
and<00:04:25.300> really<00:04:26.300> see<00:04:26.660> that<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.590> know<00:04:27.740> the

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
and really see that you know the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.280 
and really see that you know the
ingredients<00:04:29.030> are<00:04:29.150> decreasing<00:04:29.750> light<00:04:29.960> and

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
ingredients are decreasing light and

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.830 
ingredients are decreasing light and
color<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.770> everything<00:04:31.220> so<00:04:31.550> this<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:32.510> going<00:04:32.750> to

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
color and everything so this is going to

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.010 
color and everything so this is going to
just<00:04:33.050> cover<00:04:34.180> and<00:04:35.180> we'll<00:04:35.510> come<00:04:35.720> back<00:04:35.870> in

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020

another five minutes okay after Isum
boiling<00:04:42.950> for<00:04:43.280> about<00:04:43.340> another<00:04:43.850> five<00:04:44.390> minutes

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
going to show you the technique I use to

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.320 
going to show you the technique I use to
UM<00:04:50.020> make<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.380> liquid<00:04:51.590> thick<00:04:52.190> on<00:04:52.460> your<00:04:52.820> beans<00:04:53.090> a

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
UM make the liquid thick on your beans a

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.600 
UM make the liquid thick on your beans a
little<00:04:53.450> thicker<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.200> basically<00:04:55.070> what<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.370> do<00:04:55.490> I

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
little thicker so basically what I do I

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.760 
little thicker so basically what I do I
take<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.330> beans<00:04:58.510> just<00:04:59.510> over<00:04:59.750> here<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.169> take<00:05:00.590> the

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
take the beans just over here I take the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.050 
take the beans just over here I take the
beans<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.730> squish<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.630> into<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:04.070> pot<00:05:04.310> so<00:05:05.030> I

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
beans and I squish it into the pot so I

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.550 
beans and I squish it into the pot so I
grab<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:06.050> I<00:05:06.230> squeeze<00:05:07.030> and<00:05:08.030> I<00:05:08.960> grab<00:05:09.260> a<00:05:09.290> nice

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
grab and I squeeze and I grab a nice

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.330 
grab and I squeeze and I grab a nice
squeeze<00:05:09.980> and<00:05:10.520> by<00:05:11.450> doing

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
squeeze and by doing

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.730 
squeeze and by doing
this<00:05:12.610> is<00:05:12.940> just<00:05:13.180> going<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.449> create<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:14.470> beans

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
this is just going to create the beans

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.730 
this is just going to create the beans
to<00:05:15.220> get<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.550> little<00:05:15.820> thicker<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:17.260> can<00:05:17.470> do<00:05:17.590> it

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
to get a little thicker you can do it

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.470 
to get a little thicker you can do it
two<00:05:17.919> ways<00:05:17.949> you<00:05:18.310> could<00:05:18.460> do<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:18.970> way<00:05:19.240> which

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
two ways you could do it this way which

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.620 
two ways you could do it this way which
I<00:05:19.660> find<00:05:19.930> a<00:05:20.050> way<00:05:20.230> easier<00:05:20.740> or<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:22.150> could<00:05:22.360> take

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
I find a way easier or you could take

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.750 
I find a way easier or you could take
out<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.350> beans<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:23.889> throw<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:24.550> in<00:05:24.639> the

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
out the beans and throw it in the

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.390 
out the beans and throw it in the
blender<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.300> blend<00:05:25.419> them<00:05:25.930> with<00:05:26.590> a<00:05:26.620> little<00:05:27.280> bit

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
blender and blend them with a little bit

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.650 
blender and blend them with a little bit
of<00:05:27.430> soy<00:05:27.699> liquid<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.680> then<00:05:30.300> throw<00:05:31.300> it<00:05:31.389> back<00:05:31.540> in

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
of soy liquid and then throw it back in

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.100 
of soy liquid and then throw it back in
the<00:05:31.750> pot<00:05:32.040> but<00:05:33.040> this<00:05:33.340> is<00:05:33.760> faster<00:05:34.750> and<00:05:34.930> easier

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
the pot but this is faster and easier

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.640 
the pot but this is faster and easier
and<00:05:35.440> you<00:05:36.280> know<00:05:36.430> you<00:05:36.490> make<00:05:36.820> less<00:05:37.090> mess<00:05:37.650> so

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
and you know you make less mess so

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.710 
and you know you make less mess so
basically<00:05:39.010> all<00:05:39.130> you're<00:05:39.460> doing<00:05:39.760> is<00:05:39.910> taking<00:05:40.419> it

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
basically all you're doing is taking it

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.620 
basically all you're doing is taking it
and<00:05:40.900> pressing<00:05:41.199> it<00:05:41.470> to<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:42.580> wall<00:05:42.850> to<00:05:43.300> the<00:05:43.330> wall

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
and pressing it to the wall to the wall

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.600 
and pressing it to the wall to the wall
of<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:43.900> pan<00:05:44.229> of<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.650> pot<00:05:44.860> I<00:05:47.130> hope<00:05:48.130> this<00:05:48.310> makes

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
of the pan of the pot I hope this makes

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.300 
of the pan of the pot I hope this makes
sense<00:05:52.110> yeah<00:05:53.110> a<00:05:53.139> lot<00:05:53.290> of<00:05:53.410> people<00:05:53.740> they<00:05:53.889> do<00:05:54.160> the

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
sense yeah a lot of people they do the

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.570 
sense yeah a lot of people they do the
blender<00:05:54.700> thing<00:05:55.320> they<00:05:56.320> take<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.800> blender<00:05:57.310> and

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
blender thing they take the blender and

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.850 
blender thing they take the blender and
they<00:05:57.760> blend<00:05:58.479> the<00:05:58.690> beans<00:05:58.930> and<00:05:59.470> they<00:05:59.590> throw<00:05:59.830> it

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
they blend the beans and they throw it

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.840 
they blend the beans and they throw it
back<00:06:00.040> in<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.280> pack

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
back in the pack

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.870 
back in the pack
but<00:06:01.060> I<00:06:01.419> don't<00:06:02.020> have<00:06:02.110> time<00:06:02.320> for<00:06:02.380> that<00:06:02.650> so<00:06:02.979> I<00:06:03.310> just

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
but I don't have time for that so I just

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.219 
but I don't have time for that so I just
do<00:06:04.180> it<00:06:04.330> this<00:06:04.510> way<00:06:06.660> just<00:06:07.660> keep<00:06:07.780> on<00:06:07.960> pressing

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
do it this way just keep on pressing

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:15.230 
do it this way just keep on pressing
them

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.540

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:22.820 
[Music]
and<00:06:17.550> that's<00:06:18.479> it<00:06:20.960> cover<00:06:21.960> it<00:06:22.080> up<00:06:22.319> two<00:06:22.650> more

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
and that's it cover it up two more

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:29.629 
and that's it cover it up two more
minutes<00:06:23.039> on<00:06:23.310> low<00:06:23.400> and<00:06:24.470> you'll<00:06:25.470> be<00:06:25.620> done<00:06:28.610> so<00:06:29.610> you

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 
minutes on low and you'll be done so you

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.670 
minutes on low and you'll be done so you
already<00:06:30.000> can<00:06:30.330> see<00:06:30.539> once<00:06:30.840> it's<00:06:31.139> it's<00:06:31.410> boiling

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
already can see once it's it's boiling

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.610 
already can see once it's it's boiling
for<00:06:32.099> about<00:06:32.160> another<00:06:32.610> five<00:06:33.090> to<00:06:33.810> ten<00:06:34.110> minutes

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
for about another five to ten minutes

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.529 
for about another five to ten minutes
you<00:06:34.979> see<00:06:35.220> that<00:06:35.400> the<00:06:35.610> beans<00:06:35.880> got<00:06:36.180> a<00:06:36.210> little

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
you see that the beans got a little

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.990 
you see that the beans got a little
thicker<00:06:36.780> at<00:06:37.289> this<00:06:37.860> point<00:06:38.220> you're<00:06:38.490> pretty<00:06:38.759> much

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
thicker at this point you're pretty much

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.969 
thicker at this point you're pretty much
done<00:06:39.330> if<00:06:39.720> you<00:06:39.960> want<00:06:40.169> it<00:06:40.380> a<00:06:40.470> little<00:06:40.680> thicker

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
done if you want it a little thicker

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.850 
done if you want it a little thicker
than<00:06:41.220> this<00:06:41.460> just<00:06:41.970> keep<00:06:42.660> on<00:06:42.870> boiling<00:06:43.440> it<00:06:43.590> for

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
than this just keep on boiling it for

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.980 
than this just keep on boiling it for
about<00:06:43.979> another<00:06:44.430> five<00:06:44.940> minutes<00:06:45.419> if<00:06:45.569> you<00:06:45.720> want

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
about another five minutes if you want

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.730 
about another five minutes if you want
it<00:06:46.110> like<00:06:46.199> a<00:06:46.410> really<00:06:46.710> thick<00:06:47.009> on<00:06:47.220> beans<00:06:47.930> but<00:06:48.930> this

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
it like a really thick on beans but this

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.879 
it like a really thick on beans but this
is<00:06:49.889> pretty<00:06:50.130> much<00:06:50.280> it<00:06:50.759> um<00:06:51.690> just<00:06:52.320> turn<00:06:52.620> it<00:06:52.740> off

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
is pretty much it um just turn it off

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:55.670 
is pretty much it um just turn it off
and<00:06:53.220> once<00:06:53.490> you<00:06:53.759> turn<00:06:54.000> it<00:06:54.120> off<00:06:54.270> and<00:06:54.539> close<00:06:55.410> it

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
and once you turn it off and close it

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.360 
and once you turn it off and close it
leave<00:06:55.919> the<00:06:56.099> lid<00:06:56.250> closed<00:06:57.259> eventually<00:06:58.259> um<00:06:58.560> with

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
leave the lid closed eventually um with

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.790 
leave the lid closed eventually um with
all<00:06:59.400> the<00:06:59.729> vapor<00:07:00.120> going<00:07:00.389> out<00:07:00.570> it<00:07:00.780> will<00:07:00.900> get<00:07:01.110> just

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
all the vapor going out it will get just

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.129 
all the vapor going out it will get just
a<00:07:01.919> tad<00:07:02.250> B<00:07:02.550> tad<00:07:03.240> bit<00:07:03.509> thicker<00:07:04.289> God<00:07:05.360> so<00:07:06.360> anyway<00:07:07.080> so

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
a tad B tad bit thicker God so anyway so

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.370 
a tad B tad bit thicker God so anyway so
um<00:07:07.680> just<00:07:08.610> cover<00:07:09.060> it<00:07:09.180> up<00:07:09.360> let<00:07:09.630> it<00:07:09.659> rest<00:07:09.930> and<00:07:10.199> when

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
um just cover it up let it rest and when

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.870 
um just cover it up let it rest and when
you're<00:07:10.500> ready<00:07:10.680> to<00:07:10.889> serve<00:07:11.099> I'll<00:07:11.310> just<00:07:11.610> be<00:07:11.849> a

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770 
little thicker than what it is right now
