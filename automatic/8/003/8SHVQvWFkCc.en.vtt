00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.019
 That's why I say I can do better 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.089
 the game is going to make the fatter 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.089
 and I get well animal as much as I can 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.219
 as much as I can 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.539
 the country there then 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.539
 I leave pressure because he is obeying 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.470
 to a suggestion with authority 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.380
 I have to persuade him to obey 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.870
 I feel lorca 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.060
 but here I am unwavering my firmness 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.530
 there is 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.510
 hiram m look at me 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.649
 Look at me 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.100
 this is a joke 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.579
 based on ethical principles nobody tells me that I do not have but a horse my 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.200
 conscience tells me that I do not have another bull horses 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.580
 I'm doing exactly what they do is that benzema nadal 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.580
 drama 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.760
 what is important in this that the hierarchy is to protect the other look 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.650
 they came from moral authority 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.650
 and not in another place and when he becomes a hostage 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.300
 p 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.940
 do not 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.030
 I acted 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.260
 the hierarchical and what I try to do with that game is 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.660
 create a superior hierarchy to protect it to educate it to be 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.080
 credible to be convincing a horse does not believe anybody I have 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.659
 to become a horse mentally 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.650
 for him to roast in his body language and south and with all his language and 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.649
 all your injuries 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.649
 the Libyan agency was visiting a strong leadership as the groups 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.319
 human always yss the strong leadership goes according to the long the 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.680
 rise that you already have the need to propose a security framework 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.800
 The general line is loyalty 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.620
 and it is the understanding of the other 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.930
 so that a person without giving welfare should feel secure from their employer 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.579
 sure of your boss 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.499
 when an employee as he recognizes that in a hedy pattern cries the loyalty that is 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.059
 what I want to be on the horse
