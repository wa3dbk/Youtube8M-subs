 Crazy series brand good series of 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.350
 a fame but more crazy that is in a 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.110
 wave and the channel not in any country or in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.110
 no place only in stirrup with gift 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.510
 vito with the point lopez purest testing 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.489
 spanish return with matte tints 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.640
 you know what that's like the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.640
 person fell while while living 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.239
 I'm going to put a series of examples of what 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.239
 that was a chord 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.900
 but can not be 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.729
 but almost in the whole mouth 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.310
 while they wait for the value and we 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 but 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.710
 speak good not to the medium not 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.200
 missing hands 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.320
 Guatemala 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:13.990
 and as it progresses it will reach what 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.990
 the annual balance that was left to do 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.570
 It's worth to see if you do not understand it for him 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.430
 same and 5 explain that I will explain 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.590
 how are we going to do this year, we are going to 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.230
 make a team at the beginning will be a 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.120
 team a little bad will not be the racing of 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.739
 santander like that bad for ultimate 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.420
 ultimate team let's play little 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.610
 malillos let's play two people to the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.020
 Once the seasons of ultimate and online 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.209
 our goal is to reach the first 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.950
 as first I say that I do not think 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.380
 we passed or division did not pass or 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.190
 of my dream that this year we can new 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.200
 new 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.910
 and regulations that is what with the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.290
 hashtag poole is my team that I'll put 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.600
 in all the videos you do not 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.070
 You can help because it is MaytÃ­n puris 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.560
 quark we have a team and I tell you 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.910
 mean bad at the beginning two people in 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.130
 One part plays from Colombia and the other 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.170
 part with vito always play it worth 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.560
 what are we going to the party about 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.410
 if we win for the next game 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.630
 we will have an advantage and apart for each 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.640
 goal that we put a thousand coins 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.160
 we will win a thousand coins that is to say 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.950
 spend on bass we will take a full bowl of 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.290
 advantages for example what advantages 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.510
 we had around eating an oreo eating 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.040
 an oreo you will say because it is an advantage 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.550
 like the now an oreo because they are very 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.680
 rich and good a chepa hong chi chi chi 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.260
 side and whatever drinking with the glasses 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.300
 look to drink a drink that's an advantage 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.750
 because you're playing the fifa and you're 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.820
 living good are good here are several 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.020
 several are advantages I have few of 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.030
 moment but I have a better mind 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.860
 advantages the advantages are very line what 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.720
 that is good comes good in 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.160
 m ponies team are the disadvantages that is 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.380
 what was said 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.270
 for each bonus for each goal we put 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.070
 we win or lose that we're going to have 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.990
 always a thousand coins that we can go 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.030
 managing with danger but wait 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.430
 to get better players 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.170
 but if they put us goal for every goal that 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.060
 they put us in the next game 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.150
 we have to add a whole goalkeeper 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.970
 example the hub and we lose 32 then 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.040
 we won 3 for all the coins but not 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.080
 we have to become an activator of the 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.030
 template in the next and put 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.280
 transport but the money is to accumulate 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.760
 example for the party people we won 4 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.680
 0 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.020
 then we would have an advantage for 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.610
 win and four thousand coins that the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.260
 we can spend in that match or equal 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.730
 We speak long range and go 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.770
 accumulating the coins this will be a 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.580
 account created from scratch of ultimate and 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.200
 that's what it is and for two with 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.950
 three goalkeepers that we're going to make we're going 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.950
 to fit in the goal 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.030
 they change players on a side 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.600
 left but a defense of three 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.430
 goalkeepers points last year to 13 what 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.020
 what we did was to play everything always with 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.980
 mortars but we want to give it a touch 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.100
 to have more games if we lose 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.560
 we will have a disadvantage of what kind of 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.150
 which guy takes one randomly by 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.289
 example the random age 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.399
 and what is that 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.439
 masks and imitate this is a mouth yes 

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:33.939
 wants to focus and well that's what we 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.639
 we would have to put a mask on a 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.349
 youtube or some bears and inviting 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.020
 limiting it and while we play another 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.460
 It can be eating lemons while we play 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.710
 another may be for having saved for 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.360
 that rapporteur case clamps on the face have 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.069
 zeal and every time we fail a pin 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.839
 with which the command back with the command 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.240
 of after playing with weights in the arms and 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:54.430
 with arms raised play while 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.349
 we are slammed playing is while 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.240
 We have a cucumber in the asshole that is 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.610
 play while they pull us by the ear 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.319
 while at the same for example a 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.789
 handicap play in manual play at 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.399
 first touch that we can only pass 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:10.599
 first ball play with one hand 

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:12.009
 playing kissing man are disadvantages 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.689
 that this funny thing about police lighting 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:16.029
 in I decided to return giving you this boat 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.999
 red in the head that is to say will play 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:21.520
 matches with a bad team that we will go 

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:23.139
 improving as we score goals and 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.999
 the goal to reach first 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.889
 every time we go up division if 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:28.779
 we go up as a reward we will be able to 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.639
 rent a Christian type player 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.449
 ronaldo or such you already know that in this fifa 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.920
 can be given 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.690
 Y 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.690
 please play with this 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.230
 ah 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.610
 for that it will get some equipment 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.170
 very bad and every time we add division 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.270
 we can rent a good player and 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.520
 others like that if they get many goals 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.310
 we will have to play with goalies more 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.020
 among others and will be will be crazy 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.790
 here you will not understand well what 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.530
 you will see for silver years you will only see 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.630
 well when we start when we start 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.980
 the truth series I recommend that the 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.840
 you see is going to be a very effective series 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.840
 we will give specials that are live 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:16.990
 and it's going to be very funny, dale dale 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.759
 if you like the idea that we will start 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.319
 with racing and who knows what 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:22.319
 we will finish with the Cuban 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.219
 we will have to put goalies and they are 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:35.650
 disadvantages like while we pile up in 

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:37.659
 chest wax that is playing burradas 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.909
 curradas we are filled by the body 

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:42.460

 they cross with a saw and stones the 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.240
 that go to the court 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:02.680
 with flames level 6 destiny

 while all brother turisme team 

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.129
