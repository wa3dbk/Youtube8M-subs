00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
and we're gonna start with galaxy which

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.589 
and we're gonna start with galaxy which
I<00:00:07.410> actually<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.550> spent<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.910> ton<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.120> time<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:09.360> this

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
I actually I spent a ton of time on this

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.290 
I actually I spent a ton of time on this
game<00:00:09.780> really<00:00:10.469> early<00:00:10.830> on<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.099> development<00:00:11.519> as

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
game really early on in development as

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.810 
game really early on in development as
you<00:00:12.389> can<00:00:12.480> see<00:00:12.630> it's<00:00:12.750> looking<00:00:12.929> awesome<00:00:13.820> okay

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
here we go um and then I actually had to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.420 
here we go um and then I actually had to
hand<00:00:19.199> off<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.680> got<00:00:20.010> busy<00:00:20.100> with<00:00:20.250> other

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.480 
projects and so I took a lot of time
where<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> wasn't<00:00:22.410> getting<00:00:22.859> any<00:00:23.220> time<00:00:23.430> with

where I wasn't getting any time with

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.300 
where I wasn't getting any time with
galaxy<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.320> only<00:00:25.650> gotten

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
galaxy and it's really only gotten

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
galaxy and it's really only gotten
better<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.760> interim<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.240> know<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.810> guys

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
at this hub and basically what this is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.950 
at this hub and basically what this is
is<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.120> cosmic<00:01:03.539> observatory<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:05.750> it<00:01:06.750> acts

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
is it's a cosmic observatory and it acts

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.039 
is it's a cosmic observatory and it acts
as<00:01:07.170> your<00:01:07.200> hub<00:01:07.470> world<00:01:07.680> sort<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.130> similar<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
as your hub world sort of similar to the

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.590 
as your hub world sort of similar to the
castle<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.200> Super<00:01:10.530> Mario<00:01:10.560> 64<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.450> see

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
castle in Super Mario 64 so you can see

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.179 
castle in Super Mario 64 so you can see
we're<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> run<00:01:13.170> around<00:01:13.290> over<00:01:13.890> here

basically<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.729> Grand<00:01:18.090> galaxies<00:01:18.659> as<00:01:18.810> they

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
basically the the Grand galaxies as they

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.440 
basically the the Grand galaxies as they
are<00:01:19.080> called<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.619> sort<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.299> located<00:01:21.299> in

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
are called are sort of located in

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.960 
are called are sort of located in
central<00:01:21.900> domes<00:01:22.340> this<00:01:23.340> particular<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970

you press eight and grab it you go up

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.929 
you press eight and grab it you go up
and<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> zoom<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.729> here<00:01:35.729> are<00:01:35.880> the

and you get a zoom out and here are the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.810 
and you get a zoom out and here are the
galaxies<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.170> go<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.820> you

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
galaxies that you can actually go to you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.609 
galaxies that you can actually go to you
won't<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.150> seeing<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.079> first<00:01:40.350> go

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
won't be seeing this when you first go

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.780 
won't be seeing this when you first go
into<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.950> particular<00:01:41.189> area<00:01:41.579> you're

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
into this particular area you're

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.100 
into this particular area you're
probably<00:01:41.970> only<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.780> galaxy

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
probably only going to see one galaxy

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.380 
probably only going to see one galaxy
that's<00:01:43.380> open<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.310> true<00:01:44.670> Mario<00:01:45.000> tradition

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that's open and in true Mario tradition

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.700 
that's open and in true Mario tradition
you're<00:01:45.479> basically<00:01:45.750> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.020> collecting

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
you're basically going to be collecting

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770 
you're basically going to be collecting
stars<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.939> opening<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.420> more<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.720> more

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
stars and opening up more and more

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.429 
stars and opening up more and more
galaxies<00:01:49.350> um<00:01:50.090> what<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:51.210> happen<00:01:51.570> depending

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
galaxies um what would happen depending

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.780 
galaxies um what would happen depending
on<00:01:52.680> how<00:01:52.799> long<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.100> play<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.700> guys

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
on how long you play in that you guys

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.010 
on how long you play in that you guys
probably<00:01:53.939> actually<00:01:54.270> won't<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.689> far<00:01:54.899> enough

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
probably actually won't get far enough

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.679 
probably actually won't get far enough
to<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.299> over<00:01:57.570> there

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
to do this but as you can see over there

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.889 
to do this but as you can see over there
it's<00:01:58.049> quite<00:01:58.380> dark<00:01:59.000> as<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.450> more<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.750> more

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
it's quite dark as you get more and more

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.420 
it's quite dark as you get more and more
grand<00:02:01.320> stars<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.860> actually<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
grand stars you actually are going to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.209 
grand stars you actually are going to
illuminate<00:02:02.880> areas<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.500> observatory<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
illuminate areas of the observatory and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.499 
illuminate areas of the observatory and
be<00:02:05.280> able<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.490> access<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.119> actually<00:02:06.390> sort

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
be able to access and it's actually sort

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.300 
be able to access and it's actually sort
of<00:02:06.630> similar<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.439> sunshine<00:02:07.890> mechanic

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
of similar to the sunshine mechanic

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.680 
of similar to the sunshine mechanic
you're<00:02:09.060> probably<00:02:09.209> not<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> get<00:02:09.660> that

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
you're probably not going to get that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.640 
you're probably not going to get that
far<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.140> hey<00:02:11.129> case<00:02:11.340> when<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.670> go<00:02:11.760> in

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
far but hey case when you go in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.289 
far but hey case when you go in
basically<00:02:13.640> pick<00:02:13.819> your<00:02:13.970> galaxy<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:16.180> once<00:02:17.180> you

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
basically pick your galaxy and once you

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.170 
basically pick your galaxy and once you
get<00:02:17.420> into<00:02:17.599> that<00:02:18.250> let's<00:02:19.250> go<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.879> guys<00:02:20.000> probably

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
get into that let's go you guys probably

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.399 
get into that let's go you guys probably
seen<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:20.510> one<00:02:20.659> before<00:02:20.689> but<00:02:20.989> I'll<00:02:21.110> do<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.260> I'll

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
seen this one before but I'll do it I'll

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.539 
seen this one before but I'll do it I'll
do<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.650> little<00:02:21.860> mission<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.340> haven't

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
do a little mission that you haven't

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.910 
do a little mission that you haven't
seen<00:02:22.730> before<00:02:23.019> once<00:02:24.019> you<00:02:24.110> pick<00:02:24.290> which<00:02:24.530> galaxy

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
seen before once you pick which galaxy

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.619 
seen before once you pick which galaxy
you're<00:02:25.010> going<00:02:25.129> to<00:02:25.189> go<00:02:25.310> into<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:26.030> will<00:02:26.299> then

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
you're going to go into you will then

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.619 
you're going to go into you will then
basically<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.790> opportunity<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.450> do

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
basically have the opportunity to do

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.330 
basically have the opportunity to do
different<00:02:29.930> missions<00:02:30.200> within<00:02:30.379> that<00:02:30.590> galaxy<00:02:31.010> so

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
different missions within that galaxy so

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.740 
different missions within that galaxy so
the<00:02:31.760> first<00:02:31.970> time<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.120> go<00:02:32.299> in<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:32.480> probably

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
the first time you go in is probably

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.910 
the first time you go in is probably
only<00:02:32.870> going<00:02:33.019> to<00:02:33.109> have<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.260> first<00:02:33.409> one<00:02:33.650> which

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
only going to have the first one which

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.649 
only going to have the first one which
if<00:02:34.159> you<00:02:34.250> guys<00:02:34.370> are<00:02:34.489> familiar<00:02:34.579> with<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.359> think

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
if you guys are familiar with it I think

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.539 
if you guys are familiar with it I think
it's<00:02:35.780> probably<00:02:35.870> 3<00:02:36.379> version<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:37.159> was<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.459> one

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
it's probably 3 version it was the one

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.940 
it's probably 3 version it was the one
where<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.760> first<00:02:37.909> got<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.209> be<00:02:38.329> sued<00:02:38.799> this<00:02:39.799> one

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
where you first got the be sued this one

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.410 
where you first got the be sued this one
I'd<00:02:40.040> actually<00:02:40.189> beaten<00:02:40.549> all<00:02:40.640> three<00:02:40.879> levels<00:02:41.030> so

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
I'd actually beaten all three levels so

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.490 
I'd actually beaten all three levels so
i<00:02:41.659> can<00:02:42.409> show<00:02:42.650> i'll<00:02:43.310> show<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.579> this<00:02:43.700> guy's<00:02:43.909> i

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
i can show i'll show you this guy's i

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.140 
i can show i'll show you this guy's i
always<00:02:45.500> enjoy<00:02:46.159> embarrassing<00:02:46.340> myself<00:02:46.849> in

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
always enjoy embarrassing myself in

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.460 
always enjoy embarrassing myself in
front<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.329> large<00:02:47.480> groups<00:02:47.569> of<00:02:47.810> people<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.230> i'll

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470

fight a boss here and most of you'll

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.599 
fight a boss here and most of you'll
remember<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:54.019> controls<00:02:54.349> i'm<00:02:54.500> sure<00:02:54.709> um<00:02:54.920> but
