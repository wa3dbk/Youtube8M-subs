 eaten persian 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.959
 was not completely impressed as 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.780
 Item must be over 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.910
 Food roll-ups that cause death circulation 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.959

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.620
 intact styrofoam not even one that 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.440
 below is completely 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.880
 Lightproducts make me feel like it's Christmas 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.880
 is or still do they pack 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.840
 these are the first video by justin 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.230
 the same two and packages per piece 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.760
 cost much for two or 125 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.090
 and did not come much and wanted so 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.989
 like to try these are the playbar the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.989
 cups with white chocolate 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.250
 so here the ordinary with milk chocolate there 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.989
 around it 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.060
 and finally also have the dark 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.290
 ordered then there are those that have three cups 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.290
 with dark chocolate layer 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.950
 I pick it all random 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.860
 Order cars here have baking soda 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.680
 met the minimum order with teacher 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.360
 30 euros are not arrived 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.519
 I think well I see then I order 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.100
 just baking soda because in almost every 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.390
 you need an american recipe 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.220
 so far I have always managed to 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.150
 replaced with baking powder or with another 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.560
 product 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.760
 and I know you will agree with this 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.650
 drug stores 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.829
 Drugstore you can buy as are 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.480
 baking soda but I feel detail so 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.700
 the municipality idea so that's why i got there 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.220
 a package of hey he is quite big 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.660
 almost half a kilo so that way 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.640
 then a bottle 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.890
 corn sir and I'm so happy with this 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.050
 making intervest lefrye has come 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.420
 to set up against involving almost everywhere 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.010
 I need corn syrup before 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.110
 the people loose now just everything 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.720
 but just couldn't find it 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.580
 then I suddenly saw you with boys 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.170
 feels that they go to bottles of police chief 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.170
 sold so which I equated 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.530
 neither times friends targets me then one 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.510
 Really big 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.940
 This also has to see that in what one 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.830
 clean stoops and they wanted to ask 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.180
 set is the usual clean 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.180
 milk chocolate with peanut butter 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.570
 then the bag publicist was walking to work 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.100
 will you, in my opinion, and this is 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.890
 especially from tim 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.540
 monster energy he loves us and see 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.710
 you hardly ever drink anyone so toxic 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.260
 is 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.480
 but they do not have these in the Netherlands and 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.000
 this is the red wax sent 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:41.270
 it's called energy I don't know what for 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.290
 taste the design don't like to think 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:49.140
 Then these are steak bytes therapies 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.140
 of that beecher webite does n't want to 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:56.330
 order just a few euros to spend 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.330
 not to regret the third 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.060
 another can of monster energy and this thing 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.520
 very cool by the way if you really 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:11.460
 such an ornament in a little relief this 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:15.320
 monster energy is a sentence high that she and 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.270
 old ones have no sugar calories and 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.530
 sugar no mind its oil in its mind 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.530
 and curious what he thinks 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.430
 then we have a tube of pringles 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.919
 are new stores in the range 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.010
 try using rose and use animals 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:35.370
 this is tanki reward and it tastes like 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.010
 it is good to go with that sauce too 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.039
 So you know he is flocked 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.910
 I think there is very hot 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:49.940
 so I'm curious 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:49.940
 extra ordinary flavor moment rubies 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.019
 [Music] 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:09.510
 and loose peelerpark foils is nevertheless one 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.890
 very small thing this is jeetje floor 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.180
 who can tootsie for it looks I think 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.510
 that this just finds one a bit 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:22.260
 themselves and still have a mouse Pringels 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.970
 jump in now order total pizzas 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.750
 labor jump like that to pizza 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.240
 make sauce 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.789
 the boy went to and finally 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.890
 sentiment is barbecue 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.800
 maybe a little broken but okay 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.750
 now ladies were doing adventure and this 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.330
 so shine to the barbecue sauce and 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.979
 to have a barbecue taste i'm whole 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.060
 curious 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:48.050
 I think it was digging 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.050
 oh i see something else 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.370
 disadvantage these tb sweets are even smaller 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.010
 and the styrofoam stuff that sit 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.430
 does not find out if she is an employee 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.880
 used 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:03.400
 plus sandwich or something but I 'll be right away 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.920
 sometimes upside down 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.720
 yet another feature provides peppermint 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.950
 tootsie 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:13.300
 tuttifrutti critical team and also on 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:17.020
 does here too 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:20.410
 I have no world but that was it 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:23.380
 it's real it's real 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.900
 mainly crisis there are live 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.420
 but that you would jump three 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:32.920
 as two cans of sample and some baking 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:34.780
 soda and correct for fresh leek so yes 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.270
 that was it if you were somewhere one 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.520
 would like to see a review or want more 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.350

 evening that I make as primary cups 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.380
 made it myself 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.660
 but well then I am going to invent all I am going 

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.630
