00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
basically so initial impressions were

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.750 
basically so initial impressions were
good<00:00:24.600> as<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.990> Astro<00:00:25.439> presentation<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.340> pretty

I<00:00:27.510> find<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.930> packaging<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.680> really<00:00:29.250> make<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
I find that packaging can really make a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.620 
I find that packaging can really make a
difference<00:00:29.519> when<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.090> comes<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.359> first

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630

some<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.460> the<00:03:36.610> sound<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.880> leak<00:03:37.120> out<00:03:37.300> if<00:03:37.480> you're

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
some of the sound to leak out if you're

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.750 
some of the sound to leak out if you're
listening<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:38.200> higher<00:03:38.470> volumes<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.550> sound

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
listening to higher volumes the sound

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.670 
listening to higher volumes the sound
stage<00:03:40.000> doesn't<00:03:40.240> seem<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.750> large<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.380> me<00:03:41.500> even

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
stage doesn't seem that large to me even

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.410 
stage doesn't seem that large to me even
though<00:03:41.860> they<00:03:42.010> are<00:03:42.160> an<00:03:42.280> open<00:03:42.640> style<00:03:42.910> they<00:03:43.300> also

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
though they are an open style they also

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.270 
though they are an open style they also
have<00:03:43.690> somewhat<00:03:43.990> of<00:03:44.020> a<00:03:44.200> booming<00:03:44.560> low-end

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
have somewhat of a booming low-end

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.530 
have somewhat of a booming low-end
especially<00:03:45.760> when<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:45.970> start<00:03:46.209> messing<00:03:46.360> with

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
especially when you start messing with

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.780 
especially when you start messing with
the<00:03:46.780> presets<00:03:47.350> although<00:03:47.770> I<00:03:47.800> am<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.160> fan<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.490> bass

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
the presets although I am a fan of bass

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.030 
the presets although I am a fan of bass
so<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:49.360> does<00:03:49.510> not<00:03:49.690> bother<00:03:49.990> me<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.770> surround

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
so this does not bother me the surround

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.100 
so this does not bother me the surround
sound<00:03:51.130> seems<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.550> separate<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.060> audio<00:03:52.360> okay

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
sound seems to separate the audio okay

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.290 
sound seems to separate the audio okay
but<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.680> feel<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.040> introduces<00:03:54.580> somewhat<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.180> a

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
but I feel it introduces somewhat of a

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.449 
but I feel it introduces somewhat of a
Hall<00:03:55.630> effect<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.350> process<00:03:56.860> I<00:03:57.130> found

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
Hall effect in the process I found

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.010 
Hall effect in the process I found
myself<00:03:57.610> using<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.180> headset<00:03:58.390> with<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.870> Adobe

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
myself using the headset with the Adobe

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:00.990 
myself using the headset with the Adobe
surround<00:03:59.560> disabled<00:04:00.130> more<00:04:00.400> often<00:04:00.790> than<00:04:00.970> not

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
surround disabled more often than not

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.390 
surround disabled more often than not
and<00:04:01.390> really<00:04:01.990> I've<00:04:02.290> yet<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.590> hear<00:04:02.800> simulated

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
and really I've yet to hear simulated

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.400 
and really I've yet to hear simulated
surround<00:04:03.580> that<00:04:04.000> sounds<00:04:04.300> better<00:04:04.480> than<00:04:04.570> stereo

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
surround that sounds better than stereo

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.170 
surround that sounds better than stereo
at<00:04:05.650> this<00:04:05.890> point<00:04:06.190> overall<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.940> sound

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
at this point overall the sound

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.030 
at this point overall the sound
signature<00:04:07.510> does<00:04:07.930> get<00:04:08.140> a<00:04:08.170> passing<00:04:08.410> grade<00:04:08.620> from

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
signature does get a passing grade from

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.580 
signature does get a passing grade from
me<00:04:09.250> but<00:04:09.670> don't<00:04:09.790> expect<00:04:10.150> anything

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
me but don't expect anything

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.790 
me but don't expect anything

typical

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
typical

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.369 
typical
set<00:04:24.819> or<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.479> a<00:04:25.569> little<00:04:25.720> bit<00:04:25.900> better<00:04:26.080> than

you<00:04:26.440> were<00:04:26.650> expected<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.819> that's<00:04:27.940> about<00:04:28.150> it

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
you were expected and that's about it

guys<00:04:28.419> so<00:04:29.110> for<00:04:29.470> my<00:04:29.590> final<00:04:29.949> verdict<00:04:30.280> do<00:04:30.669> I<00:04:30.729> think

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
guys so for my final verdict do I think

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.939 
guys so for my final verdict do I think
these<00:04:31.150> are<00:04:31.210> worth<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.569> price<00:04:31.780> tag<00:04:32.110> well<00:04:32.620> I

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
these are worth the price tag well I

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.649 
these are worth the price tag well I
think<00:04:33.129> PC<00:04:33.669> gamers<00:04:34.000> would<00:04:34.150> be<00:04:34.270> better<00:04:34.479> off

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659 
think PC gamers would be better off

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:36.450 
think PC gamers would be better off
buying<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.259> pair<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.530> open-back<00:04:36.190> headphones

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
buying a pair of open-back headphones

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.490 
buying a pair of open-back headphones
and<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.030> separate<00:04:37.389> mic<00:04:37.629> you<00:04:37.990> may<00:04:38.110> even<00:04:38.229> be<00:04:38.349> able

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
and a separate mic you may even be able

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.490 
and a separate mic you may even be able
