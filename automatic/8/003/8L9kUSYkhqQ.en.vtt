with a tablet called the Buddha X 200

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.839 
with a tablet called the Buddha X 200
and<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.540> game<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.259> world<00:00:07.680> at<00:00:07.890> work<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.460> from

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
and the game is world at work it's from

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.499 
and the game is world at work it's from
Gameloft<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.740> allows<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.460> play<00:00:11.700> some

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
Gameloft and it allows you to play some

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.470 
Gameloft and it allows you to play some
interesting<00:00:13.080> strategy<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.210> to<00:00:15.210> simulate

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
interesting strategy and to simulate

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.650 
interesting strategy and to simulate
you're<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.960> nation<00:00:16.440> at<00:00:16.560> war<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.420> as<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.539> can

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
you're a nation at war and as you can

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.900 
you're a nation at war and as you can
see<00:00:18.720> right<00:00:19.020> now<00:00:19.199> I'm<00:00:19.320> collecting<00:00:19.500> cash<00:00:22.550> so<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
see right now I'm collecting cash so the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.179 
see right now I'm collecting cash so the
idea<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.510> build<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.960> huge<00:00:25.260> base<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.980> I'm

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
idea is to build a huge base as I'm

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.859 
idea is to build a huge base as I'm
building<00:00:26.490> right<00:00:26.640> here<00:00:26.939> there's<00:00:27.390> also<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
building right here there's also a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.679 
building right here there's also a
lottery<00:00:28.349> element<00:00:28.849> that<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:30.060> playing<00:00:30.449> right

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
lottery element that I'm playing right

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.729 
lottery element that I'm playing right
here<00:00:32.239> it<00:00:33.239> apparently<00:00:33.719> involves<00:00:34.260> some<00:00:34.380> sort<00:00:34.620> of

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
here it apparently involves some sort of

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:49.729 
here it apparently involves some sort of
war<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.129> get<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> bonus<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:49.530> only

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
war and you get a bonus and that's only

00:00:49.739 --> 00:01:01.340 
war and you get a bonus and that's only
part<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> game

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.410 

I<00:01:01.380> know<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.160> crazy<00:01:02.400> to<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.700> a<00:01:02.730> rotary<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.330> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I know it's crazy to have a rotary in a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.850 
I know it's crazy to have a rotary in a
game<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.290> we'll<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.770> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
game like this but we'll get to the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.850 
game like this but we'll get to the
strategy<00:01:05.240> immediately<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.710> about

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
strategy immediately and that was about

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.540 
strategy immediately and that was about
it

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.190 

okay<00:01:11.550> so<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.910> just<00:01:12.180> want<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> nuclear<00:01:12.870> warhead

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
okay so I just want a nuclear warhead

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.830 
okay so I just want a nuclear warhead
it's<00:01:13.710> useful<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.160> have<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> small

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it's useful to have so this is the small

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.130 
it's useful to have so this is the small
base<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.320> built<00:01:16.940> during<00:01:17.940> about<00:01:18.240> let's<00:01:18.930> say

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
base I have built during about let's say

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.830 
base I have built during about let's say
today<00:01:19.440> is<00:01:19.620> a<00:01:19.710> gameplay<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:21.060> about<00:01:21.360> two<00:01:21.750> or

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
today is a gameplay with about two or

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.380 
today is a gameplay with about two or
three<00:01:21.900> hours<00:01:22.380> per<00:01:22.620> day<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.880> idea<00:01:24.120> is<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
three hours per day so the idea is to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.770 
three hours per day so the idea is to
get<00:01:24.510> some<00:01:24.750> buildings<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:26.180> let's<00:01:27.180> say<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> bar

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
get some buildings like let's say a bar

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.560 
get some buildings like let's say a bar
or<00:01:28.170> let's<00:01:28.979> say<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> military<00:01:29.490> cottage<00:01:30.030> those

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
or let's say a military cottage those

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.780 
or let's say a military cottage those
provide<00:01:31.050> you<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.290> cash<00:01:31.620> and<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.550> you<00:01:32.640> have

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
provide you with cash and then you have

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.310 
provide you with cash and then you have
to<00:01:32.880> build<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> power<00:01:33.360> source<00:01:33.780> you'll<00:01:34.050> be<00:01:34.170> done

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
to build the power source you'll be done

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800 
to build the power source you'll be done
oil<00:01:34.619> well<00:01:34.800> for<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.369> oil<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.210> tanks<00:01:36.570> use

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
oil well for the oil that your tanks use

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.900 
oil well for the oil that your tanks use
and<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.830> have<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.160> build<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.700> these

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
and then you have to build one of these

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.170 
and then you have to build one of these
very<00:01:39.330> many<00:01:39.630> spinning<00:01:40.440> wind<00:01:41.400> power<00:01:41.759> plants

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
very many spinning wind power plants

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
very many spinning wind power plants
that<00:01:42.300> provide<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:42.900> power<00:01:43.200> forward<00:01:43.710> is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that provide your power forward is

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.410 
that provide your power forward is
needed<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.280> get<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.550> building<00:01:44.850> functioning

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
needed to get the building functioning

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.630 
needed to get the building functioning
and<00:01:45.630> then<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.650> some<00:01:46.830> terraforming<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and then there is some terraforming to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.540 
and then there is some terraforming to
do<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.570> cost<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.080> lot<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.590> times<00:01:49.800> posed<00:01:50.070> by<00:01:50.310> you

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
do that cost a lot of times posed by you

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.210 
do that cost a lot of times posed by you
can<00:01:50.790> expand<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.270> area<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.290> at<00:01:52.619> some<00:01:52.830> point<00:01:52.890> you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
can expand the area so at some point you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.940 
can expand the area so at some point you
will<00:01:53.340> be<00:01:53.369> left<00:01:53.700> without<00:01:53.910> places<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.750> build

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
will be left without places to build

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.980 
will be left without places to build
there's<00:01:55.950> also<00:01:56.720> something<00:01:57.720> called<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:59.990> power

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
there's also something called the power

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.830 
there's also something called the power
of<00:02:01.140> building<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.130> upgrades<00:02:02.910> all<00:02:03.300> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
of building this one upgrades all the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.440 
of building this one upgrades all the
things<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.100> use<00:02:05.670> during<00:02:05.970> battles

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
things that you can use during battles

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.600 
things that you can use during battles
and<00:02:06.750> battles<00:02:06.780> are<00:02:07.560> very<00:02:07.830> interesting<00:02:08.399> Lee

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and battles are very interesting Lee

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.170 
and battles are very interesting Lee
waged<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.410> also<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.739> main<00:02:11.100> area<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.700> quests

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180

resurrected<00:03:38.990> and<00:03:39.990> I<00:03:40.500> was<00:03:40.680> pretty<00:03:40.980> close<00:03:41.250> to

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
resurrected and I was pretty close to

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.660 
resurrected and I was pretty close to
actually<00:03:42.300> winning<00:03:43.110> some<00:03:43.350> point<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:43.980> two<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.490> my

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
actually winning some point so two of my

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.000 
actually winning some point so two of my
units<00:03:44.970> were<00:03:45.090> resurrected<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.990> the<00:03:46.710> battle

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
units were resurrected and the battle

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.250 
units were resurrected and the battle
was<00:03:47.220> lost<00:03:47.250> for<00:03:47.910> now<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.330> this<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.630> how<00:03:48.870> my<00:03:49.020> base

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
was lost for now so this is how my base

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.490 
was lost for now so this is how my base
looks<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:49.860> with<00:03:50.670> zoom<00:03:50.940> these<00:03:51.660> ones<00:03:51.990> provide

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
looks like with zoom these ones provide

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.960 
looks like with zoom these ones provide
the<00:03:52.620> energy<00:03:52.800> this<00:03:53.730> one<00:03:54.000> makes<00:03:54.690> my<00:03:54.990> tanks<00:03:55.940> so<00:03:56.940> I

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
the energy this one makes my tanks so I

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.090 
the energy this one makes my tanks so I
can<00:03:57.210> make<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.390> Humvee<00:03:57.930> drive<00:03:58.230> back<00:03:58.470> infiltrator

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100

complete<00:04:42.210> their<00:04:42.870> battles<00:04:43.260> just<00:04:43.380> like<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.890> one

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
complete their battles just like the one

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.159 
complete their battles just like the one
you<00:04:44.160> saw<00:04:44.340> earlier<00:04:44.490> so<00:04:44.760> let's<00:04:45.270> try<00:04:45.510> an<00:04:45.780> easier

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
you saw earlier so let's try an easier

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.550 
you saw earlier so let's try an easier
one<00:04:46.970> like<00:04:47.970> this<00:04:48.180> one<00:04:48.450> a<00:04:48.690> bunch<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.140> Tanks

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
one like this one a bunch of Tanks

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.960 
one like this one a bunch of Tanks
should<00:04:50.490> handle<00:04:50.820> them<00:04:51.000> all<00:04:52.400> so<00:04:53.400> let's<00:04:53.700> see<00:04:53.880> if

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
should handle them all so let's see if

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.280 
should handle them all so let's see if
we<00:04:54.030> can<00:04:54.240> take<00:04:54.419> them

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.590 

there<00:04:58.290> are<00:04:58.350> also<00:04:58.470> some<00:04:58.710> traps<00:04:59.270> you<00:05:00.270> can<00:05:00.330> also

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
there are also some traps you can also

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.659 
there are also some traps you can also
shoot<00:05:00.870> some<00:05:01.110> barrels<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:02.250> make<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.520> enemy

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
shoot some barrels to make the enemy

incapacitated<00:05:03.600> like<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.050> just<00:05:04.110> did<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.650> then

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
incapacitated like I just did and then

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.130 
incapacitated like I just did and then
when<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.640> battle<00:05:05.910> is<00:05:05.970> over<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.600> gain<00:05:06.930> some

00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:38.059 
you also have power-ups but sadly

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:40.299 
you also have power-ups but sadly
everything<00:05:38.749> is<00:05:38.899> costly<00:05:39.409> in<00:05:39.619> this<00:05:39.769> game<00:05:40.039> and

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:40.309 
everything is costly in this game and

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:42.069 
everything is costly in this game and
aside<00:05:40.789> from<00:05:40.969> the<00:05:41.089> cash<00:05:41.329> that<00:05:41.599> I'm<00:05:41.809> collecting

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:42.079 
aside from the cash that I'm collecting

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:44.139 
aside from the cash that I'm collecting
right<00:05:42.319> now<00:05:42.499> there<00:05:43.039> is<00:05:43.129> another<00:05:43.249> resource<00:05:43.849> is

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:44.149 
right now there is another resource is

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:47.169 
right now there is another resource is
this<00:05:45.049> metal<00:05:46.039> right<00:05:46.219> here<00:05:46.279> that<00:05:46.789> you<00:05:46.879> have<00:05:47.059> to

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:47.179 
this metal right here that you have to

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:49.569 
this metal right here that you have to
gain<00:05:47.359> some<00:05:47.929> way<00:05:48.079> or<00:05:48.289> another<00:05:48.319> usually<00:05:49.159> you<00:05:49.519> buy

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:49.579 
gain some way or another usually you buy

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:53.199 
gain some way or another usually you buy
from<00:05:49.999> Gameloft<00:05:50.239> so<00:05:50.989> this<00:05:51.199> is<00:05:51.349> once<00:05:51.739> again<00:05:52.219> one

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:53.209 
from Gameloft so this is once again one

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:55.569 
from Gameloft so this is once again one
of<00:05:53.239> those<00:05:53.509> freemium<00:05:53.899> games<00:05:54.379> that<00:05:54.919> people<00:05:55.369> love

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:55.579 
of those freemium games that people love

00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:57.969 
of those freemium games that people love
so<00:05:55.759> much<00:05:55.939> the<00:05:56.839> idea<00:05:57.139> is<00:05:57.229> to<00:05:57.319> be<00:05:57.439> patient<00:05:57.829> and

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
so much the idea is to be patient and

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.469 
so much the idea is to be patient and
wait<00:05:58.209> so<00:05:59.209> for<00:05:59.419> example<00:06:00.849> I'm<00:06:01.849> going<00:06:01.969> to<00:06:02.209> create

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
wait so for example I'm going to create

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.619 
wait so for example I'm going to create
a<00:06:02.569> marine<00:06:02.989> and<00:06:03.999> I'm<00:06:04.999> going<00:06:05.209> to<00:06:05.329> create<00:06:05.569> a

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:05.629 
a marine and I'm going to create a

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.169 
a marine and I'm going to create a
draped<00:06:06.079> back<00:06:06.229> tank<00:06:06.499> and<00:06:06.799> that's<00:06:07.669> the<00:06:07.849> waiting

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:08.179 
draped back tank and that's the waiting

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:10.959 
draped back tank and that's the waiting
time<00:06:08.360> ten<00:06:08.959> minutes<00:06:09.289> for<00:06:09.559> the<00:06:09.679> 3-pack<00:06:10.099> and<00:06:10.369> for

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
time ten minutes for the 3-pack and for

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.429 
time ten minutes for the 3-pack and for
the<00:06:11.089> marine<00:06:11.389> it<00:06:11.989> should<00:06:12.229> be<00:06:12.819> one<00:06:13.819> minute<00:06:14.439> so

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:15.439 
the marine it should be one minute so

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.349 
the marine it should be one minute so
you<00:06:15.529> have<00:06:15.679> to<00:06:15.799> wait<00:06:15.949> earn<00:06:16.339> more<00:06:16.549> cash<00:06:16.819> earn

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:17.359 
you have to wait earn more cash earn

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:20.169 
you have to wait earn more cash earn
enough<00:06:17.749> cash<00:06:18.019> to<00:06:18.049> expand<00:06:18.589> your<00:06:18.709> area<00:06:19.129> then<00:06:19.969> I

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:20.179 
enough cash to expand your area then I

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:23.199 
enough cash to expand your area then I
will<00:06:20.359> create<00:06:20.539> a<00:06:20.719> new<00:06:21.079> building<00:06:21.559> and<00:06:22.209> there

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.209 
will create a new building and there

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:24.429 
will create a new building and there
after<00:06:23.299> printing<00:06:23.689> the<00:06:23.749> building<00:06:24.139> I<00:06:24.259> keep

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:24.439 
after printing the building I keep

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:26.769 
after printing the building I keep
expanding<00:06:24.829> and<00:06:25.219> that's<00:06:25.819> the<00:06:26.059> basic<00:06:26.419> idea<00:06:26.509> of
