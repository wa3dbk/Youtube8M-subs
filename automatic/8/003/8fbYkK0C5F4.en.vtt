00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:22.239
 hello friends yesterday at 15 in the race on our own doors 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.239
 every day with these wickerwork jobs 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.739
 the material the nasa needs 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:36.110
 about 80 centimeters of tin wire of approximately 0 7 11 millimeters 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.290
 the finer the better the color that you like the best 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.250
 we can also use an account to fit into this creation 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.420
 launch an effect 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.850
 more original and we will use 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.890
 our adital cesc of the flat tip or round tip and our inhabitants 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.510
 sports 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.260

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.710
 m 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.380
 good morning we cut the 80 centimeters for the World Cup 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.530
 what I'm going to do in the extremes 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.130
 this will last a bit the tip 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.140
 to avoid Havana Cuba when working with a large showcase of a child 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.910
 in the same note premiered on the channel 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 nobody the network 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.960
 it is not known that it is very easy 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.180
 we will deliver a little 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.990
 the aluminum 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.990
 until you know everything in the palm of your hand 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.830
 and now what we have to do 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.970
 is to give it a rounded shape as if we were doing 1 something indicated 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.530
 talk about this year 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.979
 smallest Hispanic the box office for example this size can you 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.700
 serve for different generations I'm going to keep opting a little bit so that 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700
 see the result 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:23.679
 Well, this would be the result as you see I was very original, you can not 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:28.539
 Use in any kind of creation family teeth bracelets 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:36.769
 Now I'm going to make another example using an account in the middle of the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.040
 aluminum cable I will re-cut the 80 cm tecate 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.149

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.499
 both downhill 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.839
 for that the gecp an account 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.679
 for example zealand experts 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.819
