00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.259
 [Music] 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.390
 let's show you some of the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.730
 components that we usually present in 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.830
 our items like the recovery the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.590
 mode buttons on samsung terminals or 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.390
 the utility of the recovery is a way of 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.670
 terminal operation that allows 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.100
 basically update the rom perform 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.690
 backups or restore them to 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.340
 start in recovery mode you have to press 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.530
 a certain combination of keys 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.019
 that in the case of health samsung galaxy 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.820
 the keys are not the key 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.949
 of home and the volume key to 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.690
 up the simultaneous pulsation of these 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.110
 three keys allows to start in mode 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.110
 recovery 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.430
 a moment that starts 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.650
 ok this is the recovery that is included 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.210
 by default in the thor kernel that is one 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.160
 of the most recommended for this 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:23.040
 terminal and that is the only one that includes 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:26.250
 bl n for android 4.1 vÃ©lez n is a 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.070
 utility that allows us to simulate that we have 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.970
 a led in this terminal that does not 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.110
 includes by default and allows to make 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.410
 the buttons 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.970
 menu and back lights up when we receive 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.270
 a missed call or email 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.729
 electronic for example 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.679
 good as you see this recovery is 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.149
 based on cloud work mod but 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.159
 slightly customized by the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.679
 Developer includes the options 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.750
 main ones that include the recovery role 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:58.430
 who are installing a brown 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.420
 make an erasure of the data of the 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.450
 terminal create or restore a backup and 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.340
 it also includes a utility I think that 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.750
 very important and that is getting 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.640
 very fashionable lately that is a 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.160
 file explorer called aroma 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.050
 which is a file explorer that 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.510
 it works in graphic mode in recovery 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.640
 something that is not at all usual besides good 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.260
 as we have seen this recovery is tactile 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.260
 let's see the aroma 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.170
 as we see aroma is an explorer of 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.069
 files totally tactile and totally 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.829
 graphic that also in its latest version 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.909
 and we can browse the directories and 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.040
 in its latest version includes a console 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.650
 that allows us to execute practically 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.700
 any command and unix in the terminal 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.830
 while we are in recovery mode 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.190
 As you can see the keyboard is very similar to 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.470
 that we have in the terminal when 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.470
 we have switched on normally we close 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.360
 and we go back to the recovery 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.200
 the ghost loader mode of the terminals 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.460
 samsung also allows updating the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.640
 rom let's go to 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.730
 but it's a more dangerous way since 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.310
 acts lower than he 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.310
 record and it's not widely used 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.540
 to boot the terminal in boudou mode 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.489
 there we must press simultaneously 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.860
 several keys in order to avoid 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.250
 involuntary starts and that the samsung 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.440
 karachi are not the start keys the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.709
 menu key and the key to lower the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.989
 volume however it is also possible 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.829
 boot into bootloader mode using a 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.300
 usb 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:04.930
 which is an accessory as you see 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.880
 that costs five euros or even less and 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.310
 that allows to start the terminal even 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.230
 if it has been locked to start it 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.590
 we just have to insert it in the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.139
 microusb port of the terminal 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.120
 After a few seconds the terminal 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.660
 mode automatically starts 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.040
 louder as you see and from here 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.820
 we can withdraw 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:33.810
 usb accessory 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:36.050
 we can connect the phone to 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.400
 to the computer by the micro usb cable 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.570
 and we can flash any role 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.570
 using or dyn 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:47.460
 now we are going to show you the usefulness of 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.569
 the one we talked about many times 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.569
 we turn off the terminal 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.410
 we proceed to turn it on in recovery mode 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.410
 for example 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:12.229
 and we proceed to click 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.340
 to connect it to the computer 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.149
 and as you see here on the screen with the 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.230
 command has vettel 

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:28.310
 connect 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.310
 with the phone 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.850
 and once the 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.460
 connection that is also established as 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.249
 root user, we can run 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.169
 any command 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:54.659
 from seeing the partitions we have 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:56.789
 mounted until you see the contents of a 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:59.819
 directory even delete files or 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.679
 anything else we want and this 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.689
 It has been the video in which we wanted you 

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:06.059
 present these utilities we hope that 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:09.289
 you liked it and we see each other again 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:09.289
 soon thank you very much
