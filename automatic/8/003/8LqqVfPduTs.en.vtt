00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.389
 Everyone likes to think that he has never been influenced by advertising, but unless you 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.289
 have never seen an advertisement in your life, your choices have been influenced 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.820
 through all the advertisements you've ever seen. Every advertisement changes our opinion about it 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.099
 the brand or product. You may see some commercials that you think: 'why would anyone decide 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.620
 buy this product after having seen it ', but the purpose of advertisements is no longer 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.260
 to ensure that the consumer immediately picks up the phone to buy the product. The purpose of 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.510
 these advertisements is not to inform the consumer about the product and its features. 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 The reason why companies like McDonald's, which are known almost everywhere, still advertise 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.739
 is because they are trying to build in an opinion and associated image of the brand 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.859
 the thoughts of consumers. There are two main psychological methods that 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.890
 marketers nowadays use for their advertisements. The first method is called the 'mere exposure effect'. 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.630
 These are the minimalist, bald advertisements that make you scratch your head 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.409
 and which makes you wonder why the company has paid thousands of dollars for it. It is because 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.530
 everyone feels more at ease within a group. When one row at the bank is considerably longer 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.820
 one is the other, one will most likely stand in the longer line because one thinks 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.700
 that there must be a reason that one prefers the longer line to the other. They think the one 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.009
 row is better than the other, or because one is more correct than the other. It is normal 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.229
 an easier and better-feeling decision. Consumer psychology works about the same. 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.969
 By exposing the consumer to the brand, the consumer starts to think he knows the brand. 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.820
 This ensures that when the consumer goes to the store to buy detergent, 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.689
 he will grab Tide and feel good about it. Tide's detergent may be a little more expensive 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.310
 than the private label detergent, but they know that this detergent will do well. 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.119
 It wouldn't have been such a big brand if it didn't work well. A better example of this 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.400
 phenomenon are painkillers and other easily available drugs at the pharmacy. The general 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.489
 drug brands are exactly the same product as the largest brand, with exactly the same composition 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.750
 of ingredients. If they had not had the same composition, it would not have been permitted 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.600
 to call them medicines. Advil and generic ibuprofen are exactly the same product, with 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.859
 exactly the same composition, but one will still continue to buy Advil despite the higher price. 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:44.750
 It is simply easier to choose what everyone chooses. The consumer tends to be anxious 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.220
 to buy the cheaper, generic brand of medicines. This means that you always have the generic brand 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.799
 buy medicines? Not necessary. Got into a study from the University of Cincinnati 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.419
 Parkinson's patients have two types of medication, one of which was said to be the more expensive 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:09.519
 brand drugs and the others were the cheaper generic brand drugs. After taking the so-called 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.500
 more expensive drugs, patients had a 28% greater improvement in motor skills than after 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.459
 taking the supposedly cheaper medications, while in reality both injections 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.260
 were just saline. The expectations of the brand medicines were higher, so the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.639
 patients felt better because of the placebo effect. Sometimes spending more money ensures that 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:38.889
 you feel better. The other commonly used psychological method is that 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:43.919
 Being used in marketing is the classic conditioning. The idea behind this technique came 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:50.650
 from a study conducted by Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov around 1890. Pavlov noted that 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.090
 his dogs began to drool when he entered the room, even when he didn't 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.340
 had food with him. This was because the dogs expected that they would get food when 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.590
 Pavlov came into the room because every time he had food he came into the room. 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.639
 Pavlov decided to ring a bell every time he fed his dogs and after a while 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:17.459
 the dogs began to drool when they heard the sound of the bell. This is because 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.229
 the dogs were trained to associate the sound of the bell with getting food. They were trained 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:30.770
 to have the expectation of food. The same psychological principle works with people. 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.080
 Brands will try to associate certain feelings, reactions or images with them 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.840
 product. In their advertisements they show certain images in combination with their product, 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.639
 so that the consumer unknowingly links those images to the product. The best thing about this one 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.919
 technology is that it always works. No matter how much you try to ignore the advertisement, 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.500
 as long as you can see them, you will unconsciously relate the two images. 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.659
 Car brands are the biggest perpetrators of the use of this sneaky technique. Their advertisements almost never have 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:08.219
 something to make it the actual car, but are about someone who drives the car. Luxury 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:14.009
 car brands will show people in suits, arriving at a red carpet while an SUV advertising 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.810
 an adventurous looking couple will show with kayaks and bikes in tow, riding on one 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.960
 dirt road. In the meantime you hardly buy a car anymore, but a way of life. You buy 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.930
 the image of someone going to gala or spending his weekend 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.719
 be adventurous. The car hardly matters, it is the image that you buy. 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.889
 Perhaps the biggest advertising success 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:49.610
 lately it has been Beats headphones. Beats has about 27% of the total market of 1.8 billion dollars, 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.349
 despite the fact that most people agree, they only make moderately sounding headphones. 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.159
 According to the New York Times, the production costs of Beats headphones are those 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:07.400
 sold for as much as $ 250, are only about $ 14. The reason that Beats is seen 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.590
 as a big brand, is because of their marketing and brand image. From the start 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.419
 Beats spending a lot of money sponsoring famous people. All the most famous 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.039
 Athletes wore Beats during their interviews, so consumers started to think that 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:29.680
 these were fashionable, expensive headphones. The high price, solid, heavy materials; 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.689
 Robust packaging and approval from famous people raised expectations and probably have 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:52.220
 psychologically make the headphones sound better, just like with the medication.
