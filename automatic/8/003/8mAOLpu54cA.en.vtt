00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that these reviews aren't too helpful

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.389 
that these reviews aren't too helpful
because<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.170> don't<00:00:37.440> know<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.829> source<00:00:38.129> who's

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
because you don't know the source who's

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.180 
because you don't know the source who's
writing<00:00:38.760> them<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.590> what<00:00:40.590> I've<00:00:40.710> learned<00:00:40.739> from

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
writing them and what I've learned from

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.130 
writing them and what I've learned from
not<00:00:41.610> only<00:00:41.910> making<00:00:42.090> youtube<00:00:42.480> videos<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:43.020> I've

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
not only making youtube videos what I've

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.840 
not only making youtube videos what I've
learned<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.649> from<00:00:43.710> being<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.129> consumer<00:00:44.520> who

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
learned just from being a consumer who

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.630 
learned just from being a consumer who
tries<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.809> educated<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.500> possible<00:00:46.980> what

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
tries to be as educated as possible what

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.549 
tries to be as educated as possible what
I've<00:00:47.760> learned<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.329> people<00:00:48.539> tend<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> use

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
I've learned is that people tend to use

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.040 
I've learned is that people tend to use
products<00:00:50.070> incorrectly<00:00:50.700> or<00:00:51.000> not<00:00:51.300> use<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:51.809> for

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
products incorrectly or not use them for

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.889 
products incorrectly or not use them for
the<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.500> amount<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.890> time<00:00:53.129> or<00:00:53.660> make<00:00:54.660> some

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the right amount of time or make some

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.180 
the right amount of time or make some
type<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.170> fatal<00:00:55.350> error<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.010> would

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
type of fatal error that would

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.279 
type of fatal error that would
necessarily<00:00:56.969> make<00:00:57.210> their<00:00:57.510> experience<00:00:58.109> with

express shipping so I paid $18 to have

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.080 
express shipping so I paid $18 to have
this<00:01:30.540> second<00:01:31.320> day<00:01:31.470> delivery<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.520> um<00:01:32.759> I

this second day delivery and I was um I

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.330 
this second day delivery and I was um I
ordered<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> Wednesday<00:01:34.229> night<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.740> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
ordered it on a Wednesday night and it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.260 
ordered it on a Wednesday night and it
didn't<00:01:35.549> come<00:01:35.700> until<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.970> following

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
didn't come until the following

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
didn't come until the following
Wednesday<00:01:36.900> which<00:01:37.049> obviously<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
Wednesday which obviously is not the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.890 
Wednesday which obviously is not the
second<00:01:38.729> day<00:01:38.790> delivery<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
second day delivery and this is one of

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.899 
second day delivery and this is one of
those<00:01:39.990> great<00:01:40.229> devices<00:01:40.799> where<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.490> proof<00:01:41.729> is

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
those great devices where the proof is

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.149 
those great devices where the proof is
literally<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.140> results<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.920> so

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
literally in the results that you get so

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.490 
literally in the results that you get so
you<00:01:44.220> don't<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:44.939> trust<00:01:45.119> me<00:01:45.500> I'll

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
you don't have to just trust me I'll

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
you don't have to just trust me I'll
share<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.759> results<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.329> get

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
share with you the results that I get

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090 
share with you the results that I get
throughout<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> course<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.350> using<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.799> so

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
throughout the course of using this so

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.340 
throughout the course of using this so
basically<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> device<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
basically it's just the device in the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.230 
basically it's just the device in the
box<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.860> device<00:01:53.100> looks<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
box and the device looks like this it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.850 
box and the device looks like this it
has<00:01:54.390> various<00:01:54.810> packing<00:01:55.200> library<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.710> very

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
has various packing library I'm not very

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
has various packing library I'm not very
good<00:01:55.950> at<00:01:56.100> doing<00:01:56.369> an<00:01:56.490> unboxing<00:01:56.729> video<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.420> this

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
good at doing an unboxing video but this

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.240 
good at doing an unboxing video but this
is<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> box<00:01:58.290> looks<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.040> says

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
is what the box looks like it it says

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.359 
is what the box looks like it it says
tree<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.729> beauty<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:01.079> hair<00:02:01.799> removal

laser<00:02:02.659> permanent<00:02:03.659> results<00:02:04.079> at<00:02:04.290> home<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.950> what

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
laser permanent results at home and what

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.789 
laser permanent results at home and what
this<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.390> diode<00:02:06.960> laser<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.770> I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
this is is it's a diode laser and I

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.910 
this is is it's a diode laser and I
think<00:02:08.099> from<00:02:09.140> reading<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.319> trio<00:02:10.530> website

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
think from reading on the trio website

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.670 
think from reading on the trio website
it's<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.250> something<00:02:11.459> like

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
it's like something like

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.830 
it's like something like
840<00:02:12.400> nanometers<00:02:12.939> if<00:02:13.180> you're<00:02:13.329> familiar<00:02:13.569> with

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
840 nanometers if you're familiar with

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.599 
840 nanometers if you're familiar with
lasers<00:02:14.349> so<00:02:14.530> let's<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:14.829> open<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.159> box<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.549> has

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:15.609 
lasers so let's just open the box it has

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.459 
lasers so let's just open the box it has
this<00:02:15.909> little<00:02:16.090> outer<00:02:16.359> sleeve<00:02:16.780> but<00:02:17.109> the<00:02:17.260> box

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
this little outer sleeve but the box

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.309 
this little outer sleeve but the box
itself<00:02:17.829> looks<00:02:18.129> like<00:02:18.189> this<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.840> opens<00:02:20.200> like

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
itself looks like this and it opens like

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.339 
itself looks like this and it opens like
this<00:02:20.829> and<00:02:21.459> inside<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.359> box<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.810> have<00:02:22.870> the

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
this and inside of the box you have the

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.199 
this and inside of the box you have the
laser<00:02:23.560> itself<00:02:24.010> which<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.400> here<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:24.909> you<00:02:25.000> have

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
laser itself which is here and you have

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.179 
laser itself which is here and you have
a<00:02:25.239> little<00:02:25.540> AC<00:02:25.840> adapter<00:02:26.530> here<00:02:26.829> which<00:02:27.010> is

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
a little AC adapter here which is

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.619 
a little AC adapter here which is
obviously<00:02:27.579> what<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.849> plug<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.209> into<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.450> wall

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
obviously what you plug it into the wall

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.240 
obviously what you plug it into the wall
and<00:02:28.659> charge<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.139> with<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.859> then<00:02:29.950> there's<00:02:30.129> an

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
and charge it with and then there's an

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.720 
and charge it with and then there's an
informational<00:02:30.879> pamphlet<00:02:31.389> here<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.730> let's

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
informational pamphlet here and let's

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.550 
informational pamphlet here and let's
take<00:02:33.939> the<00:02:34.090> laser<00:02:34.269> out<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.659> just<00:02:34.840> sits<00:02:35.079> in<00:02:35.230> here

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
take the laser out it just sits in here

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.170 
take the laser out it just sits in here
comfortably<00:02:35.889> actually<00:02:36.579> I<00:02:36.609> believe<00:02:36.760> there<00:02:37.060> was

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
comfortably actually I believe there was

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.970 
comfortably actually I believe there was
a<00:02:37.239> little<00:02:37.450> piece<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:37.930> plastic<00:02:38.439> over<00:02:38.650> this

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
a little piece of plastic over this

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.309 
a little piece of plastic over this
I<00:02:39.010> took<00:02:39.909> this<00:02:40.180> out<00:02:40.389> to<00:02:40.599> look<00:02:40.930> at<00:02:41.079> it<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.260> little

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
I took this out to look at it a little

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.690 
I took this out to look at it a little
bit<00:02:41.469> before<00:02:41.620> making<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.159> video<00:02:42.430> but<00:02:42.639> I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
bit before making the video but I

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.159 
bit before making the video but I
haven't<00:02:42.969> taken<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.450> off<00:02:43.689> and<00:02:43.900> what<00:02:43.989> this

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:44.169 
haven't taken this off and what this

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:45.839 
haven't taken this off and what this
says<00:02:44.349> is<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.650> visit<00:02:44.859> the<00:02:45.099> website<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:45.730> to

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
says is to visit the website in to

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.339 
says is to visit the website in to
register<00:02:46.060> your<00:02:46.480> laser<00:02:46.659> ahead<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.079> time<00:02:47.260> and

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
register your laser ahead of time and

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.199 
register your laser ahead of time and
I'm<00:02:47.439> not<00:02:47.530> sure<00:02:47.650> exactly<00:02:47.889> why<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.310> need<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.849> or

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
I'm not sure exactly why you need to or

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.869 
I'm not sure exactly why you need to or
if<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.959> actually<00:02:50.109> do<00:02:50.530> need<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:51.010> but<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.400> just

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.030 
doing it that way
this<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.359> what<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.569> laser<00:03:01.750> looks<00:03:02.109> like<00:03:02.319> my

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
this is what the laser looks like my

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.339 
this is what the laser looks like my
this<00:03:03.430> is<00:03:03.609> play<00:03:03.730> about<00:03:03.939> a<00:03:04.000> one<00:03:04.689> and<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.870> half<00:03:04.900> to

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
this is play about a one and a half to

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.409 
this is play about a one and a half to
two<00:03:05.500> centimeter<00:03:06.010> actual<00:03:06.669> laser<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.090> then<00:03:07.180> has

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
two centimeter actual laser and then has

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.539 
two centimeter actual laser and then has
little<00:03:07.659> fans<00:03:07.959> around<00:03:08.409> it<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:09.280> fans

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
little fans around it and the fans

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.819 
little fans around it and the fans
operate<00:03:10.299> or<00:03:10.480> they<00:03:10.569> turn<00:03:10.629> on<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.319> basically

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
operate or they turn on and basically

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.530 
operate or they turn on and basically
cool<00:03:12.129> down<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.459> laser<00:03:12.669> as<00:03:12.939> you're<00:03:13.180> using<00:03:13.389> the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
cool down the laser as you're using the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.420 
cool down the laser as you're using the
laser<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:14.109> as<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.739> can<00:03:14.859> see<00:03:15.040> on<00:03:15.159> the<00:03:15.280> bottom

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
laser and as you can see on the bottom

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.539 
laser and as you can see on the bottom
there's<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:15.879> little<00:03:16.060> sensor<00:03:16.569> here<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.859> this

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
there's a little sensor here and this

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.729 
there's a little sensor here and this
sensor<00:03:18.970> tests<00:03:19.449> your<00:03:19.629> skin<00:03:19.959> tone<00:03:20.199> to<00:03:20.440> make<00:03:20.530> sure

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
sensor tests your skin tone to make sure

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.439 
sensor tests your skin tone to make sure
that<00:03:20.889> it's<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.129> appropriate<00:03:21.370> shade<00:03:21.819> to

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
that it's the appropriate shade to

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.420 
that it's the appropriate shade to
actually<00:03:22.750> use<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.139> device<00:03:23.409> and<00:03:23.650> not<00:03:24.129> harm

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
actually use the device and not harm

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.219 
actually use the device and not harm
your<00:03:24.579> skin<00:03:24.729> or<00:03:25.150> burn<00:03:25.329> your<00:03:25.359> skin<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.019> then<00:03:26.139> the

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:26.229 
your skin or burn your skin and then the

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:27.809 
your skin or burn your skin and then the
other<00:03:26.349> information<00:03:26.680> printed<00:03:27.370> on<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.549> bottom

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
other information printed on the bottom

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.369 
other information printed on the bottom
or<00:03:27.970> things<00:03:28.120> like<00:03:28.269> your<00:03:28.419> serial<00:03:28.780> number<00:03:28.810> or

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
or things like your serial number or

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:30.569 
or things like your serial number or
things<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:29.919> need<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.099> actually

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
things that you need to actually

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.729 
things that you need to actually
register<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:31.060> device<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.959> it's<00:03:32.229> very<00:03:32.470> very

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
register the device so it's very very

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.379 
register the device so it's very very
simple<00:03:32.979> to<00:03:33.340> go<00:03:33.489> ahead<00:03:33.609> and<00:03:33.819> get<00:03:33.939> started

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
simple to go ahead and get started

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.179 
simple to go ahead and get started
so<00:03:34.750> after<00:03:35.019> you've<00:03:35.139> set<00:03:35.349> up<00:03:35.439> the<00:03:35.560> laser<00:03:35.799> one

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:36.189 
so after you've set up the laser one

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.530 
so after you've set up the laser one
thing<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.459> like<00:03:36.639> about<00:03:36.669> the<00:03:37.030> device<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.449> that

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
thing I like about the device is that

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.780 
thing I like about the device is that
it's<00:03:37.659> very<00:03:37.720> very<00:03:37.989> simple<00:03:38.409> to<00:03:38.739> start<00:03:39.310> just

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
it's very very simple to start just

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.879 
it's very very simple to start just
start<00:03:39.879> using<00:03:40.239> you<00:03:41.169> just<00:03:41.349> hit<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.590> button<00:03:41.709> on

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
start using you just hit the button on

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.949 
start using you just hit the button on
the<00:03:42.009> top<00:03:42.220> once<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.759> a<00:03:42.879> little<00:03:43.120> luck<00:03:43.329> icon

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
the top once and a little luck icon

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.539 
the top once and a little luck icon
shows<00:03:44.319> up<00:03:44.530> this<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:45.009> when<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.400> need<00:03:45.519> to

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
shows up this is when you need to

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.280 
shows up this is when you need to
actually<00:03:45.970> unlock<00:03:46.299> the<00:03:46.509> laser<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.109> for

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
actually unlock the laser so for

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.649 
actually unlock the laser so for
instance<00:03:47.620> you'll<00:03:47.799> just<00:03:48.209> verify<00:03:49.209> your<00:03:49.389> skin

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
instance you'll just verify your skin

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.399 
instance you'll just verify your skin
tone<00:03:49.930> by<00:03:50.229> using<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> laser<00:03:50.949> on<00:03:52.079> any<00:03:53.079> part<00:03:53.319> of

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
tone by using the laser on any part of

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.659 
tone by using the laser on any part of
your<00:03:53.530> skin<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:53.979> you'll<00:03:54.069> hear<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.459> beep

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
your skin and you'll hear that beep

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.759 
your skin and you'll hear that beep
which<00:03:54.879> essentially<00:03:55.389> tells<00:03:56.349> you<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.650> you're

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
which essentially tells you that you're

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.259 
which essentially tells you that you're
prepared<00:03:57.069> to<00:03:57.159> start<00:03:57.370> using<00:03:57.579> it<00:03:57.849> and<00:03:58.000> there<00:03:58.120> are

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
prepared to start using it and there are

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.689 
prepared to start using it and there are
five<00:03:58.479> settings<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.829> the<00:04:00.159> default<00:04:00.519> is

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
five settings and the default is

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.429 
five settings and the default is
obviously<00:04:01.090> setting<00:04:01.329> one<00:04:01.599> eye<00:04:01.840> here<00:04:02.199> that<00:04:02.349> you

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
obviously setting one eye here that you

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.589 
obviously setting one eye here that you
want<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.709> use<00:04:02.859> this<00:04:03.099> on<00:04:03.280> setting<00:04:03.669> five<00:04:04.120> if<00:04:04.479> you

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
want to use this on setting five if you

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.170 
want to use this on setting five if you
want<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.840> actually<00:04:04.989> get<00:04:05.500> results<00:04:06.180> perhaps

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
want to actually get results perhaps

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.999 
want to actually get results perhaps
setting<00:04:07.419> four<00:04:07.750> on<00:04:08.019> more<00:04:08.229> sensitive<00:04:08.680> areas

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:09.009 
setting four on more sensitive areas

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.009 
setting four on more sensitive areas
like<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.579> underarms<00:04:10.150> which<00:04:10.389> is<00:04:10.599> a<00:04:10.629> really

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
like the underarms which is a really

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.009 
like the underarms which is a really
great<00:04:11.199> area<00:04:12.129> I<00:04:12.189> think<00:04:12.579> for<00:04:12.909> this<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.449> for<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
great area I think for this and for the

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.589 
great area I think for this and for the
sake<00:04:14.229> of<00:04:14.259> these<00:04:14.590> videos<00:04:15.009> I'll<00:04:15.669> be<00:04:15.729> sort<00:04:16.509> of

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
sake of these videos I'll be sort of

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.680 
sake of these videos I'll be sort of
like<00:04:16.780> showing<00:04:17.159> the<00:04:18.159> progress<00:04:18.639> on<00:04:18.880> my<00:04:19.509> own

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
like showing the progress on my own

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.040 
like showing the progress on my own
underarms<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.560> just<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.549> show<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:21.969> if<00:04:22.750> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
underarms and just to show you if the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
underarms and just to show you if the
product<00:04:23.409> itself<00:04:23.740> actually<00:04:24.310> works<00:04:24.520> and

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
product itself actually works and

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.100 
product itself actually works and
is<00:04:25.130> worth<00:04:25.280> purchasing<00:04:25.820> because<00:04:26.480> certainly<00:04:26.960> if

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
is worth purchasing because certainly if

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.140 
is worth purchasing because certainly if
it<00:04:27.260> works<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.740> definitely<00:04:28.310> will<00:04:28.550> pay<00:04:28.850> itself

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
it works it definitely will pay itself

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.970 
it works it definitely will pay itself
off<00:04:29.390> I'm<00:04:29.840> just<00:04:29.900> going<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.290> run<00:04:30.470> down<00:04:30.650> my<00:04:30.680> arm

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
off I'm just going to run down my arm

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.380 
off I'm just going to run down my arm
really<00:04:31.280> quick<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.580> don't<00:04:31.640> have<00:04:31.910> any<00:04:32.090> dark

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
really quick I don't have any dark

really quick I don't have any dark
colored<00:04:33.230> hairs<00:04:33.470> on<00:04:33.650> my<00:04:33.680> arm<00:04:33.890> into<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.160> lot<00:04:34.340> of

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
colored hairs on my arm into a lot of

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.620 
colored hairs on my arm into a lot of

people it looks like my arms are
completely<00:04:35.780> shaven<00:04:36.260> but<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:36.560> have<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.860> sort<00:04:37.790> of

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
completely shaven but I have a sort of

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.000 
completely shaven but I have a sort of
that<00:04:38.060> like<00:04:38.300> light<00:04:38.750> blonde<00:04:39.230> colored<00:04:39.650> hair<00:04:39.920> on

that like light blonde colored hair on
my<00:04:40.100> arms<00:04:40.400> where<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.700> just<00:04:41.030> doesn't<00:04:41.120> really

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
my arms where it just doesn't really

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.700 
my arms where it just doesn't really
look<00:04:41.570> like<00:04:41.630> hair<00:04:41.900> from<00:04:42.020> a<00:04:42.110> distance<00:04:42.470> but<00:04:42.590> there

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
look like hair from a distance but there

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.800 
look like hair from a distance but there
definitely<00:04:42.830> is<00:04:43.130> hair<00:04:43.400> there<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.690> way<00:04:44.780> that

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
definitely is hair there the way that

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.930 
definitely is hair there the way that
this<00:04:45.080> works<00:04:45.380> is<00:04:45.620> that<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:46.010> works<00:04:46.310> on<00:04:46.550> like

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
this works is that it works on like

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.420 
this works is that it works on like
brown<00:04:47.240> brown<00:04:47.960> hair<00:04:48.260> light<00:04:48.560> brown<00:04:48.770> hair<00:04:48.800> darker

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
brown brown hair light brown hair darker

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.430 
brown brown hair light brown hair darker
brown<00:04:49.610> hair<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.120> black<00:04:50.300> hair<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:50.780> what<00:04:51.320> it

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
brown hair and black hair and what it

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.500 
brown hair and black hair and what it
does<00:04:51.590> is<00:04:51.710> it<00:04:51.860> targets<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.520> pigment<00:04:52.970> in<00:04:53.180> the

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
does is it targets the pigment in the

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.690 
does is it targets the pigment in the
hair<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:54.050> essentially<00:04:54.800> sort<00:04:55.010> of<00:04:55.130> burn<00:04:55.310> up<00:04:55.520> the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
hair to essentially sort of burn up the

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.850 
hair to essentially sort of burn up the
follicle<00:04:56.150> and<00:04:56.390> essentially<00:04:56.960> deactivate<00:04:57.710> the

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
follicle and essentially deactivate the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.260 
follicle and essentially deactivate the
follicle<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:58.370> then<00:04:58.520> by<00:04:58.640> the<00:04:58.700> follicle<00:04:59.090> being

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
follicle and then by the follicle being

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.300 
follicle and then by the follicle being
deactivated<00:04:59.900> you<00:04:59.990> have<00:05:00.170> achieved<00:05:00.560> permanent

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
deactivated you have achieved permanent

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.700 
deactivated you have achieved permanent
hair<00:05:01.820> removal<00:05:01.940> at<00:05:02.480> home<00:05:02.750> but<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:03.410> reason<00:05:03.650> I

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
hair removal at home but the reason I

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.870 
hair removal at home but the reason I
mentioned<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.040> color<00:05:04.250> of<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.520> hair<00:05:04.640> of<00:05:04.760> my

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
mentioned the color of the hair of my

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.850 
mentioned the color of the hair of my
arm<00:05:05.060> is<00:05:05.270> is<00:05:05.480> that<00:05:05.750> I'm<00:05:05.900> going<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.170> just<00:05:06.620> scan

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
arm is is that I'm going to just scan

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.410 
arm is is that I'm going to just scan
over<00:05:07.130> my<00:05:07.340> arm<00:05:07.520> really<00:05:07.760> quick<00:05:07.940> with<00:05:08.090> this<00:05:08.180> laser

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
over my arm really quick with this laser

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.030 
over my arm really quick with this laser
and<00:05:08.570> it<00:05:08.870> won't<00:05:09.020> actually<00:05:09.230> do<00:05:09.650> anything

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
and it won't actually do anything

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.430 
and it won't actually do anything
because<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.150> hair<00:05:11.300> on<00:05:11.390> my<00:05:11.420> arm<00:05:11.660> again<00:05:12.170> as<00:05:12.350> I

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
because the hair on my arm again as I

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.780 
because the hair on my arm again as I
said<00:05:12.500> is<00:05:12.740> sort<00:05:12.920> of<00:05:12.950> like<00:05:13.070> a<00:05:13.130> whitish<00:05:13.550> blonde

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
said is sort of like a whitish blonde

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.990 
said is sort of like a whitish blonde
color<00:05:14.090> so<00:05:14.780> I'm<00:05:14.960> going<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.170> turn<00:05:15.350> it<00:05:15.440> up<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.880> the

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
color so I'm going to turn it up to the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.370 
color so I'm going to turn it up to the
highest<00:05:17.180> setting<00:05:17.420> which<00:05:17.720> is<00:05:17.900> setting<00:05:18.080> number

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
highest setting which is setting number

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.080 
highest setting which is setting number
5<00:05:18.590> just<00:05:18.920> to<00:05:19.010> show<00:05:19.190> you<00:05:19.250> there<00:05:19.550> won't<00:05:19.700> be<00:05:19.760> any

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
5 just to show you there won't be any

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.090 
5 just to show you there won't be any
pain<00:05:20.510> with<00:05:20.720> this<00:05:20.900> but<00:05:21.110> I<00:05:21.170> imagine<00:05:21.590> if<00:05:21.770> the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
pain with this but I imagine if the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.190 
pain with this but I imagine if the
hairs<00:05:22.610> were<00:05:22.880> darker<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:23.660> color<00:05:23.840> would<00:05:24.080> be

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
hairs were darker and color would be

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.410 
hairs were darker and color would be
probably<00:05:25.100> pretty<00:05:25.280> painful<00:05:26.090> so<00:05:26.210> you're<00:05:26.300> going

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
probably pretty painful so you're going

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.640 
probably pretty painful so you're going
to<00:05:26.450> hear<00:05:26.630> a<00:05:26.690> beep<00:05:26.930> and<00:05:27.110> you're<00:05:27.290> going<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.470> see

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
to hear a beep and you're going to see

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.020 
to hear a beep and you're going to see
this<00:05:27.770> light<00:05:28.040> up<00:05:28.220> hopefully<00:05:28.580> you're<00:05:28.700> able<00:05:28.730> to

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
this light up hopefully you're able to

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.340 
this light up hopefully you're able to
see<00:05:29.210> it<00:05:29.300> light<00:05:29.420> up<00:05:29.450> on<00:05:29.660> the<00:05:29.750> skin<00:05:29.960> I'll<00:05:30.110> turn<00:05:30.320> a

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
see it light up on the skin I'll turn a

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.750 
see it light up on the skin I'll turn a
little<00:05:30.470> bit<00:05:32.830> see<00:05:33.830> right<00:05:34.040> it<00:05:34.160> doesn't<00:05:34.430> hurt<00:05:34.550> but

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
little bit see right it doesn't hurt but

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.190 
little bit see right it doesn't hurt but
if<00:05:34.850> I<00:05:34.970> had<00:05:35.120> dark<00:05:35.330> hair<00:05:35.420> right<00:05:35.690> there<00:05:35.900> it<00:05:36.050> would

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
if I had dark hair right there it would

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.320 
if I had dark hair right there it would
hurt<00:05:36.380> because<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:37.010> tried<00:05:37.790> it<00:05:37.820> a<00:05:37.940> little<00:05:38.120> bit<00:05:38.240> on

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
hurt because I tried it a little bit on

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.720 
hurt because I tried it a little bit on
dark<00:05:38.570> hair<00:05:38.720> and<00:05:38.810> it<00:05:38.930> actually<00:05:39.050> it<00:05:39.920> stings<00:05:40.460> kind

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
dark hair and it actually it stings kind

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.610 
dark hair and it actually it stings kind
of<00:05:40.820> feels<00:05:41.030> like<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.330> rubber<00:05:41.480> band<00:05:41.780> snapping<00:05:42.320> but

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
of feels like a rubber band snapping but

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.130 
of feels like a rubber band snapping but
there's<00:05:42.770> also<00:05:42.950> a<00:05:43.100> heat<00:05:43.310> sensation<00:05:43.550> to<00:05:44.060> it<00:05:44.210> and

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
there's also a heat sensation to it and

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.730 
there's also a heat sensation to it and
it's<00:05:45.260> a<00:05:45.320> very<00:05:45.790> sharp<00:05:46.790> acute<00:05:47.390> type<00:05:47.810> of<00:05:47.990> heat

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
it's a very sharp acute type of heat

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.930 
it's a very sharp acute type of heat
sensation<00:05:48.950> for<00:05:49.550> sure

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
sensation for sure

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.810 
sensation for sure
but<00:05:50.120> what<00:05:50.270> you<00:05:50.390> do<00:05:50.540> is<00:05:50.720> you<00:05:50.840> just<00:05:51.760> then<00:05:52.760> you

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
but what you do is you just then you

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.580 
but what you do is you just then you
move<00:05:53.060> it<00:05:53.180> just<00:05:53.360> you<00:05:53.480> pick<00:05:53.750> it<00:05:53.870> up<00:05:53.960> move<00:05:54.290> it<00:05:54.470> just

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
move it just you pick it up move it just

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.010 
move it just you pick it up move it just
a<00:05:54.740> slight<00:05:55.010> bit<00:05:55.220> and<00:05:56.210> you<00:05:56.330> want<00:05:56.570> the<00:05:56.720> actual

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
a slight bit and you want the actual

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.920 
a slight bit and you want the actual
laser<00:05:57.410> area<00:05:58.130> to<00:05:58.400> sort<00:05:58.580> of<00:05:58.640> overlap<00:05:59.030> it<00:05:59.240> overlap

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
laser area to sort of overlap it overlap

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.480 
laser area to sort of overlap it overlap
itself<00:06:00.290> so<00:06:00.470> it<00:06:00.590> takes<00:06:00.770> a<00:06:00.890> little<00:06:01.040> while<00:06:01.220> I

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
itself so it takes a little while I

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.490 
itself so it takes a little while I
believe<00:06:02.120> it<00:06:02.240> to<00:06:02.480> hear<00:06:02.720> if<00:06:02.990> you<00:06:03.080> decide<00:06:03.320> to<00:06:03.350> do

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
believe it to hear if you decide to do

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.990 
believe it to hear if you decide to do
your<00:06:03.650> legs<00:06:03.800> so<00:06:03.980> it<00:06:04.100> takes<00:06:04.280> something<00:06:04.460> like<00:06:04.550> 45

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
your legs so it takes something like 45

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.390 
your legs so it takes something like 45
minutes<00:06:05.390> to<00:06:05.600> do<00:06:05.810> both<00:06:06.620> of<00:06:06.800> your<00:06:06.920> legs<00:06:07.070> but<00:06:07.340> if

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
minutes to do both of your legs but if

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.590 
minutes to do both of your legs but if
you're<00:06:07.520> doing<00:06:07.640> something<00:06:07.760> like<00:06:08.060> armpits

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
you're doing something like armpits

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.750 
you're doing something like armpits
you're<00:06:08.840> talking<00:06:09.140> like<00:06:09.350> 5<00:06:09.530> minutes<00:06:09.770> per<00:06:10.160> armpit

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
you're talking like 5 minutes per armpit

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.000 
you're talking like 5 minutes per armpit
but<00:06:10.970> it<00:06:11.240> takes<00:06:11.480> a<00:06:11.600> little<00:06:11.750> while<00:06:11.960> but<00:06:12.290> for<00:06:12.920> me

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
but it takes a little while but for me

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.560 
but it takes a little while but for me
this<00:06:13.190> kind<00:06:13.400> of<00:06:13.520> at-home<00:06:13.700> stuff<00:06:14.150> is<00:06:14.300> really<00:06:14.450> fun

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
this kind of at-home stuff is really fun

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.270 
this kind of at-home stuff is really fun
so<00:06:14.810> I<00:06:15.080> don't<00:06:15.290> know<00:06:15.350> why<00:06:15.590> you've<00:06:15.800> done<00:06:16.070> you

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.080 
so I don't know why you've done you
couldn't<00:06:16.580> find<00:06:16.760> the<00:06:16.880> time<00:06:16.940> to<00:06:17.270> do<00:06:17.390> it<00:06:21.970> so<00:06:22.970> this

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
couldn't find the time to do it so this

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.460 
couldn't find the time to do it so this
isn't<00:06:23.240> actually<00:06:23.600> going<00:06:23.750> to<00:06:23.900> remove<00:06:24.020> the<00:06:24.320> hair

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470

here then because it's kind of neat like

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.709 
here then because it's kind of neat like
the<00:06:34.309> make<00:06:35.309> cools<00:06:35.669> down<00:06:35.789> the<00:06:36.029> processor<00:06:36.569> here

the make cools down the processor here

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:37.359 
the make cools down the processor here
we<00:06:36.809> go

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:37.369 
we go

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:39.499 
we go
now<00:06:38.369> if<00:06:38.579> you<00:06:38.669> can<00:06:38.789> hear<00:06:38.969> that<00:06:39.119> right<00:06:39.179> only

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:39.509

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:41.939 
turned on for a second because it hadn't

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.579 
turned on for a second because it hadn't
he'd<00:06:42.119> it<00:06:42.239> up<00:06:42.359> too<00:06:42.539> much<00:06:42.569> and<00:06:42.989> then<00:06:43.169> to<00:06:43.289> turn<00:06:43.499> it

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:43.589 
he'd it up too much and then to turn it

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:44.869 
he'd it up too much and then to turn it
off<00:06:43.679> you<00:06:43.829> just<00:06:43.949> hold<00:06:44.219> the<00:06:44.399> power<00:06:44.609> button<00:06:44.669> down

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:44.879 
off you just hold the power button down

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:47.479 
off you just hold the power button down

so<00:06:47.969> I<00:06:48.239> know<00:06:49.019> this<00:06:49.289> wasn't<00:06:49.679> a<00:06:49.709> super<00:06:49.979> fancy

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:50.219
