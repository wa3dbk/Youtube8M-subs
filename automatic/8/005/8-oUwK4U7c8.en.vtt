00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.750 
Zach from line-x of Albuquerque here
today<00:00:07.259> we<00:00:07.410> put<00:00:07.710> in<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.890> cold<00:00:08.099> air<00:00:08.189> intake<00:00:08.580> on

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
today we put in the cold air intake on

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.730 
today we put in the cold air intake on
the<00:00:08.849> shop<00:00:09.059> truck<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.990> we've<00:00:10.230> got<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.440> brand

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
the shop truck and we've got a brand

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.669 
the shop truck and we've got a brand
here<00:00:10.950> called<00:00:11.190> SMB<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.940> like<00:00:12.809> SMB<00:00:13.290> because

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
here called SMB I like SMB because

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.340 
here called SMB I like SMB because
they're<00:00:13.980> made<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> US<00:00:14.700> they<00:00:15.660> fit<00:00:15.929> perfect

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
they're made in the US they fit perfect

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.490 
they're made in the US they fit perfect
every<00:00:16.680> time<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:18.109> kind<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> neat<00:00:19.380> feature

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
every time and kind of a neat feature

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.220 
every time and kind of a neat feature
about<00:00:19.680> SMB<00:00:20.220> they're<00:00:20.400> using<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.970> filter<00:00:21.720> box<00:00:21.960> so

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
about SMB they're using a filter box so

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.740 
about SMB they're using a filter box so
the<00:00:22.410> filter<00:00:22.949> goes<00:00:23.640> inside<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> box<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the filter goes inside of a box and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.359 
the filter goes inside of a box and
that's<00:00:24.869> going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> draw<00:00:25.260> more<00:00:25.590> cold<00:00:25.980> air<00:00:26.189> from

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that's going to draw more cold air from

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.589 
that's going to draw more cold air from
outside<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.029> engine<00:00:27.150> compartment

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
outside of the engine compartment

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.750 
outside of the engine compartment
instead<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.650> drawing<00:00:29.039> hot<00:00:29.310> air<00:00:29.490> from<00:00:29.640> inside

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
instead of drawing hot air from inside

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.759 
instead of drawing hot air from inside
the<00:00:30.060> engine<00:00:30.179> compartment<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.650> these

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the engine compartment and so with these

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.260 
the engine compartment and so with these
guys<00:00:32.009> they've<00:00:32.279> got<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> choice<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.030> dry

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
guys they've got a choice of a dry

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.510 
guys they've got a choice of a dry
filter<00:00:33.660> or<00:00:33.899> oil<00:00:34.230> filter<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.890> we're<00:00:35.309> gonna<00:00:35.399> be

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
filter or oil filter and we're gonna be

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.299 
filter or oil filter and we're gonna be
doing<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> oil<00:00:35.969> filter<00:00:36.329> today<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:37.860> check<00:00:37.950> it

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
doing the oil filter today so check it

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:52.310 
doing the oil filter today so check it
out<00:00:38.370> while<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.610> put<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.879> thing<00:00:39.059> on

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.200 

here's<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.500> finished<00:00:53.830> result<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.460> S&amp;T<00:00:54.910> cold

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
here's the finished result the S&amp;T cold

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:03.780 
here's the finished result the S&amp;T cold
air<00:00:55.360> intake

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.520 

okay<00:01:04.790> now<00:01:04.970> we<00:01:05.030> got<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.390> cold<00:01:05.930> air<00:01:06.080> intake<00:01:06.409> on

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
okay now we got the cold air intake on

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.690 
okay now we got the cold air intake on
the<00:01:06.650> truck<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:06.979> want<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.250> talk<00:01:07.370> just<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:07.670> little

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
the truck I want to talk just a little

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.160 
the truck I want to talk just a little
bit<00:01:07.909> about<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.330> difference<00:01:08.630> between<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.140> oil

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
bit about the difference between the oil

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.440 
bit about the difference between the oil
filter<00:01:09.710> which<00:01:10.340> we<00:01:10.460> put<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:10.760> this<00:01:10.909> truck<00:01:11.210> and

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
filter which we put on this truck and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.320 
filter which we put on this truck and
also<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.200> dry<00:01:12.500> filter<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.580> oil<00:01:13.940> filter

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
also the dry filter so the oil filter

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.120 
also the dry filter so the oil filter
this<00:01:15.140> is<00:01:15.229> going<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.409> be<00:01:15.500> similar<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.860> like<00:01:16.100> a

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
this is going to be similar to like a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.749 
this is going to be similar to like a
cannon<00:01:17.170> where<00:01:18.170> it's<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.530> cotton<00:01:18.860> filter<00:01:19.280> and

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
cannon where it's a cotton filter and

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.120 
cannon where it's a cotton filter and
you<00:01:20.270> can<00:01:20.420> clean<00:01:20.690> it<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:20.960> reuse<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.530> real<00:01:21.740> it

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
you can clean it and reuse it real it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.030 
you can clean it and reuse it real it
and<00:01:23.020> kind<00:01:24.020> of<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.140> benefits<00:01:24.530> of<00:01:24.650> this<00:01:24.800> are

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
and kind of the benefits of this are

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.760 
and kind of the benefits of this are
even<00:01:25.550> as<00:01:25.759> it<00:01:26.030> clogs<00:01:26.660> up<00:01:26.810> with<00:01:26.990> dirt<00:01:27.170> it

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
even as it clogs up with dirt it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.170 
even as it clogs up with dirt it
actually<00:01:28.190> catches<00:01:28.369> dirt<00:01:28.790> all<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.090> way

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
actually catches dirt all the way

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.670 
actually catches dirt all the way
through<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.570> media<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.020> as<00:01:30.170> it<00:01:30.320> fills<00:01:30.530> up<00:01:30.650> with

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
through the media so as it fills up with

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.640 
through the media so as it fills up with
dirt<00:01:30.920> it's<00:01:31.070> gonna<00:01:31.190> still<00:01:31.460> flow<00:01:31.759> just<00:01:32.060> as<00:01:32.180> good

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
dirt it's gonna still flow just as good

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.350 
dirt it's gonna still flow just as good
obviously<00:01:33.650> just<00:01:33.830> just<00:01:34.460> some<00:01:34.670> extent<00:01:35.150> that's

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
obviously just just some extent that's

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.740 
obviously just just some extent that's
true

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
true

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.840 
true
once<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.200> gets<00:01:36.500> too<00:01:36.860> dirty<00:01:37.070> it's<00:01:37.490> gonna<00:01:37.610> slow

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
once it gets too dirty it's gonna slow

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.960 
once it gets too dirty it's gonna slow
down<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.030> flow<00:01:38.330> but<00:01:39.310> theoretically<00:01:40.310> as<00:01:40.610> it

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
down the flow but theoretically as it

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.609 
down the flow but theoretically as it
clogs<00:01:41.210> up<00:01:41.330> with<00:01:41.479> dirt<00:01:41.630> its<00:01:41.840> flows<00:01:42.229> just<00:01:42.500> as

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
clogs up with dirt its flows just as

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.850 
clogs up with dirt its flows just as
good<00:01:43.210> benefits<00:01:44.210> are<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.539> can<00:01:44.660> keep<00:01:44.869> cleaning

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
good benefits are you can keep cleaning

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.290 
good benefits are you can keep cleaning
it<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.070> reusing<00:01:46.580> it<00:01:46.670> over<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:46.970> over<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:47.210> over

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
it and reusing it over and over and over

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.540 
it and reusing it over and over and over
and<00:01:47.479> over<00:01:47.660> again<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.710> downside<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.190> you<00:01:49.430> have

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
and over again the downside is you have

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.130 
and over again the downside is you have
to<00:01:49.670> clean<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:49.910> in<00:01:50.300> order<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.720> reuse<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:50.960> again

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
to clean it in order to reuse it again

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.200 
to clean it in order to reuse it again
so<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:51.560> have<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.039> clean<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.460> put<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.060> right

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
so you have to clean it put the right

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.630 
so you have to clean it put the right
amount<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.509> oil<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:55.009> takes<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.250> little<00:01:55.369> bit<00:01:55.490> of

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
amount of oil it takes a little bit of

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.380 
amount of oil it takes a little bit of
time<00:01:55.820> but<00:01:56.210> kind<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.229> a<00:01:57.289> cool<00:01:57.500> feature<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:59.090> the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
time but kind of a cool feature so the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.200 
time but kind of a cool feature so the
dry<00:02:00.170> filter<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.979> little<00:02:01.520> bit<00:02:01.640> easier<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.090> use

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
dry filter a little bit easier to use

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.260 
dry filter a little bit easier to use
but<00:02:02.890> every<00:02:03.890> time<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:04.130> want<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.640> change<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.179> out

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
but every time you want to change it out

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.999 
but every time you want to change it out
you<00:02:05.390> do<00:02:05.479> have<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.660> buy<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.810> new<00:02:05.869> one<00:02:06.080> so<00:02:06.710> with<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
you do have to buy a new one so with the

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.910 
you do have to buy a new one so with the
dry<00:02:07.190> filter<00:02:07.700> as<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.990> filter<00:02:09.380> clogs<00:02:09.619> up<00:02:09.800> with

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
dry filter as the filter clogs up with

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.850 
dry filter as the filter clogs up with
dirt<00:02:10.099> it<00:02:10.759> catches<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.390> media<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:12.500> catches<00:02:12.770> the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
dirt it catches the media it catches the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.350 
dirt it catches the media it catches the
dirt<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.190> outside<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.640> media<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.090> it

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
dirt on the outside of the media so it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.600 
dirt on the outside of the media so it
will<00:02:14.540> slow<00:02:15.470> down<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.770> flow<00:02:15.980> as<00:02:16.220> it<00:02:16.459> gets

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
will slow down the flow as it gets

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.440 
will slow down the flow as it gets
dirtier<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:19.190> can<00:02:19.400> also<00:02:19.580> blow<00:02:20.030> these<00:02:20.239> off<00:02:20.420> a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
dirtier you can also blow these off a

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.110 
dirtier you can also blow these off a
few<00:02:20.720> times<00:02:20.750> kind<00:02:21.349> of<00:02:21.440> clean<00:02:21.650> them<00:02:21.800> out<00:02:22.120> but

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
few times kind of clean them out but

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.520 
few times kind of clean them out but
eventually<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.110> get<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> new<00:02:24.410> one

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
eventually you do have to get a new one

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.020 
eventually you do have to get a new one
you<00:02:24.560> can't<00:02:24.830> clean<00:02:25.099> it<00:02:25.250> like<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.489> do<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.760> oiled

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
you can't clean it like you do the oiled

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.870 
you can't clean it like you do the oiled
ones<00:02:26.239> so<00:02:27.040> benefits<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.160> this<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.610> little<00:02:28.760> bit

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
ones so benefits of this a little bit

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.910 
ones so benefits of this a little bit
easier<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.180> use<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:30.349> take<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.530> off<00:02:30.680> throw

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
easier to use you just take it off throw

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.500 
easier to use you just take it off throw
it<00:02:31.010> away<00:02:31.099> put<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.489> new<00:02:31.640> one<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.150> downside<00:02:32.480> is

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
it away put a new one the downside is

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.180 
it away put a new one the downside is
you<00:02:32.810> do<00:02:32.930> have<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.230> pay<00:02:33.440> for<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.770> every<00:02:34.010> time

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
you do have to pay for that every time

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.850 
you do have to pay for that every time
and<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.450> replacement<00:02:35.900> filters<00:02:36.170> are<00:02:36.319> about<00:02:36.500> 40

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
and the replacement filters are about 40

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.250 
and the replacement filters are about 40
bucks<00:02:37.010> 45<00:02:38.000> bucks<00:02:38.209> for<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.569> for<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.110> oil

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
filter with the s and B the same you can

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.910 
filter with the s and B the same you can
put<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> dry<00:02:43.280> or<00:02:43.310> an<00:02:43.790> oil<00:02:43.970> filter<00:02:44.209> on<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:44.930> you

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
put a dry or an oil filter on so you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.470 
put a dry or an oil filter on so you
know<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.099> can<00:02:46.340> start<00:02:46.580> with<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.910> dry<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.420> if

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
know you can start with the dry and if

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.850 
know you can start with the dry and if
you<00:02:47.569> don't<00:02:47.720> like<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:48.050> next<00:02:48.379> time<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.739> put

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
you don't like it next time you can put

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.790 
you don't like it next time you can put
a<00:02:48.890> oiled<00:02:49.220> one<00:02:49.400> or<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.239> other<00:02:50.360> way<00:02:50.480> around<00:02:50.800> also

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
a oiled one or the other way around also

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.190 
a oiled one or the other way around also
on<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.400> truck<00:02:52.580> we<00:02:52.730> put<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.000> pre-filter<00:02:53.390> so

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
on this truck we put the pre-filter so

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.350 
on this truck we put the pre-filter so
it's<00:02:54.379> like<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> nylon<00:02:55.250> sock<00:02:55.550> that<00:02:55.790> goes<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.120> over

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
it's like a nylon sock that goes on over

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.660 
it's like a nylon sock that goes on over
the<00:02:56.660> filter<00:02:56.959> element<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.620> that's<00:02:58.220> gonna<00:02:58.430> keep

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
the filter element and that's gonna keep

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.280 
the filter element and that's gonna keep
the<00:02:58.879> big<00:02:59.060> stuff<00:02:59.360> from<00:02:59.750> sticking<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.260> the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
the big stuff from sticking to the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.740 
the big stuff from sticking to the
filter<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:01.030> it's<00:03:02.030> gonna<00:03:02.120> make<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.450> filter

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
filter so it's gonna make the filter

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.360 
filter so it's gonna make the filter
last<00:03:02.959> longer<00:03:03.230> between<00:03:03.410> cleanings<00:03:03.890> or<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.190> dry

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
last longer between cleanings or the dry

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.330 
last longer between cleanings or the dry
filter<00:03:04.700> lasts<00:03:04.940> longer<00:03:05.620> overall<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:07.069> with<00:03:07.220> this

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
filter lasts longer overall so with this

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.250 
filter lasts longer overall so with this
intake<00:03:07.760> on<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.030> truck<00:03:08.239> we've<00:03:09.020> been<00:03:09.110> driving

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
intake on the truck we've been driving

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.479 
intake on the truck we've been driving
around<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.830> while<00:03:09.920> now<00:03:10.129> we're<00:03:10.310> getting

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
around for a while now we're getting

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.059 
around for a while now we're getting
about<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.700> 1/2<00:03:10.940> mile<00:03:11.180> per<00:03:11.359> gallon<00:03:11.420> better<00:03:12.069> but

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
about a 1/2 mile per gallon better but

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.649 
about a 1/2 mile per gallon better but
it<00:03:13.219> is<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.340> really<00:03:13.730> noticeable<00:03:14.060> difference<00:03:14.450> on

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
it is a really noticeable difference on

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.960 
it is a really noticeable difference on
the<00:03:14.900> throttle<00:03:15.319> response<00:03:15.409> and<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:15.950> takeoff

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
the throttle response and the takeoff

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.700 
the throttle response and the takeoff
and<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.180> does<00:03:17.360> add<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.540> little<00:03:17.990> bit<00:03:18.200> of<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.350> deeper

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
and it does add a little bit of a deeper

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.130 
and it does add a little bit of a deeper
throaty<00:03:19.250> sound<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.880> motor<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.450> sounds

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
throaty sound to the motor so it sounds

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.210 
throaty sound to the motor so it sounds
good<00:03:21.290> looks<00:03:21.680> good

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220
