good<00:00:11.110> morning<00:00:11.530> folks<00:00:11.769> when<00:00:12.219> we<00:00:12.340> last<00:00:12.549> spoke

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
good morning folks when we last spoke

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.930 
good morning folks when we last spoke
the<00:00:13.150> incoming<00:00:13.539> northern<00:00:13.990> sunspot<00:00:14.559> group<00:00:14.940> 2381

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
the incoming northern sunspot group 2381

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.760 
the incoming northern sunspot group 2381
was<00:00:16.299> relatively<00:00:16.810> small<00:00:17.289> but<00:00:17.500> it<00:00:17.590> had

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
was relatively small but it had

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.700 
was relatively small but it had
potential<00:00:18.250> then<00:00:18.939> a<00:00:19.210> thousand<00:00:20.140> nano<00:00:20.320> flares

potential then a thousand nano flares

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.490 
potential then a thousand nano flares
later<00:00:21.040> we<00:00:21.610> see<00:00:21.930> unbelievable<00:00:22.930> growth<00:00:23.200> of<00:00:23.410> the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
later we see unbelievable growth of the

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.290 
later we see unbelievable growth of the
active<00:00:23.860> region<00:00:24.099> and<00:00:24.490> we<00:00:24.759> now<00:00:24.910> have<00:00:25.150> an

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
active region and we now have an

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.769 
active region and we now have an
enormous<00:00:25.660> sunspot<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:27.550> Dwarfs<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.599> other

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.870 
the earth facing desk down at the bottom
riding<00:01:09.010> in<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.400> southern<00:01:09.729> hemisphere

beneath the current coronal hole
earthquake<00:01:13.299> watch<00:01:13.539> and<00:01:14.380> maybe<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.520> power<00:01:15.729> we

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
earthquake watch and maybe the power we

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.959 
earthquake watch and maybe the power we
saw<00:01:16.240> disappear<00:01:16.929> yesterday<00:01:17.140> has<00:01:18.039> not<00:01:18.429> returned

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
saw disappear yesterday has not returned

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.480 
saw disappear yesterday has not returned
so<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.719> earthquake<00:01:20.140> activity<00:01:20.320> remains<00:01:21.159> low

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
so the earthquake activity remains low

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.910 
so the earthquake activity remains low
only<00:01:21.759> activity<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.960> report<00:01:22.990> is<00:01:23.590> small

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
only activity to report is small

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.459 
only activity to report is small
strombolian<00:01:24.729> eruptions<00:01:24.909> that<00:01:25.469> actually

strombolian eruptions that actually

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.529 
strombolian eruptions that actually
began<00:01:26.979> when<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.310> three<00:01:27.640> tropical<00:01:28.179> systems

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
began when the three tropical systems

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.630 
began when the three tropical systems
north<00:01:28.929> of<00:01:29.079> it<00:01:29.200> began<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:29.859> vein<00:01:30.039> these<00:01:30.460> are

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
north of it began to vein these are

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.520 
north of it began to vein these are

systems that could affect Hawaii but

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.639 
systems that could affect Hawaii but
we'll<00:01:42.130> keep<00:01:42.310> an<00:01:42.460> eye<00:01:42.579> on<00:01:42.609> those<00:01:43.229> top<00:01:44.229> articles

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889 
will take the satellite out of safe mode

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.700 
will take the satellite out of safe mode
tomorrow<00:01:57.520> but<00:01:57.850> suffice<00:01:58.749> to<00:01:58.810> say<00:01:59.020> there's<00:01:59.530> now

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
tomorrow but suffice to say there's now

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.039 
tomorrow but suffice to say there's now
two<00:01:59.999> interesting<00:02:00.999> reasons<00:02:01.359> to<00:02:01.569> watch<00:02:01.719> this

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
two interesting reasons to watch this

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.010 
two interesting reasons to watch this
