helix<00:01:00.000> Drago<00:01:00.300> hortons<00:01:01.289> kind<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
helix Drago hortons kind of get in the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.410 
helix Drago hortons kind of get in the
way<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.219> got<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> push<00:01:02.730> his<00:01:02.850> head<00:01:03.000> down<00:01:03.059> or

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
way there got to push his head down or

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.529 
way there got to push his head down or
something<00:01:03.629> anyway<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:08.300> copper<00:01:09.300> is<00:01:09.509> a

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
something anyway on the copper is a

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.690 
something anyway on the copper is a
hundred<00:01:10.110> g<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:12.140> gold<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.500> 90<00:01:14.009> g<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
hundred g and the gold is 90 g so the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.889 
hundred g and the gold is 90 g so the
copper<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.149> actually<00:01:15.479> higher<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:16.050> G<00:01:16.320> power<00:01:17.899> as

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
copper is actually higher in G power as

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.320 
copper is actually higher in G power as

really that great I don't like the ones
are<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.429> flip<00:01:38.670> coins<00:01:38.940> because<00:01:39.209> I<00:01:39.360> usually

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
are you flip coins because I usually

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.010 
are you flip coins because I usually
suck<00:01:39.959> at<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.289> and<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:40.950> tails<00:01:41.250> right<00:01:41.520> away

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
suck at that and get tails right away

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.180 
suck at that and get tails right away
but<00:01:43.020> anyway<00:01:45.410> try<00:01:46.410> to<00:01:46.470> employ<00:01:46.709> something<00:01:47.099> off

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190

the<00:01:47.310> desk<00:01:47.489> there<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:49.280> guess<00:01:50.280> that's<00:01:50.429> really

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the desk there I guess that's really

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.430 
the desk there I guess that's really
always<00:01:50.849> safe<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.569> think<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:51.959> think<00:01:52.259> some<00:01:52.410> of

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
always safe I think I just think some of

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.600 
always safe I think I just think some of
the<00:01:52.530> newer<00:01:52.679> ones<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:53.190> think<00:01:53.459> it<00:01:53.520> would

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the newer ones like I think it would

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.219 
the newer ones like I think it would
either<00:01:53.700> topics<00:01:54.270> or<00:01:54.420> valve<00:01:54.660> saver<00:01:54.959> how<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
either topics or valve saver how to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.919 
either topics or valve saver how to
better<00:01:55.530> ability<00:01:55.830> as<00:01:56.130> far<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.459> gangi<00:01:56.970> power<00:01:57.179> for

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
better ability as far as gangi power for

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.889 
better ability as far as gangi power for
pires<00:01:58.319> then<00:01:59.310> flipping<00:01:59.670> coins<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.599> far<00:02:00.810> as

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
yet again coin flips I mean you might I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.840 
yet again coin flips I mean you might I
mean<00:03:27.800> you<00:03:27.860> have<00:03:27.980> a<00:03:28.010> better<00:03:28.280> chance<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.670> this

mean you have a better chance of this
one<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.090> guess<00:03:29.360> since<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:29.780> get<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.380> coin<00:03:30.650> flips

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
one I guess since you get to coin flips

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.530 
one I guess since you get to coin flips
no<00:03:31.040> matter<00:03:31.190> what<00:03:31.519> instead<00:03:32.180> of<00:03:32.239> just<00:03:32.360> flipping

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
no matter what instead of just flipping

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.479 
no matter what instead of just flipping
1<00:03:32.870> tails<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:33.380> getting<00:03:33.620> like<00:03:33.739> zero<00:03:34.040> g<00:03:34.280> power

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
1 tails and getting like zero g power

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.210 
1 tails and getting like zero g power
bonus<00:03:34.760> but<00:03:35.750> yet<00:03:36.110> again<00:03:36.200> i<00:03:36.620> don't<00:03:36.860> think<00:03:37.100> it's

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
bonus but yet again i don't think it's

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.310 
bonus but yet again i don't think it's
that<00:03:37.310> amazing<00:03:37.910> because<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.540> can<00:03:38.660> still<00:03:38.930> flip

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
that amazing because you can still flip

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.930 
that amazing because you can still flip
tails<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:40.040> not<00:03:40.579> get<00:03:40.820> anything<00:03:42.400> so<00:03:43.400> i<00:03:43.430> think<00:03:43.579> it

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
tails and not get anything so i think it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.780 
tails and not get anything so i think it

which on my original jet court was

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.020 
which on my original jet court was
impossible<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.040> get<00:04:16.190> out<00:04:16.220> until<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.730> finally

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
managed to get it that's why I didn't

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.940 
managed to get it that's why I didn't
even<00:04:19.100> realize<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.790> came<00:04:20.000> out<00:04:20.239> but<00:04:21.140> until

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
i have my deca that one just kind of

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.620 
i have my deca that one just kind of
comes<00:04:24.380> out<00:04:24.530> on<00:04:24.710> its<00:04:24.860> own<00:04:24.950> but<00:04:25.730> anyway<00:04:26.030> closing

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
comes out on its own but anyway closing

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.150 
comes out on its own but anyway closing
up<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.940> jet<00:04:28.940> cords<00:04:29.300> flip<00:04:29.630> those<00:04:29.810> back<00:04:30.050> in<00:04:30.290> and

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
up the jet cords flip those back in and

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.260 
up the jet cords flip those back in and
then<00:04:31.700> you<00:04:31.820> want<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.030> fold<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.450> wings<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:32.990> and

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
then you want to fold the wings in and

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.750 
then you want to fold the wings in and
then<00:04:35.270> he'll<00:04:36.169> be<00:04:36.200> pushing<00:04:36.740> so<00:04:36.950> much<00:04:37.190> until<00:04:37.550> cuz

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
then he'll be pushing so much until cuz

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.250 
then he'll be pushing so much until cuz
these<00:04:37.880> things<00:04:38.090> get<00:04:38.300> in<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.419> way<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.960> need

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
these things get in the way so you need

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.250 
these things get in the way so you need
to<00:04:39.350> push<00:04:39.560> those<00:04:39.770> in<00:04:40.040> to<00:04:41.030> keep<00:04:41.210> folding<00:04:41.510> in<00:04:41.840> but

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
to push those in to keep folding in but

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.810 
to push those in to keep folding in but
you<00:04:42.740> actually<00:04:42.980> have<00:04:43.310> to<00:04:43.430> push<00:04:43.640> this<00:04:43.850> part<00:04:44.150> down

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
you actually have to push this part down

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.159 
you actually have to push this part down
first<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.180> then<00:04:47.390> lock<00:04:47.740> each<00:04:48.740> side<00:04:49.160> in<00:04:49.400> and

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
first and then lock each side in and

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.850 
first and then lock each side in and
there<00:04:51.169> you<00:04:51.260> go<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.900> would<00:04:54.230> be<00:04:54.260> jet<00:04:54.620> core

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
there you go so that would be jet core

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.490 
there you go so that would be jet core
and<00:04:55.419> it's<00:04:56.419> pretty<00:04:56.540> much<00:04:56.690> all<00:04:56.900> I<00:04:57.050> have<00:04:57.230> for<00:04:57.260> you
