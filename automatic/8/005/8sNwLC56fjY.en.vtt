00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.950
 hi come, minor poly 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.300
 in this tutorial we will be back in May 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.660
 airways 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.910
 let's start by explaining that 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.650
 basically this part has two parts 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.390
 It is not very complex 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:55.680
 more than anything the complexity goes through 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.340
 to play it with swing with wave and in time is 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.330
 very important 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.420
 and that the notes of the 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:08.290
 strings we are playing in principle 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:11.760
 let's see what we do is a 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:16.520
 kind of 7 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.520
 we do not have to touch a rope down yes 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.680
 and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.130
 good this the first part 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.049
 look that the right hand has to 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.049
 be as relaxed as possible 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.800
 why 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.910
 this is one of the most important things 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.310
 the funk and on the funk guitar and good 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.260
 for part d 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.210
 we have 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.210
 7 but combines with 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.670
 then we go 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.430
 of force 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.060
 What is it 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.060
 crazy mine 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:29.240
 and also to combine with the author 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.240
 then part d would be this 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.730
 well this is all that has to do 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.670
 with the funk guitar and in this theme 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.820
 it does not have too much complexity is more 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.480
 to play it at tempo yes with much wave 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.480
 with a lot of swing 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.350
 this practice as best as possible 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.650
 so you can make them flesh and 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.230
 do as natural as possible 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.319
 I hope tests authors of video subscribe
