00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 and the promised debts are told that 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.029
 I had told them in a previous video that 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.400
 I was going to teach them how to use the spoon 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.170
 Well, here we are going to talk about that in 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.240
 this video I'm going to make you a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.210
 demonstration of how we can list the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.830
 eyelashes is very important so that 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.560
 eyes look bigger then 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.779
 we would have to curl the eyelashes 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.910
 people who no longer have naturally and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.460
 there are others that you have to give them a 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.529
 Aid in the case of my model is 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.380
 has very good lashes very good long 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.420
 and what is very important is to do 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.120
 that the tab 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.550
 lift to make them clear what 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.679
 white of the eye is more exposed 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.690
 then with that we give an effect of eyes 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.570
 bigger very well I here I have a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.920
 eyelash curler that is like type 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.250
 syringe there are some other ways in the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.500
 market and what I'm going to do is go to 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 base lashes means and tips her 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.769
 looking down inside pressed three 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.289
 seconds I open libero again 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.289
 I open libero and I go to the tips 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.510
 and then with that mental look 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.450
 I give a much more eye appearance 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.570
 open because that or the eyelashes is very 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.140
 important to do it in three root steps 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.030
 means and tips to give an appearance 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.180
 natural is very good in the case of 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.070
 rezadores but what about the spoons 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.050
 Personally, I like very much the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.860
 spoons because they give a very 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.320
 natural 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.270
 I'm going to do it in the other eye so that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.270
 see the difference between an eye 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.840
 entered her looking down 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.390
 rizzo 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.860
 What is it that I am doing? 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.680
 pressing the hair I keep it between the 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.350
 video yolk and spoon 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.040
 and what I do is run the spoon over 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.770
 the yolk of medea 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.050
 and you can see the difference 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.050
 between one tab and another 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.110
 with the spoon is made completely 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.650
 curly you have to be careful that you do not 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.000
 you pray so much because suddenly it turns 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.150
 on the tab and that can reach 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.690
 be very short is very important 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.120
 check the tips 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.850
 because that can make the difference in 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.840
 the shape of the eye with the spoon we can 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.390
 reach even the inner part of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.510
 eye through the lacrimal area to be able 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.240
 curl and I'm going to give you a small tip 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.160
 If you have undisciplined eyebrows or 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.950
 that grow up down you can enter with 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.240
 the spoon also to curl the and of this 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.860
 way you're going to give it a very natural shape 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.350
 to the eyebrows and all are very well 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.480
 these eyebrows that grow downwards the 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.100
 laughs as if they were eyelashes and they are 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.100
 perfectly combed 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.410
 and if you do not know how it curls in 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.080
 tabs you can start practicing with 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.280
 your hair very simple you take the tip of the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.370
 hair and as I told them you catch the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.430
 hair between the yolk and the spoon and what 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.250
 what are you going to run is the spoon and look 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.190
 how the form of the 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.030
 hair do not go to pull the eyelashes 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.510
 just pull the spoon and look like that 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.230
 easy 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.230
 you can pray 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.670
 good
