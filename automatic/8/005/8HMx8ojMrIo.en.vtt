00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:36.279 

when<00:06:31.080> arpeggiating<00:06:31.860> I<00:06:31.949> should<00:06:32.129> say

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:41.600

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.810 

they<00:07:07.450> might<00:07:07.750> do<00:07:08.080> that<00:07:08.110> backwards<00:07:08.950> sometimes

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.880 

autumn<00:07:12.820> little<00:07:13.480> top<00:07:15.810> and<00:07:16.810> again<00:07:17.080> you<00:07:17.680> can

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890

autumn little top and again you can
improvise<00:07:18.460> around<00:07:19.060> that<00:07:19.360> idea<00:07:19.950> so<00:07:20.950> we<00:07:21.040> got<00:07:21.190> to

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370 
improvise around that idea so we got to

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.830 
improvise around that idea so we got to
chord<00:07:21.610> progressions<00:07:22.090> that<00:07:22.330> are<00:07:22.450> very<00:07:22.600> similar

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 
chord progressions that are very similar

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.530 
chord progressions that are very similar
and<00:07:23.110> then<00:07:23.680> two<00:07:24.070> ways<00:07:24.280> of<00:07:24.460> playing<00:07:24.880> those<00:07:25.210> chord

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:25.540 
and then two ways of playing those chord

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.540 
and then two ways of playing those chord
progressions<00:07:26.050> it's<00:07:26.800> all<00:07:26.950> gonna<00:07:27.070> be<00:07:27.250> in<00:07:27.280> the

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
progressions it's all gonna be in the

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.730 
progressions it's all gonna be in the
