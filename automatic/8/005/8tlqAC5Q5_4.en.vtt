I need to do is come over here and just

00:00:42.420 --> 00:01:18.130 
I need to do is come over here and just
hit<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> button<00:00:51.440> play<00:00:52.440> some<00:00:52.649> music

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.390 

okay<00:01:20.300> right<00:01:21.300> now<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.380> probably<00:01:22.710> get<00:01:23.250> about

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
okay right now I can probably get about

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.960 
okay right now I can probably get about
60<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.270> 70<00:01:24.720> feet<00:01:25.229> distance<00:01:26.100> between<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> phone

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
60 or 70 feet distance between the phone

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
60 or 70 feet distance between the phone
and<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.330> speaker<00:01:27.870> and<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> sound<00:01:29.010> is<00:01:29.130> still

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and the speaker and the sound is still

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.800 
and the speaker and the sound is still
that<00:01:29.729> clear<00:01:30.979> that<00:01:31.979> has<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.490> pretty<00:01:33.030> much<00:01:33.330> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
that clear that has to be pretty much a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.370 
that clear that has to be pretty much a
straight<00:01:34.410> shot<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:35.010> nothing<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.580> between

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
straight shot with nothing in between

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.410 
straight shot with nothing in between
more<00:01:37.380> realistically<00:01:38.040> i<00:01:38.430> could<00:01:38.550> probably<00:01:38.970> get

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
more realistically i could probably get

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
more realistically i could probably get
about<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.350> 35<00:01:41.190> 40<00:01:41.759> foot<00:01:42.060> distance<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:43.680> people

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
about a 35 40 foot distance with people

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.670 
about a 35 40 foot distance with people
standing<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.270> way<00:01:45.420> or<00:01:45.780> whatever<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.470> it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
standing in the way or whatever and it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.410 
standing in the way or whatever and it
would<00:01:46.920> still<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.850> clean<00:01:48.150> as<00:01:48.270> you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
would still be just as clean as you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.320 
would still be just as clean as you
heard<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:49.789> what<00:01:50.789> are<00:01:50.910> things<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.270> still

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
heard it here what are things I still

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.540 
heard it here what are things I still
need<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.140> I'll<00:01:52.289> probably<00:01:52.470> need<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> go

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
need to do is I'll probably need to go

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.800 
need to do is I'll probably need to go
ahead<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.060> modify<00:01:54.899> those<00:01:55.470> music<00:01:55.950> track<00:01:56.250> files

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
ahead and modify those music track files

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.840 
ahead and modify those music track files
to<00:01:57.810> make<00:01:57.990> them<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.259> little<00:01:58.440> louder<00:01:58.850> because

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
to make them a little louder because

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.760 
to make them a little louder because
even<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> loudest<00:02:01.170> setting<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.590> might

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
even on the loudest setting it might

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.290 
even on the loudest setting it might
just<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.160> a<00:02:02.190> little<00:02:02.460> too<00:02:02.759> low<00:02:02.940> for<00:02:02.970> a

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
just be a little too low for a

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
just be a little too low for a
convention<00:02:04.289> setting<00:02:05.210> but<00:02:06.210> otherwise<00:02:06.690> if<00:02:07.080> this

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
convention setting but otherwise if this

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.940 
convention setting but otherwise if this
was<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.800> straight<00:02:09.619> setting<00:02:10.619> where<00:02:10.800> we

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
was just a straight setting where we

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.380 
was just a straight setting where we
were<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.280> doing<00:02:11.550> something<00:02:11.880> more<00:02:12.030> intimate

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
were just doing something more intimate

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.380 
were just doing something more intimate
you<00:02:12.840> know<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.140> small<00:02:13.730> conference<00:02:14.730> room<00:02:14.940> or

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
you know in a small conference room or

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.190 
you know in a small conference room or
something<00:02:15.840> or<00:02:16.850> in<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.239> small<00:02:18.540> area<00:02:18.840> I

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
something or in just a small area I

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.840 
something or in just a small area I
think<00:02:19.470> these<00:02:19.830> sounds<00:02:20.190> would<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.430> just<00:02:20.670> fine

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
think these sounds would be just fine

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.080 
think these sounds would be just fine
but<00:02:21.420> other<00:02:21.570> than<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:22.730> thank<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.940> for

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
but other than that thank you for

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.190 
but other than that thank you for
