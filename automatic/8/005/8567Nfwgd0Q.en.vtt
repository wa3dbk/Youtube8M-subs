00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
oh yeah I think he definitely does the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.360 
oh yeah I think he definitely does the
only<00:04:07.080> thing<00:04:07.230> that<00:04:07.379> challenge<00:04:07.830> them<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.069> his

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
only thing that challenge them is his

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.039 
only thing that challenge them is his
height<00:04:08.610> I<00:04:08.849> don't<00:04:09.540> think<00:04:09.660> that<00:04:09.720> he's<00:04:09.870> actually

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
height I don't think that he's actually

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.930 
height I don't think that he's actually
that's<00:04:10.319> all<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:10.769> yeah<00:04:11.220> he's<00:04:11.340> not<00:04:11.519> fighting<00:04:11.730> on

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
that's all but yeah he's not fighting on

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.520 
that's all but yeah he's not fighting on
but<00:04:12.180> he<00:04:12.599> can<00:04:12.720> get<00:04:12.810> away<00:04:12.930> with<00:04:13.049> it<00:04:13.260> because<00:04:13.290> he's

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
but he can get away with it because he's

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.080 
but he can get away with it because he's
actually<00:04:13.680> skilled<00:04:14.129> he's<00:04:14.340> quick<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:14.879> he<00:04:14.940> can

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
actually skilled he's quick and he can

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.870 
actually skilled he's quick and he can
shoot<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.569> he<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.709> guy<00:04:16.829> he<00:04:17.100> creates<00:04:17.430> very

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
shoot and he is a guy he creates very

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.759 
shoot and he is a guy he creates very
good<00:04:18.150> space<00:04:18.449> was<00:04:18.660> quick<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:19.350> he<00:04:19.650> has<00:04:19.739> really

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
good space was quick and he has really

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.319 
good space was quick and he has really
good<00:04:20.130> handle<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:20.609> he<00:04:20.789> could<00:04:20.940> create<00:04:21.150> those

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
good handle so he could create those

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.300 
good handle so he could create those
dishes<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.989> get<00:04:22.139> his<00:04:22.229> shot<00:04:22.410> off<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:22.979> think

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
dishes to get his shot off and I think

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.250
