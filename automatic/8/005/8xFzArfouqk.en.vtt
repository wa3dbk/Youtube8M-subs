00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.249
 the company offered 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.419
 after splitting three games fatally one after the other 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.010
 and after brief disappearance the return of prince of Persia could not happen 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.619
 at a better time 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.870
 to new and more powerful platforms in the market 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.489
 to give more breath to the adventures of the prince 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.670
 and we're already talking about a feature film based on the series for 2010 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.980
 when rescuing elements that were most striking in previous games 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.690
 the luck iob decided to restart the saga of the hero 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.409
 the prince is coming back from one of his adventures 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.110
 when I have lost the donkey that bears all the newly acquired riches 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.240
 when looking for the animal to face the beautiful and rich 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.710
 A fugitive princess depends, however, written on the forehead by the girl 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.840
 amazing magic powers 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.920
 I ran to try to keep a creature from the so-called art cloak stuck in a 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.670
 temple nearby 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.929
 the prince then decided to follow the defeat out of sheer curiosity 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.220
 and ends up getting involved in the confusion 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.870
 with the strengthening of armament the two need to explore the regions around 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.649
 of the temple 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.320
 to purify the soil 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.320
 channeling power from land to building 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.640
 even though it seems forced 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.320
 the chemistry between the two protagonists shows the great trump of the game 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.179
 he probably did 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.020
 one of the computer controlled characters 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.800
 most clever and charismatic of recent times 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.070
 your role is key in the game at all times 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.330
 she can help the protagonist perform leads to double jumps and even 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.650
 prevents him from dying 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.969
 That's right, you never die. 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:08.069
 which she always gives a way to save no matter what the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.159
 situation 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.549
 which makes everyone braver 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.030
 the aspect of the game that ended up losing with this story of never dies 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:21.370
 it was the fight, thanks to the intelligence of the developers who 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.510
 punctuated well the appearance of enemies there is a sense of urgency excerpts 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.419
 suspensive 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.670
 about the outcome of battles 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.950
 creating at least some curiosity about what might happen during 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.970
 the duels despite the opening for exploration 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.139
 and the great presence of Alexandre 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.370
 the persie disease controls are quite similar 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.249
 with those of the previous trilogy 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:46.340
 you jump 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.599
 scale ravines 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.829
 turn on posts or astiz 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.900
 and with the davis cup everything like before 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.040
 only in a much lighter intuitive scheme 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.120
 the fighting follows the same guideline 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.009
 with sword attacks and with the hero's new maneuver 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.269
 there is also a button for defense in another to call the league to fight 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.769
 and how they are carried out with small variations of torture 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.050
 if the combats were facilitated until talking comes at least the animations 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.790
 create the illusion that battles are always great causes and disputed 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.199
 speaking of presentation animations is the factor that should cause the greatest 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.379
 estrangement 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.730
 with the so-called snow-filled sky 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.420
 to chew three-dimensional polygons so they look like cartoons 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.420
 need to see if it does not appear even with the previous ones 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.730
 It's cool to give new air 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.150
 especially with the interesting design of characters 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.319
 more dirty than the stool benefited by the good animations 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.489
 the scenarios are also quite distinct and alive 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.410
 before the visual exuberance 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.060
 the audio ends up in the background 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.760
 it is a very discreet skin 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.569
 that punctuated in more tense moments or to give magic but that is little used 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.319
 in other more trivial passages 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.470
 the dubbing also the median 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.039
 especially that of the human hero 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.690
 an ambulance that came from above 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.620
 we must preserve the new beginning 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.919
 for the traditional series of adventures 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.429
 created by jordan matthews in the late 80's 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:26.190
 It's kind of back to origins. 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.259
 lose some of the seriousness of the last games 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.300
 with a lighter climate and a greater focus on exploration 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.009
 with a tasty and intuitive mechanics 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.350
 among the undoubtedly the most significant novelties 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.870
 is the dynamics between the protagonist and there ruin alexa 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.699
 a triumph of characterization 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.890
 and ubisoft artificial intelligence that creates a strong emotional bond 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.559
 and still a bit rare in the world of video games 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.569
 a great revitalization 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.240
 who only sinned because there are few exciting matches 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.009
 under fecundity 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.459
 considerable time of life
