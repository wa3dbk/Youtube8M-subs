00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850 
you a double or a single shot proper
timing<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> grind<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> coffee<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
timing for the grind of the coffee that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.049 
timing for the grind of the coffee that
you<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.340> you're<00:00:35.550> using<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.030> your

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
you have that you're using in your

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.490 
you have that you're using in your
portafilter<00:00:36.570> okay

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
portafilter okay

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.040 
portafilter okay
so<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.070> determines<00:00:38.820> how<00:00:39.120> fast<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.899> going

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so that determines how fast it's going

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.680 
so that determines how fast it's going
to<00:00:40.170> come<00:00:40.320> out<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.770> how<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> grind<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.450> coffee

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
to come out is how you grind that coffee

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.529 
to come out is how you grind that coffee
mm-hm<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.530> grind<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.890> course<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.539> your

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
mm-hm if you grind it course or your

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.389 
mm-hm if you grind it course or your
programming<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:46.350> might<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.620> programmed<00:00:47.190> for

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
programming here might be programmed for

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.639 
programming here might be programmed for
20<00:00:47.670> seconds<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.840> shots<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> be

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
20 seconds but your shots going to be

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.680 
20 seconds but your shots going to be
completed<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.370> 10<00:00:50.550> seconds<00:00:51.030> got<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.420> right

of some sort so shot glasses okay and
then<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.790> program<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.650> only<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:14.250> I

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
then you program and so not only do I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.710 
then you program and so not only do I
have<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.580> worry<00:01:14.909> about<00:01:14.970> my<00:01:15.210> grind<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.600> stuff

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
have the back pressure that that coffee

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.370 
have the back pressure that that coffee
provides<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.180> also<00:01:24.780> coffee<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
provides and also coffee is going to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
provides and also coffee is going to
take<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> little<00:01:25.799> water<00:01:26.040> yes<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.210> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
take a little water yes it's going to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.760 
take a little water yes it's going to
keep<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.659> coffee<00:01:27.960> that's<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.439> keeps<00:01:28.619> them

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
keep on coffee that's what keeps them

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.590 
keep on coffee that's what keeps them
wired<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.130> machine<00:01:29.490> does<00:01:29.729> pre-infusion<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
wired this machine does pre-infusion it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.840 
wired this machine does pre-infusion it
put<00:01:31.140> passively<00:01:31.619> puts<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.009> little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.700> water

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
put passively puts a little bit of water

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.399 
put passively puts a little bit of water
down<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> coffee<00:01:33.600> waits<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.079> couple<00:01:34.350> of

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
down on the coffee waits a couple of

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.260 
down on the coffee waits a couple of
seconds<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.009> I'm<00:01:35.369> actually<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.030> pump

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
seconds and then I'm actually the pump

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.600 
seconds and then I'm actually the pump
kicks<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.750> brews<00:01:36.990> an<00:01:37.140> actual<00:01:37.500> shot<00:01:37.799> okay

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
kicks in and brews an actual shot okay

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.330 
kicks in and brews an actual shot okay
yeah<00:01:39.060> getting<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.380> coffee<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
yeah getting the the coffee is going to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.340 
yeah getting the the coffee is going to
absorb<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.909> certain<00:01:42.060> amount<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.420> water<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.869> so

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
absorb a certain amount of water and so

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.210 
absorb a certain amount of water and so

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
and run it through the filter yeah yeah

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.059 
and run it through the filter yeah yeah
and<00:03:44.000> measure<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:44.959> out<00:03:45.109> just<00:03:45.349> to<00:03:45.470> see<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.890> tip

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
and measure it out just to see the tip

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.160 
and measure it out just to see the tip
see<00:03:46.310> how<00:03:46.549> much<00:03:46.700> water<00:03:47.030> volume<00:03:47.510> we<00:03:47.690> actually

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
see how much water volume we actually

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.009 
see how much water volume we actually
programmed<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:50.299> that's<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.629> thing<00:03:50.810> too

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
programmed you and that's the thing too

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.509 
programmed you and that's the thing too
with<00:03:51.200> these<00:03:51.349> guys<00:03:51.620> is<00:03:51.890> that<00:03:52.099> what<00:03:52.400> you're

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
with these guys is that what you're

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.259 
with these guys is that what you're
programming<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.599> number<00:03:54.349> of<00:03:54.530> rotations<00:03:55.269> yes

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
programming is a number of rotations yes

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.550 
programming is a number of rotations yes
of<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:57.159> little<00:03:58.159> dude<00:03:59.000> right<00:03:59.269> there's<00:03:59.780> a<00:04:00.049> flow

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
of a little dude right there's a flow

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.099 
of a little dude right there's a flow
meter<00:04:00.769> in<00:04:01.069> there<00:04:01.280> that<00:04:01.690> it<00:04:02.690> has<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:02.870> little

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
meter in there that it has a little

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.420 
meter in there that it has a little
magnet<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.620> goes<00:04:03.739> around<00:04:03.890> as<00:04:04.159> the<00:04:04.250> water

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
magnet that goes around as the water

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.890 
magnet that goes around as the water
goes<00:04:04.609> through<00:04:04.640> it<00:04:04.940> okay<00:04:05.299> every<00:04:05.540> time<00:04:05.720> that

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
goes through it okay every time that

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.890 
goes through it okay every time that
magnet<00:04:06.290> goes<00:04:06.440> around<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.890> registers<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:08.690> when

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
magnet goes around it registers so when

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.289 
magnet goes around it registers so when
you<00:04:09.079> program<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:09.890> just<00:04:10.099> remembers<00:04:10.579> like<00:04:11.120> I

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
you program it it just remembers like I

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.870 
you program it it just remembers like I
moved<00:04:11.810> around<00:04:11.959> 150<00:04:12.829> times<00:04:13.069> exit<00:04:13.489> something

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
moved around 150 times exit something

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.000 
moved around 150 times exit something
you<00:04:14.239> accept<00:04:14.419> only<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:15.169> doesn't<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.769> doesn't

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
you accept only it doesn't it doesn't

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.610 
you accept only it doesn't it doesn't
have<00:04:16.099> a<00:04:16.130> clock<00:04:16.510> or<00:04:17.510> it's<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.410> it's<00:04:18.530> not

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
have a clock or it's and it's not

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.060 
have a clock or it's and it's not
measuring<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.450> volume<00:04:20.450> like<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:21.590> sent<00:04:21.829> me<00:04:21.889> for

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
measuring a volume like you sent me for

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.310 
measuring a volume like you sent me for
two<00:04:22.190> ounces<00:04:22.550> but<00:04:23.360> that<00:04:23.570> flow<00:04:23.840> meter<00:04:24.080> goes

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
two ounces but that flow meter goes

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.409 
two ounces but that flow meter goes
around<00:04:24.530> it's<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.860> same<00:04:25.070> rate<00:04:27.490> see<00:04:28.490> this<00:04:28.760> they

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
around it's the same rate see this they

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:45.659 
around it's the same rate see this they
might<00:04:29.630> even<00:04:29.780> overflow

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.620 

so<00:04:46.669> three<00:04:47.540> ounces<00:04:48.080> right<00:04:48.350> yeah<00:04:49.389> so<00:04:50.389> that's

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
so three ounces right yeah so that's

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.960 
so three ounces right yeah so that's
basically<00:04:51.080> about<00:04:51.560> an<00:04:51.710> ounce<00:04:51.919> difference<00:04:52.550> than

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
basically about an ounce difference than

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.670 
basically about an ounce difference than
you<00:04:53.270> know<00:04:53.389> of<00:04:53.720> what<00:04:53.930> kind<00:04:54.139> of<00:04:54.200> stuck<00:04:54.470> with<00:04:54.500> the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
you know of what kind of stuck with the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.190 
you know of what kind of stuck with the
coffee<00:04:54.980> so<00:04:55.730> then<00:04:55.940> you<00:04:56.060> can<00:04:56.210> program<00:04:56.450> your<00:04:56.660> see

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
coffee so then you can program your see

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.440 
coffee so then you can program your see
your<00:04:57.320> single<00:04:57.710> in<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:57.919> same<00:04:58.130> fashion<00:04:58.450> for

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
your single in the same fashion for

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.090 
your single in the same fashion for
whatever<00:04:59.900> amount<00:05:00.260> you<00:05:00.320> want<00:05:00.470> they're<00:05:00.770> three

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
whatever amount you want they're three

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.960 
whatever amount you want they're three
quarters<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.550> an<00:05:01.639> ounce

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
quarters to an ounce

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.730 
quarters to an ounce
yeah<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.389> it'll<00:05:02.510> do<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.780> same<00:05:02.900> thing<00:05:03.260> it's<00:05:03.440> my

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
yeah and it'll do the same thing it's my

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.680 
yeah and it'll do the same thing it's my
volume<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.550> coffee<00:05:04.760> going<00:05:05.030> through<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.389> flow

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
volume of coffee going through that flow

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.300 
volume of coffee going through that flow
meter<00:05:05.930> and<00:05:06.169> it<00:05:06.410> doesn't<00:05:06.710> actually<00:05:06.830> really

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
meter and it doesn't actually really

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.430 
meter and it doesn't actually really
matter<00:05:07.520> let's<00:05:07.910> say<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.180> have<00:05:08.660> two<00:05:08.930> people<00:05:09.139> who

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
matter let's say you have two people who

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.379 
matter let's say you have two people who
use<00:05:09.620> it<00:05:09.830> you<00:05:09.919> like<00:05:10.070> coffee<00:05:10.400> different<00:05:10.910> but<00:05:11.300> you

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
use it you like coffee different but you

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.240 
use it you like coffee different but you
could<00:05:11.570> both<00:05:11.750> do<00:05:11.930> double<00:05:12.200> shots<00:05:12.440> you<00:05:13.040> can

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
could both do double shots you can

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.370 
could both do double shots you can
program<00:05:13.460> either<00:05:13.940> of<00:05:14.270> these<00:05:14.389> for<00:05:14.960> whatever

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
program either of these for whatever

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.469 
program either of these for whatever
different<00:05:16.220> volumes<00:05:16.700> they're<00:05:17.030> just<00:05:17.240> kind<00:05:17.389> of

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
different volumes they're just kind of

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:18.969 
different volumes they're just kind of
giving<00:05:17.660> you<00:05:17.750> a<00:05:17.810> reference<00:05:18.200> this<00:05:18.440> give<00:05:18.620> me<00:05:18.650> cats

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
giving you a reference this give me cats

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.129 
giving you a reference this give me cats
double<00:05:19.430> shot<00:05:19.639> this<00:05:19.910> could<00:05:20.120> be<00:05:20.240> my<00:05:20.419> double<00:05:20.479> why

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
double shot this could be my double why

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.650 
double shot this could be my double why
do<00:05:21.200> I<00:05:21.320> get<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.800> little<00:05:22.010> one<00:05:22.240> you're<00:05:23.240> shorter

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
do I get the little one you're shorter

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.500 
do I get the little one you're shorter
than<00:05:23.690> me<00:05:23.960> yeah<00:05:24.790> okay<00:05:25.790> that<00:05:26.240> was<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.360> good<00:05:26.479> answer

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
than me yeah okay that was a good answer

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.430 
than me yeah okay that was a good answer
I<00:05:26.810> did<00:05:27.700> okay<00:05:28.700> so<00:05:28.729> that<00:05:29.540> is<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.229> sort<00:05:30.410> of

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
I did okay so that is that the sort of

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.740 
I did okay so that is that the sort of
the<00:05:30.950> primer<00:05:31.220> on<00:05:31.520> programming<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:32.600> you're

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
the primer on programming and you're

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:41.430 
the primer on programming and you're
younger<00:05:33.020> than<00:05:33.290> me<00:05:33.440> today<00:05:34.750> only<00:05:35.750> by<00:05:35.870> six<00:05:36.139> months
