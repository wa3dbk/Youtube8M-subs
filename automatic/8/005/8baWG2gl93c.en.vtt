00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 now let's talk about the camera 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.670
 we have the first one on the back 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.410
 cell phone has this 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.080
 metal framing 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 that's 3 2 megapixels but unfortunately it 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.960
 no autofocus 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.430
 but unfortunately in this case the phone 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.840
 the word hardly fits because it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.500
 rather, a business phone is a camera in such 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.600
 In principle, the phone doesnâ€™t really 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.700
 need nevertheless need to say about that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.550
 how is navigation going where is she 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.930
 separate keys start 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.190
 naturally on rather unnatural a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.180
 There is no to run the camera application 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:56.760
 so you have to run through the menu 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:01:00.270
 here here is the camera app we 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.980
 now hit the menu here's how you see 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.329
 after a few seconds disappears 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.110
 completely all and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.290
 means about the activation of the upper or lower 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.150
 keys we can choose either photo mode 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.110
 In this case, the photo mode is either 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.380
 video mode that tells us here here 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.170
 ikonochka photo mode, you can select the menu 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.900
 as you can see you can switch mode 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.490
 work, that is, daytime shooting 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.840
 shooting to put on some kind of something 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.540
 after some time 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.280
 run and here I understand it 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.020
 binding to the map here infa we have here 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.220
 this is the information that is in 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.020
 Russian version will be in Russian 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.049
 language 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:52.530
 accordingly we exit again we exit 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:56.399
 further in the camcorder what functions do we have 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.210
 there is again a night mode 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.200
 there is means sending by m m with that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.079
 There he apparently writes 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.820
 in that quality which will be acceptable 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.470
 to send by m and with actually 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.849
 disable this feature 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.430
 next we turn on or off 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:17.950
 I mean, turn off the microphone or 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:22.050
 turn on the sound there are hints very 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.530
 convenient and actually go out 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.240
 you can close and see how we have from 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.830
 everything is done well, for example, with keys 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:35.370
 left and right, you can adjust the brightness 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:40.610
 and the actual zoom is likely to be 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.610
 work on yes you see for example 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.629
 fourfold come down on digital here 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:54.189
 take a picture of how you can 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:56.799
 For example, we correct somewhere we press 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.599
 on the central button and actually 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.790
 we can be removed 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.689
 can be sent either apparently assigned to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.760
 some kind of contact that's why we are 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:11.049
 so delete and go back 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.290
 the camcorder acts like this 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.290
 principle 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.310
 recording takes place 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.260
 stop and on our screen should 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.000
 the action will be displayed or play or 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.890
 send either delete or return 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.700
 back here we can periodically 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.700
 lose 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:44.520
 This is how a camera is presented here. 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:52.040
 I repeat that he has a sensor 3 and 3 2 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:52.040
 megapixels without autofocus like this
