00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.289
 Hello and welcome to Hellmich in July 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.049
 our topic today is sick the 3 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.070
 I prepared him for some tips and tricks 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.570
 which I hope will help 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.390
 to improve today 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.429
 for demonstration purposes I use his field 47 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.589
 the shown tricks functionary Daraa actually with each assault rifle to 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.340
 Example also with a methodology 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.310
 When abomination fires off with an assault rifle looking at los fires 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.310
 she is usually like this 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.089
 after all, Krauss would have to be proven because you can see well 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.739
 are the bullet holes this is the most cordial against a real opponent 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:49.870
 would have played 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.110
 I would probably go too 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.110
 Capitain maybe a more sustainable 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.670
 So what do you do? 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.080
 To make it short 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.560
 you take a break for flight operations or you just shoot him 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.720
 numbers 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.200
 that looks like it looks like this 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 Deuce 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.950
 dpa 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.950
 until 12 one or two shows 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.899
 with a good 7 5 percent 51 percent and are just under a year 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.820
 and when he is targeted to the head 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.300
 he already gives a shot to kill 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.829
 he is allowed to pull the body 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.829
 2 are sufficient but they are not a protective vest 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.240
 you need about 3 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.259
 SIAG and that will be and practically demonstrate now 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.139
 which animal Lampre Fortier I have my board for testing purposes quiet 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:51.390
 posed 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.350
 you could have the one with there then fit on port men could and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.820
 mostly from Alberts Chrysler Bartz 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.960
 Of course this only works if he has his own school time human 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.030
 players 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.969
 It's important with Dakar 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.400
 To keep calm 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.020
 even if it is actually an assault rifle or a heart attacking one 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.869
 that would be in Alice Rivlin before it 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.629
 Capital is a very tactical game 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.269
 That's why it's important to stay calmly wrong 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.329
 Those who reached the year again expected that would probably look like this 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:30.329
 I'll see if she's better looks good at last and you instead of for 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.879
 the run was just short 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.089
 a short time the 2 5-fold on ca and there is something awkward cockpit 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:40.850
 you are a scandal faster 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.849
 and even the mind meets art twice 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.789
 make a total of maybe 30 to 36 he seems lucky 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.399
 gives their performances 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:53.589
 that is especially as a beginner of a very good car now i will show you how 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.010
 from the previous US to tackle in front of him 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.949
 or capitalize 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:02.579
 as he already showed me SchieÃŸler day a light trot 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:04.930
 if he is so 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.449
 Animal lovers do not stand a case 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:12.089
 then you have the party a mouse and thus the weapon 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.950
 easy 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.759
 he is pulling down 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.889
 South Courier also concentrate a very small area 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.849
 Sorg 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.849
 we see what they have made a big mistake 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.189
 the copies are the weather inconspicuously unplanned 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.239
 why is that? 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.669
 very easily 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.039
 the aka is a weapon with a huge recoil 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.469
 so it is important to take a break every three or four shots 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.559
 I will wash it again with a fresh market 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.480
 Who concentrate the balls on an extremely small area 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.760
 another system that can use very quickly 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.029
 is the so-called 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.249
 So who is an emergency with the standard pistol of the terrorist brush 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:15.139
 In the game initially there was more Dr Counter Terror it is important to learn 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.669
 it is activated by clicking the right mouse button 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.879
 what is really space before 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:26.550
 This Schiestl celebrate as normal normal Ford models shoot at that 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.129
 but several balls on one for example here in normal mode 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.840
 each closes a ball 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.080
 if necessary 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.900
 this is to High Court 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.740
 what is better now 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.740
 Crap that depends on it 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.939
 if he enters at a long distance 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.409
 we rake that celebrates 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:54.599
 who see here 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.069
 only bring relatively little 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:01.990
 that shows he shoots possible and Klopp's revenge 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.330
 the cover just as it asserts works in the marketers this 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.309
 but better 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.309
 even long distances with the single shot mode 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.080
 now have the lips 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.520
 It is very different on a DAX event 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.199
 hir dpa 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.759
 Luxury alien to many shots he had at his good 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:30.109
 because that would reduce much faster before here in Dirty damage 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.289
 when the fire had to be 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.189
 it looks different 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.659
 two shots and he is dead 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.599
 This is especially in the beginning and Dr where all maximum with time the deans 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:41.310
 circulate 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.060
 but only really FC Leschede notes only stupid I'll stop it 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.380
 some small sermons demonstrate his style of play 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.869
 However, it is important that all possible hiding places are always fast here 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:58.869
 abchecken 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:06.509
 here's just describing Klein's opponent for brief information only 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.509
 Play for demonstration purposes against two punks 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:15.639
 In concrete terms, it is important when he leaves 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.780
 to act fast but never lose control or peace 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.400
 secondly, only briefly 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.770
 that always sees reload begot Bangert 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.020
 However, it does not exaggerate to say that he is still against Wieandt's best years 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.020
 Annoyances are after suffering and thus be surprised 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.010
 it is best simply 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.249
 to represent each killed and if you yourself 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.729
 the climate Deuce 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.360
 reloading and that we consistently like each other 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.710
 It is said and often forgotten by beginners 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.830
 is the waiting bench 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.100
 Every time I have some form of temporary work, he is a gun 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:01.629
 she uses it purely 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.629
 who i am as i am briefly being used here 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:11.669
 before it lands here it is much easier to get to the gun fast 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.259
 especially later he has quite a bit of money should you consider his second 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:21.319
 hides that SAP which paralyzes him 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:26.960
 this is available at 1 2 so to speak fractions after significant damage 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.249
 even if you pull upside down with a fifth of red 

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:32.580
 and most of all it's pretty fast too 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.699
 as her after the animal has the little magazine 

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:39.020
 However, we said we are just getting excited with her game getting in 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.319
 Last but not least a small preview of my new team 

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:47.580
 a weapon that they are due to the change generally is not the most time 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.710
 all 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.469
 especially the smaller ones 

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:56.389
 that's all the Stechert and the whole celebration start the bankruptcy pull Jan Zier 

00:07:56.389 --> 00:08:00.409
 Custody underestimated because she's too weak to phone but I can not 

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:04.759
 For example, he has denied these to the most precise weapons
