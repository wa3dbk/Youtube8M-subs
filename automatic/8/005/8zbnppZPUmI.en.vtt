00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.630 
partner altitude where we are at is
about<00:03:59.470> 980<00:04:00.400> feet

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.740 

so<00:04:07.150> we're<00:04:07.300> near<00:04:07.570> boil<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.410> Bayou<00:04:08.620> burner

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
so we're near boil on the Bayou burner

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:26.680 
so we're near boil on the Bayou burner
respect<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.840> be<00:04:10.960> hidden<00:04:11.200> at<00:04:11.320> any<00:04:11.470> time

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.640 

we<00:04:27.170> are<00:04:27.350> 13<00:04:27.830> minutes<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.430> 59<00:04:29.270> at<00:04:29.900> 14<00:04:30.440> minutes

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
we are 13 minutes and 59 at 14 minutes

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.410 
we are 13 minutes and 59 at 14 minutes
we'll<00:04:30.890> call<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.490> worry<00:04:31.760> got<00:04:31.910> a<00:04:31.940> rolling

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
we'll call it and worry got a rolling

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.510 
we'll call it and worry got a rolling
boil<00:04:32.630> here<00:04:33.020> in<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.260> Bayou<00:04:33.650> Classic

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.040 

according<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.360> temperature<00:04:39.690> probes

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
according to the temperature probes

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.159 
according to the temperature probes
about<00:04:40.379> 280<00:04:40.979> degrees<00:04:41.509> maybe<00:04:42.509> a<00:04:42.690> calibration

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
about 280 degrees maybe a calibration

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.869 
about 280 degrees maybe a calibration
issue<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:43.770> just<00:04:43.979> may<00:04:44.129> be<00:04:44.160> where<00:04:44.460> we<00:04:44.550> reach<00:04:44.729> a

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
issue that just may be where we reach a

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.940 
issue that just may be where we reach a
boil<00:04:45.979> six<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.099> a<00:04:47.159> half<00:04:47.190> gallons<00:04:47.669> of<00:04:47.759> water
