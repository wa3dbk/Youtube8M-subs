bucks and their home base forty inches
forty<00:03:14.859> inches<00:03:15.189> is<00:03:15.400> not<00:03:15.599> Chris<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:17.200> bigger<00:03:17.439> one

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
forty inches is not Chris the bigger one

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:25.309 
forty inches is not Chris the bigger one
the<00:03:18.249> 15<00:03:18.760> inch<00:03:18.939> one<00:03:19.239> or<00:03:19.510> whatever<00:03:19.870> was<00:03:20.139> a<00:03:20.169> a<00:03:21.090> DLP

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.839 

the<00:03:26.319> biggest<00:03:26.769> ones<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.159> they<00:03:27.370> had<00:03:27.579> in<00:03:27.730> the

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
the biggest ones that they had in the

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.379 
the biggest ones that they had in the
flatscreen<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:28.599> think<00:03:28.829> were<00:03:29.829> uh<00:03:30.099> for<00:03:31.030> forty

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
flatscreen so I think were uh for forty

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.059 
flatscreen so I think were uh for forty
to<00:03:31.540> two<00:03:31.569> inches<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.469> it<00:03:32.530> would<00:03:32.650> be<00:03:32.769> two<00:03:32.919> inches

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
to two inches so it would be two inches

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.520 
to two inches so it would be two inches
bigger<00:03:33.400> but<00:03:34.239> they<00:03:34.359> were<00:03:34.419> more<00:03:34.750> money<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:35.500> that

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
bigger but they were more money so that

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.729 
bigger but they were more money so that
two<00:03:35.889> inches<00:03:36.219> in<00:03:36.430> army<00:03:37.169> theaters<00:03:38.169> that<00:03:38.260> you<00:03:38.379> can

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
two inches in army theaters that you can

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.399

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
either buy that 42 or the Hori but the

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.030
