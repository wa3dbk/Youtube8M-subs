00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that row and we can have a an L gonna

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.620 
that row and we can have a an L gonna
leave<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.130> bate<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.790> into<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.030> vanishes

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
leave it a bate just into that vanishes

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.050

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
so we can do a repeat of the L otherwise

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.550 
so we can do a repeat of the L otherwise
it<00:01:57.210> obviously<00:01:57.509> take<00:01:57.689> us<00:01:57.840> on
