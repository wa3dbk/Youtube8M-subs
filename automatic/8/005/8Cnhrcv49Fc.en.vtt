00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.800
 hair loss to a degree higher than what one is used to 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.230
 that is, more than 50 hairs would have been a worrying problem 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.470
 so it does not seem to see young people look older in a few months and adults 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.980
 especially if we talk about women 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.179
 it produces emotional instability they can even get 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.349
 appear depressions today professor pablo see 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.930
 he will focus on this topic of female alopecias the protocol 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.610
 Berber featured hematologist 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.390
 in the air thank you for joining us and pleasure of not being here ricardo don 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.090
 Paul are different causes of hair loss in women who 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.240
 in men v 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.570
 there are some differences but there are many that are very common I would say that it was 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.839
 The biggest difference is that women dominate 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.450
 link the hormonal androgenic problems 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.460
 men also n 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.859
 but it's real 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.159
 not most I repeat can be given what we have not done is to say the other guy 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.460
 cicatricial alopecia areata 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.310
 therefore in him 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.340
 the small differences are 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.420
 I suppose bonuses 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.970
 doctor pablo umbert who has you in front of your query as a whole 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.030
 A lady 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.090
 that comes with a sachet and in that requested and 100 hair that tells you that 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.190
 They are 100 hairs that landed that same day thought they are of the day 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.560
 how to reconduct this visit 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.520
 I just have to drive the road 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.530
 because it's going to be difficult to convince her if it's going to be difficult 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.860
 it's going to be difficult because she has a certainty what it is before this does not happen 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.160
 it did not happen to him and that the certainty that when he goes to the fight he has to take all the 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.350
 hair because if not the ua does not run and this before did not happen for other two are 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.700
 the evidence 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.210
 because I have to say that despite these evidences it can be no 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.080
 by the hair at certain times of the year can fall more even up 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.630
 200 hairs there is a person who has a lot of hair in the introduction has 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.760
 said 50 horses these were not even case 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.180
 tecos few hairs 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.780
 but what I say a lot of hair 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.030
 It can be up to 200 horses 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.619
 the important thing she a series of questions and you stop fanny jara the cicr 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.599
 sick read 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.699
 pay attention and despite believing in me 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:13.849
 and like in this time today 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.979
 Real Diarte 14 March 15 of last year as it was sta 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.020
 man with more or less the same and two years ago a little less 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.300
 Well, see this 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.679
 for its sea 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:26.299
 therefore this is not so important anymore 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.979
 then as I speak I do the putter, I pick up my hands like that and if I have left 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.809
 More than five hair whipping the hair 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.569
 Well, here came the effluvium, there's something here that does not fall out any less. 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.679
 well do not give much importance sergio progressed his five deaths is well 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:44.649
 those desires that it takes on that to say that I want we have other techniques for 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:47.049
 example asked - looms on the head 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.779
 in four days the 4 4 ​​times separated by 24 hours 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.049
 they do not pick up an envelope 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.349
 and I'm going to quantify if what you have to do is add quantify 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.959
 we look at what types of you that are you if they are short and have more or less 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:02.680
 length 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.999
 even using this diagnosis there 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.079
 and all that said diagnosis I can tell you what is going to happen what 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.549
 must do is eta 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.620
 the tips are the knowledge of Professor Pablo Umbert and Millet is 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.689
 Professor of countless dermatologists trained in their dermatology department 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.099
 in the university hospital sacred heart unit oz between the university 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.259
 from Barcelona, ​​as you know, also works as a director at the institute 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:29.349
 dermatológico pablo a baby located in the corachán clinic in barcelona 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.139
 piqué drought announced the peacock see the perfume blond 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.280
 efe this differential is a president aló says 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.760
 the effluvium even though the patient who really does this hand and you 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.840
 there are ten first places in which although the patient has 200 400 letters 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.780
 weights another hundred people 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.449
 therefore it is like a fall of the leaf so that you understand it the autumn uu 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.839
 this can sometimes be physiological and lasts about two months but 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:56.059
 yes it is persistent 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.729
 you have to inquire 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:00.869
 most often this can be after a delivery for example the 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:02.909
 postpartum telogen effluvium 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.709
 this may also be the effluvium produced by what medications 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:11.549
 sometimes even blessed you have to look if san angelo telogen cixtec hair 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:12.639
 what fell 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.779
 in several museums and halls that not that it does not have san angelo which is the 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:17.049
 horse we can say 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.459
 the one that grows strong before the uc in the hair that is going to die but that 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.159
 normal is that they are strangers the hair with that 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.219
 these can be by medications 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.419
 it may be because of the fever it can be by cytostatic 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.070
 can be stopped by for example minoxidil according to what 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.990
 medicines 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.650
 or the stop of treatments for example contraceptive spaces 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.850
 only so much we have to look at microscopic gestures but without looking at them and 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.159
 these are easy 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.569
 with the hair, when they saw the leaf 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:45.900
 and quickly put 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.099
 exactly 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.809
 percent to close without diagnosis you do not like the fall of the leaf not 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:54.719
 because they are many horses that fall and that are also quequén hair 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.879
 Punctually censorship is a specific problem such as, for example, 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:58.629
 pregnant 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:02.529
 for pregnant always this happens after three months sanchez de cabeza 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:03.750
 aggression of this type 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.570
 curiously the answer is not like the slap that gets the red face 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.060
 he needs three months says he always 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.979
 you have to look at what atom drugs 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.279
 in the arm it has it very well with the arm of course better to the hair 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:19.280
 after three months there is a loss three hair fall caps is a 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.569
 success of the dermatologist because on its own it will improve percent after 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.650
 Give anything placebo or placebo treatment p lima perú jorge saad 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.699
 in the laboratory as always fundamental tests for 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:36.309
 accurate diagnosis I would tell you as always more experience - tests 1 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:41.099
 I do what many do I doubt about what I said agustí costantes spc short 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.679
 a surface of 2 centimeters and after two days with digital system we can 

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:45.490
 quantify 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.840
 and after six months 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.020
 to quantify the response to treatment 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.440
 and then of course there are two theses that you always have to do especially that you 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.199
 they can deceive that they are deceitful 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.200
 what is the guy has divism 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.610
 and then in the woman the iron problems
