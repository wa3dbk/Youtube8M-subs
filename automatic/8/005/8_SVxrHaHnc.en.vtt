00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
identical in construction except the 43

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.730 
identical in construction except the 43
has<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.250> floodgate<00:00:17.850> built<00:00:18.840> into<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> wetsuit

so<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.310> 43<00:00:20.699> we're<00:00:20.820> going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> take<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
so this is the 43 we're going to take a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.810 
so this is the 43 we're going to take a
look<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.350> has<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> floodgate<00:00:22.980> which

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
look at and this has a floodgate which

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.550 
look at and this has a floodgate which
means<00:00:24.060> an<00:00:24.210> extra<00:00:24.449> piece<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.750> neoprene<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
means an extra piece of neoprene in the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.920 
means an extra piece of neoprene in the
back<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.760> event<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.210> water<00:00:27.539> floods

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
back and in the event that water floods

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.720 
back and in the event that water floods
through<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> zipper<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:29.340> actually

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
through the zipper this actually

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.299 
through the zipper this actually
protects<00:00:30.510> your<00:00:30.750> back<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.230> allows<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.130> water

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
protects your back and allows the water

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.760 
protects your back and allows the water
to<00:00:32.460> drain<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.600> these<00:00:33.780> two<00:00:33.989> pinholes<00:00:34.290> so

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
to drain out of these two pinholes so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.130 
to drain out of these two pinholes so
that<00:00:34.920> only<00:00:35.130> comes<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.700> 4-3<00:00:36.210> version<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
that only comes in the 4-3 version the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
that only comes in the 4-3 version the
32<00:00:37.590> doesn't<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:38.969> otherwise<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
32 doesn't have this but otherwise the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.660 
32 doesn't have this but otherwise the
two<00:00:39.809> are<00:00:39.960> identical<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.649> construction<00:00:41.309> so

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
two are identical in construction so

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.150 
two are identical in construction so
this<00:00:42.270> video<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.629> perfect<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.710> you're<00:00:43.860> looking

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
the wetsuit this is the the furnace

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.770 
the wetsuit this is the the furnace
lining<00:05:55.770> and<00:05:55.889> so<00:05:56.310> is<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.610> red<00:05:56.849> and<00:05:57.120> what<00:05:57.659> it

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
does is again water hits it wicks it

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.430 
does is again water hits it wicks it
away<00:05:59.819> a<00:06:00.060> couple<00:06:00.509> other<00:06:00.780> things<00:06:00.870> that<00:06:01.139> you<00:06:01.229> can

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
see while we're looking at this is

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.839 
see while we're looking at this is
you've<00:06:03.810> got<00:06:03.990> extra<00:06:04.469> reinforcement<00:06:04.680> a<00:06:05.400> welded

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
that you can keep so that you actually

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.860 
that you can keep so that you actually
extra<00:06:10.800> durability<00:06:11.130> on<00:06:11.550> the<00:06:11.699> seams<00:06:12.000> you'll<00:06:12.659> see

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
extra durability on the seams you'll see

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.379 
extra durability on the seams you'll see
spot<00:06:13.199> taping<00:06:13.740> on<00:06:13.889> critical<00:06:14.460> cross<00:06:14.759> seams<00:06:15.120> and

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
spot taping on critical cross seams and

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.629 
spot taping on critical cross seams and
again<00:06:15.990> that's<00:06:16.469> to<00:06:16.770> actually<00:06:17.130> help<00:06:17.310> build

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
again that's to actually help build

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.219
