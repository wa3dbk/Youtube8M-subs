00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:20.450
 Today is the former Olympic Japan representative forest forest 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:25.250
 Also Thank you for seeing the athlete project Morita venue straight today 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:32.770
 The point of today's video is here 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.770
 I think if you can work on daily practice while being aware of the points of this video 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:41.420
 Today I will introduce how to move eyes 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:46.159
 But it is about Econo King eyes 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:52.370
 I think that poured into that head when stretched before hand 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:53.870
 also, but we will like to introduce at Ha Aakono video delivery go over a body weight 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.210
 It is surprisingly 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.410
 And it has changed hands this way with a jerk the head twisting manner from the beginning 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:07.020
 I turn my head back home too 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.200
 And it has changed hands not the case because it is often put away 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.970
 So strongly head of that reason to extend before the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:20.729
 You don't have to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.400
 The position of the eyes gradually and gradually towards the back 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.470
 a 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:30.580
 It comes with a natural and head by'll go down this way As you can see this 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:36.970
 Again not a jerk To Izumo body movement of the head, of course in the previous bear was doing 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:38.440
 But this is a little bit more or less sport eye or Ted color nature before 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.420
 It makes it easier to go 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.540
 So everyone would also go for confirmation 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.630
 If for constant because it is the sitting state 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:56.899
 Just put your eyes down without putting your head in this posture little by little from this posture 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.420
 Easy to go to the front of the nature and body and I'll do all the time receiving the hole of or toward the lower 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.350
 I think I can see where 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.409
 If you try to do creative action in water 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.619
 Because nature and hand become easy to grow 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:14.879
 Doting a fairly long distance chase form Toka 200 of Hiromi or well so 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.130
 Although it is so even a personal medal player of a little brisk distance type now 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.580
 a 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.090
 If you are conscious of it without number 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.390
 But it will be easier to grow forward and weight 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.270
 A person who should be aware of a kind of weight 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.350
 Carried out by all means it will be easier to make the the of about clean one will extend at the shoulder blade 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.900
 I see 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:42.150
