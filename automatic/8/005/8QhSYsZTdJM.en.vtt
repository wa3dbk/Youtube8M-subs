know how to turn it off and stuff like
that

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
that

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.970 
that
so<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.470> setting<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.189> talking<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.580> is

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
so the setting that I'm talking about is

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.509 
so the setting that I'm talking about is
CL<00:00:26.060> underscore<00:00:27.060> baba<00:00:27.510> mount<00:00:27.930> lat<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.949> vert

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
lat

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.139 
lat
is<00:00:30.859> lateral<00:00:31.859> invert<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.059> vertical<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:35.149> when

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
is lateral invert is vertical so when

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.100 
is lateral invert is vertical so when
you<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.540> those<00:00:37.110> two<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:38.329> pretty<00:00:39.329> much<00:00:39.540> your

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
you have those two on pretty much your

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.950 
you have those two on pretty much your
character<00:00:41.010> bobs<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> side<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
character bobs to the side and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.380 
character bobs to the side and
vertically<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.340> when<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.030> move<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:47.390> right

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
vertically a lot when you move so right

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
vertically a lot when you move so right
now<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.079> set<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.350> zero<00:00:50.219> or<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> think

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
now I have it set to zero or I think

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.670 
now I have it set to zero or I think
it's<00:00:50.910> zero<00:00:51.149> point<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> lowest<00:00:52.199> but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it's zero point one is the lowest but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.459 
it's zero point one is the lowest but
that's<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.129> barely<00:00:53.520> noticeable<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.870> when

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
that's like barely noticeable so when

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.450 
that's like barely noticeable so when
you<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:56.070> shift<00:00:56.820> around<00:00:57.090> corners<00:00:58.129> your<00:00:59.129> scope

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you like shift around corners your scope

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
you like shift around corners your scope
doesn't<00:00:59.879> move<00:01:00.120> all<00:01:00.300> over<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> place<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.020> when

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
doesn't move all over the place and when

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.650 
doesn't move all over the place and when
you're<00:01:01.440> moving<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.789> there's<00:01:03.300> still<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
you're moving like there's still the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.800 
you're moving like there's still the
blur<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.400> lot<00:01:05.580> easier<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.360> stop

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
blur but it's a lot easier to just stop

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.469 
blur but it's a lot easier to just stop
and<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.500> already<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> center<00:01:08.479> whereas

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
and it's already at the center whereas

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.039 
and it's already at the center whereas
if<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.770> settings<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:12.049> CEO

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
if you have the settings on CEO

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.670 
if you have the settings on CEO
underscore<00:01:13.710> baba<00:01:14.070> mount<00:01:15.290> lat

underscore baba mount lat
2<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> maximum<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:19.710> moves<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.659> lot<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
2 is the maximum it moves a lot to the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200 
2 is the maximum it moves a lot to the
sides<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.830> then<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> wait<00:01:23.759> until<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
sides and then you have to wait until it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570 
sides and then you have to wait until it
resets<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> center<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.400> don't

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
resets at the center and you don't

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
resets at the center and you don't
really<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.000> sense<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.750> where<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> center

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
really have a sense of where the center

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.289 
really have a sense of where the center
is<00:01:28.650> when<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.280> setting<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.850> because

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
is when you have this setting on because

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
is when you have this setting on because
it's<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.630> crazy<00:01:31.140> movement<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> sides

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
it's just crazy movement to the sides

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.730 
it's just crazy movement to the sides
and<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:33.240> oh<00:01:33.420> where's<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> center<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.590> then

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
and like oh where's the center and then

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.149 
and like oh where's the center and then
wait<00:01:35.729> until<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:37.079> resets<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.829> then<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.040> can

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
wait until it resets and then you can

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.460 
wait until it resets and then you can
actually<00:01:38.670> shoot<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.500> vertical<00:01:41.240> is

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
actually shoot so then the vertical is

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.789 
actually shoot so then the vertical is
the<00:01:43.470> opposite<00:01:43.890> pretty<00:01:44.100> much<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:46.250> dirt<00:01:47.250> -<00:01:48.799> this

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
the opposite pretty much so dirt - this

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.670 
the opposite pretty much so dirt - this
is<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.610> crazy<00:01:51.060> vertical<00:01:51.990> movement<00:01:52.409> which<00:01:52.530> is

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
is just crazy vertical movement which is

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.830 
is just crazy vertical movement which is
even<00:01:53.159> worse<00:01:53.340> because<00:01:53.369> you're<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.180> oh<00:01:54.329> how

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
even worse because you're like oh how

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.480 
even worse because you're like oh how
where<00:01:55.470> am<00:01:55.590> i<00:01:55.649> aiming<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.399> down<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.180> then

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
where am i aiming up and down and then

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.340 
where am i aiming up and down and then
this<00:01:59.490> looks<00:01:59.700> really<00:01:59.939> funny<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:00.540> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
this looks really funny because it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990 
this looks really funny because it
kicked<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.219> bouncing<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.880> down

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
kicked is just like bouncing up and down

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.630 
kicked is just like bouncing up and down
pretty<00:02:03.360> much<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.810> yeah

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
pretty much but yeah

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.610 
pretty much but yeah
aiming<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.600> things<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.960> definitely<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.410> lot

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
aiming at things is definitely a lot

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.320 
aiming at things is definitely a lot
harder<00:02:07.950> because<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> sense

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
harder because you have to have a sense

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.350 
harder because you have to have a sense
of<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:13.380> oh<00:02:13.620> wow

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
of like this oh wow

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.550 
of like this oh wow
you<00:02:15.360> have<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.600> have<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.750> sense<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.350> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
you have to have a sense of like the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.200 
you have to have a sense of like the
center<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.040> your<00:02:17.160> screen<00:02:17.370> otherwise<00:02:18.000> you

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
center of your screen otherwise you

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.010 
center of your screen otherwise you
really<00:02:18.510> can't<00:02:19.470> aim<00:02:19.740> with<00:02:20.130> all<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.700> movement

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
really can't aim with all this movement

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.510 
really can't aim with all this movement
so<00:02:22.020> then<00:02:22.230> back<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.630> normal<00:02:24.960> or<00:02:25.590> zero<00:02:26.040> it's

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
so then back to the normal or zero it's

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.520 
so then back to the normal or zero it's
a<00:02:26.670> lot<00:02:26.910> better<00:02:27.240> as<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.630> can<00:02:27.930> see<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.320> guys<00:02:28.470> can

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
a lot better as you can see you guys can

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.340 
a lot better as you can see you guys can
have<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.490> certain<00:02:30.180> areas<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.870> then<00:02:31.020> when

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
have it on certain areas and then when

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.500 
have it on certain areas and then when
someone<00:02:31.590> pops<00:02:31.860> up<00:02:32.040> you're<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.310> like<00:02:32.400> BAM<00:02:33.090> and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
someone pops up you're just like BAM and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.930 
someone pops up you're just like BAM and
they're<00:02:33.630> dead<00:02:33.930> hopefully<00:02:34.770> unless<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.730> can't

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
they're dead hopefully unless you can't

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.880 
they're dead hopefully unless you can't
aim<00:02:36.120> which<00:02:36.510> then<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:36.780> can't<00:02:37.230> really<00:02:37.350> help<00:02:37.560> but

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
aim which then I can't really help but

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.460 
aim which then I can't really help but
should<00:02:38.850> watch<00:02:38.970> my<00:02:39.120> other<00:02:39.150> video<00:02:39.720> which<00:02:40.170> shows

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
should watch my other video which shows

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.260 
should watch my other video which shows
you<00:02:40.650> guys<00:02:40.800> how<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.220> practice<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.180> improve

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
you guys how to practice and improve

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.400 
you guys how to practice and improve
your<00:02:42.660> aim<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:45.450> pretty<00:02:45.660> much<00:02:45.750> wraps<00:02:45.870> it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
your aim and that pretty much wraps it

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.930 
your aim and that pretty much wraps it
up<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.770> mean<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> other<00:02:47.340> settings<00:02:47.760> don't

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
up I mean all the other settings don't

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.010 
up I mean all the other settings don't
really<00:02:48.090> change<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.570> much<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.900> was

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
really change it much I was

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.900 
really change it much I was
experimenting<00:02:49.709> before<00:02:50.130> this<00:02:50.280> video<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.850> I

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
experimenting before this video and I

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.600 
experimenting before this video and I
was<00:02:51.000> experimenting<00:02:51.660> with<00:02:51.690> like<00:02:51.930> CL

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
was experimenting with like CL

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.180 
was experimenting with like CL
underscore<00:02:53.610> Bob<00:02:54.030> lower<00:02:54.989> amount<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.800> doesn't

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
underscore Bob lower amount that doesn't

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.060 
underscore Bob lower amount that doesn't
change<00:02:56.370> anything

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
change anything

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.070 
change anything
CL<00:02:59.070> view<00:02:59.400> model<00:02:59.790> shifting<00:03:00.330> left<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.870> right

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
CL view model shifting left and right

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.600 
CL view model shifting left and right
that<00:03:01.410> doesn't<00:03:01.590> change<00:03:01.860> anything<00:03:02.040> it's<00:03:02.400> just

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
that doesn't change anything it's just

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.040 
that doesn't change anything it's just
the<00:03:02.730> bobbing<00:03:03.410> vertical<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.770> lateral<00:03:05.040> that

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
the bobbing vertical and lateral that

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.160 
the bobbing vertical and lateral that
changed<00:03:07.050> your<00:03:07.170> scope<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.239> yeah<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.630> wraps<00:03:09.930> up

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
changed your scope so yeah that wraps up

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.940 
changed your scope so yeah that wraps up
this<00:03:10.380> video<00:03:10.590> hope<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.400> guys<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.950> can't
