00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
like I'd lost myself so eventually I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.340 
like I'd lost myself so eventually I
realized<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.790> had<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.330> something<00:02:24.810> about<00:02:24.930> it

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
realized I had to do something about it

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.470 
realized I had to do something about it
and<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.710> only<00:02:25.740> way<00:02:26.130> back<00:02:26.520> was<00:02:27.060> through<00:02:27.330> my

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
and the only way back was through my

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.450 
and the only way back was through my
writing<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.230> created<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.890> group<00:02:29.250> of

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
writing and I created this group of

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.020 
writing and I created this group of
people<00:02:29.730> who<00:02:30.270> felt<00:02:30.780> no<00:02:30.990> emotion<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.950> they<00:02:32.610> felt

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
people who felt no emotion and they felt

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.640 
people who felt no emotion and they felt
had<00:02:33.270> no<00:02:33.480> color<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:34.050> their<00:02:34.230> lives<00:02:34.410> because

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
had no color in their lives because

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.220 
had no color in their lives because
that's<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> way<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.100> felt<00:02:35.580> as<00:02:35.970> if<00:02:36.570> there<00:02:37.050> was<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
that's the way I felt as if there was a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.740 
that's the way I felt as if there was a
no<00:02:37.650> color<00:02:37.980> anymore<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:41.010> was<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> very

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
no color anymore and it was a very

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.370 
no color anymore and it was a very
difficult<00:02:42.920> experience<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:45.240> created<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
difficult experience but I created the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.150 
difficult experience but I created the
world<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.900> took<00:02:49.140> off<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.680> there's<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.890> lot
