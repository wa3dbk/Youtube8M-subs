00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
the wood chips so you have to start an

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.450 
the wood chips so you have to start an
awesome<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:09.260> in<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.380> beginning<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:11.130> didn't

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
awesome and in the beginning I didn't

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.290 
awesome and in the beginning I didn't
see<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.730> much<00:00:14.969> progress<00:00:16.190> only<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.910> didn't

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
see so much progress only that I didn't

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.810 
see so much progress only that I didn't
have<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.690> water<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.500> much<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.550> didn't

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
have to water that much and I didn't

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.779 
have to water that much and I didn't
have<00:00:20.970> weeds<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.600> much<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.680> that's<00:00:22.920> very<00:00:23.279> nice

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
have weeds that much so that's very nice

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.080 
have weeds that much so that's very nice
because<00:00:24.420> then<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:24.840> more<00:00:25.199> energy<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:26.460> do

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
because then you have more energy to do

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.260 
because then you have more energy to do
other<00:00:27.359> chores<00:00:27.750> chores<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.369> garden<00:00:30.359> and
