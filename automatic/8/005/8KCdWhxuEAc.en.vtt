00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.620 
and looked down at the gun Street he
would<00:03:48.070> have<00:03:48.160> had<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.310> nicer<00:03:48.850> angle<00:03:49.240> probably

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
would have had a nicer angle probably

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.350 
would have had a nicer angle probably
get<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.750> four<00:03:49.990> shot<00:03:50.170> at<00:03:50.320> him<00:03:50.500> but<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:52.060> know<00:03:52.090> what

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
get a four shot at him but you know what

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.030 
get a four shot at him but you know what
they<00:03:52.600> got<00:03:52.720> some<00:03:52.930> room<00:03:53.110> for<00:03:53.290> air<00:03:53.500> they<00:03:53.890> have<00:03:53.920> a

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
they got some room for air they have a

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
they got some room for air they have a
comfortable<00:03:54.580> lead<00:03:54.790> right<00:03:55.030> here<00:03:56.910> checking<00:03:57.910> for

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
comfortable lead right here checking for

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.860 
comfortable lead right here checking for
rockets<00:03:58.600> they're<00:03:58.930> not<00:03:59.080> there<00:04:00.060> -<00:04:01.060> one<00:04:01.540> with

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
rockets they're not there - one with

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.440 
rockets they're not there - one with
rockets<00:04:02.500> just<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:02.950> right<00:04:03.130> thing<00:04:03.550> which<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.300> to

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
rockets just the right thing which is to

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.960 
rockets just the right thing which is to
stick<00:04:04.690> virtue<00:04:05.170> just<00:04:05.650> guarantee<00:04:06.520> himself<00:04:06.700> a

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
stick virtue just guarantee himself a

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.920 
stick virtue just guarantee himself a
kill<00:04:07.240> and<00:04:07.510> then<00:04:08.640> he's<00:04:09.640> probably<00:04:10.090> gonna<00:04:10.660> want

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
kill and then he's probably gonna want

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.210 
kill and then he's probably gonna want
to<00:04:10.990> check<00:04:11.140> long<00:04:11.470> haul

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
to check long haul

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.270 
to check long haul
but<00:04:12.370> he<00:04:12.490> doesn't<00:04:13.739> because<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:15.040> guy<00:04:15.160> with

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
but he doesn't because the guy with

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.380 
but he doesn't because the guy with
rockets<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:17.500> see<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.919> nade<00:04:18.160> there<00:04:18.459> that's

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
rockets and I see that nade there that's

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.100 
rockets and I see that nade there that's
gonna<00:04:19.540> maybe<00:04:19.780> alert<00:04:20.350> him<00:04:20.560> that<00:04:21.600> he's<00:04:22.600> coming

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
gonna maybe alert him that he's coming

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.730 
gonna maybe alert him that he's coming
but<00:04:23.440> again<00:04:24.010> using<00:04:24.280> his<00:04:24.490> angle<00:04:25.350> he's<00:04:26.350> able<00:04:26.530> to

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
but again using his angle he's able to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.409 
but again using his angle he's able to
clean<00:04:27.010> on<00:04:27.160> virtue<00:04:27.370> with<00:04:27.700> some<00:04:28.000> nice<00:04:28.150> beer

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
clean on virtue with some nice beer

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.010 
clean on virtue with some nice beer
shots

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
shots

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.300 
shots
gets<00:04:29.440> hands<00:04:29.860> on<00:04:29.980> another<00:04:30.310> sniper<00:04:30.669> somehow<00:04:31.300> and

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
gets hands on another sniper somehow and

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.830 
gets hands on another sniper somehow and
it's<00:04:33.310> gonna<00:04:33.460> be<00:04:33.610> checking<00:04:33.820> for<00:04:34.210> spawn<00:04:36.690> so<00:04:37.690> this

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
it's gonna be checking for spawn so this

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.050 
it's gonna be checking for spawn so this
guy<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.080> pretty<00:04:38.320> oblivious<00:04:38.650> um<00:04:39.370> looks<00:04:39.910> like

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
guy is pretty oblivious um looks like

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.570 
guy is pretty oblivious um looks like
something<00:04:40.390> that's<00:04:40.510> going<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.780> chase<00:04:41.020> him<00:04:41.580> not

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
something that's going to chase him not

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.710 
something that's going to chase him not
the<00:04:42.760> best<00:04:42.940> decision

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
the best decision

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.920 
the best decision
never<00:04:44.169> chase<00:04:44.620> unless<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.640> know<00:04:45.790> you're<00:04:46.660> I

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
never chase unless you know you're I

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.050 
never chase unless you know you're I
mean<00:04:47.650> even<00:04:48.190> if<00:04:48.250> they're<00:04:48.430> watch<00:04:48.610> out<00:04:48.790> they<00:04:48.910> can

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
mean even if they're watch out they can

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.900 
mean even if they're watch out they can
drop<00:04:49.300> Nate<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:49.870> kill<00:04:50.110> you<00:04:50.290> so<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.890> would<00:04:51.729> never

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
drop Nate and kill you so I would never

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.270 
drop Nate and kill you so I would never
suggest<00:04:52.180> chasing<00:04:52.930> you<00:04:53.800> just<00:04:53.950> got<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.190> get

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
suggest chasing you just got to get

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.860 
suggest chasing you just got to get
lucky<00:04:54.610> like<00:04:54.760> you<00:04:54.820> did<00:04:55.060> right<00:04:55.240> there<00:04:55.479> which

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
lucky like you did right there which

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.740 
lucky like you did right there which
does<00:04:56.350> happen<00:04:56.590> eventually

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
does happen eventually

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.780 
does happen eventually
so<00:04:58.750> put<00:04:59.110> slash<00:04:59.410> off<00:04:59.710> to<00:04:59.800> good<00:04:59.979> use<00:05:00.250> picks<00:05:00.640> up

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
so put slash off to good use picks up

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.670 
so put slash off to good use picks up
the<00:05:00.880> headshot<00:05:01.300> been<00:05:01.900> really<00:05:02.200> aggressive<00:05:02.260> on

the headshot been really aggressive on

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.900 
the headshot been really aggressive on
this<00:05:02.800> push<00:05:03.040> here<00:05:03.220> probably<00:05:03.580> not<00:05:03.700> going<00:05:03.850> to

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
this push here probably not going to

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.750 
this push here probably not going to
live<00:05:04.120> tries<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.140> cut<00:05:05.350> back<00:05:05.590> to<00:05:05.890> objective
