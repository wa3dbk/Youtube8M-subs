00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430
 look 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.369
 This is a British study according to the dog 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.720
 today is national apple picking day 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.679
 prorail explains how that works 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.070
 is thought of 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.779
 one of the days when you have to welcome Thomas warmly 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.339
 to wonder what the club is about something that we have been doing for almost 20 years now 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.820
 and the album is actually very simple Libya you are therefore coming for sausage 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.350
 Essentially you look at the signs that we are referring to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.460
 another higher each time 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.220
 can offer beautiful pictures 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.600
 thijs kraantje get pappie bags that get information in the holes boogerd 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.890
 in there are always people who have a little supervisor also not placed 2 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.740
 in the bags or two steps that is settled 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.220
 we are approaching many people 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.450
 I think so 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.450
 I think there are weekends and that it's an hour 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.220
 could hardly be busier 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.890
 And I mean that the vehicle 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.720
 I think that there is at the same time parked except on the estate 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.500
 A brief tell about apple growing and she is a fascinating van of fact 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.010
 of course that date is emphatically multi-year image the fight against ours 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.850
 apple orchard on average 15 to 20 years 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.430
 for russia but also that what you do what a bunch actually a website 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.330
 the scope of fifty years and of course they are never always good 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.320
 for that reason siren the fact that companies actually always orchard 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.830
 different ages 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.940
 and also different varieties 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.650
 because we only hope it concerns the spirit of the times that had come and 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.720
 body 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.710
 telstar has our apple varieties 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.710
 gets a bit of a revival 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.830
 but if we are honest it is perhaps now after almost thirty years on the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.990
 have been on the market 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.280
 already on its way back 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.380
 as a pilot we are very happy that we are 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.910
 If Santana's rasp was the eye because he fit us very well because 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.219
 they many who are susceptible to the disease 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.339
 and thereby 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:16.679
 these were by the game rules 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:18.599
 because second 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.019
 and that while there is indeed saying 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.919
 wigan finished second 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.109
 to balance 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.629
 passing ships 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:27.859
 westergaard 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.979
 Meanwhile 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.889
 bosz reuters the importance of the tree an interest of the whole I must not 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.259
 too many rumors are going around the trees at the expense of the 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.939
 there 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.739
 velsen too little set the bond grows fast making it for the year 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.919
 then your less beautiful goal less 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.919
 charities 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.099
 for the flowers 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.399
 And then I think as the mayor years before that you 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.239
 back in balance 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.749
 the same those apples, yes 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:01.859
 they only make world titles divided but much more gloomy in 4 sets 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.399
 expected 7 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.929
 partly because deal with third parties that just do that 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:08.159
 for us 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.900
 to be able to care very efficiently and that leaves the link with the latter 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.900
 think of our apple juice pear juice that 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.609
 yes, because it had been quite a prototype 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:27.659
 h this month f 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.879
 not 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.939
 a 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.069
 nothing 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.679
 look
