josh ex-slave this is how to wire the
VGA<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.800> Xbox<00:00:11.250> motherboard<00:00:12.710> I'm<00:00:13.710> not

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
VGA to the Xbox motherboard I'm not

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.709 
VGA to the Xbox motherboard I'm not
actually<00:00:14.190> going<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> solder<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.059> again

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
actually going to solder it again

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.609 
actually going to solder it again
because<00:00:16.080> I've<00:00:16.199> already<00:00:16.350> done<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.800> but<00:00:18.380> this<00:00:19.380> is

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
because I've already done it but this is

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.730 
because I've already done it but this is
my<00:00:19.650> method<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.369> doing<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.820> now<00:00:21.109> I<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.470> made

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
my method of doing it now I have made

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.120 
my method of doing it now I have made
the<00:00:23.039> sort<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.090> made<00:00:24.420> these<00:00:24.720> two<00:00:25.439> sheets<00:00:25.980> of

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the sort of made these two sheets of

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.310 
the sort of made these two sheets of
paper<00:00:26.340> which<00:00:26.880> helped<00:00:27.180> me<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.599> lot

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
paper which helped me a lot

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.089 
paper which helped me a lot
now<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.279> one's<00:00:29.519> telling<00:00:29.820> me<00:00:30.439> what<00:00:31.439> pins<00:00:31.800> of

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
now this one's telling me what pins of

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.040 
now this one's telling me what pins of
the<00:00:32.130> VGA<00:00:32.669> cable<00:00:33.260> which<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.290> over<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:36.050> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the VGA cable which is over here to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.790 
the VGA cable which is over here to
solders<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> motherboard<00:00:39.410> so<00:00:40.410> I've<00:00:40.559> got

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
solders to the motherboard so I've got

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
solders to the motherboard so I've got
red<00:00:41.309> green<00:00:41.700> blue<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:43.590> me<00:00:43.710> I've<00:00:44.129> made<00:00:44.750> my

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
red green blue and for me I've made my

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.479 
red green blue and for me I've made my
own<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> show<00:00:46.559> what<00:00:46.710> colour<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.160> are<00:00:47.340> in

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
own just to show what colour they are in

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.810 
own just to show what colour they are in
my<00:00:47.670> case<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.570> green<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.289> actually<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.520> gray

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
my case my green is actually a gray

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.790 
my case my green is actually a gray
cable<00:00:51.320> my<00:00:52.320> H<00:00:52.559> sink<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.309> brown<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.199> vsync<00:00:55.199> is

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
cable my H sink is brown and vsync is

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.459 
cable my H sink is brown and vsync is
black<00:00:56.280> now<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> tested<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
black now I tested this with a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.740 
black now I tested this with a
multimeter<00:00:59.219> doing<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.760> continuity<00:01:00.420> test<00:01:01.039> by

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
multimeter doing a continuity test by

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.580 
multimeter doing a continuity test by
touching<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.309> pin<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.290> trying

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
touching this pin here and just trying

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.780 
touching this pin here and just trying
out<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.520> smaller<00:01:09.180> cables<00:01:09.950> in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.280> VGA

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
out all of the smaller cables in the VGA

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.630 
out all of the smaller cables in the VGA
cable<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.750> make<00:01:12.900> sure<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> was<00:01:14.369> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
cable to make sure what one it was and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.440 
cable to make sure what one it was and
the<00:01:15.210> same<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.659> vsync<00:01:17.659> now<00:01:19.820> in<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.090> I've

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
the same for the vsync now in this I've

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.710 
the same for the vsync now in this I've
got<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> numbers<00:01:22.290> corresponding<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.720> where

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
got the numbers corresponding to where

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.249 
got the numbers corresponding to where
the<00:01:24.930> VGA<00:01:25.320> cables<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:28.020> an

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the VGA cables are but that's not an

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.819 
the VGA cables are but that's not an
Xbox<00:01:29.159> header<00:01:29.579> all<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.439> cable

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
Xbox header all it is but it's the cable

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.800 
Xbox header all it is but it's the cable
which<00:01:31.920> connects<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.520> header<00:01:32.700> which<00:01:32.970> doesn't

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
which connects the header which doesn't

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.760 
which connects the header which doesn't
really<00:01:33.990> help<00:01:34.200> us<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.460> made<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.420> which<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
really help us so I made this which is

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.390 
really help us so I made this which is
the<00:01:38.400> pins<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.770> motherboard<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:41.189> you're

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the pins on the motherboard if you're

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:51.260 
the pins on the motherboard if you're
looking<00:01:42.890> what<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.220> from<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:50.030> if<00:01:51.030> you're

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
looking what is it from the if you're

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.580 
looking what is it from the if you're
looking<00:01:51.540> down<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:54.590> that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
looking down to that like this that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.389 
looking down to that like this that
corresponds<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.640> pin<00:01:57.360> 2<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.290> highest<00:01:59.219> pin

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
corresponds so pin 2 is the highest pin

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.459 
corresponds so pin 2 is the highest pin
there<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:01.259> um<00:02:02.780> what<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.810> did<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.590> I've<00:02:05.189> gone<00:02:06.469> 3

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
there so um what I did is I've gone 3

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.639 
there so um what I did is I've gone 3
pin<00:02:07.950> 3<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.569> soldered<00:02:09.569> my<00:02:09.720> red<00:02:09.959> cable<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.530> it

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
pin 3 I soldered my red cable to it

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.940 
pin 3 I soldered my red cable to it
there<00:02:10.860> now<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:12.720> before<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.110> go<00:02:13.319> further

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
there now just before I go further

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.309 
there now just before I go further
I<00:02:13.980> actually<00:02:14.190> soldered<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.910> with<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.319> standard

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
I actually soldered it with a standard

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.300 
I actually soldered it with a standard
ribbon<00:02:17.280> cable<00:02:17.879> on<00:02:18.830> ebay<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:19.980> buy<00:02:20.250> these

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
ribbon cable on ebay you can buy these

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.750 
ribbon cable on ebay you can buy these
they<00:02:20.640> called<00:02:20.879> IDC<00:02:21.569> cables<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.500> found<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.550> lot

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
they called IDC cables I found a lot

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.140 
they called IDC cables I found a lot
easier<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.099> it<00:02:26.280> right<00:02:26.459> because<00:02:26.760> they're

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
easier to get it right because they're

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.320 
easier to get it right because they're
smaller<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.870> later<00:02:28.769> on<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> sold<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
smaller and later on I sold it to the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.620 
smaller and later on I sold it to the
VGA<00:02:31.170> cable<00:02:32.660> pin<00:02:33.660> for<00:02:33.959> is<00:02:34.260> green<00:02:35.390> pin<00:02:36.390> eight

in<00:02:46.799> this<00:02:47.190> I'm<00:02:47.840> not<00:02:48.840> really<00:02:48.900> going<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.440> explain

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
in this I'm not really going to explain

these<00:02:51.720> two<00:02:51.959> pins<00:02:52.260> here<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.880> ground

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
these two pins here and there ground

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.220 
these two pins here and there ground
I<00:02:54.599> just<00:02:54.870> solder<00:02:55.349> two<00:02:57.860> if<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.220> find<00:02:59.730> it<00:03:00.239> there

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
I just solder two if I can find it there

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.550 
I just solder two if I can find it there
which<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.799> just<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> shielding<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.269> other<00:03:03.930> AV

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
which is just the shielding of other AV

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.259 
which is just the shielding of other AV
port<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.420> pin<00:03:06.420> 20<00:03:06.959> which<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:08.060> here<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.329> for<00:03:10.079> the

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
port and pin 20 which is here is for the

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.530 
port and pin 20 which is here is for the
used<00:03:12.269> VGA<00:03:12.870> signal<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:14.519> saw<00:03:14.849> that<00:03:15.090> directly

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
used VGA signal and I saw that directly

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.440 
used VGA signal and I saw that directly
to<00:03:15.690> ground<00:03:15.840> but<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:17.010> will<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.549> switch<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.420> it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
to ground but I will have a switch on it

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.020 
to ground but I will have a switch on it
to<00:03:19.079> change<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:20.510> um<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:22.130> hope<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.400> helped

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
to change that um I hope that helped

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.289 
to change that um I hope that helped
I'll<00:03:24.450> just<00:03:24.660> show<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.850> just<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.150> repeat

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
I'll just show you so just to repeat

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.580 
I'll just show you so just to repeat
that<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:28.130> soldered<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.340> ribbon<00:03:30.209> cable<00:03:30.590> directly

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
that I soldered a ribbon cable directly

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.559 
that I soldered a ribbon cable directly
to<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:32.100> header<00:03:32.660> if<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.870> turn<00:03:34.139> it<00:03:34.260> around<00:03:34.350> here<00:03:35.069> I

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
to the header if I turn it around here I

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.620 
to the header if I turn it around here I
spliced<00:03:36.569> it<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.380> soldered<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:39.420> VGA

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
spliced it and soldered it to the VGA

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.590 
spliced it and soldered it to the VGA
cable<00:03:40.350> now<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.310> can't<00:03:41.819> test<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.269> at<00:03:42.510> the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
cable now I can't test this at the

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.509 
cable now I can't test this at the
moment<00:03:42.750> but<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.410> have<00:03:43.739> tested<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.130> before<00:03:44.220> it

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
moment but I have tested it before it

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.479 
moment but I have tested it before it
works<00:03:44.730> fine<00:03:45.139> no<00:03:48.019> no<00:03:49.019> bad<00:03:49.440> picture<00:03:50.010> forget<00:03:50.370> what

you call at the moment um I can't test
it<00:03:53.489> because<00:03:54.109> this<00:03:55.109> MOSFET<00:03:55.440> here<00:03:55.980> which<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.549> D

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
it because this MOSFET here which is D

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.710 
it because this MOSFET here which is D
soldered<00:03:57.239> now<00:03:59.329> short-circuited<00:04:00.329> because<00:04:00.630> I

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
soldered now short-circuited because I

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.259 
soldered now short-circuited because I
touched<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.230> while<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.590> was<00:04:01.739> on<00:04:02.000> bird<00:04:03.000> move

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
touched it while it was on bird move

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.390 
touched it while it was on bird move
cost<00:04:03.780> me<00:04:03.900> 20<00:04:04.230> bucks<00:04:06.500> but<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.680> should<00:04:08.040> be<00:04:08.160> able<00:04:08.280> to

cost me 20 bucks but I should be able to

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.559 
cost me 20 bucks but I should be able to
