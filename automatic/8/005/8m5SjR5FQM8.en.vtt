taking a long-range precision tool that

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.940

we normally shoot targets at three four
hundred<00:00:27.250> yards<00:00:27.610> bringing<00:00:28.420> that<00:00:28.570> up<00:00:28.779> close<00:00:29.170> and

hundred yards bringing that up close and

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.010 
hundred yards bringing that up close and
shooting<00:00:29.890> some<00:00:30.070> targets<00:00:30.430> very<00:00:30.820> quickly<00:00:31.180> we've

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.330 
got to set out here today for our
training<00:00:34.390> tip<00:00:34.720> what<00:00:35.590> we're<00:00:35.710> gonna<00:00:35.830> be<00:00:35.980> focused

training tip what we're gonna be focused

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.490 
training tip what we're gonna be focused
on<00:00:36.489> is<00:00:36.699> shooting<00:00:37.120> two<00:00:37.540> rounds<00:00:37.900> quickly<00:00:38.260> on<00:00:38.379> the

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
on is shooting two rounds quickly on the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.530 
on is shooting two rounds quickly on the
first<00:00:38.710> target<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.269> transitioning<00:00:40.269> into<00:00:40.360> that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
first target and transitioning into that

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.960 
first target and transitioning into that
second<00:00:40.960> target<00:00:41.140> as<00:00:41.470> fast<00:00:41.949> as<00:00:42.160> we<00:00:42.280> possibly<00:00:42.699> can

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
second target as fast as we possibly can

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.720 
second target as fast as we possibly can
the<00:00:43.660> easiest<00:00:44.080> way<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.290> do<00:00:44.590> that<00:00:44.769> is<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.370> snap

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
the easiest way to do that is to snap

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.910 
the easiest way to do that is to snap
your<00:00:46.030> eyes<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.660> target<00:00:47.110> look<00:00:47.620> at<00:00:47.770> where

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
your eyes to the target look at where

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.069 
your eyes to the target look at where
you<00:00:48.100> want<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.399> be<00:00:48.550> to<00:00:49.090> bring<00:00:49.390> the<00:00:49.450> rifle<00:00:49.899> right

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
you want to be to bring the rifle right

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.020 
you want to be to bring the rifle right
over<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.440> it'll<00:00:50.559> automatically<00:00:51.190> stop<00:00:51.670> right

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
over and it'll automatically stop right

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.520 
over and it'll automatically stop right
where<00:00:52.059> you're<00:00:52.360> looking<00:00:52.750> so<00:00:53.110> you<00:00:53.170> can<00:00:53.320> fire

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
where you're looking so you can fire

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.139 
where you're looking so you can fire
those<00:00:53.739> next<00:00:54.100> two<00:00:54.219> shots<00:00:54.489> as<00:00:54.760> quickly<00:00:54.969> as

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
those next two shots as quickly as

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.750 
those next two shots as quickly as
possible<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.530> other<00:00:56.680> way<00:00:57.040> to<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.340> it<00:00:57.520> is<00:00:57.640> if

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
possible the other way to do it is if

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.060 
possible the other way to do it is if
you<00:00:57.850> leave<00:00:58.090> your<00:00:58.390> eyes<00:00:58.690> focused<00:00:59.410> in<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.739> scope

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
you leave your eyes focused in the scope

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.580 
you leave your eyes focused in the scope
or<00:01:00.280> on<00:01:00.489> your<00:01:00.789> rifle<00:01:00.969> you'll<00:01:01.870> end<00:01:02.079> up<00:01:02.200> searching

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
or on your rifle you'll end up searching

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.130 
or on your rifle you'll end up searching
for<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:03.070> next<00:01:03.280> target<00:01:03.700> probably<00:01:04.330> go<00:01:04.509> past<00:01:04.839> it

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
for the next target probably go past it

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.320 
for the next target probably go past it
have<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.710> come<00:01:05.920> back<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.399> it's<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.940> much<00:01:07.149> slower

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
have to come back and it's a much slower

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.450 
have to come back and it's a much slower
way<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.750> do<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.860> other<00:01:08.979> thing<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.310> need

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
way to do that the other thing you need

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.859 
way to do that the other thing you need
to<00:01:09.490> be<00:01:09.640> focused<00:01:10.000> on<00:01:10.119> while<00:01:10.360> you're<00:01:10.509> doing<00:01:10.750> this

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
to be focused on while you're doing this

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.469 
to be focused on while you're doing this
drill<00:01:11.170> is<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:12.100> understand<00:01:12.700> that<00:01:12.880> two<00:01:13.180> hits

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
drill is to understand that two hits

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.600 
drill is to understand that two hits
anywhere<00:01:13.930> in<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.410> zone<00:01:14.830> on<00:01:15.039> that<00:01:15.310> target

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
anywhere in the a zone on that target

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.179 
anywhere in the a zone on that target
will<00:01:16.210> count<00:01:16.450> just<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.869> same<00:01:17.140> as<00:01:17.380> two<00:01:17.770> hits<00:01:18.010> and

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
will count just the same as two hits and

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.100 
will count just the same as two hits and
the<00:01:18.490> very<00:01:18.729> dead<00:01:18.939> center<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.600> let's<00:01:20.049> go

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
the very dead center of it let's go

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:28.890 
the very dead center of it let's go
ahead<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.439> see<00:01:20.560> what<00:01:20.710> that<00:01:20.740> looks<00:01:21.040> like<00:01:27.900> as

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
ahead and see what that looks like as

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.899 
ahead and see what that looks like as
you<00:01:28.960> can<00:01:29.140> see<00:01:29.439> snap<00:01:29.979> my<00:01:30.189> eyes<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.670> next

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
you can see snap my eyes to the next

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:31.289 
you can see snap my eyes to the next
target

out to the range and practice it for

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.480 
out to the range and practice it for
yourself<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:38.080> find<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.409> range<00:01:38.560> near<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:39.070> go<00:01:39.430> to
