00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
LED lights at first they might appear

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.720 
LED lights at first they might appear
fantastic<00:00:03.990> low-power<00:00:04.680> bright<00:00:05.310> source

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
fantastic low-power bright source

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.020 
fantastic low-power bright source
however<00:00:06.089> when<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:06.660> look<00:00:06.839> under<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.230> surface

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
however when we look under the surface

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:20.330 
however when we look under the surface
what<00:00:09.030> lies<00:00:09.300> there<00:00:09.599> might<00:00:09.840> actually<00:00:10.019> scale

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.800

welcome back guys it's going to be an
unusual<00:00:21.960> video<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> don't<00:00:23.640> usually<00:00:23.790> do<00:00:24.180> so

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
unusual video that I don't usually do so

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.670 
unusual video that I don't usually do so

to see more like it however recently the
reason<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.610> doing<00:00:29.850> this<00:00:29.940> video<00:00:30.120> and<00:00:30.570> reason

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
reason for doing this video and reason

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.140 
reason for doing this video and reason
for<00:00:31.320> researching<00:00:31.860> LEDs<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:32.940> recently

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
for researching LEDs is that we recently

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.540 
for researching LEDs is that we recently
put<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.870> blue<00:00:34.200> LED<00:00:34.740> light<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.010> low<00:00:35.310> vision

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
put in a blue LED light a low vision

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.810 
put in a blue LED light a low vision
late<00:00:35.820> night<00:00:36.030> room<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.960> noticed<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
late night room and I noticed in the

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.790 
late night room and I noticed in the
after<00:00:38.820> about<00:00:38.940> two<00:00:39.120> weeks<00:00:39.150> of<00:00:39.450> using<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.960> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
after about two weeks of using it so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.020 
after about two weeks of using it so
before<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.309> had<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> standard

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
before that we just had a standard

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.150 
before that we just had a standard
orange<00:00:42.270> bulb<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.930> there<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.170> blew<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.530> but

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
orange bulb in there that blew out but

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.010 
orange bulb in there that blew out but
after<00:00:44.430> about<00:00:44.550> two<00:00:44.760> weeks<00:00:44.790> of<00:00:45.120> using<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.600> bulb

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
after about two weeks of using this bulb

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
after about two weeks of using this bulb
I<00:00:46.350> noticed<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.220> I'd<00:00:47.370> go<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.580> work<00:00:47.790> in<00:00:47.970> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
I noticed when I'd go to work in the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.790 
I noticed when I'd go to work in the
morning<00:00:48.270> I'd<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.629> black<00:00:48.960> spots<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.620> my

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
morning I'd have like black spots in my

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.640 
morning I'd have like black spots in my
eyes<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> started<00:00:51.510> looking<00:00:52.320> up<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
eyes and so I started looking up on the

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.530 
eyes and so I started looking up on the
internet<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.550> my<00:00:53.699> eyes<00:00:53.879> degrading

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
internet you know in my eyes degrading

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.020 
internet you know in my eyes degrading
and<00:00:54.720> do<00:00:55.019> have<00:00:55.170> some<00:00:55.379> disease<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.730> started

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and do have some disease and I started

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.850 
and do have some disease and I started
looking<00:00:57.239> at<00:00:57.300> LEDs<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.110> I<00:00:58.140> found<00:00:58.530> was

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
looking at LEDs and what I found was

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.610 
looking at LEDs and what I found was
pretty<00:00:59.480> spooked<00:01:00.480> me<00:01:00.720> out<00:01:00.839> however<00:01:01.170> before<00:01:01.530> we

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
pretty spooked me out however before we

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500 
pretty spooked me out however before we
get<00:01:01.769> on<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> juicy<00:01:02.460> news<00:01:02.730> we'll<00:01:03.269> look<00:01:03.390> at

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
get on to the juicy news we'll look at

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.020 
get on to the juicy news we'll look at
what<00:01:03.659> it<00:01:03.750> essentially<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.290> LED<00:01:04.650> is

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
what it essentially an LED is

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.310 
what it essentially an LED is
essentially<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> common<00:01:06.630> standard<00:01:07.170> LED

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
essentially what a common standard LED

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.680 
essentially what a common standard LED
is<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.800> it's<00:01:07.920> got<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> blue<00:01:08.340> light<00:01:08.610> source<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
is is it's got a blue light source that

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.590 
is is it's got a blue light source that
has<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.870> yellow<00:01:10.530> layer<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.950> phosphor<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
has a yellow layer of phosphor and that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.440 
has a yellow layer of phosphor and that
converts<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.290> blue<00:01:13.530> light<00:01:13.770> into<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.120> white

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
converts the blue light into the white

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.420 
converts the blue light into the white
artificial<00:01:16.200> white<00:01:16.440> light<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.040> essentially

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
artificial white light so essentially

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
artificial white light so essentially
every<00:01:17.580> time<00:01:17.940> we<00:01:18.090> look<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.540> an<00:01:18.659> LED<00:01:19.080> light<00:01:19.320> we're

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
every time we look at an LED light we're

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
every time we look at an LED light we're
essentially<00:01:19.860> looking<00:01:20.250> at<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.580> core<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.090> blue

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
essentially looking at the core a blue

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.270 
essentially looking at the core a blue
light<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.260> so<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.010> look<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.190> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
light and so if we look at the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.569 
light and so if we look at the
frequencies<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.120> we<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.659> red

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
frequencies here we can see that red

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.289 
frequencies here we can see that red
Red's<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:26.820> least

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
Red's the least

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.660 
Red's the least
what's<00:01:28.079> the<00:01:28.259> lower<00:01:28.439> frequency<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.219> puts<00:01:29.490> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
what's the lower frequency it puts a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.459 
what's the lower frequency it puts a
least<00:01:30.090> little<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> least<00:01:30.840> amount<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.200> strain

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
least little the least amount of strain

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.620 
least little the least amount of strain
on<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.770> eyes<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.250> opposed<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.700> ultraviolet

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
on your eyes as opposed to ultraviolet

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.959 
on your eyes as opposed to ultraviolet
which<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.100> Sun<00:01:35.340> emits<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.729> lot<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
which is what the Sun emits a lot of

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.240 
which is what the Sun emits a lot of
ultraviolet<00:01:36.570> rays<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.009> look<00:01:38.130> here

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
ultraviolet rays but if we look here

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.429 
ultraviolet rays but if we look here
White's<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.909> below<00:01:39.299> blue<00:01:39.539> so<00:01:39.990> blue<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.259> kind

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
White's it's below blue so blue is kind

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.620 
White's it's below blue so blue is kind
of<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.710> there<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> spectrum<00:01:41.579> white<00:01:42.329> sits

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
of up there in the spectrum white sits

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.109 
of up there in the spectrum white sits
below<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:44.340> we've<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.759> LED

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
below that so what we've got with LED

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.730 
below that so what we've got with LED
lights<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.570> something<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.020> truly<00:01:46.409> is

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
lights is something that truly is

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.010 
lights is something that truly is
something<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.579> intense<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.869> what

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
something that's more intense for what

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.990 
something that's more intense for what
it's<00:01:49.140> giving<00:01:49.469> us<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.399> these<00:01:50.549> articles

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it's giving us and so these articles

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.480 
it's giving us and so these articles
they<00:01:51.149> started<00:01:51.509> researching<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:53.009> effects<00:01:53.369> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
they started researching the effects of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.910 
they started researching the effects of
LEDs<00:01:54.000> especially<00:01:54.630> blue<00:01:54.899> LEDs<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.590> found

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
LEDs especially blue LEDs and they found

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.840 
LEDs especially blue LEDs and they found
that<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.369> some<00:01:56.670> cases<00:01:57.289> blue<00:01:58.289> light<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:59.549> cause

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that in some cases blue light can cause

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.240 
that in some cases blue light can cause
stress<00:02:00.479> or<00:02:00.750> toxic<00:02:01.229> stress<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> retina

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
stress or toxic stress to the retina

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.310 
stress or toxic stress to the retina
especially<00:02:02.850> outside<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.390> normal<00:02:03.750> daylight

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
especially outside of normal daylight

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.709 
especially outside of normal daylight
hours<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.609> goal<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.329> not<00:02:06.539> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
hours and so the goal of this was not to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.010 
hours and so the goal of this was not to
use<00:02:06.929> too<00:02:06.960> much<00:02:07.289> blue<00:02:07.649> light<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:09.090> since<00:02:09.390> LEDs

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
use too much blue light and since LEDs

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.290 
use too much blue light and since LEDs
have<00:02:10.470> an<00:02:10.619> element<00:02:11.070> of<00:02:11.250> blue<00:02:11.580> light<00:02:11.850> in<00:02:12.060> them

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
have an element of blue light in them

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.450 
have an element of blue light in them
which<00:02:12.960> we<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.320> see<00:02:13.590> whether<00:02:13.830> we<00:02:14.010> like<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.250> or

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
which we can see whether we like it or

no<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.440> don't<00:02:19.590> say<00:02:19.710> a<00:02:19.740> little<00:02:19.950> bit<00:02:20.040> later<00:02:20.190> but

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
no you don't say a little bit later but

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.400 
no you don't say a little bit later but
we<00:02:20.430> see<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.610> LED<00:02:21.510> lights<00:02:21.750> they<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.260> that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
we see you LED lights they have that

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.410 
we see you LED lights they have that
spike<00:02:22.860> there<00:02:23.130> blue<00:02:23.430> light<00:02:23.670> which<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.180> cause

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
spike there blue light which can cause

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.090 
spike there blue light which can cause
strain<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.960> our<00:02:25.110> eyes<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.560> if<00:02:25.950> you're

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
strain to our eyes so if you're

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.590 
strain to our eyes so if you're
wondering<00:02:26.280> over<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> last<00:02:26.880> few<00:02:27.120> years<00:02:27.240> why

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
wondering over the last few years why

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.170 
wondering over the last few years why
your<00:02:27.870> eyesight's<00:02:28.769> probably<00:02:29.430> degraded<00:02:29.970> more

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
your eyesight's probably degraded more

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.119 
your eyesight's probably degraded more
than<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.450> should<00:02:30.480> then<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.500> mean<00:02:31.830> your<00:02:32.010> eyes

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
than it should then I mean your eyes

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.470 
than it should then I mean your eyes
degrade<00:02:32.519> as<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.730> get<00:02:32.849> older<00:02:33.090> anyway<00:02:33.239> that

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
degrade as you get older anyway that

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.760 
degrade as you get older anyway that
can't<00:02:33.629> be

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
can't be

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.140 
can't be
helped<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.160> if<00:02:34.460> you're<00:02:34.580> wondering<00:02:34.880> why<00:02:34.970> your

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
helped but if you're wondering why your

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.670 
helped but if you're wondering why your
eyes<00:02:35.270> have<00:02:35.540> probably<00:02:35.780> degraded<00:02:36.200> faster<00:02:36.560> than

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
eyes have probably degraded faster than

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.790 
eyes have probably degraded faster than
usual<00:02:36.830> LEDs<00:02:37.730> might<00:02:38.210> be<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.510> blame<00:02:38.800> I've

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
usual LEDs might be to blame I've

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.350 
usual LEDs might be to blame I've
noticed<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.190> my<00:02:40.340> eyesight<00:02:40.700> in<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.910> last<00:02:41.090> few

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
noticed that my eyesight in the last few

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.120 
noticed that my eyesight in the last few
years<00:02:41.420> hasn't<00:02:42.170> been<00:02:42.440> all<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.680> best<00:02:42.920> but

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
years hasn't been all the best but

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.460 
years hasn't been all the best but
before<00:02:43.400> that's<00:02:43.580> been<00:02:43.790> 20/20<00:02:44.390> perfect<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.440> I

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
before that's been 20/20 perfect so I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.140 
before that's been 20/20 perfect so I
might<00:02:45.740> do<00:02:46.010> an<00:02:46.130> experiment<00:02:46.700> where<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.820> change

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
might do an experiment where I change

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.140 
might do an experiment where I change
back<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:47.540> see<00:02:47.780> CFL<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.550> see<00:02:49.550> how<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.910> goes

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
back to see CFL and see how that goes

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.030 
back to see CFL and see how that goes
for<00:02:50.210> you<00:02:50.510> guys<00:02:50.720> maybe<00:02:50.960> you'd<00:02:51.200> like<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:51.920> I'll

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
for you guys maybe you'd like to be I'll

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.160 
for you guys maybe you'd like to be I'll
be<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.220> human<00:02:52.610> experiment<00:02:53.030> for<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.330> hey<00:02:53.750> how

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
be a human experiment for you hey how

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.720 
be a human experiment for you hey how
you<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.470> that<00:02:54.620> but<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.340> meantime<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:55.700> can

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
you like that but in the meantime we can

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.240 
you like that but in the meantime we can
see<00:02:56.000> here<00:02:56.210> that<00:02:56.300> see<00:02:56.510> CFLs<00:02:56.990> the<00:02:57.260> technology

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
see here that see CFLs the technology

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.620 
see here that see CFLs the technology
that<00:02:58.370> was<00:02:58.460> mainly<00:02:58.790> used<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.120> computer

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
that was mainly used in computer

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.290 
that was mainly used in computer
monitors<00:03:00.020> before<00:03:00.470> LEDs<00:03:00.940> didn't<00:03:01.940> have<00:03:02.120> that

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
monitors before LEDs didn't have that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.020 
monitors before LEDs didn't have that
peak<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.900> blue<00:03:03.200> light<00:03:03.500> in<00:03:03.710> there<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:04.640> they

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
peak of blue light in there so they

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.120 
peak of blue light in there so they
probably<00:03:05.330> didn't<00:03:05.960> cause<00:03:06.170> as<00:03:06.410> much<00:03:06.590> stress<00:03:07.100> as

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
probably didn't cause as much stress as

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.940 
probably didn't cause as much stress as
an<00:03:07.610> LED<00:03:08.060> would<00:03:08.270> on<00:03:08.480> your<00:03:08.780> eyes<00:03:08.960> is<00:03:09.740> that

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
an LED would on your eyes is that

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.350 
an LED would on your eyes is that
something<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.280> keep<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:10.760> mind<00:03:10.940> it's<00:03:11.270> something

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
something to keep in mind it's something

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.120 
something to keep in mind it's something
that<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.720> found<00:03:12.110> really<00:03:12.290> interesting<00:03:12.620> and

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
that I found really interesting and

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.560 
that I found really interesting and
something<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.550> thought<00:03:13.880> I'd<00:03:14.030> share<00:03:14.360> with<00:03:14.420> you

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
something I thought I'd share with you

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.230 
something I thought I'd share with you
guys<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.140> now<00:03:15.620> in<00:03:15.950> conclusion<00:03:16.550> I<00:03:16.910> will<00:03:17.060> say

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
guys and now in conclusion I will say

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.800 
guys and now in conclusion I will say
that<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.450> no<00:03:18.220> I'm<00:03:19.220> not<00:03:19.580> I'm<00:03:20.210> not<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.420> man<00:03:20.660> of

that I no I'm not I'm not a man of

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.890 
that I no I'm not I'm not a man of
science<00:03:21.080> I<00:03:21.590> do<00:03:22.010> love<00:03:22.520> science<00:03:23.030> but<00:03:23.540> I'm<00:03:23.660> not<00:03:23.840> a
