requested a lot so I just thought I'd

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.540 
requested a lot so I just thought I'd
make<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.599> since<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.139> kind<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.620> already<00:00:11.010> figured

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
make it since I kind of already figured

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.020 
make it since I kind of already figured
it<00:00:11.670> out<00:00:11.840> so<00:00:12.840> um<00:00:13.280> this<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.700> sounds<00:00:15.000> like

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:40.560 

you

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.520 

so<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:42.500> start<00:00:42.679> out<00:00:42.829> your<00:00:43.070> right<00:00:43.219> hand<00:00:43.460> plays<00:00:44.530> to

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
so to start out your right hand plays to

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.000 
so to start out your right hand plays to
shine<00:00:45.769> I've<00:00:46.670> sharp

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010

shine I've sharp
and<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:50.150> sharp

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.100 

then<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.540> play<00:00:54.750> F<00:00:55.350> sharp<00:00:55.910> B<00:00:57.740> and<00:00:58.740> D<00:00:58.950> sharp<00:01:00.110> then

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
then you play F sharp B and D sharp then

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.440 
then you play F sharp B and D sharp then
you<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.440> back<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.650> be<00:01:02.070> sharp<00:01:02.370> F<00:01:02.670> sharp<00:01:02.700> and<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450

sharp<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:21.200 

then<00:01:10.530> next<00:01:10.800> you<00:01:11.160> play<00:01:11.430> e<00:01:15.020> G<00:01:16.020> sharp<00:01:18.080> C<00:01:19.080> sharp<00:01:20.210> and

F

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.170 

so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920 

and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.560> just<00:01:32.830> play<00:01:33.240> G<00:01:34.240> sharp<00:01:34.510> and<00:01:34.780> C

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
and then you just play G sharp and C

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.630 
and then you just play G sharp and C
sharp<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.680> while<00:01:38.920> you're<00:01:39.070> playing<00:01:39.190> that<00:01:39.460> your

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.900 

be<00:01:46.280> a<00:01:47.890> sharp<00:01:49.780> C<00:01:50.780> sharp<00:01:51.310> then<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.490> add<00:01:52.730> the

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
be a sharp C sharp then you add the

objects

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.660 

and<00:01:59.460> then<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.440> one<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.830> a<00:02:02.010> song

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and then you can like this one is a song

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.980 
and then you can like this one is a song
that<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.330> pretty<00:02:03.540> much<00:02:03.750> make<00:02:03.960> up
