00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.980
 in this capacity of the ge at the time of 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.380

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.079
 a complete and total contact with the world 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.540
 of the spirits that was shown for the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.910

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.170
 very patience with the glue is so good 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.990
 See you last time you treated me 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.810
 so bad but I'm so happy to see you 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.880
 What is the best joke of the episode was 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 he tells her everything she has done 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.939
 wrong in his absence he's just talking to me 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.650
 I knew it was going to happen 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.720
 Did you know how gaudy I believe in 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.520
 you ok i know thanks 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.590
 wants to enter the spiritual world even 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 finding correct location even by doing 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.150
 all the rituals were still needed 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.680
 so it was not his fate that would risk 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.140
 I'm sorry, I know it's important 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.420
 for you a little opium or that 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.479
 now the children of the dollar that will 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.270
 join our team because they were 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.610
 treated as trash by the father already something 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.590
 very normal in this drawing parents bring 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.290
 children as extremely important things 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.540
 rule out the deficit are good parents and 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.009
 children do not vote for you ok then one 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.470
 something I did not particularly like 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.810
 to see in this episode were the children of 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.090
 ten not interested in knowing about the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.610
 culture of their people I find this very 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 bad a very bad example indeed a 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.860
 very funny joke make a drawing 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.780
 the oba old things and there old things 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.789
 can be very interesting I love the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.710
 national history museum is one thing 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.440
 so it's so good to see it so good to know that 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.240
 it existed a thousand years ago I think 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.940
 interesting I do not have because a 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.160
 child would think so then this 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.590
 The love triangle that came back was 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.420
 resurrected in the past episode 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.790
 to understand that this mittal feels 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.350
 and suddenly mark where the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.100
 person was there but now they 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.700
 actually return to receive creating 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.340
 loving is so worthless save something else 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.560
 that this hotel is doing being a bad 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.670
 example for and so do not forget you have 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.550
 this design the following one 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.520
 agreement being the worst girlfriend of all 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.920
 all the while treating super mouse frame 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.670
 in scandalous making temper tantrums 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.500
 none 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.720
 showing how a rationing can not 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.090
 how to make a mistake in your 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.310
 dating in five steps per coura because 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.269
 the whole hand of god 2 a frame 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.220
 and know how to live the mourning of the end of your 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.870
 dating because the man can not stay 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.000
 Alone because you can not stay 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.700
 alone by type two weeks is so 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.549
 It is difficult for us to become sad 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.239
 I then left for another example 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:26.970
 What the hell are you going to say? 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:29.580
 love you, this guy ends with you 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.290
 stay with another and it is not that it ends 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.130
 with the other and back to you, it's not 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.959
 seeing that it has a poor standard of 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.959
 behavior that is so loving angle 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.390
 useless it only in interest here I do not 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.850
 I watch the legend of running to watch. 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.370
 bad written teen series 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.590
 I support a high school class where the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.940
 main ace gets to caninha 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.190
 then you 're going to stay with the best 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.829
 friend of the principal and then she 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.049
 go back to main not take these 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.850
 things I 'm not watching barred 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.040
 At the ball I'm not watching the 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.510
 short or watching - on and off 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.489
 time for this kind of thing to happen and 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.780
 everyone here I just had a speech from 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.180
 in this episode that I really 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.000
 I like that when you go to him 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.200
 until they cease too much and normally in these 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.909
 holidays the first thing the person 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.889
 Speak I'm not stressed 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.320
 exactly the boat does not say I'm 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.389
 stressed out even take your stress 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.580
 else I'm here is to 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.530
 language as she does not see that these two 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.870
 their assistants are completely 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.639
 bought her mother received that these 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.500
 guys do not pay at night taught 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.449
 hear the beating of the heart to see if 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.639
 no longer lying kind of tank 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.139
 What kind of detective are you? 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.090
 it's ours 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.370
 I think it's very good that the crown succeeded 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.020
 bend those negative spirits I 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.120
 I think she just got it 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.039
 then she apologizes for protein and 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.320
 then she withdraws the negative energy 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.270
 that she was carrying for her to be able 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.250
 of transforming negative energy energy 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.500
 positive she had to offer something 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.300
 positive for these spirits to be 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.820
 things is the legal problem of 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.860
 evolution of her talking about her evolution 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.139
 How nice that you apologized was the 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.599
 minimum you should do and you do not 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.099
 There are more excuses to be like you. 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.349
 now it has gone through two big 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.120
 moments in your life first with amon 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.150
 now recovering the memory after 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.669
 of that confusion, let's control the 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.639
 temperament let's make decisions 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:24.449
 intelligent let's listen to others not 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.979
 have more excuse if the color is any more 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.349
 well in those I will consider 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.320
 officially he was an evil character 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.360
 written by writers one of the 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.870
 best things of the episode as always 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.330

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.220

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.280
 best jokes you always bring 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.949
 joy to my heart to stay that way 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.750

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.120

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.340

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.169
 that you did not like and do not let 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.060
