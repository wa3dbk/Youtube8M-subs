00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 but all good girls found again today 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.250
 we will make a new recipe together a 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.960
 hamburgers were at the base of results 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.269
 what it will take to be able to do it 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.130
 to achieve 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.680
 this has already been tested by me vi 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.800
 I guarantee that really very good 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.550
 I'm going to use three boxes of tuna 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:27.990
 completely natural already 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:30.420
 then drain a new bran that is 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.120
 the main ingredient is fine or 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.850
 this one at the ricci or the one already in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.340
 My quantity of ground powder is 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.950
 more or less on 80 grams then you settle 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.010
 you because the dough should not come either 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.170
 too dry and neither too soft for 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.140
 take this 80 grams and there 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.780
 put aside as you add for 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.629
 see the quantity of the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.219
 consistency then I'll go to put 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.850
 grated cheese salt as low 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:07.290
 then a pinch of pepper then put a little 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.619
 of ginger if you like I will put it year and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.259
 cheese and then I'll use this 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.420
 equip those who can not as a 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.360
 call a form to give to cookies 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.610
 a pastry chef is called this here for 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.189
 give the shape of the hamburger and then 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.710
 we will cook it in a pot 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.170
 only non-stick greased with oil 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.810
 let's see immediately how to do it 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.560
 I'll put it all in this mix it's from here 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.060
 kitchen and I'm going to add the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.130
 tuna move this I make space for myself 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.049
 so I'll show you 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.060
 add the tuna is also fine 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.060
 with olive oil if you don't like the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.009
 natural throne just make you can tc e 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.619
 I thought to use this here is 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.300
 natural I guarantee that I am 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.520
 really very good they are light 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:09.430
 they have a slightly crunchy aftertaste 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.640
 cooked in the pan given by the race 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.620
 and even your kids will love there 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.690
 my son sincerely asked me 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.510
 his grandfather in the new redo because I 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.060
 really liked them so much we say if 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.770
 he eats my son is true that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.150
 however he does not eat everything 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.120
 problems to eat though if anyway 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.760
 then I put this to go put 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:41.500
 already a little salt so then I put a little 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:45.580
 untidy garlic powder if you 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:51.340
 you want you can put the cool one then 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:03:02.950
 I put a little bit of parsley pepper too 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:04.900
 if you want some ginger you go by 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:15.040
 put a nice handful of cheese 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:17.110
 where the sensa polito then I add the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.270
 bran I put a little at a time as 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:25.930
 see just to see the consistency 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:30.010
 these are 80 grams tested adagio ho 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:37.989
 put three holes take the idea then the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:40.120
 toux a whole egg I put in is a 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.560
 just go with the mixer until you do it 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.780
 to become the soft compound the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.390
 compound must come out of this way 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.860
 consistency 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:56.440
 now offers on a plate and put the 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.870
 coppapasta above so to escape in here 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.910
 the list and the form of love 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.180
 you decide you talk louder or more 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.920
 low is normal that if you make it higher 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:13.920
 it will take a little longer to cook 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.920
 good to flatten sighted 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.870
 I'm with mobile phone I hope you see 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.340
 so I show 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:43.840
 here is a bit darkened the shape I already put 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:48.449
 the pan on the fire just the pan 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.449
 of oil must be nice warm 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:03.479
 I'm going to press quite well on and 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.479
 so I proceed with all the dough 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.150
 then take a non-stick pan e 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.160
 cook them on both sides if so 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.130
 case the compound is very soft and 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.800
 you see that the board of 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:22.289
 keep them in 15 minutes not refrigerated 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.970
 before cooking them and this is the dish 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.479
 finished my tuna burger 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.789
 light with bran I hope the recipe will 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:34.320
 both enjoyed a great passion ave 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.320
