00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.959
 good today chicken coop 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.820
 we are going to collect all the chickens already 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.830
 that are leaving the chickens and os 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.950
 let's teach how to bullying the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.670
 nation 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:31.550
 you already know or if new notices I say 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.070
 the gallinaceous is one of the most 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.730
 rich for the garden that there is what happens 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.550
 is that it is a very strong fertilizer for 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:45.250
 deliver it directly on earth 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.780
 then you have to leave it well 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.630
 because if I could not burn the plants 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.340
 you also have to take a little in all 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.870
 us today what we are going to do is a 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.770
 different thing we are going to do 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:02.370
 urina moulinex with broth permanence 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.710
 in asia now the mix we do not need 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.140
 much we only need a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.909
 container where you can put the mixture and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.409
 the chicken 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.530
 then the proportion is d 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.760
 one third gymnastics scores and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.020
 the rest of water 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.020
 we add eljuri 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:35.360
 Water 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:38.930
 until cover good where the parties 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.200
 or we stir it well all the mixture as 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.240
 you see also has a lot of straw part of 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.590
 a lot of manure if you have a 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.920
 container a little better than mine 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.260
 round and such 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.620
 much better but good I do not have it 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.480
 I'm satisfied with this 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.140
 that's where we make nettle manure 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.140
 also in spring 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.720
 The ideal is to leave it in a place with 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.580
 shadow 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.580
 so that it goes to fermented 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.959
 the lungs 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:31.740
 and know what pain is going to give bad smell 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.110
 that you can not put our house 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:39.050
 Well, it's better tomorrow we go back 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.050
 stir and so for 10 days 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.700
 of the next day and we're going to 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.180
 and we are going to remove 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.290
 or lack there 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.610
 we can cover and until the next day 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.390
 good if we can not every day then 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.390
 the days 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.060
 let's go here again 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.349
 we are going to 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.349
 I'm going to remove them 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.050
 where to mix well and so that 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.050
 everything is activated 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.710
 or we go back to another part 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.610
 i 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.610
 plus 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.990
 It has been ten days since we made the 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.870
 mint and we've been stirring almost to 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.260
 daily 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.290
 it's time to strain 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.920
 while we have done to separate 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.920
 I put everything and do 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.410
 the people who used a colander the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.410
 true 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.830
 in school much better everything and they spend 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:32.000
 less 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.409
 the particles but good those of castings 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.039
 those who are staying the remains of 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.039
 manure 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.700
 we do not have 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.670
 when we run out of liquid 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.560
 we did not do the Qur'an or 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.830
 that we will take advantage of it and we will take it 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.910
 in the compostela 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.990
 and this well with a little patience 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.990
 let's cut it all 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.770
 Y 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:18.070
 once we have cast all the 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:22.000
 remains let's throw in the computer 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:25.930
 and here we have the final result 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.110
 a fertilizer very rich in nitrogen and 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.620
 totally organic and ecological this what 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.050
 we have to mix a part of this 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.510
 water conscience fertilizer is worth it because 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.520
 It is a very strong fertilizer made from 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.600
 chickens already then 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.510
 mix it well 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.790
 in 10 parts of water the castings a 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.040
 part of these feet of water 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.860
 so nothing when we start the garden 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.380
 in spring we are going to have 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:59.020
 and a fertilizer to help us 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.800
 that grow the accounts well to be a 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.660
 fertilizer quite rich in nitrogen 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.860
 we are also going to space the risks with 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.229
 he is saying 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.580
 We will stick once every 15 days or more 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:14.189
 less because it will not be necessary anymore 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.169
 then in spring we will use it to 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.350
 when we do the transplant of the 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.930
 plants 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.720
 and nothing is a fertilizer more than we have 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.529
 seen already we saw the other day a subscription with 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.449
 banana tea 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:30.080
 and today we have seen this asia 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.080
 We will see some more later 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.379
 so nothing to follow attentive to the channel and 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.379
 see you
