the a-team escaped a c-130 cargo plane
blowing<00:00:27.570> up<00:00:27.840> by<00:00:28.230> getting<00:00:28.439> inside<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.010> an

blowing up by getting inside of an
airdrop<00:00:29.640> ready<00:00:30.000> paint<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:30.750> that's<00:00:30.869> not<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
airdrop ready paint but that's not a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.870 
airdrop ready paint but that's not a
normal<00:00:31.289> tank<00:00:31.619> that's<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> m8<00:00:32.340> Buford<00:00:32.759> which

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
normal tank that's the m8 Buford which

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.400 
normal tank that's the m8 Buford which
is<00:00:33.000> really<00:00:33.239> important<00:00:33.630> later<00:00:33.809> there<00:00:34.290> were

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
is really important later there were

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.020 
is really important later there were
several<00:00:34.770> variations<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.460> Buford<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:35.910> this

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
several variations of Buford and this

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.520 
several variations of Buford and this
one<00:00:36.149> looks<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.510> armored<00:00:36.780> variation<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:37.380> or

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
one looks to be armored variation two or

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.139 
one looks to be armored variation two or
three<00:00:37.770> with<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> surprise<00:00:38.309> modification<00:00:39.030> we

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
three with a surprise modification we

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.569 
three with a surprise modification we
will<00:00:39.329> reveal<00:00:39.540> later<00:00:39.809> right<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.010> here<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.370> have

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
will reveal later right so here we have

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.610 
will reveal later right so here we have
face<00:00:41.879> shooting<00:00:42.329> an<00:00:42.420> already<00:00:42.960> loaded<00:00:43.350> top

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
face shooting an already loaded top

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440 
face shooting an already loaded top
mounted<00:00:44.010> gun<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.700> found<00:00:44.969> out<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.329> when

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
mounted gun and we found out that when

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.760 
mounted gun and we found out that when
Buford's<00:00:45.870> are<00:00:45.989> dropped<00:00:46.230> they<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.649> are

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
Buford's are dropped they really are

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.260 
Buford's are dropped they really are
fully<00:00:47.070> loaded<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.550> ready<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.879> go

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
fully loaded and ready to go

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.850 
fully loaded and ready to go
you<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> argued<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.200> point<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> long

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you know I argued that point for a long

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.260 
you know I argued that point for a long
time<00:00:50.160> thinking<00:00:50.489> there<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.700> no<00:00:50.760> way<00:00:50.940> these

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
time thinking there was no way these

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.180 
time thinking there was no way these
things<00:00:51.510> were<00:00:51.629> already<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.960> mode<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
things were already a mode up but you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.020 
things were already a mode up but you
know<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.520> don't<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:53.969> thinking

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
know I don't know what I was thinking

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.459 
know I don't know what I was thinking
because<00:00:54.449> otherwise<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:55.110> would<00:00:55.260> they<00:00:55.350> get

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
because otherwise when would they get

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.770 
because otherwise when would they get
their<00:00:55.649> ammo<00:00:55.980> oh<00:00:56.190> hang<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.539> okay<00:00:57.750> so

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
their ammo oh hang on right here okay so

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.720 
their ammo oh hang on right here okay so
the<00:00:57.989> reapers<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.980> took<00:00:59.129> out<00:00:59.280> two<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the reapers just took out two of the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.459 
the reapers just took out two of the
parachutes<00:01:00.359> putting<00:01:00.899> them<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> freefall

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
parachutes putting them in a freefall

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.229 
parachutes putting them in a freefall
going<00:01:01.980> straight<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.910> looks<00:01:03.090> like

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
going straight down and this looks like

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.759 
going straight down and this looks like
Hollywood<00:01:03.660> physics<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.140> its<00:01:04.260> worst

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
Hollywood physics at its worst

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.399 
Hollywood physics at its worst
yeah<00:01:04.890> no<00:01:05.129> kidding<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.909> here<00:01:06.510> comes<00:01:06.810> here

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
comes that crazy gun recoil tank flying

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
comes that crazy gun recoil tank flying
that<00:01:10.110> made<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> movie<00:01:10.560> trailer<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.250> exciting

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that made the movie trailer so exciting

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
that made the movie trailer so exciting
let's<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.240> technically<00:01:12.600> flying<00:01:12.930> yeah<00:01:13.320> yeah

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
let's not technically flying yeah yeah

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.399 
let's not technically flying yeah yeah
yeah<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> makes<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.060> an<00:01:15.240> insane<00:01:15.720> action

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
yeah but it makes for an insane action

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.679 
yeah but it makes for an insane action
sequence<00:01:16.890> oh<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.880> know<00:01:17.970> what<00:01:18.000> check<00:01:18.570> out

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
sequence oh and you know what check out

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.090 
sequence oh and you know what check out
the<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.320> tank<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> scene

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the back of the tank in the scene

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.830 
the back of the tank in the scene
because<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:20.820> another<00:01:21.150> important<00:01:21.720> detail

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
because it's another important detail

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.470 
because it's another important detail

we'll talk about later
and<00:01:24.570> splash<00:01:25.530> into<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.160> lake<00:01:26.730> driving<00:01:27.540> out

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and splash into the lake driving out

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
and splash into the lake driving out
afterwards<00:01:28.080> oh<00:01:29.240> man<00:01:30.270> okay<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.190> alright<00:01:32.190> before

afterwards oh man okay so alright before
we<00:01:32.700> begin<00:01:32.970> our<00:01:33.030> calculations<00:01:33.750> let's<00:01:33.960> talk<00:01:34.080> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
we begin our calculations let's talk a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.570 
we begin our calculations let's talk a
little<00:01:34.350> bit<00:01:34.500> about<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.800> research<00:01:35.190> we<00:01:35.400> had<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
little bit about the research we had to

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.040 
little bit about the research we had to
do<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.880> make<00:01:35.910> sure<00:01:36.060> our<00:01:36.300> calculations<00:01:36.930> were

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
do to make sure our calculations were

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.510 
do to make sure our calculations were
going<00:01:37.230> to<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.470> accurate<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:38.040> they<00:01:38.160> could<00:01:38.370> be

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
going to be as accurate as they could be

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.010 
going to be as accurate as they could be
right<00:01:38.970> what<00:01:39.210> we're<00:01:39.330> looking<00:01:39.510> at<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.900> an

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
right what we're looking at here is an

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140 
right what we're looking at here is an
m8<00:01:40.320> Buford<00:01:40.650> which<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.860> around<00:01:40.980> 22<00:01:41.430> tons<00:01:41.670> it's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
m8 Buford which is around 22 tons it's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.400 
m8 Buford which is around 22 tons it's
about<00:01:42.300> forty<00:01:42.600> four<00:01:42.750> thousand<00:01:43.170> five<00:01:43.290> hundred

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
about forty four thousand five hundred

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.930 
about forty four thousand five hundred
pounds<00:01:43.680> based<00:01:44.160> on<00:01:44.370> the<00:01:44.460> variant<00:01:44.760> that<00:01:44.820> we

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
pounds based on the variant that we

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.120 
pounds based on the variant that we
think<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.480> right<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.590> know<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:46.830> an<00:01:46.920> MA

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
think it is right what we know as an MA

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.410 
think it is right what we know as an MA
Buford<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.610> could<00:01:47.760> figure<00:01:47.940> out<00:01:48.150> what<00:01:48.330> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
Buford we could figure out what the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
Buford we could figure out what the
frontal<00:01:48.720> area<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.620> what<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.830> frontal

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
frontal area is we know what the frontal

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.290 
frontal area is we know what the frontal
area<00:01:50.400> is<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.640> could<00:01:50.760> figure<00:01:50.880> out<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.150> the

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
area is we could figure out what the

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.240 
area is we could figure out what the
wind<00:01:51.480> resistance<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.260> it<00:01:52.380> exactly<00:01:53.010> because

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
wind resistance is on it exactly because

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.500 
wind resistance is on it exactly because
at<00:01:53.370> that<00:01:53.460> point<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.760> need<00:01:53.940> two<00:01:54.030> dimensions

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
at that point we need two dimensions

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.360 
at that point we need two dimensions
after<00:01:54.900> we<00:01:55.200> figured<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.500> out<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:56.100> started

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
after we figured that out we started

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.250 
after we figured that out we started
looking<00:01:56.610> into<00:01:56.760> acceptable<00:01:57.510> air<00:01:57.660> drop<00:01:57.960> speeds

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
looking into acceptable air drop speeds

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.590 
looking into acceptable air drop speeds
for<00:01:58.530> military<00:01:58.860> vehicles<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.820> happens<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.480> be

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
for military vehicles that happens to be

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.960 
for military vehicles that happens to be
28<00:02:01.080> feet<00:02:01.410> per<00:02:01.590> second<00:02:02.010> or<00:02:02.130> around<00:02:02.490> 19<00:02:02.820> miles

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
28 feet per second or around 19 miles

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.850 
28 feet per second or around 19 miles
per<00:02:03.090> hour<00:02:03.300> right<00:02:03.870> now<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:04.380> don't<00:02:04.530> know<00:02:04.740> what

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
per hour right now we don't know what

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
per hour right now we don't know what
the<00:02:04.920> parachute<00:02:05.370> size<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.850> exactly<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.720> can

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the parachute size is exactly but we can

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.750 
the parachute size is exactly but we can
derive<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.350> from<00:02:07.440> these<00:02:07.620> figures<00:02:07.950> exactly<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
derive it from these figures exactly and

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.740 
derive it from these figures exactly and
we'll<00:02:08.850> get<00:02:08.970> more<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.210> that<00:02:09.330> later

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
we'll get more to that later

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.980 
we'll get more to that later
for<00:02:10.260> now<00:02:10.380> let's<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.070> some<00:02:11.280> math<00:02:11.480> brief<00:02:12.480> fall<00:02:12.810> is

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
for now let's do some math brief fall is

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.570 
for now let's do some math brief fall is

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
gravity now the tank measures about

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.060 
gravity now the tank measures about
eight<00:02:27.120> foot<00:02:27.480> by<00:02:27.630> nine<00:02:27.660> foot<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.290> that's<00:02:28.410> 73

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
eight foot by nine foot so that's 73

slowed up about half a mile per hour and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.810 
slowed up about half a mile per hour and
then<00:04:22.139> immediately<00:04:22.530> approached<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.460> terminal
