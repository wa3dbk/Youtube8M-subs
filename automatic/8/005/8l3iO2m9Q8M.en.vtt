00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.340
 6 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.629
 notebook is one of the world 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.559
 after the release of windows 8 bam manufacturers with all the notebooks that is on 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.679
 different ways we combine that 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.989
 and the followers of article that must come from intel fall 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.269
 but that is only expected later this year until the ces fair in las vegas 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.929
 exactly in between these two developments and see especially with older cars 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.970
 clashed and then again fantastic provided 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.330
 but fortunately stand new and that manufacturer is confident 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.329
 something new to come and that is the series 7's assignment 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.510
 the sand that has of course already on the boat in the affordable series 5 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.630
 and also in the sharks and series 9, but the series sector must be exactly in between 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.370
 However, he not only has much better specifications than the series 5 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.860
 but then also the series 9 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.520
 if you are a bit less thin, the tube is slightly less impressive though 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.430
 sand she calls it and multimedia rotterdam corner 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.670
 One of the most important feature though is screen it comes to a thirteen in 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.660
 screen with a resolution of 29 by 1080 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.590
 It is also a pls screen that means that colors just display well 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.640
 The picture will remain beautiful even if you look at it 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.049
 moreover, it is a bag circle and that means that the operation of windows 8 is 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.480
 a lot easier 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.850
 as sometimes you see that bag recycle book a bit thicker and that falls here 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.470
 Fortunately, because he is 9 10 millimeters thick 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.800
 but he closes about five 60 kilos and that is a bit on the heavy side of it 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 the dark pants 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.990
 from 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.580
 Europe's processor is controlled by a 25 7 30 hour 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.510
 and that there is new ivy bridge processor and that is a fraction faster than the much 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.740
 used 33 17 hours but really does not distinguish Samsung at 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.040
 this processor we are going to fix the coming time more often we see a lot of blood 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.330
 Where the traps can distinguish itself is the GP hour telstar radio 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.250
 on 85 70 km that ensured that your game as a starcraft on diablo was fine 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.580
 can play what he is twice as fast as the intel now awel that is 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.880
 it of course the question how the battery life suffers under this club hour and also found 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.159
 we therefore have to be very warm when there is still free work to do 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:22.289
 the finish of ultra is very well suggested mini weissink found good firm 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.669
 on and there are some extras that you do not always see with the notebook 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:30.169
 like a full ethernet port the speakers of the manufacturer gbl but that 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.199
 should provide good sound but could not perform as well as 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.419
 you understand because it is extremely busy 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:39.349
 the keyboard of a very light plan, but a bag was found 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.349
 I am very happy 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.109
 With the series November 7, Samsung has released some summery homely me here 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.629
 me who does have hardware growing there 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.819
 abbott already six actually two questions what is the battery of this mission and again 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:00.840
 what do we actually have to pay for it?
