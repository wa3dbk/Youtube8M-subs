00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.440
 immortal tradition and art the charrería 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.050

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.790
 of our traditions and roots the 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.920
 charrería on the other hand is 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.600
 related to tailoring the

 September as charro day 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.840
 Therefore, it should be clear that the 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:07.000
 Charrería was born in the countryside and 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.980

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.959
 subsequently it arises on April 29 of 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.000

 of mexico the sport of charrería 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.879
 is listed as one of the most 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.950
 complete because it is practiced outdoors 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.049
 free and it activates all the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.359
 muscles of the body when starting the 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.189
 movement of the horse or when applying the 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.709
 force of power to be able with the animals 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.689

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.439
 of the charrería is divided into nine 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:08.349
 lots and also the skirmish the nine 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.849
 lots are named because success 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.519
 of the execution will largely depend 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.040
 of the will of the beast with which 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.169
 are going to be executed, even if there is 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.630
 enough experience in some 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.759
 Sometimes the animal does not lend itself and you 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.639
 executions are not performed with the 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.740
 showcasing and expected successes 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.379
 in the following capsules 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.749
 We will present each of the lots of
