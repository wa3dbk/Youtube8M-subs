glued into the bottom of this tray and

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.270 
glued into the bottom of this tray and
then<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.760> entire<00:03:02.880> tray<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.780> float<00:03:04.530> soaked<00:03:05.010> on

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
then the entire tray is float soaked on

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.400 
then the entire tray is float soaked on
top<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.269> water<00:03:06.510> until<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.019> foam<00:03:07.260> is

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
top of water until the foam is

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.100

completely saturated and then each of
the<00:03:10.200> elements<00:03:10.349> is<00:03:10.709> added<00:03:11.099> on<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.760> can<00:03:11.940> easily

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
the elements is added on you can easily

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.140 
the elements is added on you can easily
drill<00:03:13.410> through<00:03:13.739> or<00:03:13.980> pierce<00:03:14.370> through<00:03:14.790> this

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
drill through or pierce through this

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.660 
drill through or pierce through this
plastic<00:03:15.660> it's<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.840> very<00:03:16.080> soft<00:03:16.739> plastic<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
plastic it's a very soft plastic and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.460 
plastic it's a very soft plastic and
then<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.120> can<00:03:18.299> be<00:03:18.420> used<00:03:18.570> as<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> wall<00:03:19.049> hanging

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
then that can be used as a wall hanging

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.550 
then that can be used as a wall hanging
and<00:03:19.650> because<00:03:20.640> that's<00:03:20.910> pan<00:03:21.209> glued<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.660> those
