that<00:00:00.299> product<00:00:00.659> that<00:00:00.780> you<00:00:00.870> helped<00:00:01.079> develop

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
that product that you helped develop

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.409 
that product that you helped develop
it's<00:00:01.709> called<00:00:01.890> ta-65<00:00:02.460> mm-hmm

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
it's called ta-65 mm-hmm

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.860 
it's called ta-65 mm-hmm
explain<00:00:03.780> what<00:00:03.929> that<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.440> what<00:00:04.560> it<00:00:04.680> does

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
explain what that is and what it does

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.990 
explain what that is and what it does
t65<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.230> single<00:00:07.859> molecule<00:00:08.069> so<00:00:08.670> it's<00:00:08.790> not

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
t65 is a single molecule so it's not

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.120 
t65 is a single molecule so it's not
like<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.360> whole<00:00:09.630> ground-up<00:00:10.170> herb<00:00:10.410> it's<00:00:10.800> just

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
like a whole ground-up herb it's just

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.430 
like a whole ground-up herb it's just
one<00:00:11.400> molecule<00:00:11.610> kind<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.210> taxall<00:00:12.780> as<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> cancer

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
one molecule kind of taxall as a cancer

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.709 
one molecule kind of taxall as a cancer
drug<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:14.190> comes<00:00:14.490> from<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.790> plant<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.630> you

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
drug that comes from a plant but you

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.330 
drug that comes from a plant but you
don't<00:00:15.870> get<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.109> whole<00:00:16.260> bark<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.920> just<00:00:17.160> take

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
don't get the whole bark you just take

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.130 
don't get the whole bark you just take
the<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.640> thing<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.029> inject<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.600> for<00:00:18.779> cancer

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
the one thing you inject it for cancer

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.710 
the one thing you inject it for cancer
so<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> single<00:00:19.980> molecule<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.420> pure

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
so it's a single molecule in the pure

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.290 
so it's a single molecule in the pure
form<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:23.160> derived<00:00:23.670> from<00:00:23.820> an<00:00:24.090> herb

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
form and it's derived from an herb

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.910 
form and it's derived from an herb
that's<00:00:24.420> been<00:00:24.630> known<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.170> help<00:00:25.289> immunity<00:00:25.830> in

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
that's been known to help immunity in

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.740 
that's been known to help immunity in
longevity<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.640> thousands<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.119> years<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
longevity for thousands of years it's a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.839 
longevity for thousands of years it's a
stragglers<00:00:28.230> pointer<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.550> discovered

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
stragglers pointer so it was discovered

have<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.090> lot<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.480> patients<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.230> there's<00:00:46.440> been

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
have a lot of patients and there's been

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.319 
have a lot of patients and there's been
tens<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.370> thousands<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.730> patients<00:00:47.910> around<00:00:48.239> the

tens of thousands of patients around the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
tens of thousands of patients around the
world<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.840> appears<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.289> very<00:00:49.500> safe<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
world so it appears to be very safe and

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
world so it appears to be very safe and
my<00:00:50.879> mission<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.329> kind<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.719> get<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> message

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
my mission is to kind of get the message

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.139 
my mission is to kind of get the message
out<00:00:52.440> these<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.100> some<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> effects<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.940> how

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
out these are some of the effects is how

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.569 
out these are some of the effects is how
we<00:00:54.210> safely<00:00:54.629> manage<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.489> think

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
we safely manage it and I really think

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.560 
we safely manage it and I really think
it's<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.789> future<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.300> gonna<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it's the future it's gonna be a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.299 
it's the future it's gonna be a
game-changer<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.649> way<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.890> think<00:00:59.039> about

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
game-changer for the way we think about

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
game-changer for the way we think about
life<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.359> what<00:01:00.480> does<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.809> exactly<00:01:00.989> can

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
life and so what does it do exactly can

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.280 
life and so what does it do exactly can
you<00:01:01.500> explain<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.890> yeah<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.449> seems<00:01:03.809> to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you explain that yeah I I it seems to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.560 
you explain that yeah I I it seems to
turn<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> transcription<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
turn up the transcription of the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.210 
turn up the transcription of the
talamo's<00:01:06.840> engine<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.560> Telemachus<00:01:08.130> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
talamo's engine and Telemachus you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.390 
talamo's engine and Telemachus you
remember<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> enzyme<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.630> will<00:01:10.400> allow

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
remember is the enzyme that will allow

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.010 
remember is the enzyme that will allow
you<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> lengthen<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> wicks<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
you to lengthen the wicks or the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.789 
you to lengthen the wicks or the
diffuses<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:15.270> again<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.170> stem<00:01:16.500> cells

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
diffuses and so again like in stem cells

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.109 
diffuses and so again like in stem cells
you<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> key<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.549> will<00:01:17.670> run<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.000> engine

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you have a key that will run that engine

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.390 
you have a key that will run that engine
if<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.689> more<00:01:18.840> engine<00:01:19.320> for<00:01:19.560> let's<00:01:19.860> say<00:01:19.979> 14

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
if you have more engine for let's say 14

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.590 
if you have more engine for let's say 14
hours<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.439> stem<00:01:22.740> cell<00:01:23.150> copying<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.360> more

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
hours then the stem cell copying is more

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.630 
hours then the stem cell copying is more
efficient<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.259> more<00:01:25.409> pure<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.580> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
efficient it's more pure and some of the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.640 
efficient it's more pure and some of the
ones<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.939> we're<00:01:27.060> trying<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.630> die<00:01:27.810> are<00:01:28.380> able

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
ones that we're trying to die are able

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.590 
ones that we're trying to die are able
to<00:01:28.799> die<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.729> there's<00:01:29.880> different<00:01:30.030> kinds<00:01:30.540> of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
to die so there's different kinds of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.210 
to die so there's different kinds of
effects<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.140> some<00:01:31.320> cells<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> competitive

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
effects and some cells get a competitive

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.160 
effects and some cells get a competitive
advantage<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.850> short<00:01:33.060> time<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.049> why

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
advantage for a short time so that's why

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.569 
advantage for a short time so that's why
we<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.470> people<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.860> better<00:01:35.009> digestion

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
we see people with better digestion

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.780 
we see people with better digestion
better<00:01:36.060> mood<00:01:36.329> better<00:01:36.570> skin<00:01:37.040> for<00:01:38.040> like<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.700> an

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
better mood better skin for like that an

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.520 
better mood better skin for like that an
inducible<00:01:39.240> time<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.869> when<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.020> stop<00:01:40.200> taking

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
inducible time and when they stop taking

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.410 
inducible time and when they stop taking
it<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.979> fades<00:01:41.220> away<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.270> there's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
it it kind of fades away so there's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.969 
it it kind of fades away so there's
three<00:01:42.600> kinds<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.899> changes<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> prevention

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
three kinds of changes to prevention

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.039 
three kinds of changes to prevention
which<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.310> always<00:01:44.490> good<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.060> know<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
which is always good you know it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.660 
which is always good you know it
competitive<00:01:46.530> advantage<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.130> short<00:01:47.490> time

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
competitive advantage for a short time

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.850 
competitive advantage for a short time
days<00:01:48.450> two<00:01:48.659> weeks<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.530> there's<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
days two weeks and then there's the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.319 
days two weeks and then there's the
third<00:01:50.100> kind<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.579> really<00:01:50.790> annihilate

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
third kind when you really annihilate

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.060 
third kind when you really annihilate
bad<00:01:51.540> Queen<00:01:51.899> cells<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:52.740> they<00:01:52.860> come<00:01:53.040> back

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
bad Queen cells and then they come back

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.350 
bad Queen cells and then they come back
with<00:01:53.220> fresh<00:01:53.610> servers

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360
