hey<00:00:26.530> what's<00:00:26.740> going<00:00:26.890> on<00:00:26.980> guys<00:00:27.130> here's<00:00:27.400> my

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
hey what's going on guys here's my

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.120 
hey what's going on guys here's my
review<00:00:27.970> of<00:00:28.000> the<00:00:28.330> zero<00:00:28.600> gravity<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:29.710> the<00:00:29.920> zero

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
review of the zero gravity on the zero

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.159 
review of the zero gravity on the zero
gravity<00:00:30.190> I<00:00:30.580> went<00:00:30.820> went<00:00:30.970> to<00:00:31.030> lay<00:00:31.150> out<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.300> 45<00:00:31.870> by

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
gravity I went went to lay out a 45 by

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.860 
gravity I went went to lay out a 45 by
five<00:00:32.470> by<00:00:32.710> 45<00:00:33.280> for<00:00:33.610> dual<00:00:33.760> angle<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.300> for<00:00:34.750> those

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
five by 45 for dual angle and for those

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.210 
five by 45 for dual angle and for those
of<00:00:35.020> you<00:00:35.110> guys<00:00:35.260> that<00:00:35.500> are<00:00:35.530> using<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.040> pin

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
of you guys that are using the pin

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.250 
of you guys that are using the pin
buffer<00:00:36.520> method<00:00:36.700> that<00:00:37.420> is<00:00:37.540> a<00:00:37.570> five<00:00:37.930> by<00:00:38.230> three

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
buffer method that is a five by three

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.280 
buffer method that is a five by three
and<00:00:38.650> a<00:00:38.710> half<00:00:38.890> by<00:00:39.130> three<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.750> any<00:00:40.750> you<00:00:40.930> guys<00:00:41.050> out

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
and a half by three and any you guys out

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.750 
and a half by three and any you guys out
there<00:00:41.320> that<00:00:41.559> are<00:00:41.620> not<00:00:41.830> using<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.250> pin<00:00:42.400> buffer

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
there that are not using the pin buffer

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.700 
there that are not using the pin buffer
it's<00:00:43.000> definitely<00:00:43.540> a<00:00:43.570> great<00:00:43.870> system<00:00:44.290> to<00:00:44.350> use

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
it's definitely a great system to use

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.130 
it's definitely a great system to use
and<00:00:45.070> something<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:46.000> I<00:00:46.300> have<00:00:46.750> found<00:00:46.989> works

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
and something that I have found works

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.600 
and something that I have found works
really<00:00:47.260> really<00:00:47.530> well<00:00:47.739> I've<00:00:48.100> been<00:00:48.250> laying<00:00:48.430> out

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
really really well I've been laying out

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.250 
really really well I've been laying out
quite<00:00:48.790> a<00:00:48.820> few<00:00:48.879> balls<00:00:49.210> with<00:00:49.420> it<00:00:49.450> here<00:00:49.720> lately<00:00:49.960> is

thing<00:01:01.510> with<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.720> zero<00:01:01.900> gravity<00:01:01.960> is<00:01:02.500> its<00:01:03.190> using

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
thing with the zero gravity is its using

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.970 
thing with the zero gravity is its using
the<00:01:03.550> shake<00:01:03.820> block<00:01:04.290> HD<00:01:05.290> core<00:01:05.590> which<00:01:05.800> is<00:01:05.830> the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
the shake block HD core which is the

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.790 
the shake block HD core which is the
same<00:01:06.400> core<00:01:06.880> that<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.870> virtual<00:01:08.230> gravity<00:01:08.620> made

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
same core that the virtual gravity made

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.740 
same core that the virtual gravity made
famous<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.460> that<00:01:09.640> thing<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:09.880> just<00:01:10.210> moves<00:01:10.570> like

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
famous and that thing is just moves like

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.860 
famous and that thing is just moves like
a<00:01:10.810> truck<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:12.729> using<00:01:13.120> a<00:01:13.210> 4000<00:01:13.780> grit

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
a truck and it's using a 4000 grit

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.020 
a truck and it's using a 4000 grit
surface<00:01:14.290> with<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.530> ERG<00:01:14.979> solid<00:01:15.340> reactive<00:01:15.820> so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
surface with the ERG solid reactive so

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.080 
surface with the ERG solid reactive so
it's<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.330> same<00:01:16.800> ERG<00:01:17.800> cover<00:01:18.070> that<00:01:18.310> you<00:01:18.370> see<00:01:18.790> on

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
it's the same ERG cover that you see on

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.270 
it's the same ERG cover that you see on
the<00:01:19.990> bike<00:01:20.170> but<00:01:20.409> instead<00:01:20.710> of<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.890> Pearl<00:01:21.070> it's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
the bike but instead of the Pearl it's

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.830 
the bike but instead of the Pearl it's
the<00:01:21.430> solid<00:01:21.760> version<00:01:21.940> this<00:01:22.180> is<00:01:22.240> actually<00:01:22.720> the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
the solid version this is actually the

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.130 
the solid version this is actually the
bite<00:01:23.020> right<00:01:23.229> out<00:01:23.380> of<00:01:23.409> box<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:25.540> bite<00:01:25.869> is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
bite right out of box and this bite is

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.109 
bite right out of box and this bite is
sitting<00:01:26.530> at<00:01:26.590> 1500<00:01:27.219> polished<00:01:27.549> so<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:27.790> see<00:01:27.969> it

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
sitting at 1500 polished so you see it

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.700 
sitting at 1500 polished so you see it
is<00:01:28.240> definitely<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.780> lot<00:01:29.020> longer<00:01:29.170> I<00:01:29.380> got<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.590> take

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
is definitely a lot longer I got to take

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.560 
is definitely a lot longer I got to take
a<00:01:29.740> big<00:01:29.979> step<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.549> right<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:30.969> it's<00:01:31.299> the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
a big step to the right and it's the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.039 
a big step to the right and it's the
bite<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.930> definitely<00:01:32.350> more<00:01:32.530> angular<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:34.049> then

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
bite is definitely more angular and then

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.600 
bite is definitely more angular and then
I<00:01:35.079> went<00:01:35.259> ahead<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.560> I<00:01:35.740> pulled<00:01:36.070> off<00:01:36.250> some

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
I went ahead and I pulled off some

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.399 
I went ahead and I pulled off some
surface<00:01:37.060> on<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.600> bite<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:37.990> went<00:01:38.229> with<00:01:38.350> a

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
surface on the bite and I went with a

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.170 
surface on the bite and I went with a
thousand<00:01:39.039> grit<00:01:39.130> sanded<00:01:39.610> just<00:01:39.789> to<00:01:39.880> kind<00:01:40.090> of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
thousand grit sanded just to kind of

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.490 
thousand grit sanded just to kind of
show<00:01:40.299> you<00:01:40.360> guys<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.719> difference<00:01:41.049> and<00:01:41.170> I<00:01:41.259> was

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
show you guys the difference and I was

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.670 
show you guys the difference and I was
able<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:41.920> get<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.399> ball<00:01:42.579> to<00:01:42.610> read<00:01:43.180> earlier<00:01:43.680> but

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
able to get the ball to read earlier but

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.819 
able to get the ball to read earlier but
the<00:01:44.799> big<00:01:45.009> thing<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:46.630> compromising<00:01:47.560> making

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
the big thing is in compromising making

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.590 
the big thing is in compromising making
the<00:01:47.920> ball<00:01:48.070> read<00:01:48.280> earlier<00:01:48.640> for<00:01:48.880> this<00:01:48.969> bite<00:01:49.299> I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
the ball read earlier for this bite I

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.200 
the ball read earlier for this bite I
lost<00:01:50.439> some<00:01:50.859> of<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.009> angularity<00:01:51.700> down<00:01:51.850> Lane

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
lost some of that angularity down Lane

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.139 
lost some of that angularity down Lane
and<00:01:52.570> as<00:01:52.869> I<00:01:53.049> had<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.320> move<00:01:53.500> left<00:01:53.829> I<00:01:54.159> didn't<00:01:54.969> have

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
and as I had to move left I didn't have

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.959 
and as I had to move left I didn't have
the<00:01:55.329> same<00:01:55.539> flip<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:56.079> you<00:01:56.200> see<00:01:56.649> with<00:01:57.579> the<00:01:57.609> zero

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
the same flip that you see with the zero

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.279 
the same flip that you see with the zero
gravity<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.450> zero<00:01:58.659> gravity<00:01:58.840> I'm<00:01:59.109> actually

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
gravity the zero gravity I'm actually

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.959 
gravity the zero gravity I'm actually
left<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.979> this<00:02:00.130> bite<00:02:00.369> that's<00:02:00.609> sitting<00:02:00.850> out<00:02:00.939> a

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
left of this bite that's sitting out a

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.639 
left of this bite that's sitting out a
thousand<00:02:01.359> grit<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.689> I'm<00:02:02.049> able<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.320> create

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
thousand grit and I'm able to create

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.950 
thousand grit and I'm able to create
more<00:02:02.829> angle<00:02:03.130> down<00:02:03.280> lanes<00:02:03.579> so<00:02:03.969> it's<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.600> win-win

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
more angle down lanes so it's a win-win

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.690 
more angle down lanes so it's a win-win
I'm<00:02:05.109> able<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.439> handle<00:02:05.710> more<00:02:05.859> oil<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.429> create

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
I'm able to handle more oil and create

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.400 
I'm able to handle more oil and create
more<00:02:06.969> angles<00:02:07.359> so<00:02:07.509> that's<00:02:07.689> definitely<00:02:07.899> gonna

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
more angles so that's definitely gonna

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.840 
more angles so that's definitely gonna
be<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.710> ball<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.009> choice<00:02:09.160> when<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.520> guys<00:02:09.610> hit

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
be the ball of choice when you guys hit

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.330 
be the ball of choice when you guys hit
some<00:02:10.030> heavier<00:02:10.300> oil<00:02:10.600> patterns<00:02:10.960> in<00:02:11.860> comparing

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
some heavier oil patterns in comparing

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.890 
some heavier oil patterns in comparing
that<00:02:12.460> with<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.700> marvelous<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.510> had<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.750> move

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
that with the marvelous I had to move

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.810 
that with the marvelous I had to move
just<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.200> pinch<00:02:14.500> right<00:02:14.770> with<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.040> Marvel<00:02:15.400> s<00:02:15.550> and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
just a pinch right with the Marvel s and

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.120 
just a pinch right with the Marvel s and
square<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.630> lane<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:16.960> just<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.320> little<00:02:17.350> bit<00:02:17.800> and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
square the lane up just a little bit and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.430 
square the lane up just a little bit and
compared<00:02:18.490> with<00:02:18.580> zero<00:02:18.910> gravity<00:02:19.290> because<00:02:20.290> of

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
compared with zero gravity because of

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.760 
compared with zero gravity because of
the<00:02:20.500> energy<00:02:20.850> cover<00:02:21.850> stock<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.620> Marvel<00:02:23.620> s

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
the energy cover stock that the Marvel s

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.850 
the energy cover stock that the Marvel s
is<00:02:23.920> use<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:25.390> symmetrical<00:02:26.350> core<00:02:26.620> you

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
is use it and that symmetrical core you

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.470 
is use it and that symmetrical core you
see<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.460> marvelous<00:02:27.849> is<00:02:28.000> definitely

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
see that the marvelous is definitely

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.330 
see that the marvelous is definitely
more<00:02:28.690> even<00:02:29.080> down<00:02:29.230> Lane<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.800> doesn't<00:02:30.190> get

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
more even down Lane that doesn't get

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.800 
more even down Lane that doesn't get
real<00:02:30.550> angular<00:02:30.970> or<00:02:31.030> anything<00:02:31.209> like<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.629> it's

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
real angular or anything like that it's

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.580 
real angular or anything like that it's
just<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:32.110> nice

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
just a nice

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.009 
just a nice
even<00:02:32.980> roll<00:02:33.220> all<00:02:33.879> around<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.510> it's<00:02:34.660> definitely

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
even roll all around so it's definitely

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.320 
even roll all around so it's definitely
a<00:02:35.110> great<00:02:35.530> combo<00:02:36.099> for<00:02:36.670> those<00:02:36.819> of<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.120> guys<00:02:37.269> that

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
a great combo for those of you guys that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.030 
a great combo for those of you guys that
can<00:02:37.660> run<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.870> Marvel<00:02:38.290> s<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.800> zero

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
can run the Marvel s and the zero

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.140 
can run the Marvel s and the zero
gravity<00:02:39.250> you're<00:02:39.519> gonna<00:02:39.640> have<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.849> great

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
gravity you're gonna have a great

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.550 
gravity you're gonna have a great
one-two<00:02:40.510> punch<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.050> little<00:02:41.290> heavier

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
one-two punch on a little heavier

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.070 
one-two punch on a little heavier
volumes<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:43.209> now<00:02:43.360> you're<00:02:43.510> gonna<00:02:43.569> be<00:02:43.840> able<00:02:43.900> to

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
volumes and now you're gonna be able to

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.570 
volumes and now you're gonna be able to
see<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.470> kind<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.709> comparing<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.250> three<00:02:45.459> and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
see just kind of comparing the three and

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.160 
see just kind of comparing the three and
you<00:02:45.640> see<00:02:45.879> just<00:02:46.150> how<00:02:46.300> much<00:02:46.420> more<00:02:46.629> angle<00:02:47.019> the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
you see just how much more angle the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.690 
you see just how much more angle the
zero<00:02:47.349> gravity<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.830> able<00:02:48.069> to<00:02:48.160> create<00:02:48.459> even

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
zero gravity is able to create even

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.490 
zero gravity is able to create even
though<00:02:48.879> it<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> solid<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.840> definitely<00:02:50.319> comes

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
though it is a solid it definitely comes

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.740 
though it is a solid it definitely comes
off<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.799> spot<00:02:51.069> hard<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.640> it's<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.390> closest

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
off the spot hard and it's the closest

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.449 
off the spot hard and it's the closest
thing<00:02:52.840> I<00:02:52.989> found<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.319> awhile<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.950> zero<00:02:54.220> or

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
thing I found in awhile to that zero or

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.220 
thing I found in awhile to that zero or
two<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.819> virtual<00:02:55.390> gravity<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:55.930> we<00:02:56.080> all
