this is we were able to include more
forage<00:00:47.750> in<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:47.960> diet<00:00:48.260> which<00:00:48.829> creates<00:00:49.219> a

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
forage in the diet which creates a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.790 
forage in the diet which creates a
healthier<00:00:49.730> cow<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:50.329> is<00:00:50.780> more<00:00:51.020> beneficial<00:00:51.230> to

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
healthier cow and is more beneficial to

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.819 
healthier cow and is more beneficial to
