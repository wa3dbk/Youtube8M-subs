for<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:32.860> simple<00:02:33.160> fact<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.549> one<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.780> believe

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
for the simple fact that one I believe

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.089 
for the simple fact that one I believe
faster<00:02:37.349> response<00:02:38.349> time<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:40.080> actually<00:02:41.099> you

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
faster response time to I actually you

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.440 
faster response time to I actually you
know<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.519> doesn't<00:02:42.849> really<00:02:43.000> matter<00:02:43.269> about

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
know it doesn't really matter about

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.729
