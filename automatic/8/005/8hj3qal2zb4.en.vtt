at<00:01:00.570> least<00:01:01.039> truthfully<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.309> trying<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
at least truthfully I was trying to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.600 
at least truthfully I was trying to
purchase<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.530> t-shirt<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.739> says<00:01:04.949> team<00:01:05.309> sin

purchase the t-shirt that says team sin

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.010 
purchase the t-shirt that says team sin
again<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> couldn't<00:01:06.390> find<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.840> hot

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
again but I couldn't find it at the hot

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.170 
again but I couldn't find it at the hot
topic<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.430> i<00:01:08.460> might<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.000> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
topic here so i might have to get that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.609 
topic here so i might have to get that
online<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> meantime<00:01:09.990> i<00:01:10.200> thought<00:01:10.500> at

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
online but in the meantime i thought at

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.350 
online but in the meantime i thought at
least<00:01:10.680> i<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.130> pin<00:01:11.750> that<00:01:12.750> says<00:01:12.810> plastic<00:01:13.590> off

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.999 

so<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.930> why<00:01:19.049> i<00:01:19.080> only<00:01:19.439> got<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.770> these

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
so that is why i only got one of these

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
so that is why i only got one of these
because<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.759> only<00:01:21.030> difference<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> pin

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
because the only difference is a pin

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.539 
because the only difference is a pin
which<00:01:22.409> i'm<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.920> big<00:01:23.189> collector<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
which i'm not really big collector of

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.330 
which i'm not really big collector of
foot<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.990> very<00:01:25.229> pretty<00:01:25.530> very<00:01:25.770> well<00:01:26.040> done

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
foot a very very pretty very well done

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.870 
foot a very very pretty very well done
pin<00:01:27.350> I'm<00:01:28.350> very<00:01:28.439> first<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.490> genesect

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
pin I'm very first much the genesect

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.200 
pin I'm very first much the genesect
pins<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.450> well<00:01:30.600> but<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.409> will<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:31.979> my<00:01:32.340> way<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
pins as well but that will be my way of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.960 
pins as well but that will be my way of
showing<00:01:33.329> which<00:01:33.960> started<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.380> picked<00:01:34.850> for<00:01:35.850> my

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
showing which started I picked for my

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.039 
showing which started I picked for my
shift<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:38.220> then<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.240> three<00:01:39.659> packs<00:01:39.900> here

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
shift and then we have three packs here

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.719 
shift and then we have three packs here
and<00:01:40.200> I'll<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.470> from<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.950> oldest<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and I'll go from the oldest to the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.170 
and I'll go from the oldest to the
newest<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.390> boundaries<00:01:42.840> crossed<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:44.060> lot<00:01:45.060> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
newest so boundaries crossed a lot of
