in and we're gonna plug in our xt60
connector<00:00:51.199> or<00:00:52.199> whatever<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.980> clear<00:00:53.190> me

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
connector or whatever can I clear me

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.799 
connector or whatever can I clear me
half<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.640> power<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.270> second<00:00:54.680> right<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:59.809> you

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
half of power I'm second right so you

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.000 
half of power I'm second right so you
have<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> different<00:01:01.379> kind<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.590> connector<00:01:01.920> you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
have a different kind of connector you

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
have a different kind of connector you
can<00:01:02.129> simply<00:01:02.579> swap<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.940> those<00:01:03.120> banana<00:01:03.420> plugs

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
can simply swap out those banana plugs

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.000 
can simply swap out those banana plugs
here<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.159> can<00:01:05.159> write<00:01:05.990> anyway<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.290> yeah<00:01:07.710> let's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
here I can write anyway so yeah let's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.690 
here I can write anyway so yeah let's
look<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.250> screen<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> lipo<00:01:11.100> charge<00:01:11.400> I'm

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
look at the screen so lipo charge I'm

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.130 
look at the screen so lipo charge I'm
going<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.939> press<00:01:12.270> we're<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> select<00:01:12.840> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
going to press we're going to select you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.600 
going to press we're going to select you
know<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.619> thing<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.310> label

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
know this thing or you want to label

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.190 
know this thing or you want to label
charge<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.420> also<00:01:15.570> balanced<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
charge because it's also balanced is it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.109 
charge because it's also balanced is it
it<00:01:16.830> has<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> SWOT<00:01:17.280> Emperor<00:01:17.580> wants<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> church

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
it has a SWOT Emperor wants to church

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.980 
it has a SWOT Emperor wants to church
now<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.770> turnigy<00:01:19.770> nanotech<00:01:20.220> 2.2<00:01:20.840> 3<00:01:21.840> s

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
now this is a turnigy nanotech 2.2 3 s

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.969 
now this is a turnigy nanotech 2.2 3 s
so<00:01:22.549> 2.2<00:01:23.549> means<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> 2200<00:01:25.799> billion

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
so 2.2 means that this is a 2200 billion

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.810 
so 2.2 means that this is a 2200 billion
power<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.630> usually<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> charge<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
power so you usually want to charge a

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.590 
power so you usually want to charge a
lipo<00:01:29.820> battery<00:01:30.119> at<00:01:30.180> once<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.689> now<00:01:30.900> 1c<00:01:31.380> means

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
lipo battery at once see now 1c means

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.140 
lipo battery at once see now 1c means
basically<00:01:33.600> um<00:01:34.490> basically<00:01:35.490> what<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> written

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
basically um basically what is written

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.190 
basically um basically what is written
here<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.659> two<00:01:36.780> thousand<00:01:37.110> two<00:01:37.170> hundred

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
here if it's two thousand two hundred

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
here if it's two thousand two hundred
million<00:01:37.500> power<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:37.920> 2.2<00:01:38.520> m/s<00:01:38.729> right<00:01:39.090> so

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
million power that's 2.2 m/s right so

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.749 
million power that's 2.2 m/s right so
you<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> try<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> two<00:01:41.070> point<00:01:41.579> two

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
you want to try to the two point two

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.130 
you want to try to the two point two
amps<00:01:42.030> maximum<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.689> we're<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.930> try<00:01:43.079> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
amps maximum so we're going to try to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.310 
amps maximum so we're going to try to
shoot<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.740> two<00:01:44.369> point<00:01:45.240> two<00:01:45.600> amps<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.200> can

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
shoot that two point two amps as you can

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.359 
shoot that two point two amps as you can
see<00:01:46.470> right<00:01:46.619> there<00:01:47.030> right<00:01:48.030> we're<00:01:48.240> gonna<00:01:49.369> press

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
see right there right we're gonna press

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.889 
see right there right we're gonna press
start<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.360> we're<00:01:51.450> going<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.600> select<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
start and then we're going to select the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.139 
start and then we're going to select the
voltage<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.799> goes<00:01:53.220> through<00:01:53.670> s<00:01:53.820> three

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
voltage and this is goes through s three

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.240 
voltage and this is goes through s three
s<00:01:54.180> v5<00:01:54.659> s<00:01:54.840> whatever<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:55.950> case<00:01:56.130> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
s v5 s whatever but in this case you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.020 
s v5 s whatever but in this case you
have<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> three<00:01:56.549> 3s<00:01:57.479> right<00:01:58.460> it's<00:01:59.460> 11<00:01:59.759> point<00:01:59.939> one

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
have a three 3s right it's 11 point one

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.850 
have a three 3s right it's 11 point one
volts<00:02:00.060> total<00:02:00.840> pressure<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.110> we're<00:02:01.680> going<00:02:01.770> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
volts total pressure so we're going to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.840 
volts total pressure so we're going to
