system and it's affecting PvP so
basically<00:00:19.500> when<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.220> gear<00:00:20.730> upgrade<00:00:21.090> system

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
basically when the gear upgrade system

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.630 
basically when the gear upgrade system
was<00:00:21.930> implemented<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.710> was<00:00:22.859> like<00:00:23.070> yeah<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.550> is

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
was implemented I was like yeah this is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.210 
was implemented I was like yeah this is
going<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> be<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> good<00:00:24.390> thing<00:00:24.710> we're<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
going to be a good thing we're going to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.300 
going to be a good thing we're going to
have<00:00:26.760> more<00:00:27.060> gear<00:00:27.480> if<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:27.810> get<00:00:28.019> more<00:00:28.289> points<00:00:28.890> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
have more gear if we get more points and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.580 
have more gear if we get more points and
stuff<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:30.060> then<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> realized<00:00:31.199> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
stuff like that but then I realized that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.190 
stuff like that but then I realized that
what<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> does<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.700> basically<00:00:33.030> prolong<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
what it does is basically prolong the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.490 
what it does is basically prolong the
time<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.239> farm<00:00:36.570> your<00:00:36.870> gear<00:00:37.290> and

time that you have to farm your gear and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
something like that so they had to do

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.719 
something like that so they had to do
RPGs<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.290> order<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> best<00:02:05.159> gear

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
getting removed but I'm bit concerned

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.940 
getting removed but I'm bit concerned
because

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
because

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.809 
because
there's<00:02:14.580> no<00:02:14.790> clearance<00:02:15.330> as<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:16.280> what<00:02:17.280> he<00:02:17.550> means

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
there's no clearance as to what he means

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:26.180 
there's no clearance as to what he means
by<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.810> might<00:02:19.769> get<00:02:20.519> three<00:02:20.819> added<00:02:22.550> after<00:02:24.319> 5.2<00:02:25.319> so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
by it might get three added after 5.2 so

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.259 
by it might get three added after 5.2 so
yeah<00:02:26.700> that's<00:02:26.849> about<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:28.769> thing<00:02:28.980> is

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
yeah that's about it the thing is

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.820 
yeah that's about it the thing is
there's<00:02:30.269> not<00:02:30.480> going<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.840> be<00:02:30.959> any<00:02:31.500> gear
