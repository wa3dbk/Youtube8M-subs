00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.690
 What about the quality of shooting is nothing 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.430
 different filling in terms of the camera but air 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.190
 would be better able to cope with such a task 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.830
 as a video editing because it is much 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.780
 more screen resolution that will make 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.930
 processing the roller is much more convenient and 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.930
