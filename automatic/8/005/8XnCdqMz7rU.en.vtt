00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.450
 let's prepare a delicious cake 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.450
 three chocolates 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.150
 we begin by preparing the basis for 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.920
 which holder we have a package of cookies 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.190
 they have to be very thin as if 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.960
 they were flours 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.860
 we mix it with softened butter 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.330
 until it is firm by sandy 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.490
 We prepare a removable mold with 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.270
 baking paper and transfer the mass of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.490
 the cookies 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.500
 we crush it with a spoon until 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.130
 has spread throughout the base and not 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.230
 remain hollow melt 250 grams of 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.370
 black chocolate in 200 milliliters of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.710
 cream and 200 milliliters of milk 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.920
 that the fire is not too hot to 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.620
 do not burn while we dissolve a 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.670
 leftover curd in a glass of milk 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 trying not to leave lumps 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.620
 when the chocolate has melted 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.289
 add the curd stirring once 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.850
 when it is expected to boil it is left 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.910
 read for a few seconds to set 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.400
 all right 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.740
 we pass it to the mold it has to cover 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.930
 the whole cookie base 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.800
 we'll leave you in the fridge while 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.660
 we continue with the other layers 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.880
 with the same measures we prepare the 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.540
 layer of milk chocolate and we repeat 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.640
 the same process to transfer it to 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.280
 mold we make peel with a spoon 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.280
 so the inner layer of 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.229
 new we cover everything 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.299
 let's repeat the process with 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.430
 white chocolate this burns with 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.220
 ease so you have to ensure that 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.080
 do not drop what burned in the cake is left 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.390
 in the fridge and after 4 hours it will be 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.729
 perfectly mounted although it is a 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.159
 long and simple process of doing and is 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.340
 very good that you enjoy it and even the 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.340
 next
