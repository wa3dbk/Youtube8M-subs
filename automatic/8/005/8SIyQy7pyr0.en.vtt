00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.470
 worse 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.020
 and what really frustrates me so much 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.939
 because I try so little 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.610
 work as possible and everything back to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.010
 and it always gets worse 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.660
 I do not care what's wrong 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.730
 I'm doing a video today without me 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.580
 too overworked 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.780
 and I just want to watch with dvd 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.580
 I thought to myself okay I'll show you 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.949

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:50.610
 At the beginning we have ladies night here 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.769
 Great movie work wants to be this 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.780
 love film because this is it 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:01:00.140
 original in which the good 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.089
 quentin tarantino so let's say 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.729
 Spiritually influence very strongly 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.229
 because he has this story 11 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.700
 stolen a little rewritten 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.630
 In any case, as the movie is very 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.410
 very bloody so therefore has none 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.050
 pictures time partly really really 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.580
 from the tv comes full of good 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.070
 you have to shower again or 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.390
 so great in front of all things also one 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.700
 Great story with a very bad one 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.110
 end and and that 's what i love when to 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.030
 dramatic end is and not so 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.290
 snappy dacia end peace joy 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.230
 eggcakes and everyone is happy 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.580
 but that really has a bad end and 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.730
 united really original 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.220
 So first who looks here and the same 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.640
 in connection capital what i made 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.280
 have 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.590
 he will think of children what i watch 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.040
 because this look really shynes 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.550
 So great hammer soundtrack to great 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.150
 music and these films is from the 70s 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.630
 and 60s from japan and still 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:08.460
 top i've already shown that 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.220
 my akira kurosawa box so great 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.250
 a great movie in there like youtube or 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.530
 Bodyguard you were also hollywood 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.630
 had stolen again with last one 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.760
 standing with bruce willis just that 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.500
 same story just stop here again 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.340
 really better i have to say that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.470
 seven samurai sandro opened their foreheads 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.670
 forest and the hidden fortress so 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.980
 everything from the classic yes- last 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
 time comes that I would say 50s 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.010
 60s everything still in black and white 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.500
 and I think it's unbelievable 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.540
 movies the people did back then 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.610
 with a black and white camera and with 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.989
 the equipment 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.290
 So I've been watching flashes 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:56.190
 i once in a year i can only 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.300
 recommend then princess mononoke will 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.730
 says what's that for the kids 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.489
 Shit then I can only say hey look 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.420
 the film of the guide and nothing for 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.700
 children finds 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.380
 it gets pretty bloody it is 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.050
 not the tvversion if you are yes 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.880
 the dvd version and already incredible 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.250
 what is so partly on is in any 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.220
 fall i love watching these movies as he does 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.920
 is the type a jaromir sacchi of power 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.680
 It's always very secular movies 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.650
 the really very aesthetic film of 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.220
 from the picture and also from the story 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.360
 always very profound and also 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.590
 socially critical club thinks if 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.810
 Just stop by the lines 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.190
 reads and not only lets itself be sprayed 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.260
 you notice there's always me up there 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.910
 a social criticism behind it and 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.100
 who always gives us such a basic morality 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.110
 mediate as we do with our world 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.500
 should handle 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.910
 and I think I have a great movie 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.640
 But I can see myself too often 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.590
 do not move in then the simpsons 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.280
 the movie has each of you determined 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.220
 seen 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.660
 I was totally disappointed in the cinema that likes 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.910
 but at that time, too 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.220
 everyone expected from the film where too 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.080
 So everyone loves interest rates though 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.510
 you love the simpsons and go to the movie 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.959
 one thinks only of that must hamm areal 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.239
 more 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.989
 I have to love the movie is it must 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.459
 be great 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.160
 you go with a high 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.680
 expectant attitude to it that I at cinema 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.660
 when really shit then I found 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.370
 get him for Christmas 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.410
 my sister and yes, even if 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.130
 The one with friends comes to a two 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.370
 bierchen 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.960
 you 're really broken so already 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.120
 they have not done bad 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.000
 quite well done so finally 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.820
 something to think gandhi so one 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.960
 my favorite movies a very 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.370
 interesting figure 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.960
 and it is in front of some 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.660
 no science fiction is nothing 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.790
 the story is so unbelievable 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.820
 what this man has achieved in the world 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.880
 water has changed water and what he has 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.370
 really everything has moved that one 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.430
 it could be invented because it was 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.389
 unbelievable is what a man alone 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.160
 can cause 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.500
 with his mind with his abilities 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.889
 And this man is definitely for 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.669
 me a great source of inspiration and 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:14.710
 in the forum so where can I say 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.660
 I really care about myself 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.070
 really to take heart last times 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.199
 talk with a friend 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.820
 he meant yes would be nothing 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.580
 achieved in the long run 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.949
 I see it differently because just as well 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.370
 through the movies and books you 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:33.370
 He always returns lonely 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.380
 thoughts in down head plants and 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:40.330
 it really is something bigger 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:42.400
 growing and people really learn 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.460
 also for others to stand up for 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.130
 others' rights and for the show class 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.060
 So I love this movie 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.520
 I think I will now too 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.020
 The first thing to pull in is extremely long 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.550
 I will probably fall asleep 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.000
 then in extremely tired 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.370
 So if you know flu now 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.990
 where one only coughs and can because of that 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.270
 Do not punish me that way 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.910
 and said I want to be now but I was 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.070
 First of all , I'm here 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.979
 okay today i really hope tomorrow 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.620
 that aubry is better at going back to like 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.000
 a horny video you can and then before 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.169
 all the things the journalist in berlin 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.690
 I really wanted to be with him 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:23.220
 meet and go already and and flirting 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.220
 and all that do what you have just 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.949
 I hope I can manage that was okay that 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.869
 you already wrote the comments 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:34.039
 your favorite movies but we see 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:34.039

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:48.430
