get into a fight with them because you

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:39.939

need more than just thought to take him
down<00:00:39.979> but<00:00:40.760> I<00:00:41.800> guess<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:43.639> the<00:00:44.149> Hulk<00:00:44.329> should<00:00:44.629> be

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:44.749 
down but I guess that the Hulk should be

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:46.389 
down but I guess that the Hulk should be
the<00:00:44.870> victor<00:00:45.229> so<00:00:45.679> I<00:00:45.710> guess<00:00:45.949> that's<00:00:46.159> how<00:00:46.339> it

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
the victor so I guess that's how it

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.059 
the victor so I guess that's how it
should<00:00:46.460> be<00:00:46.579> ready<00:00:46.819> but<00:00:47.389> whore<00:00:47.719> is<00:00:48.589> a<00:00:48.649> god<00:00:49.039> of

gets the stronger he gets so I guess
it's<00:01:04.810> it's<00:01:05.810> pretty<00:01:06.110> much<00:01:06.350> um<00:01:06.740> a<00:01:07.400> close<00:01:08.330> draw

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
it's it's pretty much um a close draw

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.080 
it's it's pretty much um a close draw
between<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.380> tube<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.370> it<00:01:10.400> would<00:01:10.640> be<00:01:10.730> a<00:01:10.760> draw

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
between the tube so it would be a draw

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.150 
between the tube so it would be a draw
you<00:01:11.300> think<00:01:11.600> they<00:01:12.020> they<00:01:12.590> would<00:01:12.770> punch<00:01:13.010> each
