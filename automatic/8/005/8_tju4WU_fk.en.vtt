since<00:01:23.580> we're<00:01:23.729> demoing<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.270> we're<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.509> going

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
since we're demoing it we're just going

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
to stay in offline mode here and now
we're<00:01:28.890> ready<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.100> collect<00:01:29.400> data<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
we're ready to collect data so as you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
we're ready to collect data so as you
see<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.869> simply<00:01:34.290> contact<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> two

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
see here I simply contact the two

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.390 
see here I simply contact the two
electrodes<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.780> data<00:01:36.780> begins<00:01:37.020> recording<00:01:37.560> now

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
electrodes and data begins recording now

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.670 
electrodes and data begins recording now
there<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> slight<00:01:39.150> lag<00:01:39.479> phase<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.470> allow

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
there is a slight lag phase to allow

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.710 
there is a slight lag phase to allow
stabilization<00:01:41.610> before<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> data<00:01:42.329> starts

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
stabilization before the data starts

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810 
stabilization before the data starts
actually<00:01:42.930> recording<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.700> don't

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
actually recording and if we don't

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.120 
actually recording and if we don't
actually<00:01:45.030> record<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> full<00:01:45.899> 10<00:01:46.140> seconds<00:01:46.560> as

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
actually record for a full 10 seconds as

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.569 
actually record for a full 10 seconds as
you<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.670> gonna<00:01:47.820> let<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:50.159> data<00:01:50.369> is

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you see I'm gonna let go the data is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.200 
you see I'm gonna let go the data is
going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.880> vanish<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:53.970> not

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
going to vanish so that it is not

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.569 
going to vanish so that it is not
recorded<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.110> need<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> keep<00:01:55.590> contact<00:01:56.219> with

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
recorded so we need to keep contact with

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.550 
recorded so we need to keep contact with
the<00:01:56.759> leads<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> minimum<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.350> 10

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the leads here for a minimum of 10

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.249 
the leads here for a minimum of 10
seconds<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.070> want<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.369> sort<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> store

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
seconds so we want to sort the store

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.139 
seconds so we want to sort the store
record<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.500> possibly<00:02:02.009> analyze<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.090> data

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
record and possibly analyze this data

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.219 
record and possibly analyze this data
later<00:02:03.860> in<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> top<00:02:05.189> right<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:06.090> see<00:02:06.119> my<00:02:06.570> pulse

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
later in the top right you see my pulse

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.620 
later in the top right you see my pulse
rate<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:08.489> beats<00:02:08.640> per<00:02:08.759> minute

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
rate in beats per minute

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.890 
rate in beats per minute
and<00:02:11.430> now<00:02:12.430> we've<00:02:12.670> collected<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.180> minimum<00:02:13.570> of<00:02:13.690> 10

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
and now we've collected a minimum of 10

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.980 
and now we've collected a minimum of 10
seconds<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.290> data<00:02:14.440> let<00:02:15.010> go<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.840> let's

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
seconds of data let go of that and let's

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.310 
seconds of data let go of that and let's
take<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.170> look<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:19.360> now<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.540> see<00:02:19.750> we<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:19.900> scroll

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
take a look so now we see we can scroll

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.030 
take a look so now we see we can scroll
through<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.740> data<00:02:22.320> some<00:02:23.320> options<00:02:23.680> include

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
through the data some options include

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040 
through the data some options include
either<00:02:24.280> printing<00:02:24.820> or<00:02:24.970> viewing<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.510> PDF<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.990> the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
either printing or viewing a PDF of the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.520 
either printing or viewing a PDF of the
data<00:02:28.140> which<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.260> can<00:02:29.410> see<00:02:29.530> here<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.500> now

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
data which you can see here and so now

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.130 
data which you can see here and so now
say<00:02:32.890> we<00:02:33.010> wanted<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.310> use<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.760> as<00:02:34.600> an<00:02:34.870> iPhone

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
say we wanted to use it as an iPhone

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.560 
say we wanted to use it as an iPhone
cover<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:36.040> let's<00:02:36.070> put<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.550> iPhone<00:02:37.030> into<00:02:37.300> the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
cover so let's put the iPhone into the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.980 
cover so let's put the iPhone into the
device<00:02:41.220> snaps<00:02:42.220> right<00:02:42.400> in<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.480> now<00:02:43.630> we<00:02:43.690> have

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
device snaps right in and so now we have

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.530 
device snaps right in and so now we have
is<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.890> device<00:02:45.220> attached<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.240> iPhone

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
is the device attached to the iPhone

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.230 
is the device attached to the iPhone
with<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.170> two<00:02:47.350> leads<00:02:47.560> on<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.770> back<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:49.090> let's

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
with the two leads on the back so let's

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.960 
with the two leads on the back so let's
go<00:02:49.360> back<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.780> recording<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:51.760> now<00:02:51.850> I'm

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
go back to the recording and so now I'm

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.760 
go back to the recording and so now I'm
simply<00:02:52.330> resting<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.960> two<00:02:53.110> leads<00:02:53.350> on<00:02:53.590> my

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
simply resting the two leads on my

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.050 
simply resting the two leads on my
fingers<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.220> not<00:02:54.280> putting<00:02:54.490> an<00:02:54.640> undue<00:02:54.730> amount

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
fingers and not putting an undue amount

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.970 
fingers and not putting an undue amount
of<00:02:55.180> pressure<00:02:55.450> on<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.690> device<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.200> as<00:02:56.800> before

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
of pressure on the device and as before

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.500 
of pressure on the device and as before
we<00:02:57.190> have<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.430> slight<00:02:57.670> lag<00:02:57.880> phase<00:02:58.150> before<00:02:58.360> the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
we have a slight lag phase before the

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.410 
we have a slight lag phase before the
timer<00:02:58.720> begins<00:02:58.960> and<00:02:59.850> again<00:03:00.850> we<00:03:00.970> have<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.150> record

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
timer begins and again we have to record

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.060 
timer begins and again we have to record
at<00:03:01.600> least<00:03:01.630> 10<00:03:01.990> seconds<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.470> data<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:02.950> that<00:03:02.980> we

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
at least 10 seconds of data so that we

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.160 
at least 10 seconds of data so that we
can<00:03:03.250> then<00:03:03.370> save<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.790> look<00:03:04.570> at<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.780> later<00:03:04.870> and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
can then save it look at it later and

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.570 
can then save it look at it later and
possibly<00:03:05.650> email<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.070> ourselves<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:08.580> now

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
possibly email it to ourselves so now

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.340 
possibly email it to ourselves so now
we've<00:03:09.760> collected<00:03:10.060> enough<00:03:10.240> time<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:11.320> can

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
we've collected enough time you can

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
scroll through the data and then send it

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.630 
scroll through the data and then send it
