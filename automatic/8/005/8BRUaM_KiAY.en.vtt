00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.830
 his carport has paul kÃ¤mmerling 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.800
 visually the winter garden behind the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.019
 adapted to the house 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.109
 the wooden parts are light in the color oak 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.740
 launches the special feature here 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.699
 There is no three-sided glazing 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.210
 instead, windows were in 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.310
 Existing masonry integrates one 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.650
 former shed and pigsty 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.689
 the owner of the house has himself with jenny 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.270
 asse products to a living room for 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 plant rebuilt 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:42.420
 there is no direct house connection there 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.160
 it is an outbuilding that is 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.390
 system what they have just awesome 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.610
 that was great for me 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.059
 we started from the top then build 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.350
 down it exactly what it needs 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.780
 shed before and after the conversion on the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.850
 neighbor plot right in the picture is the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.510
 old form of the outbuilding still 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.460
 recognizable 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.670
 in a conventional winter garden the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.140
 build a house with and that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 was a freestanding building that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.560
 means you have no house wall where you 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 can connect that was the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.100
 big problem 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.420
 yes we do that at all and genesis 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.939
 have come along with me since then 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.890
 just in the middle of a 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.720
 main carrier pure so to speak the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.280
 simulated house wall and then left 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.229
 and right each have their own 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.810
 winter garden connected and thereby 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.950
 is just this year free standing 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.950
 building has just emerged 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.410
 the main carrier in the middle serves as 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.260
 House wall replacement the beam construction 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.330
 relies on existing masonry our 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.480
 Planners and architects find solutions 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.100
 for every skin type and despite the transmitter 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.990
 the builder has the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.700
 construction without problems in 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.700
 own performance 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.840
 the blanks were already there 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.250
 So all you have to do is make the holes 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.150
 Finally, before drilling and 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.890
 screw together 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.560
 once you have played the system 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.050
 no topic and it has everything wonderful 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.910
 so nothing fits where you have to 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.910
 After all, everything has to be perfect
