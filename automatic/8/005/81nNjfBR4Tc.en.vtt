00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.979
 let's see now what is the matrix of 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.570
 cross impact and multiplication 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:12.800
 applied where the classification that is 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.670
 the full name of victim that up 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.160
 now we have been seeing how to capture 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.259
 what would be a problematic situation 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.449
 using the problem tree but the 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.630
 problem tree presents among many 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.630
 limitations the fact that only 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.939
 allows us to build a list of 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.309
 causes and the effects of the problem that 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:39.320
 we are analyzing if certainly 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.660
 We can do some line that shows 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.840
 how are they fed back? 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.050
 elements we are not allowed to see the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.210
 impact if we are not allowed inside the 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:56.539
 model introduce the impact of a 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:00.199
 cause over the other and as both together 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.870
 they will impact much more within the 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.680
 problem that we are analyzing for 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.300
 overcome 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.190
 this characteristic of the tree of 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.890
 problem we can borrow a 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.890
 tool that comes to us from the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.890
 strategic planning by scenarios 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.520
 developed by my game of iu 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.860
 in france in the 70s and more 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.390
 exactly 1974 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.790
 this tool later on we are going to 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.990
 see it also has limitations the box 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.540
 of planning tools 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.000
 strategic by scenarios has some 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.830
 limitations that are related to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.030
 the fact that they were developed 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.920
 basically in 1974 a time when the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.640
 computers did not have the power that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 have at this time and certainly today 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.140
 in day what was then something 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.140
 absolutely new and useful because 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.390
 presents some limitations and can be 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.860
 can be done even with a lot 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.619
 more easily using other methods 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.909
 at this time however we are going to 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:06.170
 take advantage of this tool that exists 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.259
 Many people know it is free but not 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:15.170
 it is open source, that is, you can not 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:17.629
 modify the source of any of the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.129
 the tools that are in the box 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.720
 strategic planning that's why by 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.819
 scenario that's one of the big 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.200
 limit limitations that I see this 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.300
 we can discuss it later 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.300
 here we have an example of the interface 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.430
 it's fast and fast 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.780
 micmacs will allow us to see is 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.450
 just like the causes and even 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.140
 the effects of a given problem or of a 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.450
 set of problems that are impacted 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.130
 each other are interrelated and can 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.840
 amplify 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:55.200
 the circumstances are either harmful or 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.320
 well be positive within the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.560
 system that's why it's called impacts 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.950
 crusaders is like that mick mars helps us 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.580
 to unveil when we throw a stone in 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.860
 the water and we are seeing the expansion the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.840
 different waves that arise from the 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.420
 moment when that stone was thrown then 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.400
 likewise it will allow us to put 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:23.040
 highlight the impact on the system 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.530
 the behavior of one of his 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.940
 elements the system is conceived as a 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.640
 set of interrelated elements 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.070
 that also give us to analyze it the 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.740
 structure of that system allows us 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.520
 capture the structure of that system for 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.100
 the people who developed the same 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.500
 it is possible it is possible to understand the 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.300
 system when analyzing the structure because 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.690
 although it is true that the elements 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.070
 they change in the structure has certain 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.930
 permanence that is what today 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.240
 it's also called resilience of the 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.650
 resilience of the systems is and for more 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.660
 that there are changes in the elements these 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.910
 changes do not manifest immediately 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.640
 in the complete structure of the system if 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.340
 there is a there is a there is a there is a delay 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.100
 between one thing and another and that's what 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.260
 allows us according to what the 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.500
 people who have developed same that what 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.500
 that will allow us to understand the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.109
 behavior of the system through 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.930
 the analysis of its structure the magma 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.680
 that like all the other tools of 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.150
 the strategic perspective box 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.100
 which is another name that receives the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.950
 strategic planning by 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.210
 scenario is based on the theory of 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.430
 graphs of course to the theory of 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.430
 system in the theory of in the theory of 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.160
 graphs and uses the input matrix 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.450
 product that is also known as 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.610
 the output output matrix output that was 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.650
 developed by 10 but if one looks 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.230
 well this matrix one realizes that no 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.310
 it's more than an adjacency matrix 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.140
 and that in the context the magma is going to 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.520
 call structural analysis matrix 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.689
 let's repeat this because 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.869
 I probably said it very fast 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.209
 the magma that starts from the theory of 

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:14.779
 system obviously part of the theory of 

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:17.509
 graphs and is also based on the matrix of 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:20.389
 product input that is also known 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:24.110
 as as input developed output 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.149
 by leontief in the 50s however 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.149
 if when you look closely 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:30.679
 the product input matrix is ​​given 

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:32.880
 account that it is nothing more than a matrix of 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:35.760
 adjacency 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.010
 that is, one thing or the other in the context 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.260
 of magma this matrix is ​​going to receive the 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.300
 name of structural analysis matrix 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.370
 and that this matrix that we are going to collect 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.840
 the different elements 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.400
 the different ones 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.270
 interrelationships between the elements of 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.420
 system to in this way reveal that 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.750
 structure in the second part in the 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.390
 second video let's see how it's done 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.110
 this using the analysis matrix 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.110
 structural
