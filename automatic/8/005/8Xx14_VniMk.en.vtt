right<00:02:27.209> here<00:02:27.379> downloading<00:02:28.379> on<00:02:28.530> my<00:02:29.069> iPhone<00:02:29.519> 5

right here downloading on my iPhone 5
it's<00:02:30.659> weird<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.019> my<00:02:31.319> iPhone<00:02:31.680> 5<00:02:31.890> has

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
it's weird that my iPhone 5 has

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.789 
it's weird that my iPhone 5 has
sometimes<00:02:32.459> better<00:02:32.909> Wi-Fi<00:02:33.540> than<00:02:33.870> my<00:02:34.019> iPhone<00:02:34.470> 4s

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
sometimes better Wi-Fi than my iPhone 4s

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.410 
sometimes better Wi-Fi than my iPhone 4s
I<00:02:35.220> guess<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.849> makes<00:02:36.030> sense

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
I guess that makes sense

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.809 
I guess that makes sense
since<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> iPhone<00:02:37.230> 5<00:02:37.680> has<00:02:37.920> an<00:02:38.040> upgraded<00:02:38.250> Wi-Fi

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
since the iPhone 5 has an upgraded Wi-Fi

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.780 
since the iPhone 5 has an upgraded Wi-Fi

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
chip so disregard what I just said that

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.240 
chip so disregard what I just said that
was<00:02:41.939> kind<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.269> stupid<00:02:42.659> anyways<00:02:43.470> as<00:02:43.829> you<00:02:44.099> can

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
