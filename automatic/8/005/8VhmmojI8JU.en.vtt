are<00:00:38.160> all<00:00:38.340> based<00:00:38.730> around<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.450> lip<00:00:39.780> liner<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
are all based around this lip liner that

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.670 
are all based around this lip liner that
is<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.309> old<00:00:41.730> then<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.510> doesn't<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.410> brand

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
is so old then it doesn't have a brand

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.889 
is so old then it doesn't have a brand
name<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.190> anymore<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.239> doesn't<00:00:45.690> have<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
name on it anymore and it doesn't have a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.520 
name on it anymore and it doesn't have a
color<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.340> I'm<00:00:47.730> really<00:00:48.480> at<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> loss<00:00:48.989> when

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
color on it so I'm really at a loss when

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.590 
color on it so I'm really at a loss when
this<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.860> done<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.640> getting<00:00:51.090> quite

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600

this is done and it's getting quite
close<00:00:51.870> okay<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.100> basically<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.449> a

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
close okay so basically it is like a

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.689 
close okay so basically it is like a
darker<00:00:56.550> shade<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.680> your<00:00:58.680> lip<00:00:58.920> color<00:00:59.100> my<00:00:59.489> lip

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.540 
with my nude lips but generally it's
clear<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.200> we're<00:02:47.350> gonna<00:02:47.440> put<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:47.980> on<00:02:48.040> and
