they<00:03:11.060> will<00:03:11.090> be<00:03:11.360> coming<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.780> sec<00:03:11.810> it's<00:03:12.350> or<00:03:12.470> you

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
they will be coming in a sec it's or you

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.560 
they will be coming in a sec it's or you
know<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:12.800> bit<00:03:12.980> later<00:03:13.010> on<00:03:13.280> or<00:03:13.610> whatever<00:03:13.730> both<00:03:14.360> so

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
know a bit later on or whatever both so

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.330 
know a bit later on or whatever both so
yeah<00:03:14.720> okay<00:03:15.050> we're<00:03:15.710> not<00:03:15.800> finished<00:03:16.130> there

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
yeah okay we're not finished there

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.730 
yeah okay we're not finished there
because<00:03:16.910> we<00:03:17.450> actually<00:03:17.540> have<00:03:17.900> customization

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
because we actually have customization

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.800 
because we actually have customization
options<00:03:19.040> with<00:03:19.280> these<00:03:19.490> fireworks<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.660> we're

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
options with these fireworks so we're

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.090 
options with these fireworks so we're
going<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.020> stick<00:03:21.200> with<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.440> red<00:03:21.650> although<00:03:22.040> you

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
going to stick with the red although you

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.290 
going to stick with the red although you
can<00:03:22.310> do<00:03:22.430> these<00:03:22.580> in<00:03:22.700> any<00:03:22.820> color<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.270> want

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
can do these in any color you want

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.420 
can do these in any color you want
however<00:03:24.140> we<00:03:24.320> can<00:03:24.440> also<00:03:24.500> make<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:24.920> explosions

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
however we can also make the explosions

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.980 
however we can also make the explosions
a<00:03:25.520> little<00:03:25.760> bit<00:03:25.850> cooler<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.270> look<00:03:26.450> at<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.810> the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
a little bit cooler to look at and the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.170 
a little bit cooler to look at and the
way<00:03:27.110> we<00:03:27.260> do<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:27.800> by<00:03:28.250> using<00:03:28.520> glowstone

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
way we do that is by using glowstone

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.530 
way we do that is by using glowstone
dust<00:03:29.240> and<00:03:29.690> fire<00:03:30.080> charges<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.970> fire<00:03:32.240> charge

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
dust and fire charges so the fire charge

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.540 
dust and fire charges so the fire charge
includes<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:33.140> sort<00:03:33.590> of<00:03:33.620> increases<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.280> size

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
includes a sort of increases the size

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.210 
includes a sort of increases the size
and<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.000> power<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.690> firework<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.320> the

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
and the power of the firework and the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.010 
and the power of the firework and the
glowstone<00:03:37.670> dust<00:03:37.730> creates<00:03:38.390> a<00:03:38.510> sparkle<00:03:38.959> effect

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
glowstone dust creates a sparkle effect

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.830 
glowstone dust creates a sparkle effect
after<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.890> firework<00:03:40.280> has<00:03:40.459> been<00:03:40.610> fired<00:03:40.840> so

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
after the firework has been fired so

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.600 
after the firework has been fired so
it's<00:03:41.990> very<00:03:42.110> very<00:03:42.350> simple<00:03:42.410> once<00:03:43.070> again<00:03:43.400> what

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
it's very very simple once again what

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.520 
it's very very simple once again what
you<00:03:43.730> do<00:03:43.940> when<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.330> are<00:03:44.450> making<00:03:44.570> your<00:03:45.080> your

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
you do when you are making your your

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.860 
you do when you are making your your
fireworks<00:03:45.950> star<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.520> you<00:03:46.880> just<00:03:47.090> add<00:03:47.180> any<00:03:47.510> of

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
fireworks star is you just add any of

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.770 
fireworks star is you just add any of
these<00:03:48.050> you<00:03:48.709> know<00:03:48.830> in<00:03:49.010> with<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:49.730> crafting<00:03:50.090> so

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
these you know in with the crafting so

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.300 
these you know in with the crafting so
let's<00:03:50.989> actually<00:03:51.110> just<00:03:51.530> make<00:03:51.770> it<00:03:51.800> from<00:03:52.070> scratch

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
let's actually just make it from scratch

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.850 
let's actually just make it from scratch
because<00:03:52.730> we<00:03:52.970> might<00:03:53.180> as<00:03:53.360> well<00:03:53.680> we're<00:03:54.680> going<00:03:54.770> to

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
because we might as well we're going to

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.010 
because we might as well we're going to
go<00:03:55.010> redstone<00:03:55.700> like<00:03:55.910> fat<00:03:56.209> sort<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.780> redstone

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
go redstone like fat sort of redstone

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.320 
go redstone like fat sort of redstone
red<00:03:57.590> rose<00:03:57.860> like<00:03:58.190> that<00:03:58.489> we<00:03:58.730> got<00:03:58.850> our<00:03:58.880> gunpowder

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
red rose like that we got our gunpowder

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.630 
red rose like that we got our gunpowder
now<00:03:59.810> notice<00:04:00.140> when<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:00.290> put<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.709> glowstone<00:04:01.580> dust

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
now notice when I put the glowstone dust

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.840 
now notice when I put the glowstone dust
in<00:04:02.030> it<00:04:02.209> has<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.050> little<00:04:03.140> twinkle<00:04:03.700> text<00:04:04.700> there

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
in it has the little twinkle text there

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.160 
in it has the little twinkle text there
at<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.030> bottom<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.450> then<00:04:05.660> when<00:04:05.810> I<00:04:05.840> add<00:04:06.020> the

side the paper on the top make ourselves

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.190 
side the paper on the top make ourselves
here<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.739> flight<00:04:22.310> duration<00:04:22.610> one<00:04:23.030> large<00:04:23.870> ball

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
here a flight duration one large ball

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.950 
here a flight duration one large ball
red<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:24.890> twinkle<00:04:25.460> rocket<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.539> now<00:04:26.690> when<00:04:26.870> we

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
red and twinkle rocket so now when we

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.959 
red and twinkle rocket so now when we
fire<00:04:27.200> this<00:04:27.440> you'll<00:04:27.950> notice<00:04:28.190> there's<00:04:28.460> so<00:04:28.640> much

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:28.969 
fire this you'll notice there's so much

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.549 
fire this you'll notice there's so much
bigger<00:04:29.059> explosion<00:04:29.329> and<00:04:29.899> it<00:04:30.229> has<00:04:30.319> a<00:04:30.349> nice

00:04:30.549 --> 00:04:30.559

of<00:04:34.519> explode<00:04:35.209> a<00:04:35.239> lot<00:04:35.449> of<00:04:35.569> them<00:04:35.629> and<00:04:35.809> you<00:04:36.499> know<00:04:36.589> if

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:36.649 
of explode a lot of them and you know if

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:37.989 
of explode a lot of them and you know if
you<00:04:36.739> had<00:04:36.860> them<00:04:36.979> all<00:04:37.099> in<00:04:37.219> different<00:04:37.369> colors<00:04:37.819> it

00:04:37.989 --> 00:04:37.999 
you had them all in different colors it

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.649 
you had them all in different colors it
would<00:04:38.209> be<00:04:38.360> pretty<00:04:38.599> cool<00:04:39.129> see<00:04:40.129> that<00:04:40.339> is<00:04:40.429> it<00:04:40.459> for

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
would be pretty cool see that is it for

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.209 
would be pretty cool see that is it for
fireworks<00:04:41.659> I<00:04:41.959> know<00:04:42.289> quite<00:04:42.559> a<00:04:42.649> few<00:04:42.709> people<00:04:42.860> on

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:47.659 
of those it did take me a little while

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.409 
of those it did take me a little while
myself<00:04:48.110> oh<00:04:48.259> well<00:04:48.289> a<00:04:48.439> bit<00:04:48.879> but<00:04:49.879> yeah<00:04:49.999> moving<00:04:50.329> on

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.600 
myself oh well a bit but yeah moving on
to<00:04:50.629> the<00:04:50.659> next<00:04:51.049> one<00:04:51.169> here<00:04:51.499> there's<00:04:52.219> now<00:04:52.429> a<00:04:52.459> new

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
to the next one here there's now a new

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.789 
to the next one here there's now a new
system<00:04:53.179> for<00:04:53.209> enchanting<00:04:54.019> books<00:04:54.319> and<00:04:54.619> then

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:54.799 
system for enchanting books and then

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.589 
system for enchanting books and then
using<00:04:55.219> those<00:04:55.339> books<00:04:55.669> to<00:04:55.879> further<00:04:56.179> in<00:04:56.389> Chad

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
using those books to further in Chad

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.379 
using those books to further in Chad
weapons<00:04:57.049> so<00:04:57.829> it's<00:04:57.979> kind<00:04:58.189> of<00:04:58.249> a<00:04:58.339> strange<00:04:58.639> sort

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
weapons so it's kind of a strange sort

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.359 
weapons so it's kind of a strange sort
of<00:04:59.539> way<00:04:59.629> to<00:05:00.110> do<00:05:00.349> things<00:05:00.559> but<00:05:00.769> I<00:05:00.860> think<00:05:01.249> it's

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:01.369 
of way to do things but I think it's

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:03.489 
of way to do things but I think it's
quite<00:05:01.489> cool<00:05:01.759> because<00:05:02.719> what<00:05:02.959> you<00:05:03.049> can<00:05:03.199> do<00:05:03.319> now

00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:03.499 
quite cool because what you can do now

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:04.809 
quite cool because what you can do now
is<00:05:03.529> instead<00:05:03.979> of<00:05:04.099> having<00:05:04.279> to<00:05:04.399> enchanted

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
is instead of having to enchanted

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.429 
is instead of having to enchanted
weapons<00:05:04.939> in<00:05:05.329> here<00:05:05.509> you<00:05:05.749> can<00:05:05.899> have<00:05:05.989> the<00:05:06.110> option

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:06.439 
weapons in here you can have the option

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.009 
weapons in here you can have the option
to<00:05:06.469> enchant<00:05:06.860> books<00:05:07.069> so<00:05:08.029> for<00:05:08.509> example<00:05:08.569> all<00:05:08.929> you

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:09.019 
to enchant books so for example all you

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:10.539 
to enchant books so for example all you
need<00:05:09.169> is<00:05:09.289> actually<00:05:09.559> just<00:05:09.649> a<00:05:09.769> normal<00:05:09.979> book<00:05:10.189> and

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:10.549 
need is actually just a normal book and

00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:11.919 
need is actually just a normal book and
then<00:05:10.759> you<00:05:10.849> go<00:05:10.969> to<00:05:11.029> your<00:05:11.179> crafting<00:05:11.479> table<00:05:11.809> like

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:11.929 
then you go to your crafting table like

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:13.419 
then you go to your crafting table like
so<00:05:12.199> and<00:05:12.409> you<00:05:12.469> can<00:05:12.589> just<00:05:12.709> put<00:05:12.860> your<00:05:13.009> book<00:05:13.189> in<00:05:13.339> the

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:13.429 
so and you can just put your book in the

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:15.249 
so and you can just put your book in the
crafting<00:05:13.729> table<00:05:13.789> and<00:05:14.299> then<00:05:14.839> you<00:05:15.049> know<00:05:15.139> if

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
crafting table and then you know if

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:16.749 
crafting table and then you know if
you've<00:05:15.349> got<00:05:15.559> enough<00:05:15.829> levels<00:05:16.219> you<00:05:16.369> can<00:05:16.399> do<00:05:16.639> it

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
you've got enough levels you can do it

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.399 
you've got enough levels you can do it
and<00:05:16.969> then<00:05:17.389> you'll<00:05:17.539> see<00:05:17.689> that<00:05:17.779> this<00:05:17.899> book<00:05:18.169> now

suppose of projectile protection 3 now

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:27.339 
suppose of projectile protection 3 now
if<00:05:25.009> we<00:05:25.129> go<00:05:25.309> into<00:05:25.549> the<00:05:26.179> just<00:05:26.749> the<00:05:26.839> menus<00:05:27.139> here

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:44.239 
this system so what's the whole point of

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:46.479 
this system so what's the whole point of
that<00:05:44.419> well<00:05:45.019> when<00:05:45.499> you<00:05:45.529> actually<00:05:45.769> use<00:05:46.129> them<00:05:46.339> in

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:46.489 
that well when you actually use them in

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:48.369 
that well when you actually use them in
combination<00:05:47.029> with<00:05:47.059> an<00:05:47.239> anvil<00:05:47.449> then<00:05:48.050> you<00:05:48.199> can

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:48.379 
combination with an anvil then you can

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.189 
combination with an anvil then you can
enchant<00:05:48.529> weapons<00:05:49.129> and<00:05:49.309> stuff<00:05:49.629> using<00:05:50.629> kind<00:05:51.110> of

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
enchant weapons and stuff using kind of

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.949 
enchant weapons and stuff using kind of
that<00:05:51.349> so<00:05:51.679> if<00:05:52.099> we<00:05:52.429> had<00:05:52.579> an<00:05:52.699> efficiency<00:05:53.089> 5<00:05:53.539> book

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:53.959 
that so if we had an efficiency 5 book

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:56.409 
that so if we had an efficiency 5 book
here<00:05:54.199> and<00:05:54.409> we<00:05:54.589> had<00:05:54.769> a<00:05:54.949> diamond<00:05:55.309> pickaxe<00:05:55.729> we<00:05:56.239> can

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
here and we had a diamond pickaxe we can

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.179 
here and we had a diamond pickaxe we can
just<00:05:56.539> right-click<00:05:56.809> on<00:05:57.079> the<00:05:57.139> anvil<00:05:57.349> stick<00:05:58.099> the

00:05:58.179 --> 00:05:58.189 
just right-click on the anvil stick the

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:00.129 
just right-click on the anvil stick the
pic<00:05:58.399> in<00:05:58.579> and<00:05:58.759> then<00:05:59.209> stick<00:05:59.419> the<00:05:59.539> enchanted<00:05:59.959> book

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
pic in and then stick the enchanted book

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.899 
pic in and then stick the enchanted book
in<00:06:00.349> and<00:06:00.529> then<00:06:00.739> that<00:06:00.860> will<00:06:00.979> give<00:06:01.219> us<00:06:01.249> a<00:06:01.399> diamond

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
in and then that will give us a diamond

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:05.049 
in and then that will give us a diamond
pickaxe<00:06:02.299> efficiency<00:06:02.959> five<00:06:03.369> so<00:06:04.369> effectively

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:05.059 
pickaxe efficiency five so effectively

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:08.409 
pickaxe efficiency five so effectively
