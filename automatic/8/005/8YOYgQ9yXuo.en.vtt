the<00:02:00.450> Sam<00:02:00.659> Raimi<00:02:00.840> movies<00:02:01.320> cuz<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.619> think<00:02:01.680> at<00:02:01.890> this

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the Sam Raimi movies cuz I think at this

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.800 
the Sam Raimi movies cuz I think at this
point<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.430> all<00:02:02.520> pretty<00:02:02.820> much<00:02:03.000> assume<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
point it's all pretty much assume that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.450 
point it's all pretty much assume that
we<00:02:04.049> all<00:02:04.200> agree<00:02:04.469> they're<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> better<00:02:05.040> films
