the<00:00:26.260> reason<00:00:26.500> why<00:00:26.619> is<00:00:26.890> you<00:00:27.310> finally<00:00:27.730> have<00:00:27.910> a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
the reason why is you finally have a

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.450 
the reason why is you finally have a
good<00:00:28.330> bang<00:00:28.539> per<00:00:28.750> buck<00:00:28.779> a<00:00:29.109> lot<00:00:29.800> of<00:00:29.980> performance

good bang per buck a lot of performance

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.540 
good bang per buck a lot of performance
at<00:00:30.609> a<00:00:30.970> reasonable<00:00:31.720> price<00:00:32.110> there<00:00:32.949> is<00:00:33.100> no<00:00:33.340> way

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
at a reasonable price there is no way

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
32 I got the 128 right here they

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.499 
32 I got the 128 right here they
actually<00:01:03.190> all<00:01:03.340> perform<00:01:03.789> identical<00:01:04.390> they're

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
actually all perform identical they're

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.300 
actually all perform identical they're
just<00:01:04.660> different<00:01:04.809> capacities<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:05.680> my

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
just different capacities and my

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.920 
just different capacities and my
favorite<00:01:06.729> one<00:01:06.850> so<00:01:06.880> far<00:01:07.060> even<00:01:07.750> though<00:01:07.810> they're

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
favorite one so far even though they're

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.719 
favorite one so far even though they're
all<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.080> same<00:01:08.140> is<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.619> 32<00:01:09.010> because<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
all the same is the 32 because of the

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.760 
all the same is the 32 because of the
price<00:01:10.060> for<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.750> price<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:10.960> one<00:01:11.380> western

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
price for the price of one western

digital velociraptor drive you can get
two<00:01:13.780> of<00:01:13.810> these<00:01:13.990> 32<00:01:14.350> s<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.770> have<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.130> raid<00:01:15.400> 0<00:01:15.790> way

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
two of these 32 s and have a raid 0 way

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.649 
two of these 32 s and have a raid 0 way
array<00:01:16.600> with<00:01:16.900> 64<00:01:17.530> gigabytes<00:01:17.979> of<00:01:18.450> capacity<00:01:19.450> and

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
array with 64 gigabytes of capacity and

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:20.789 
array with 64 gigabytes of capacity and
you're<00:01:20.049> going<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.229> get<00:01:20.290> some<00:01:20.470> serious

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
you're going to get some serious

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.980 
you're going to get some serious
performance<00:01:21.460> numbers<00:01:22.180> out<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.689> these<00:01:22.810> things

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
performance numbers out of these things

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.710 
performance numbers out of these things
now<00:01:23.140> these<00:01:23.950> Patriot<00:01:24.340> warp<00:01:24.520> v2s<00:01:24.939> are<00:01:25.540> the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
now these Patriot warp v2s are the

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.179 
now these Patriot warp v2s are the
second<00:01:26.140> version<00:01:26.229> of<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.500> page<00:01:26.590> reverb<00:01:26.830> SSDs

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
second version of the page reverb SSDs

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.580 
second version of the page reverb SSDs
and<00:01:27.340> they<00:01:28.000> are<00:01:28.119> actually<00:01:28.299> very<00:01:28.869> very<00:01:29.170> fast<00:01:29.320> the

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
and they are actually very very fast the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.590 
and they are actually very very fast the
reason<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.220> they're<00:01:30.790> so<00:01:30.939> special<00:01:31.180> I<00:01:31.390> think

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
reason that they're so special I think

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.490 
reason that they're so special I think
it's<00:01:31.689> because<00:01:31.750> they're<00:01:31.960> still<00:01:32.140> using<00:01:32.259> the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
it's because they're still using the

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.920 
it's because they're still using the
jmicron<00:01:32.830> 602<00:01:33.369> controller<00:01:34.329> which<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:34.720> not

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
jmicron 602 controller which is not

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.050 
jmicron 602 controller which is not
exactly<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.710> best<00:01:35.979> controller<00:01:36.579> it's<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.939> one

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
exactly the best controller it's the one

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.219 
exactly the best controller it's the one
that's<00:01:37.090> been<00:01:37.270> giving<00:01:37.600> stuttering<00:01:37.930> problems

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
that's been giving stuttering problems

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.960 
that's been giving stuttering problems
to<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.320> lot<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.680> first<00:01:39.220> solid<00:01:39.490> state<00:01:39.700> drives

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
to a lot of the first solid state drives

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.219 
to a lot of the first solid state drives
that<00:01:40.090> came<00:01:40.270> out<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.509> first<00:01:40.540> gen<00:01:40.900> ones<00:01:41.110> that

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
that came out the first gen ones that

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.810 
that came out the first gen ones that
were<00:01:41.290> all<00:01:41.380> expensive<00:01:41.890> they<00:01:42.400> stuttered<00:01:42.790> when

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
were all expensive they stuttered when

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.700 
were all expensive they stuttered when
they<00:01:43.060> wrote<00:01:43.299> they<00:01:43.900> stuttered<00:01:44.229> when<00:01:44.259> they<00:01:44.470> read

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
they wrote they stuttered when they read

write<00:01:46.720> speed<00:01:47.020> minimum<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.100> then<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.460> really

multi-layer cell NAND memory they're

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.870 
multi-layer cell NAND memory they're
actually<00:02:01.990> really<00:02:02.020> really<00:02:02.409> fast<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.549> they're

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
actually really really fast and they're

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.639 
actually really really fast and they're
great<00:02:04.060> for<00:02:04.180> desktops<00:02:04.540> in<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.750> raid<00:02:04.899> array<00:02:05.079> or<00:02:05.350> in

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
great for desktops in a raid array or in

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
a netbook or a notebook I threw one into

a netbook or a notebook I threw one into
this<00:02:08.200> thing<00:02:08.470> I'll<00:02:08.799> tell<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.070> what<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.190> got<00:02:09.340> so

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
this thing I'll tell you what I got so

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.039 
this thing I'll tell you what I got so
much<00:02:09.790> faster<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.239> not<00:02:10.479> only<00:02:10.660> is<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.780> faster

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
much faster and not only is it faster

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.449 
much faster and not only is it faster
it's<00:02:11.709> also<00:02:11.920> lighter<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.700> produces<00:02:13.270> less<00:02:13.599> heat

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
it's also lighter it produces less heat

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.880 
it's also lighter it produces less heat
its<00:02:15.459> shockproof<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.480> all<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.530> stuff<00:02:17.650> is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
its shockproof and all that stuff is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.540 
its shockproof and all that stuff is
really

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
really

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.700 
really
really<00:02:18.850> good<00:02:19.060> for<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.540> notebook<00:02:19.870> or<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.200> laptop

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
really good for a notebook or a laptop

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.530 
really good for a notebook or a laptop
they're<00:02:21.430> also<00:02:21.550> more<00:02:21.790> efficiency<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.390> get

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
they're also more efficiency you get

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.030 
they're also more efficiency you get
better<00:02:22.780> battery<00:02:23.140> life<00:02:23.170> now<00:02:23.440> let's<00:02:23.860> talk<00:02:23.980> a

will be even faster than those numbers I
just<00:03:30.430> told<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.200> keep<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.230> in<00:03:32.590> mind

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
just told you so keep that in mind

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.040 
just told you so keep that in mind

very very high number so that's really

about these things because in fact
that's<00:04:26.140> like<00:04:26.290> 1.5<00:04:26.800> million<00:04:27.160> hours<00:04:27.880> mean<00:04:28.300> time

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010
