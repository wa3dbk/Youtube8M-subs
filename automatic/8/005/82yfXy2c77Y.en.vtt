00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
from the picture on the front there is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.530 
from the picture on the front there is
one<00:00:34.710> with<00:00:34.829> free<00:00:35.070> ports<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:35.489> well<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:36.329> comes

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
with six tips I'm not sure the tips that

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.840

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
USB port is the other way around so when

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.960 
USB port is the other way around so when
you're<00:03:06.690> challenging<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.550> you're<00:03:08.550> effectively
