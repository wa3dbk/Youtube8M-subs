00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.589
 this time we are going to make the htc 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.589
 galaxy nou 2 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.010
 let's go back first 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.010
 with the box 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.170
 comes a spare protector for the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.980
 phone display 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.189
 comes 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.189
 a liner to place the phone 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.100
 the data cable that is also part of 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.100
 of the charger 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.050
 a handsfree 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.000
 the phone charger 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.100
 come two batteries and battery 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.879
 I want to highlight 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.560
 what is a battery of 3 thousand 600 thousand 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.760
 jumper 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.140
 this favors the duration of the phone 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.620
 when it's being used mostly with 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.140
 wifi or with data plan 3600 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.010
 have two batteries let's move now to 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.010
 check the phone 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.940
 the phone comes with a 3 camera 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.150
 megapixel camera on the rear 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.010
 and 5 megapixels in the front 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.420
 what is the camera doing 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.979
 videoconferences 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.080
 or the one to use with the sky or it also has 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.780
 button on the left side of the phone 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.159
 which is to raise or lower the volume a 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.189
 button on the right side that is the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.600
 turn on the phone or turn off the display 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.600
 and the button center button 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.060
 previously it has already been recharged 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.060
 some applications to the phone 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.120
 the application that we are going to review is the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.240
 of the benchmark with which we can 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.330
 look 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.040
 the actual capacity of the phone the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:18.170
 contagiante of this phone is 12 thousand 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:21.239
 927 which corroborates that it is a telephone 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.930
 four cores let's register this 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.930
 characteristic 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.180
 phone information information 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.260
 system checks the phone comes 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:39.090
 equipped with a processor that is called 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.180
 metric 65 89 of recent technology and 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.380
 with a 4-core processor as a figure 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.830
 and 1200 megahertz 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:52.330
 the resolution of the phone is given by 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.330
 720 x 1280 pixels 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.109
 here we can also corroborate the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.110
 RAM memory available from a gig of 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.360
 ram internal memory 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.730
 a memory is also included 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.840
 internal that is for storage of 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.660
 5.5 gig data 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.150
 It should be noted that the telephone is also 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.690
 double sim card and also has a post 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.720
 to place a micro sd that can be 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:26.060
 up to 64 gigs 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.060
 here we can also check clearly 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.480
 the camera how many megapixels 12 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.220
 6-megapixel points the backside and 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.410
 the front 5 megapixel camera 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.680
 we can also observe the version of 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.660
 android which is the most recent the 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.660
 version 4.2.1 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.290
 we can also check 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.710
 in the graphics bar a comparison 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.690
 with the most significant phones in the 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:04.220
 market like him 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.620
 galaxy now 2 original the htc one x here 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.129
 is the device of us 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.390
 which is much higher than the 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:13.390
 great majority of telephones 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.540
 let's review about the phone 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.910
 the phone here we can also 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.420
 corroborate the android version and something 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:36.570
 What I want to emphasize is that the telephone 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.570
 the compilation version is from 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:45.380
 March 21 , 2013 is a phone 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.250
 very recent the capabilities of the 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.620
 phone comes with wifi comes with gps 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.560
 can do router 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.430
 it's a very complete phone 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.430
 here I finish
