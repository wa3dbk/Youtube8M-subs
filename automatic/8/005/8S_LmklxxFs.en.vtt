00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.850
 our little tour at xigmatek at 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.680
 xigmatek we start with the killers 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.840
 to 2 of the bodegas seems a little bit 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.330
 to what we saw in Enermax on his 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.330
 lab of the chantÃ´me so we had to wick 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.560
 the shape of the red of the black 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.660
 it looks a little bit of ghost 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.100
 let's say it clearly with doors 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.610
 bodybuilder and a chassis rather 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.530
 classical 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.000
 inside we go directly to see 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.430
 the watercooling kits kits 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.860
 watercooling do not have a name yet 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:52.490
 will be available in 240 mm and years 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.300
 140 mm it's pretty it's enough 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.960
 well done 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.900
 we also have the of truth a ventirad 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.890
 cpu double floor with above 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.740
 a 120 mm 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.530
 below at 80 mm and two floors two 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.950
 heat pipe stages a little bit the same 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.350
 principle on the janus so the janus we have 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.680
 a slim 120 mm heat pipe and 81 mm 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.480
 slim 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.400
 thank you well 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.760
 it may be interesting but the anthem 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.760
 vector 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.200
 we continue with the cases now 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.320
 and blue 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.869
 janus in micro-atx rather a case 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.869
 very pleasant of white with 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.340
 a lot of room inside for a 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.130
 big graphic card cage hdd in 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.860
 Classic lilac underwear and possibility 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.430
 to put two fans of 120 mm 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.910
 on the top then we assassinate 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.060
 has already noticed and seen elsewhere we have them 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.060
 pics 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.320
 we go now to a prototype did 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.080
 no name so face very clean 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.269
 aluminum we have behind the cages but 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.599
 in automatic insulating foam and 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.120
 you will see what is very funny 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.340
 it's going to take a frame here 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.840
 rather nice if we have no noise than 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.670
 the machine does not heat up 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.019
 openings close if we want to put in 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.000
 road the fans it's not 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.099
 complicated we could read near you the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.050
 see we see through the light that the 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.310
 fan gets started management 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.470
 is therefore made at the opening of 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.510
 panels then on the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.400
 midgard believes the billion we stay on 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.930
 a 2000 chassis keeps relatively 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.370
 classic we are the same on the kill this 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.740
 which actually changes is the possibility 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.270
 to charge his phone or if you have 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.680
 a lumia or the possibility it is with the 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.680
 site know what simple system for 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.670
 load suddenly the system q for 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.580
 charge your phone 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.460
 finally last novelty and not 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.140
 minus the nebula so it's kind 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.810
 of cube a little bit like we already have 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.819
 seen at silverstone or things like 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.750
 it's more compact and so 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.770
 we are not afraid of doors 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.770
 borders simply 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.920
 on the other side we see that we are going 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.710
 inside the different elements 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.810
 he raises the door it was very nice 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.230
 it was at xigmatek we are always at 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.230
