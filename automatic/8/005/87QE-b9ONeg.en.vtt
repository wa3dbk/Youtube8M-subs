 very busy character gathered today

 for the sake of a very important task which task 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.829
 today we compare your slop records 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.719
 with great asus laptops 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.440
 with torsion bars not driving anything in my 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.059
 contract g750 then i will with this asus 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.070
 and you will write for him and see what 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.079
 it turned out that we will 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.239
 compare this benchmark performance and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.309
 if you watch this video with mom she 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.850
 will understand nothing so take her 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.770
 from the screens so they are nothing we all 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.840
 we understand that these are all sorts of bagel 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.640
 Japanese and points and everything else then 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.680
 a little torn from reality but not 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.020
 less but for many gives some 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.670
 understanding about power and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.619
 computer performance so he 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.369
 Still, we will do this test 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.430
 furmark 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.710
 laptop asus scored 6200 bagels when 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.530
 this average temperature was 73 degrees 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.470
 Celsius it was a test in full hd 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.619
 she mega letters and received 14 thousand 100 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.860
 There are a lot more points 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.960
 temperature of the same 76 degrees test 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.460
 letters mark 7 professional edition 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.550
 asus g750 scored 5712 points omega pisi 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.100
 scored 6700 2 points 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.830
 bye measure productivity in 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.890
 parrots we are like normal men 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.810
 look at the speed of loading games and FPS 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.050
 they have at maximum settings for 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.060
 of this we have a beautiful edge sister and 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.420
 necrophile this one in general I played here 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.120
 k with goal on mega recording and asus g750 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.940
 measured by fps program play clown and 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.940
 The conclusion we have is such a principle fps 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.010
 the same difference is somewhere at 10 15 fps but 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.830
 still on mega psychos he was a little bit 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.740
 more and so he kept around 200 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.140
 fps painting we set the maximum 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.680
 settings that you can 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.430
 see for yourself 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.640
 tutorial booted in 12 seconds pancakes 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.180
 on mega food 12 seconds well that's an atom of 12 with 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.420
 pennies and here 199 to shit ossuse 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.330
 started in 16 seconds and on furniture from 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.410
 Sizo 16 seconds on mega recording as on 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.880
 asus g750 sisi edge too 60fps 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.080
 although it seems to me that something is here 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.580
 learn it how we make it all 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.620
 generally realistically spend it 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.200
 called folk test my favorite 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.660
 take a fast kingston flash drive on 64 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.730
 gigabyte transfer files from it to 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.310
 laptop then do the same with 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.380
 computer and measure where to get it 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.300
 sooner we 'll do the same with 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.330
 archive take archive unzip it 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.280
 here and on mega pisi we will notice time 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.610
 I remind you that this laptop is installed 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.400
 256 gig ssd disk and hard disk 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.930
 at 1 terabyte in a mobile computer she 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.100
 mega pis installed ssd letters 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.270
 780 seven hundred sixty eight gigabytes 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.030
 gigabyte and 4 terabyte hard drive and 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.709
 let's see how much speed will be 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.540
 8 gigabyte copying varies 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.690
 file from computer to flash drive happened 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.540
 per minute 36 copying 1 8 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.510
 gigabyte archive from flash drive to mega 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.670
 pis happened in 50 seconds even the most 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.730
 the operation on the laptop happened in two 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.650
 seconds faster unzipping this 8 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.569
 gigabyte archive on laptop took 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.099
 well that 48 she is mega pisi minute 45 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.170
 Thanks for watching the comparison 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.260
 most powerful mobile 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.780
 computer asus 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.569
 at the moment yes g750 and our 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.400
 school 30 kilogram mega office up to 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.349
 make your own conclusions and we went 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.540
 prepare for the next round I'm this
