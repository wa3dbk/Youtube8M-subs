this<00:01:31.350> example<00:01:31.740> does<00:01:32.070> not<00:01:32.340> produce<00:01:32.610> complex

this example does not produce complex

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.190 
you can see with the naked eye it is
fair<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.520> say<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.820> even<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.390> soap<00:01:45.630> example

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
fair to say that even the soap example

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.010 
fair to say that even the soap example
does<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.619> constitute<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.430> living<00:01:47.700> cell<00:01:48.020> indeed

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
does not constitute a living cell indeed

it holds no genetic information but it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.300 
it holds no genetic information but it
is<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> step<00:01:52.259> towards<00:01:52.470> life<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.729> non-life<00:01:54.030> a

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
popular hypothesis is that RNA preceded

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.550 
popular hypothesis is that RNA preceded

undertaken by proteins such as enzyme
function<00:02:07.910> this<00:02:08.910> would<00:02:09.119> enable<00:02:09.360> enzymes<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.349> be

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
function this would enable enzymes to be

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.800 
in life
this<00:02:14.590> also<00:02:14.800> dismisses<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.760> assertion<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.390> a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
this also dismisses the assertion that a

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.200 
this also dismisses the assertion that a
minimal<00:02:17.620> cell<00:02:17.890> needs<00:02:18.220> several<00:02:18.700> hundred

minimal cell needs several hundred

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.820 
minimal cell needs several hundred
proteins<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.340> how<00:02:21.550> about<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.170> even<00:02:23.170> if<00:02:23.350> every

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
proteins so how about this even if every
