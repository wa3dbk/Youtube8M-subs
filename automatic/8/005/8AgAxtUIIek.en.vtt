00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.590
 Good day to all and again I'm with 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.900
 by you and this time I have another 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.710
 small review for online store 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.259
 curly 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.689
 I again went to be broken on the 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:21.119
 time for my happiness and for the female and 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.939
 purely female I did not get the press 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.660
 for hair is not for the body but of course for 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.090
 faces 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 accordingly as make-up artists as a girl 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.180
 much nicer for me personally 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.600
 use some kind of cosmetic 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.670
 novelties rather than hair care 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.730
 because not so fast it can 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.010
 experience and tools for body care I 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.309
 I donâ€™t really use pretty 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.590
 Means my skin is normal not dry 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.629
 this exercise does not need therefore 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.039
 of course i'm rubbing my hands and happily 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.940
 started tests 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.710
 new form of cream and a first for me 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.710
 it would be surprising to know what it is 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.140
 firm filorga or filorga i'm honest 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.329
 saying don't even know what to call 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.860
 since i play beetles 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.860
 6 Why am I seeing this too for the first time ? 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.340
 accordingly in 1 a very useful angle 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.520
 I read it looked I found out for myself 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.000
 what is pharmacy cosmetics sold on 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.000
 in pharmacies we will see how they went 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.010
 has also already there decades of history and 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.480
 so they decided to release and not only 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:57.910
 cream but also bibi cream to and 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.970
 take care and give skin tone barley 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.560
 they advertise as a tinting cream and 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.050
 in fact, you can 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.020
 agree changes not too big 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.630
 experience with creams or myself 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.310
 I tried a little example 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.950
 essence the Kremlin is absolutely not disappointed 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.960
 you about which orange is still 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.850
 guys whose creams I would like 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.720
 continue to make a video on the topic yet 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.880
 keep silent 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.360
 in fact we can say that it is 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.240
 one of my first plans 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.750
 experiences exactly love the pen that me in 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.000
 first of all let's say so and not yet on 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.820
 does this anti age see 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.459
 but I can not say that I am already acutely 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.470
 badly need some anti-aging 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.660
 cosmetics but nonetheless the skin is already 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.850
 lost elasticity and would like to 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.750
 pull up 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.670
 promises to tighten wrinkles and other 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.790
 recover honey function somewhere through 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.820
 a week and a half for 3 uses but i 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.610
 I managed to try it for 4 days 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.240
 Therefore, such a visible effect, I do not 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.330
 noticed 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.110
 what is the first thing that loves by 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.250
 they promise that to us 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.450
 let's say I promise you drag it 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.670
 skin repair and and moisturizing and 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.380
 masking well plus of course 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.580
 anti-aging dick there is contained and 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.180
 gasoline and these uranic acid and even 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.180
 spf15 what 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.439
 actually for aged skin is pretty 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.019
 so good what a nuance 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.810
 because with age it is necessary and indeed in any 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.970
 aged skin must be protected from the sun 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.980
 spf15 exposure 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.110
 In my opinion this is exactly what 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.379
 not aggressively catch fire at the same time 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.709
 may be a slight shade of tan you 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.689
 cosine because my example of you to 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.340
 makeup 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.609
 spf50 that means when you log out 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.980
 to the park then you come back here here 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.470
 all white in a circle will later caused a 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.810
 here you just want the result later 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.510
 council with a white face tanned affair what 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.549
 also not very nice at all well, I 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.940
 I can say that before I was fond of 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.500
 tanning beds and summer you early summer on 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.090
 spring I'm here on a solarium 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.760
 in order to be as much as possible 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.770
 burned we can about her and needless 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.750
 naturally also gradually gradually 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.830
 because of my little 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.440
 amount of time chandelier 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.210
 not children, I moved a little bit away from the solarium 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.470
 but i love 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.780
 let on the skin has such a tanned color 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.850
 Certainly not talking it warmed up 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.610
 chicken who have to understand what 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.710
 even the most valuable tonalnik for them 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.280
 too light silhouette and when 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.570
 big problem and so super miracle cooper 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.490
 the cream is very cool in his packaging 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.550
 without dispenser, respectively 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.380
 keeps its property all inside and not 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.390
 get there microbial 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.160
 and to the touch it is also quite nice 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:15.390
 it means that I have the lightest shade 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.190
 number one is called basing 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.020
 if we consider it as 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.230
 tea on his hand, he looks pretty 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.440
 dark when you put it on your face and 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.010
 even here I am rubbing on his hand he 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.950
 becomes not visible and 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:36.570
 five minutes later he settles and already with 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.570
 completely merges with the hand 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.800
 so summing up I would like to say 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.520
 what is this super cool moisturizer 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.190
 tinted face cream to 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.200
 does not overload the skin is not 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.320
 masking the client out for problem 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:05.080
 skin I would not have advised his head 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.880
 about anthey thursday then nothing yet 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.220
 can't say anything definite too 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.440
 little and enjoyed but still try it 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.690
 use for two three months and 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.550
 and now probably closer to the summer I can 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.790
 fully reliably share 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.720
 I want to say thanks again 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.000
 getting warm given the opportunity 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.070
 because one hundred percent know me 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.220
 drew attention when the pharmacy 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:30.650
 cosmetics but thanks to somewhere and mom 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.900
 many things to try and advise in 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.310
 including me like this theme 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.640
 wanted to meet 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:40.430
 other products of this brand and 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.410
 accordingly, now for the summer besides 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.840
 your favorite tire is such a tonal 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.660
 cream I will definitely try again 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.480
 run from the cream I recommend it as 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.430
 tint sang well moisturizing for 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.250
 dry skin for easy easy pace 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.410
 coverage well of course there is nobody skybar 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:01.420
 coffee to new meetings and brought with 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.420
