 the sg dynamo dresden for the third 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.030
 league ahead 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.920
 following the press interview 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.400
 spoke dynamo tv with the managing director 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.530
 the spd ralf sports that the employees 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.630
 and committee representatives three days club 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.950
 granted mourning and have but said 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.940
 from thursday monster look again after 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.700
 be directed forward 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.330
 you have the thankless task one 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.280
 completely new team 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.960
 to assemble and find trainers 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.360
 how does a time planning see that 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.100
 next days from first I have the 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.660
 grief probably abbreviated for that 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.980
 a little bit more intense we are married 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.290
 Of course it's clear that on the way 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.790
 the new coach the most important 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.180
 Personality at the moment is that very much there 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.489
 a lot depends on we are in things 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.930
 skylink art of compilation optional 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.090
 Well placed so we directly 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.579
 Of course we can respond too 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.570
 that one or the other are there all 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.880
 due to the time off the shelf 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.829
 But I think that will be quite 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.240
 Seriously prepared are how fast should 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.280
 the trainer search will be completed 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.929
 rather days or weeks no that's me 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.200
 said the most important personal depends 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:19.299
 very much and there we go 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.530
 properly gas in the knowledge that one 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.969
 of course not make a quick shot 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.100
 So, like his sons, they want time 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.719
 we have to intensively test and take 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.249
 then hopefully the right one in a timely manner 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.440
 present a decision 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:32.810
 what must the new coach bring? 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.060
 yes it according to your our 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.790
 see economic opportunities with 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.260
 safety is not a trainer 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.000
 ten years of bundesliga or second league 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.470
 experience has on the other side 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.990
 we have had to rebook the giant 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.570
 be as possible in the team as possible 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.140
 to lead together quickly 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.600
 unit 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.760
 We will be some youth player boy 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.620
 players are still in the factory 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.830
 Development is about this 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.040
 to develop and that's how they are 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.800
 things, the core issues of the competent 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.420
 then the search would begin to occupy 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.340
 after new obligations resp 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.030
 to conclude contracts only if 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.130
 the new leader lars and sure so 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.500
 I am now also with the players 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.650
 stay with the talks 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.590
 have searched and therefore this is also 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.180
 Coaching staff so important in the final spurt 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.350
 The two-year-old son had one 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.430
 impression that many fans I never 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.320
 really with this team 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.520
 that could also be infected 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.810
 view of the composition of the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.410
 new team is an important criterion 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.380
 that the people in the club with the fans 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.400
 to identify the team yes 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.200
 you do not need that 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.440
 there we had a problem in the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.470
 The team has many things 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.900
 reflected 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.030
 are also in things 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.830
 look closely at the personality structure 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.800
 what the players bring with them 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.070
 bring mentality attitude and 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.410
 that is an important criterion 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.270
 because all players continue a variety 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.500
 the current squad leaves the club 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.330
 because they just can not get contracts anymore 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.530
 there are players at the moment 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.170
 you do not have a contract 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.760
 want to keep interests is natural 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.700
 there are others too 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.440
 There is also intensive talk 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.520
 circle players where you can now from the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.080
 passion for a bit more 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.630
 depending on whether you maybe 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.410
 but again the conversation is looking for 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.330
 thinking drinks was in different ways 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.430
 direction of the tat league 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.920
 includes at the moment and 28 million euros 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.510
 it is impossible with such a thing 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.310
 limited financial resources 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.930
 to give the goal back up 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.600
 I think that's not the time 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.430
 in order to define goals , we have to stop 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.320
 then we will do 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.600
 look like we are the first days and 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.980
 how to handle weeks of preparation 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.440
 It was back to the training camp 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.960
 and I think that would be too 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.030
 Orientation where one says now is that 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.720
 realistic in the forecast 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.720
 Many Thanks
