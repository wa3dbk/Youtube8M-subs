00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
spider-man game for the Gamecube I've

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.369 
spider-man game for the Gamecube I've
been<00:00:06.060> playing<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.600> few<00:00:06.839> hours<00:00:06.870> now<00:00:07.350> and

been playing it for a few hours now and

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.049 
been playing it for a few hours now and
I<00:00:07.919> think<00:00:07.980> it's<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.280> pretty<00:00:08.429> interesting<00:00:08.910> game

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
I think it's a pretty interesting game

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.390 
I think it's a pretty interesting game
so<00:00:09.389> let's<00:00:09.750> talk<00:00:09.900> about<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.320> first<00:00:11.160> things

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
so let's talk about it first things

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.129 
so let's talk about it first things
first<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.910> game<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.240> based<00:00:12.450> off<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.690> ultimate

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
first the game is based off the ultimate

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.530 
first the game is based off the ultimate
spider-man<00:00:13.530> comic<00:00:14.250> book<00:00:14.429> series<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.210> it

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
spider-man comic book series and it

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.090 
spider-man comic book series and it
shows<00:00:15.839> through<00:00:16.139> these<00:00:16.289> comic<00:00:16.710> book<00:00:16.890> style

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
shows through these comic book style

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.519 
shows through these comic book style
graphics<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:18.449> may<00:00:18.600> think<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.080> graphics

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
graphics you may think that the graphics

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.740 
graphics you may think that the graphics
just<00:00:19.619> suck<00:00:20.070> or<00:00:20.310> they're<00:00:20.850> not<00:00:21.000> really<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.390> par

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
just suck or they're not really on par

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.810 
just suck or they're not really on par
with<00:00:21.779> what<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.380> Gamecube<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.980> capable<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.580> or

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
with what the Gamecube is capable of or

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.340 
with what the Gamecube is capable of or
don't<00:00:24.180> look<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.539> good<00:00:24.750> as<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.230> other

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
don't look as good as some other

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.349 
don't look as good as some other
GameCube<00:00:25.830> games<00:00:26.070> but<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
GameCube games but it's not that the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.240 
GameCube games but it's not that the
game<00:00:27.539> graphics<00:00:27.990> are<00:00:28.199> designed<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.830> resemble

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
game graphics are designed to resemble

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.250 
game graphics are designed to resemble
the<00:00:29.580> comic<00:00:29.939> books<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.900> think<00:00:30.960> that's

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the comic books and I think that's

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.500 
the comic books and I think that's
pretty<00:00:31.380> cool<00:00:31.910> spider-man<00:00:32.910> looks<00:00:33.239> very

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
pretty cool spider-man looks very

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.600 
pretty cool spider-man looks very
detailed<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.380> game<00:00:34.620> even<00:00:34.980> more<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.399> than

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
detailed in this game even more so than

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.299 
detailed in this game even more so than
he<00:00:35.760> does<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.210> some<00:00:36.570> newer<00:00:36.899> Xbox<00:00:37.530> 360<00:00:38.190> or

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
he does in some newer Xbox 360 or

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
he does in some newer Xbox 360 or
Playstation<00:00:38.550> games<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:40.079> know<00:00:40.110> this

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
Playstation games and you know this

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.660 
Playstation games and you know this
isn't<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.710> say<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.460> game

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
isn't to say that in this game

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.209 
isn't to say that in this game
spider-man<00:00:42.239> looks<00:00:42.540> better<00:00:42.780> than<00:00:43.219> spider-man

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
spider-man looks better than spider-man

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
spider-man looks better than spider-man
will<00:00:44.579> look<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.090> newer<00:00:45.450> more<00:00:45.870> updated<00:00:46.260> games

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
will look in newer more updated games

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.200 
will look in newer more updated games
with<00:00:46.920> more<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.730> better

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
with more you know better

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.840 
with more you know better
updated<00:00:48.780> graphics<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:50.579> I'm<00:00:50.670> basically

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
updated graphics but what I'm basically

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.220 
updated graphics but what I'm basically
trying<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> say<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.629> spider-man

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
trying to say is spider-man

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.130 
trying to say is spider-man
looks<00:00:52.800> different<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.670> cool<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.600> his<00:00:54.750> own<00:00:54.870> way

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
looks different and cool in his own way

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.779 
looks different and cool in his own way
I<00:00:55.379> happen<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.610> most

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I happen to think that in most

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.490 
I happen to think that in most
spider-man<00:00:57.360> games<00:00:57.660> they're<00:00:57.930> more<00:00:58.079> concerned

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
spider-man games they're more concerned

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.170 
spider-man games they're more concerned
with<00:00:58.649> making<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.280> villains<00:00:59.609> bigger<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
with making the villains bigger and

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.420 
with making the villains bigger and
badder<00:01:00.300> than<00:01:00.480> spider-man<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.469> that's<00:01:02.129> fine

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
badder than spider-man and that's fine

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.070 
badder than spider-man and that's fine
but<00:01:02.699> don't<00:01:02.760> forget<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.300> make<00:01:03.449> spider-man<00:01:03.660> look

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
but don't forget to make spider-man look

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
but don't forget to make spider-man look
equally<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.710> cool<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.670> game<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.540> got

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
equally as cool in this game they got

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.929 
equally as cool in this game they got
that<00:01:06.869> down<00:01:07.080> pretty<00:01:07.350> well<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.010> all<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that down pretty well and all the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.910 
that down pretty well and all the
characters<00:01:09.360> look<00:01:09.659> cool<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.530> pretty<00:01:10.680> much

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
characters look cool so it's pretty much

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.179 
characters look cool so it's pretty much
even<00:01:11.840> now<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.900> gameplay<00:01:13.229> doesn't<00:01:13.740> stray<00:01:14.130> too

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
even now the gameplay doesn't stray too

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.609 
even now the gameplay doesn't stray too
far<00:01:14.460> from<00:01:14.820> other<00:01:15.299> spider-man<00:01:15.840> games<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.439> it's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
far from other spider-man games but it's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.740 
far from other spider-man games but it's
different<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.070> its<00:01:17.189> own<00:01:17.369> ways<00:01:17.670> web<00:01:18.420> swinging

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
different in its own ways web swinging

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
different in its own ways web swinging
through<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> city<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.710> fun<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.340> always<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
through the city is fun as always but it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.940 
through the city is fun as always but it
comes<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> few<00:01:21.810> complications<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> course

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
comes with a few complications of course

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.280 
comes with a few complications of course
for<00:01:23.580> example<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> web<00:01:24.270> swinging<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> little

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
for example the web swinging is a little

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.469 
for example the web swinging is a little
sloppy<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.610> attach<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:27.060> web<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
sloppy you have to attach your web to a

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.600 
sloppy you have to attach your web to a
building<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.080> order<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> swing<00:01:28.680> which<00:01:29.220> slows

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
building in order to swing which slows

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.460 
building in order to swing which slows
you<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.150> you're<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> hurry<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.990> other

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
you down if you're in a hurry in other

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.160 
you down if you're in a hurry in other
games<00:01:31.770> I've<00:01:32.220> seen<00:01:32.250> spider-man<00:01:33.090> may<00:01:33.659> swing

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
games I've seen spider-man may swing

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.609 
games I've seen spider-man may swing
directly<00:01:35.130> from<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.490> sky<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:36.570> obviously<00:01:37.380> this

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
directly from the sky now obviously this

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.380 
directly from the sky now obviously this
isn't<00:01:37.799> realistic<00:01:38.189> but<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.850> gets<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.119> around

as well which is a lot of fun the only

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.570 
as well which is a lot of fun the only
problem<00:02:29.990> is<00:02:30.110> Venom's<00:02:30.440> health<00:02:30.710> is<00:02:30.890> constantly

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
problem is Venom's health is constantly

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.280

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
back up you have to eat people now I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.270 
back up you have to eat people now I
personally<00:02:35.900> think<00:02:36.290> that's<00:02:36.470> pretty<00:02:36.890> annoying

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
personally think that's pretty annoying

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.610 
personally think that's pretty annoying
and<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.090> overall<00:02:38.450> it's<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:39.020> dumb<00:02:39.590> idea

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
and the overall it's just a dumb idea

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.040 
and the overall it's just a dumb idea
and<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.580> makes<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.970> venom<00:02:41.210> less<00:02:41.390> enjoyable<00:02:41.720> to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
and it makes it venom less enjoyable to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.410 
and it makes it venom less enjoyable to
play<00:02:42.080> as<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:43.340> game<00:02:43.520> features<00:02:43.910> many<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.300> our
