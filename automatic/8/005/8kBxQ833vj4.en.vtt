00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello all my friends my name 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.260
 Sergei 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.889
 they continue to do mod reviews for 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.750
 skyrim and today we have a very strange 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.510
 episode because today we are whole 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.770
 the castle on the tree is he in the river 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.300
 will be so find you will be it 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.070
 pretty simple but first of all I 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.170
 I would like to notice to begin with the river myself 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.960
 and as you can see it has become much greener 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.939
 or is it from my plugin for this plugin 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.500
 for nature i honestly don't know myself 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.120
 but I'm sitting on the packages nature so 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.920
 I don't guarantee him that it is from 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.630
 this house however does not seem 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.489
 the plot of it in any with accounting here such 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.440
 trees and instead of some house by 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.690
 my so instead of some house here 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.649
 just such a healthy tree which 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.649
 holds a whole lock 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.989
 the house is so small little 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.930
 tree house there hut as usual 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.370
 children build very small 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.199
 generally small anyway let's 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.559
 let's go and see what we put pressure on 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.730
 tree 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.320
 we keep looking to review 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.090
 modifications that are added at home 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.950
 because how long ago it was not 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.210
 Well, that is, it was recently quite but 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.340
 it is here in general that global 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.159
 meaning they were not very long ago probably 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.240
 somewhere with summer and so now we 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.159
 visit the fired 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.439
 squander here a little 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.600
 again because of the size of this tree 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.290
 It seems to me dimensional like that lock and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.780
 top or 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.630
 squander fps very much on principle 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.430
 like any own so all 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.520
 tree house looks like that what why 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.890
 why why why am I through through through 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:45.479
 locks and open tree houses why 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:48.000
 someone will tell me understandable or 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.299
 incomprehensible and this type of fast system 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.200
 move what oh wah god who is up 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.200
 guessed it 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.200
 Well, actually, that's all like it steals 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.830
 I think this is hundreds not not about 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.440
 textured and they are so painted yes 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.950
 they are here painted and there is some kind of lie and 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.720
 teleported well who are here street 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.710
 pretty posta Pak Pak telescope 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.130
 and that something that can move and still 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:25.740
 that we also have at the helm 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.150
 guard ok let's assume you follow don 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.050
 not bad at first glance 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.420
 besides this here from the couch you even what 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.950
 brian is a past fashion so don't 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.959
 wonder why this is not if not 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.530
 know what congregation are watching past 15 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.990
 greedily so we have something but in 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.209
 any case where a house on the house itself 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.220
 somewhere there and do it this here 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.040
 This is all I am in this very 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.530
 disappointed to be honest and the mod will be released 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.209
 really so so wear it really all 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:00.060
 but i repeat i'm very disappointed mod 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.340
 done pretty much like that for sure 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.140
 not very neatly very stupid 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.980
 I think it is unlikely to be something good they 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.790
 look let's go ahead and wait a minute 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.510
 do just what what what what what 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:25.100
 what is it like this happened 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:27.400
 why did this happen nafig 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.849
 okay 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:36.879
 may Lithuanians fight forgive me but I don’t 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:38.470
 I can generally be honest in today's 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.739
 fashion pretty disappointed and you 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.010
 see for yourself why neither nor neither 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.170
 neither neither nor neither nor neither nor neither 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.599
 I have dear friends not ours 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.000
 misunderstandings it turns out they are just 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.920
 here some with tambourines some 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.939
 be like and then you will go exactly where 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.519
 you need that is exactly to the house itself 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.879
 that's all right here there is a house waiting await 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:07.420
 guys and with whose golden ahl and 4 in any 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.739
 case trashy all anyway like this 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.720
 thats all really pour out on the very 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.829
 in fact everything is fine here except these fucking 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.599
 nippon support is still not about 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.700
 textured and taking into account too that there is no 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.440
 everything is so painted to be individual 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.870
 we have and not about me textured to 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.539
 house we estimate the names of the house inside by 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.250
 the merits I initially want to evaluate 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.610
 house and we'll see how it 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.860
 evaluate well actually this here 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.510
 values ​​equals the other side this 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.180
 I really need to find everything for her 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.710
 search by skyrim 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.560
 decoration decoration but house look plates 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.970
 the dog woke up 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:51.909
 A bit inside looks even very good 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:05:00.039
 I liked this here so much 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:05:06.270
 all the flour looks for randy and it's important 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:08.380
 even you have a pretty good pretty good 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.150
 you gave 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.810
 I am a question what the villains and he took 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:20.500
 ok fireplace 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.300
 In principle, how to say something bills something 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.490
 then there is the most common house added 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.080
 House Sochi Looks All Well, Pretty Pretty 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.150
 standard so they said you 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.979
 worth swing in general we look not 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.659
 bad house so from the tree house itself 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.400
 liked it download but I have everything 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:35.740
 time was a review on a more cool little house on 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.599
 tree and here it was really what a house 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.879
 the alchemist fell called it was real 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.169
 very beautiful and this but looked up 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.969
 looked generally I hope you 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:48.039
 I liked it though I think that it is here 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:50.560
 something like pisarro sits in Sochi 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.300
 let's complete this type of review 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.389
 chest of drawers and gifted always come here again 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.340
 not a masterpiece to review in general 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.159
