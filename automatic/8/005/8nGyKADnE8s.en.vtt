00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.850 
the font for this little menu design and
it<00:01:53.700> looks<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.180> crappy<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.229> crumbing<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it looks really crappy and crumbing and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.800 
it looks really crappy and crumbing and
not<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.369> great<00:01:56.640> looking<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.479> then<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
not really great looking but then on the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.350 
not really great looking but then on the
other<00:01:57.840> hand<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.950> said<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.790> render<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
other hand like I said this render of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.300 
other hand like I said this render of
Superman<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.110> something<00:02:01.649> I've<00:02:01.770> never<00:02:01.920> seen

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
Superman is something I've never seen

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.749 
Superman is something I've never seen
before

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
before

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.630 
before
might<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> also<00:02:03.630> mention<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.640> everything

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
might I also mention that everything

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.550 
might I also mention that everything
here<00:02:06.060> even<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.630> looks<00:02:06.899> kind<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.259> crummy

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
here even if it looks kind of crummy

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.680 
here even if it looks kind of crummy
it's<00:02:08.099> probably<00:02:08.459> because<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.479> game

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
it's probably because that if this game

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.839 
it's probably because that if this game
even<00:02:09.959> exists<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.190> early<00:02:11.489> early

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
even exists it's in early early

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.430 
even exists it's in early early
development<00:02:12.720> right<00:02:12.900> now

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
development right now

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.050 
development right now
so<00:02:13.560> everything<00:02:13.920> won't<00:02:14.070> be<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:14.370> polished<00:02:14.700> or

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
so everything won't be as polished or

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.220 
so everything won't be as polished or
great-looking<00:02:15.870> anyways<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.790> WB<00:02:18.690> Montreal

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
great-looking anyways so is WB Montreal

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.130 
great-looking anyways so is WB Montreal
making<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.980> superman<00:02:20.520> game<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.030> sure<00:02:21.840> hope<00:02:22.110> so

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
making a superman game I sure hope so

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.710 
making a superman game I sure hope so
because<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.740> think<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.940> good<00:02:24.180> hands<00:02:24.600> with

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
because I think it's in good hands with

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.240 
because I think it's in good hands with
them<00:02:24.960> especially<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.500> they<00:02:25.620> take<00:02:25.860> their<00:02:26.040> time

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
them especially if they take their time

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.040 
them especially if they take their time
on<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.670> they're<00:02:27.090> using<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.600> next-gen

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
on it and they're using the next-gen

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.630 
on it and they're using the next-gen
consoles<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.830> power<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.280> next-gen

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
consoles and the power of the next-gen

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.720 
consoles and the power of the next-gen
consoles<00:02:30.120> then<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.960> think<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:32.070> we<00:02:32.310> might<00:02:32.550> have

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
consoles then I think that we might have

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.180 
consoles then I think that we might have
some<00:02:32.790> piece<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.600> greatness<00:02:34.380> on<00:02:34.590> our<00:02:34.710> hands<00:02:35.040> on

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
some piece of greatness on our hands on

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.550 
some piece of greatness on our hands on
the<00:02:35.610> horizon<00:02:36.150> very<00:02:36.420> soon<00:02:36.780> but<00:02:37.230> what<00:02:37.380> do<00:02:37.470> you

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
the horizon very soon but what do you

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.470 
the horizon very soon but what do you
