00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.690 
really expensive are those things like
the<00:01:54.450> cacao<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.590> powders<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> moccasin

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the cacao and the powders and a moccasin

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.240 
the cacao and the powders and a moccasin
needs<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.149> exotic<00:01:57.840> things<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.680> coming

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
from other countries but I actually

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.480 
from other countries but I actually
believe<00:02:01.050> that<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.710> lot<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.890> our<00:02:02.039> nutrients

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
believe that a lot of our nutrients

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.100 
believe that a lot of our nutrients
should<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.880> should<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.390> able<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.660> come<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.020> us

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.870 
should be should be able to come to us
through<00:02:04.320> our<00:02:04.440> food<00:02:04.679> and<00:02:05.310> we're<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.729> lucky

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
through our food and we're so lucky

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.100 
through our food and we're so lucky
because<00:02:06.119> we're<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.570> Southern<00:02:06.990> California

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
