 and this was going to be the end of what you would call 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.409
 recreational because the next day I see what to do 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.620
 quotes pri aldo 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.570
 because it was the speed stage 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.450
 of the 176 that started the rally six days ago 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.640

 cocaine at home 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.769
 because it was bringing February california made especially for the first 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.969
 Venezuelans adopted this type of scanner 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.689
 in the first stage it has been very exciting there has been a united group 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.159
 eight people a lot catamaran full equipment well prepared we have been 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.159
 very very 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:47.999
 the team is very good 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:49.989
 in the last stage without problems 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.339
 the leg 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.989
 but that took me decades to stage until today they finally fix it 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.549
 they will return with great attention to what is the final feminine part of 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.499
 speed 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:03.679
 because that's where those who are tied at 43 million euros are decided 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:07.829
 those of the project 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.449
 many the remaining encounters 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.499
 in that sense east-west 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.699
 of step occurs in the city of Mexico 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.909
 the headquarters of the psoe four Mexican students 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.239
 according to your needs look at it 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.939
 it showed more solid 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.139
 I already did it in all the documents you can buy by teams 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.289
 tel 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.839
 if the unions 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.139
 the power 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.989
 the art category new plots achieved were February 3 they have 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.279
 become a year 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:45.559
 I will thank the most competitive life the number of occasions that enter them 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:49.289
 a boat that is over 70 million 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.519
 I hope it arrives much more important to arrive in this case 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:58.069
 I tried another way that we can the rain has treated us very well and what of 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.259
 the porteños alberto spencer swear to see it from another file chávez 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.369
 accepting 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:05.839
 basically from mhol lima to throw him a little hard 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:07.519
 treated very well 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.859
 nice everything in general I have 8 made the farewell but the truth that 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.249
 it would be very easy for them to come if they knew 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.680
 was benidorm 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.019
 Chávez visited spectacular that we have that we do not know the great 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.389
 Most Venezuelan 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.449
 the legend is worth coming 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.550
 they do not integrate with us I thank the sublemas level of the sidewalk opté 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.550
 for being with us 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.990
 speed stage 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.020
 65 miles from the Orinoco Yacht Club in Bolívar City to the Yacht Club 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.910
 caroní in puerto ordaz taking out all the weight of the boats and changing propellers 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.910
 to look for the speed record 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.689
 group as a side minutes before the last competition is on the cover of 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:53.639
 lucid tunnel 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.150
 I went back for all 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.139
 fast boats and we have the maximum expression of 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.800
 applied technology 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.240
 at speed over water in venezuela 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.210
 are going to leave the 17 boat approximately 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.130
 i the one that we just got from the pilots meeting does not count now the ilp is 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.809
 preparing for taken 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:16.349
 departure iniesta departure that will be wings ponce 0 0 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.529
 really in the part of greater expectation 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:23.830
 and there already in empty that to ignore to see is something left fifth in a row 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.969
 as a winner because here the one that comes out is already very difficult to go 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.810
 towards the part of the queue however admitted guiana celadon we should get 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:35.520
 to the flag to the place of the checkered flag 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.310
 what is or is not the winners d this competition will we distribute to the captain is 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.310
 and co-pilots using the lowest possible weight 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:48.199
 here yes all the security included was used 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.150
 because we're not talking jokingly that we were going to get over 120 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.610
 miles per hour 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.900
 since the return had been marked at 130 miles per hour by quito 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.900
 in 2006 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.030
 very clear neither one of the favorites also to break the record is not 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.300
 I knew I had each of these pilots under him 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.900
 hood 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.900
 and another outboard very prepared 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.279
 but they take 

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.150
 even from more back of the 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.150
 exit point to live 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:29.309
