00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
Wow this is a bigger fish but really

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:44.130 
Wow this is a bigger fish but really
having<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:37.060> go<00:04:40.830> really<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:41.920> having<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.310> go<00:04:43.080> by<00:04:44.080> two

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
having a go really is having a go by two

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.480 
having a go really is having a go by two
or<00:04:44.470> three<00:04:44.500> little<00:04:44.980> preliminary<00:04:45.220> knocks<00:04:47.490> and

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
or three little preliminary knocks and

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.330 
or three little preliminary knocks and
then<00:04:48.790> a<00:04:48.820> more<00:04:49.030> substantial<00:04:49.810> hit<00:04:50.190> I'm<00:04:51.190> gonna

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
then a more substantial hit I'm gonna

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.800 
then a more substantial hit I'm gonna
back<00:04:51.580> off<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.850> drag<00:04:52.060> a<00:04:52.090> little<00:04:52.390> bit<00:04:52.540> but<00:04:52.660> it's

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
back off the drag a little bit but it's

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.490 
back off the drag a little bit but it's
because<00:04:52.960> I'm<00:04:53.170> using<00:04:53.610> ten<00:04:54.610> pound<00:04:54.880> fluorocarbon

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
because I'm using ten pound fluorocarbon

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.700 
because I'm using ten pound fluorocarbon
or<00:04:56.500> hook<00:04:57.370> lengths<00:04:58.140> which<00:04:59.140> isn't<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.470> great<00:04:59.650> deal

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
or hook lengths which isn't a great deal

really in this kind of see in this kind
of<00:05:06.160> current<00:05:07.980> and<00:05:08.980> this<00:05:09.070> rusty<00:05:09.490> is<00:05:09.550> all<00:05:09.670> right

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
of current and this rusty is all right

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.480

for fishing heavy method feeders it's

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.270 
for fishing heavy method feeders it's
probably<00:05:12.910> a<00:05:12.970> bit<00:05:13.120> long<00:05:13.590> but<00:05:14.590> the<00:05:14.770> action<00:05:15.190> is

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
probably a bit long but the action is

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.640 
probably a bit long but the action is
incredible<00:05:17.310> at<00:05:18.310> ten<00:05:18.520> or<00:05:18.640> fifteen<00:05:19.000> feet<00:05:19.210> to<00:05:19.420> go

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650

I'm using my famous depth finder braid

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.340 
I'm using my famous depth finder braid
it<00:05:24.670> tells<00:05:24.910> me<00:05:25.090> exactly<00:05:25.120> how<00:05:25.600> far<00:05:25.870> down<00:05:26.110> on

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
it tells me exactly how far down on

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.960 
it tells me exactly how far down on
fishing<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:26.920> how<00:05:26.980> far<00:05:27.220> off<00:05:27.340> I've<00:05:27.460> got<00:05:27.640> to<00:05:27.730> come
