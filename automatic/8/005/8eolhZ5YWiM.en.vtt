00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
here we are day three in the mag bought

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.879 
here we are day three in the mag bought
three<00:00:10.580> design<00:00:11.580> phase<00:00:12.020> this<00:00:13.020> is<00:00:13.170> where<00:00:13.709> right

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
three design phase this is where right

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.689 
three design phase this is where right
so<00:00:14.100> far<00:00:14.570> this<00:00:15.570> design<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.080> based<00:00:16.530> on<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.220> mat

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
so far this design is based on the mat

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.790 
so far this design is based on the mat
track<00:00:18.320> conversion<00:00:19.320> kits<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:21.110> tonight<00:00:22.110> what

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
track conversion kits and tonight what

we're going to try to do is a finalized

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.470 
we're going to try to do is a finalized
the<00:00:28.280> placement<00:00:29.280> of<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.550> road<00:00:29.970> wheel<00:00:30.210> right

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the placement of this road wheel right

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.680 
the placement of this road wheel right
here<00:00:31.640> we're<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> trim<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> metal

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
here we're going to trim all the metal

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.549 
here we're going to trim all the metal
out<00:00:34.250> to<00:00:35.250> revolve<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.820> excess<00:00:36.180> metal<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.750> get

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
out to revolve the excess metal and get

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.540 
out to revolve the excess metal and get
our<00:00:37.679> spacings<00:00:38.399> all<00:00:39.359> correct<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:41.370> that

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
our spacings all correct so that

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.619 
our spacings all correct so that
everything<00:00:41.789> rolls<00:00:42.329> nice<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.870> smoothly

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
everything rolls nice and smoothly

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.970 
everything rolls nice and smoothly
everything's<00:00:45.629> lined<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.170> nice<00:00:46.589> and<00:00:46.620> straight

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
everything's lined up nice and straight

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.079 
everything's lined up nice and straight
and<00:00:47.899> after<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.429> now<00:00:50.429> I'm<00:00:50.640> not<00:00:50.670> put<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> little

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
and after that now I'm not put a little

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.139 
and after that now I'm not put a little
power<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.569> it<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.739> how<00:00:52.769> it<00:00:53.069> actually<00:00:53.339> how

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
power to it and see how it actually how

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.160 
power to it and see how it actually how
it<00:00:54.269> actually<00:00:54.449> rolls<00:00:55.159> once<00:00:56.159> we<00:00:56.399> finalize<00:00:57.269> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it actually rolls once we finalize the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.619 
it actually rolls once we finalize the
track<00:00:58.440> design<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:59.219> we'll<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.609> build<00:01:00.300> three

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
track design then we'll just build three

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.419 
track design then we'll just build three
more<00:01:00.839> of<00:01:00.870> them<00:01:01.019> and<00:01:01.260> figure<00:01:01.979> out<00:01:02.039> how<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> do

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
more of them and figure out how to do

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.390 
more of them and figure out how to do
the<00:01:02.519> chassis<00:01:02.819> connect<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.420> together

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
the chassis connect them all together

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.920 
the chassis connect them all together
starting<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.580> some<00:01:06.080> final<00:01:07.080> assembly<00:01:07.500> here

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
screws as you see I'm putting a lot of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.440 
screws as you see I'm putting a lot of
parts<00:01:22.050> into<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> very<00:01:22.590> small<00:01:22.680> space<00:01:23.300> if<00:01:24.300> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
parts into a very small space if you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.050 
parts into a very small space if you
notice<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:26.240> bearing<00:01:27.240> blocks<00:01:27.540> I've<00:01:28.260> cut

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
notice on the bearing blocks I've cut

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.880 
notice on the bearing blocks I've cut
bearing<00:01:30.060> blocks<00:01:30.330> down<00:01:30.720> from<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:32.400> three

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
bearing blocks down from the three

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.410 
bearing blocks down from the three
standard<00:01:34.890> size<00:01:35.130> three<00:01:35.520> hole<00:01:35.730> standard<00:01:36.210> size

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
standard size three hole standard size

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.420

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.790 

22<00:01:40.430> bearing<00:01:40.790> blocks<00:01:41.090> right<00:01:41.300> here<00:01:41.660> I'm<00:01:42.560> also

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
22 bearing blocks right here I'm also

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.440 
22 bearing blocks right here I'm also
sneaking<00:01:43.670> these<00:01:44.360> standoffs<00:01:45.080> in<00:01:45.470> between<00:01:46.450> that

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
sneaking these standoffs in between that

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.450 
sneaking these standoffs in between that
bearing<00:01:47.810> block<00:01:48.050> right<00:01:48.290> there<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:49.040> had<00:01:49.250> to

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
bearing block right there and I had to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.230 
bearing block right there and I had to
trim<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.870> inside<00:01:51.410> of<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.520> bearing<00:01:52.760> block<00:01:52.970> out

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
trim the inside of the bearing block out

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.600 
trim the inside of the bearing block out
so<00:01:53.900> that<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.380> standoffs<00:01:54.890> will<00:01:55.130> fit<00:01:55.340> down<00:01:55.460> in

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
so that the standoffs will fit down in

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.170 
so that the standoffs will fit down in
there<00:01:55.869> this<00:01:57.190> bearing<00:01:58.190> block<00:01:58.400> right<00:01:58.670> here<00:01:58.700> is

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
there this bearing block right here is

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.820 
there this bearing block right here is
going<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.570> be<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.260> main<00:02:00.530> pivot<00:02:00.920> point<00:02:02.830> this

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
going to be the main pivot point this

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.310 
going to be the main pivot point this
back<00:02:04.130> axe<00:02:04.400> this<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.910> back<00:02:05.119> axle<00:02:05.810> right

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
back axe this is the back axle right

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.180 
back axe this is the back axle right
there<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.990> here's<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.200> motor<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.950> way<00:02:10.070> that

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
there and here's the motor the way that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.370 
there and here's the motor the way that
the<00:02:10.280> motor<00:02:10.489> is<00:02:10.610> mounted<00:02:10.759> now<00:02:11.540> one<00:02:11.900> thing<00:02:11.930> that

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
the motor is mounted now one thing that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.800 
the motor is mounted now one thing that
I<00:02:12.470> have<00:02:12.709> changed<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.580> I'm<00:02:13.760> going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.209> remove

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
I have changed is I'm going to remove

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.830 
I have changed is I'm going to remove
the<00:02:15.800> clutch<00:02:16.160> which<00:02:16.610> goes<00:02:16.910> right<00:02:17.030> here<00:02:17.180> I'm

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
the clutch which goes right here I'm

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.280 
the clutch which goes right here I'm
going<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.320> go<00:02:18.410> ahead<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.620> put<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> collar<00:02:19.209> end

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
going to go ahead and put a collar end

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.729 
going to go ahead and put a collar end
right<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.440> there<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.100> going<00:02:25.370> through

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.589 

keep<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.890> axle<00:02:30.370> from<00:02:30.579> actually<00:02:31.000> pulling<00:02:31.299> out

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
keep the axle from actually pulling out

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.170 
keep the axle from actually pulling out
so<00:02:32.349> there's<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.620> lot<00:02:32.859> of<00:02:32.890> lot<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.819> stuff<00:02:34.150> going

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
so there's a lot of lot of stuff going

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.520 
so there's a lot of lot of stuff going
on<00:02:34.629> inside<00:02:35.159> very<00:02:36.159> very<00:02:36.370> confined<00:02:37.030> space<00:02:37.530> we're

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
on inside very very confined space we're

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.770 
on inside very very confined space we're
going<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.709> see<00:02:38.920> how<00:02:39.129> it<00:02:39.250> goes<00:02:42.540> what<00:02:43.540> we<00:02:43.659> have

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
going to see how it goes what we have

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.009 
going to see how it goes what we have
here<00:02:44.049> now<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.579> getting<00:02:45.579> close<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:46.120> put<00:02:46.930> this

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
here now is getting close to put this

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.030 
here now is getting close to put this
thing<00:02:47.170> together<00:02:48.689> we've<00:02:49.689> put<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.170> road<00:02:50.799> wheel

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
thing together we've put the road wheel

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.089 
thing together we've put the road wheel
on<00:02:51.510> road<00:02:52.510> wheel<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:53.019> attached<00:02:53.470> with<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.799> little

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
on road wheel is attached with a little

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.920 
on road wheel is attached with a little
section<00:02:54.819> of<00:02:54.849> that<00:02:54.939> C<00:02:55.420> channel<00:02:55.870> right<00:02:56.319> here<00:02:57.930> and

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
section of that C channel right here and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.780 
section of that C channel right here and
it<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.620> slotted<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.620> main<00:03:02.859> assembly<00:03:03.250> here

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
it is slotted in the main assembly here

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.599 
it is slotted in the main assembly here
so<00:03:04.389> it<00:03:04.569> can<00:03:04.810> be<00:03:04.989> adjusted<00:03:05.079> up<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:05.889> down<00:03:06.040> to

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
so it can be adjusted up and down to

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.129 
so it can be adjusted up and down to
adjust<00:03:06.970> for<00:03:07.739> track<00:03:08.739> stretching<00:03:09.959> we've<00:03:10.959> got

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
adjust for track stretching we've got

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.619 
adjust for track stretching we've got
the<00:03:11.260> standoffs<00:03:11.739> right<00:03:11.950> here<00:03:12.310> we<00:03:13.000> have<00:03:13.030> cut<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
the standoffs right here we have cut the

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.140 
the standoffs right here we have cut the
bearing<00:03:13.959> blocks<00:03:14.579> down<00:03:16.169> because<00:03:17.169> we've<00:03:17.319> got<00:03:17.500> so

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
bearing blocks down because we've got so

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.729 
bearing blocks down because we've got so
many<00:03:19.150> things<00:03:19.299> going<00:03:19.750> into<00:03:20.139> such<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.349> small

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
many things going into such a small

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.780 
many things going into such a small
compact<00:03:21.689> space<00:03:22.799> so<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:24.069> way<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.459> going

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
compact space so the way this is going

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:33.090 
compact space so the way this is going
to<00:03:24.970> assemble<00:03:25.919> is<00:03:28.169> motor<00:03:29.250> slides<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.489> like<00:03:30.700> that

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:41.980 

and<00:03:33.570> bearing<00:03:34.570> block<00:03:34.780> then<00:03:35.790> goes<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:37.200> like<00:03:38.200> that

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.950 

and<00:03:42.990> then<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.260> main<00:03:43.560> pivot<00:03:44.550> point<00:03:44.970> will<00:03:45.690> come

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
and then the main pivot point will come

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.210 
and then the main pivot point will come
through<00:03:46.650> these<00:03:46.980> two<00:03:47.600> bearing<00:03:48.600> blocks<00:03:49.220> two

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
through these two bearing blocks two

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.260 
through these two bearing blocks two
right<00:03:50.430> there<00:03:50.460> that's<00:03:50.910> going<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.210> actually

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
right there that's going to actually

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.020 
right there that's going to actually
pivot<00:03:51.980> then<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.160> have<00:03:53.810> axles<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:56.030> there

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
pivot then we have axles there and there

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.950 
pivot then we have axles there and there
and<00:03:57.960> there's<00:03:58.140> quite<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.590> bunch<00:03:59.510> things<00:04:00.510> packed

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
and there's quite a bunch things packed

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.240 
and there's quite a bunch things packed
into<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.290> small<00:04:01.650> small<00:04:02.400> space<00:04:03.890> this<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:04.950> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
into that small small space this is the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.820 
into that small small space this is the
final<00:04:05.700> assembly<00:04:05.910> minus<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.570> track<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:07.650> is

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
final assembly minus the track this is

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.870 
final assembly minus the track this is
the<00:04:08.160> outside<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.360> track<00:04:09.630> and<00:04:10.520> no<00:04:11.520> so<00:04:11.700> nice

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
the outside of the track and no so nice

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.820 
the outside of the track and no so nice
and<00:04:12.060> clean<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.750> there's<00:04:13.020> no<00:04:13.170> screws<00:04:13.740> or

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
and clean it is there's no screws or

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.440 
and clean it is there's no screws or
colors<00:04:16.830> or<00:04:17.070> anything<00:04:17.340> on<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.549> outside<00:04:17.940> nice

this is the drive end of it notice the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.909 
this is the drive end of it notice the
all<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.940> shafts<00:04:28.210> are<00:04:28.630> trimmed<00:04:29.110> flush<00:04:29.590> you

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
all the shafts are trimmed flush you

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.120 
all the shafts are trimmed flush you
don't<00:04:30.070> see<00:04:30.250> any<00:04:30.370> shafts<00:04:31.020> protruding<00:04:32.040> just<00:04:33.040> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
don't see any shafts protruding just a

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.150 
don't see any shafts protruding just a
simple<00:04:33.460> little<00:04:33.930> angled<00:04:34.930> bracket<00:04:35.410> it's<00:04:35.860> all

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
simple little angled bracket it's all

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.550 
simple little angled bracket it's all
I've<00:04:36.370> gone<00:04:36.580> with<00:04:36.820> right<00:04:37.090> now<00:04:37.270> for<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.350> road

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
I've gone with right now for the road

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.590 
I've gone with right now for the road
wheel<00:04:38.860> and<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.880> road<00:04:40.000> will<00:04:40.210> can<00:04:40.389> be<00:04:40.510> adjusted

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
wheel and the road will can be adjusted

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.640 
wheel and the road will can be adjusted
up<00:04:40.990> or<00:04:41.110> down<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:42.370> it<00:04:42.600> compensate<00:04:43.600> for<00:04:44.020> any

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
up or down to it compensate for any

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.220 
up or down to it compensate for any
stretching<00:04:45.070> they<00:04:45.280> may<00:04:45.430> occur<00:04:45.730> so<00:04:46.720> that's<00:04:46.960> nice

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
stretching they may occur so that's nice

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.879 
stretching they may occur so that's nice
and<00:04:47.440> clean<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:49.270> standoffs<00:04:50.260> that<00:04:50.560> actually

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
and clean the standoffs that actually

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.950 
and clean the standoffs that actually
hold<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.250> assembly<00:04:51.669> together<00:04:51.820> to<00:04:52.389> stand<00:04:52.690> offs

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
hold the assembly together to stand offs

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.140 
hold the assembly together to stand offs
right<00:04:53.919> there<00:04:54.510> they<00:04:55.510> give<00:04:55.690> it

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
right there they give it

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.530 
right there they give it
a<00:04:57.180> lot<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.870> structural<00:04:58.380> support<00:04:59.540> there's

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
a lot of structural support there's

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.770 
a lot of structural support there's
actual<00:05:01.230> drive<00:05:01.500> wheels<00:05:01.830> right<00:05:02.100> here<00:05:02.480> okay<00:05:03.480> a

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
actual drive wheels right here okay a

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.380 
actual drive wheels right here okay a
little<00:05:04.350> slop<00:05:04.770> in<00:05:04.950> them<00:05:05.100> hopefully<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.270> won't

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
little slop in them hopefully that won't

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.870 
little slop in them hopefully that won't
cause<00:05:06.660> any<00:05:06.690> problems<00:05:07.260> I<00:05:07.350> can<00:05:07.530> shim<00:05:08.400> those<00:05:08.640> out

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
cause any problems I can shim those out

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.810 
cause any problems I can shim those out
if<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:09.990> need<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.590> think<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:11.130> tracks<00:05:11.460> going<00:05:11.700> to

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
if I need to I think the tracks going to

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.370 
if I need to I think the tracks going to
keep<00:05:12.390> them<00:05:12.600> nice<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.170> tight<00:05:13.650> in<00:05:13.800> place<00:05:14.070> and

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
keep them nice and tight in place and

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.370 
keep them nice and tight in place and
again<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.530> motor<00:05:16.740> sunk<00:05:17.340> down<00:05:17.520> in<00:05:17.670> the<00:05:17.760> bottom

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
again the motor sunk down in the bottom

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.320 
again the motor sunk down in the bottom
so<00:05:19.380> I'm<00:05:19.440> going<00:05:19.560> to<00:05:19.590> put<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.800> track<00:05:20.100> on<00:05:20.340> here<00:05:20.640> so

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
so I'm going to put the track on here so

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.680 
so I'm going to put the track on here so
you<00:05:21.390> can<00:05:21.630> see<00:05:21.660> exactly<00:05:22.910> how<00:05:23.910> this<00:05:24.210> is<00:05:24.360> going<00:05:24.600> to

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
you can see exactly how this is going to

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:38.620 
you can see exactly how this is going to
look

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.870 

so<00:05:39.290> there<00:05:39.710> we<00:05:39.890> go

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.530 

that's<00:05:43.480> the<00:05:43.660> outside

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:06:00.550 

this<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.380> business<00:05:47.710> end<00:05:47.890> right<00:05:48.130> here

so imagine four of these
maybe<00:06:31.580> six<00:06:32.030> of<00:06:32.210> these<00:06:32.530> depends<00:06:33.530> on<00:06:33.590> how

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
maybe six of these depends on how
