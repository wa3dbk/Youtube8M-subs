00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
continue doing when we fried it up I

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
continue doing when we fried it up I
will<00:00:51.719> say<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> little<00:00:52.649> difficult

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
will say that it was a little difficult

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.369 
will say that it was a little difficult
in<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> frying<00:00:53.910> pan<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.930> piece<00:00:55.170> is

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
in the frying pan if the piece is

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
in the frying pan if the piece is
touched<00:00:55.739> they<00:00:56.520> wanted<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> stick<00:00:57.239> together

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
touched they wanted to stick together

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.049 
touched they wanted to stick together
quite<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:59.340> broke<00:00:59.520> apart<00:00:59.579> very

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
quite a bit and they broke apart very

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.779 
quite a bit and they broke apart very
easily<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.780> you'll<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.280> careful<00:01:02.670> when

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
easily so you'll have to be careful when

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.160 
easily so you'll have to be careful when
you're<00:01:02.910> frying<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.600> we<00:01:03.690> did<00:01:03.930> use<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.300 
you're frying it and we did use the
thick<00:01:04.559> sliced<00:01:04.890> bacon<00:01:05.510> but<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.689> taste<00:01:06.990> is
