whatever but traditional micro USB
charges<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.600> fine<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.829> have

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
charges it just fine and there you have

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.020 
charges it just fine and there you have
another<00:00:47.070> cable<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.610> go<00:00:47.700> along<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.210> so

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
another cable to go along with it so

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.250 
another cable to go along with it so

here<00:05:25.140> it<00:05:25.230> is<00:05:25.320> how<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.530> do<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.830> on<00:05:25.950> a<00:05:25.980> webpage<00:05:26.430> so

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
here it is how you do it on a webpage so

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.190 
here it is how you do it on a webpage so
you<00:05:26.880> see<00:05:27.000> it<00:05:27.090> takes<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:27.300> screenshot<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:27.990> starts

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
you see it takes a screenshot and starts

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.930 
you see it takes a screenshot and starts
drawing<00:05:28.410> I'm<00:05:29.100> getting<00:05:29.400> a<00:05:29.460> little<00:05:29.550> more<00:05:29.760> used

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
drawing I'm getting a little more used

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.910 
drawing I'm getting a little more used
to<00:05:30.060> it<00:05:30.150> but<00:05:30.270> at<00:05:30.390> first<00:05:30.540> it<00:05:30.780> was<00:05:30.900> almost<00:05:31.470> like

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
to it but at first it was almost like

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.330 
to it but at first it was almost like
like<00:05:32.310> metal<00:05:32.760> on<00:05:32.910> glass<00:05:33.620> yeah<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:35.100> mean<00:05:35.220> that's

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
like metal on glass yeah I mean that's

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.800 
like metal on glass yeah I mean that's
not<00:05:35.520> what<00:05:35.790> it<00:05:35.940> is<00:05:35.970> but<00:05:36.270> that's<00:05:36.360> kind<00:05:36.600> of<00:05:36.630> how<00:05:36.720> it

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
not what it is but that's kind of how it

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.210 
not what it is but that's kind of how it
felt<00:05:37.140> to<00:05:37.200> me<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.560> it<00:05:37.650> was<00:05:37.740> really<00:05:38.100> just

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
felt to me and it was really just

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.850 
felt to me and it was really just
jarring<00:05:38.760> on<00:05:38.880> my<00:05:39.060> teeth<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.750> didn't<00:05:40.410> enjoy<00:05:40.680> it

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
jarring on my teeth and didn't enjoy it

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.860 
jarring on my teeth and didn't enjoy it

let's see so there's a web browser by
the<00:05:47.310> way<00:05:47.490> so<00:05:47.820> a<00:05:47.880> pretty<00:05:48.300> standard<00:05:48.870> web<00:05:49.050> browser

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.320 
that is the micro SD card slot no
removable<00:07:02.830> battery<00:07:03.190> you<00:07:04.000> know<00:07:04.120> we're<00:07:04.270> okay

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
removable battery you know we're okay

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.930 
removable battery you know we're okay
with<00:07:04.630> that<00:07:04.780> I<00:07:04.810> guess<00:07:05.280> the<00:07:06.280> battery<00:07:06.610> should<00:07:06.639> be

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
with that I guess the battery should be

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.460 
with that I guess the battery should be
big<00:07:07.120> enough<00:07:07.150> to<00:07:07.389> a<00:07:07.570> key<00:07:07.840> through<00:07:08.169> the<00:07:08.260> day<00:07:08.440> I

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
big enough to a key through the day I

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.940 
big enough to a key through the day I
would<00:07:08.889> think<00:07:09.840> but<00:07:10.840> that<00:07:11.050> is<00:07:11.169> your<00:07:11.320> micro<00:07:11.590> SD

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:11.950 
would think but that is your micro SD

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.340 
would think but that is your micro SD
