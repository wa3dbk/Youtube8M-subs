every time they back out of a game or

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.709 
every time they back out of a game or
dashboard<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.390> don't<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.600> what

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
dashboard if you don't know what

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.180

dashboarding<00:00:52.350> or<00:00:52.469> backing<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> game

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
dashboarding or backing out of the game

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.420 
dashboarding or backing out of the game
is<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.579> basically<00:00:54.800> getting<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> game

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
is is basically getting out of the game

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.160 
is is basically getting out of the game
and<00:00:56.780> then<00:00:59.000> the<00:01:00.000> score<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.750> get<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and then the score that you get in that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.450 
and then the score that you get in that
game<00:01:01.440> doesn't<00:01:01.739> count<00:01:01.890> towards<00:01:02.039> your<00:01:02.250> kill

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
game doesn't count towards your kill

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.219 
game doesn't count towards your kill
death<00:01:02.609> ratio<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> won't<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.760> that

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
death ratio so you won't see that

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.960

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
games if you look at all my games

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.120 
games if you look at all my games
they're<00:03:54.510> all<00:03:54.690> legitimate<00:03:55.230> every<00:03:55.799> single<00:03:55.980> one

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
they're all legitimate every single one

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.270 
they're all legitimate every single one
of<00:03:56.250> them<00:03:56.400> now<00:03:57.200> some<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.380> games<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.160> other

of them now some of the games the other
team<00:03:59.579> we<00:03:59.760> beat<00:03:59.880> them<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.239> bad<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.630> they<00:04:00.750> back

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
team we beat them so bad that they back

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.900 
team we beat them so bad that they back
out<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.440> they<00:04:01.530> got<00:04:01.709> host<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.250> unfortunately

out and they got host and unfortunately

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.800 
out and they got host and unfortunately
doesn't<00:04:03.180> record<00:04:04.579> so<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:06.239> point<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.690> I'm

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
doesn't record so the point that I'm

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.110 
doesn't record so the point that I'm
trying<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:07.110> make<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.320> that<00:04:07.829> if<00:04:08.549> somebody<00:04:08.850> is

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
trying to make is that if somebody is

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.180 
trying to make is that if somebody is
trying<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.540> teach<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:10.049> about<00:04:10.260> gameplay<00:04:10.950> and

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
the game so when somebody's telling you

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.320 
the game so when somebody's telling you
they<00:04:37.169> got<00:04:37.199> like<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.470> three<00:04:37.800> four<00:04:38.069> five<00:04:38.280> or<00:04:38.729> five

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
they got like a three four five or five

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.779 
they got like a three four five or five
point<00:04:39.750> we're<00:04:40.500> getting<00:04:40.830> five<00:04:41.099> six<00:04:41.430> hundred

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
point we're getting five six hundred

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.150 
point we're getting five six hundred
points<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.210> minute<00:04:42.479> they're<00:04:42.630> full<00:04:42.810> of<00:04:42.930> shit

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
points a minute they're full of shit

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.659 
points a minute they're full of shit
maybe<00:04:44.160> they<00:04:44.310> found<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.639> glitch<00:04:44.880> in<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.180> game<00:04:45.410> or

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
maybe they found a glitch in the game or

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.730 
maybe they found a glitch in the game or
one<00:04:47.669> of<00:04:47.699> the<00:04:47.880> other<00:04:48.030> they're<00:04:48.569> not<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:49.050> know<00:04:49.080> or

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
one of the other they're not you know or

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.249 
one of the other they're not you know or
their<00:04:50.490> dashboarding<00:04:51.240> every<00:04:51.569> time<00:04:51.810> they<00:04:51.990> start

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
their dashboarding every time they start

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.320 
their dashboarding every time they start
going<00:04:52.380> negative<00:04:52.680> so<00:04:53.460> this<00:04:53.490> is<00:04:53.819> the<00:04:53.940> proof<00:04:54.150> in

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
going negative so this is the proof in

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.969 
going negative so this is the proof in
the<00:04:54.419> pudding<00:04:54.449> if<00:04:54.900> you<00:04:55.349> want<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.770> go<00:04:55.919> to

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
the pudding if you want to go to

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.309 
the pudding if you want to go to
cross-reference<00:04:56.550> somebody<00:04:57.210> go<00:04:57.840> find<00:04:58.139> their

cross-reference somebody go find their

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.010 
cross-reference somebody go find their
name<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:59.190> can<00:04:59.220> see<00:04:59.610> they<00:05:00.330> won't<00:05:00.539> have<00:05:00.750> any

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020
