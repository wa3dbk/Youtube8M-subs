giving the Monaro which is good for them
really<00:00:49.610> what<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> decided<00:00:51.150> it<00:00:51.480> when<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
really what I decided it when I was a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.780 
really what I decided it when I was a
student<00:00:52.290> at<00:00:52.470> reading<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.890> was<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> do<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
student at reading I was going to do a

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.369 
student at reading I was going to do a
really<00:00:54.210> simple<00:00:55.309> clear<00:00:56.329> straight<00:00:57.379> painting

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
really simple clear straight painting

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.130 
really simple clear straight painting
and<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.340> thought<00:00:59.489> right<00:00:59.700> if<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.210> those<00:01:00.510> Italians

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and I thought right if if those Italians

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.030 
and I thought right if if those Italians
can<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.650> it<00:01:02.210> like<00:01:03.210> Bellini<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.870> know<00:01:04.710> some<00:01:04.949> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
can do it like Bellini and know some of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.590 
can do it like Bellini and know some of
that<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.550> tell<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.150> Dutcher's
