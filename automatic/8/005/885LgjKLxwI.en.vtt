that as a possibility that's the least
of<00:01:47.090> my<00:01:47.150> concern<00:01:48.250> well<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:50.060> know<00:01:50.150> I<00:01:50.360> think<00:01:50.870> I

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
of my concern well you know I think I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.980 
of my concern well you know I think I
think<00:01:51.350> he<00:01:52.060> he's<00:01:53.060> got<00:01:53.270> control<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.870> that

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
think he he's got control of that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.990 
think he he's got control of that
campaign<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.860> know<00:01:54.980> and<00:01:55.280> it's<00:01:55.460> how<00:01:55.610> he<00:01:55.670> goes

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
campaign you know and it's how he goes

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.670 
campaign you know and it's how he goes
and<00:01:56.270> plays<00:01:58.360> hopefully<00:01:59.360> he'll<00:01:59.540> have<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.470> same

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
and plays hopefully he'll have the same

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.950 
and plays hopefully he'll have the same
type<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:00.980> impact<00:02:01.460> next<00:02:02.090> year<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.570> if<00:02:02.690> he<00:02:02.780> does

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
type of impact next year and if he does

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.340 
type of impact next year and if he does
then<00:02:03.260> he'll<00:02:04.220> it'll<00:02:05.150> be<00:02:05.330> he'll<00:02:05.870> be<00:02:06.020> up<00:02:06.200> for

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
then he'll it'll be he'll be up for

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.230

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
give momentum Gossett's how much could a

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.300 
give momentum Gossett's how much could a
bcs<00:02:43.360> when<00:02:43.690> how<00:02:44.470> much<00:02:44.590> could<00:02:44.740> that<00:02:44.830> do<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.190> this

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
bcs when how much could that do for this

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.340 
bcs when how much could that do for this
team<00:02:45.520> going<00:02:45.730> forward<00:02:45.880> into<00:02:46.750> spring<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
next season well I mean it's huge I mean

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.330 
next season well I mean it's huge I mean
it's<00:02:49.870> like<00:02:50.020> our<00:02:50.200> first<00:02:50.410> year<00:02:50.650> when<00:02:50.860> we<00:02:50.980> got<00:02:51.130> to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
the championship game I mean that was a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.610 
the championship game I mean that was a
big<00:02:53.740> accomplishment<00:02:54.010> for<00:02:54.460> us<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.900> know<00:02:55.930> had

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
obviously a goal we've never been in a

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.220 
obviously a goal we've never been in a
bcs<00:03:11.530> game<00:03:11.560> since<00:03:12.160> i<00:03:12.280> started<00:03:12.520> that<00:03:12.790> deal<00:03:13.230> so

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
bcs game since i started that deal so

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.010 
bcs game since i started that deal so
that's<00:03:14.410> it<00:03:14.530> that's<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.800> great<00:03:14.980> accomplishment

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
that's it that's a great accomplishment

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.070 
that's it that's a great accomplishment
but<00:03:17.020> she<00:03:17.200> want<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.410> win<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:19.390> know<00:03:19.510> be

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
but she want to win it and you know be

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.729 
but she want to win it and you know be
honest<00:03:20.290> with<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.590> whether<00:03:20.800> it's<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.100> BCS<00:03:21.640> or

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
honest with you whether it's the BCS or

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.710 
honest with you whether it's the BCS or
whatever<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.830> lowest<00:03:24.130> MO<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.610> going<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.600> win

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
whatever the lowest MO is going to win

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.770 
whatever the lowest MO is going to win
and<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.709> just<00:03:26.830> think<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:28.300> know<00:03:28.390> waning

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
and I just think that you know waning

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.390 
and I just think that you know waning
breeds<00:03:29.050> confidence<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.890> enthusiasm<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.940> and

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
breeds confidence and enthusiasm and and

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.890 
breeds confidence and enthusiasm and and
it's<00:03:33.400> your<00:03:33.610> last<00:03:33.790> game<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.480> you're<00:03:34.630> not<00:03:34.720> going

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
to get to go play again the next week

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.250
