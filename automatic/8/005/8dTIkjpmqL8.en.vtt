00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.080
 Hello and welcome to Club 2 Ulm Komorowski was looking for this time and 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:20.009
 even if the case was destroyed 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.640
 the players who did not play just agree 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.839
 my protege 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.969
 Why why why Jörg Leichtfried does not explain he was what he was 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:30.229
 packed with the purchase and although covered with a part of the Prof to do so 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.190
 the max cathedrals shot twice as weighed at maximum by the proportion in the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.960
 ProB 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.470
 and as the conclusion of Group 3 the apartment on the 4 account number and also 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.730
 therefore chairman held 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.970
 why I'm looking for the whole comment now though 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.100
 has a very simple reason I can not play it at the moment because I am 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.130
 Monday on the Iller to Prokop 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.430
 and the AK commented on the schools though 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.820
 I want and do what I show and what I do 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.970
 the Colmar Warrior Challenge does not work because you are in the old lottery 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.600
 here on the ship is too bad 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.780
 unclear I just stay with the use of drops r4 given some gentes 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.390
 I comment on the now loading the 4 high 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.900
 see the us premiere 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 I enjoy it now I know how I get here from Lastrup 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.370
 and I'm really happy that it worked 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.110
 you do not need to arrive here now i have Rheinmetall can do that 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.760
 Program Zürs comment or similar No No No No firstly 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.410
 so Leuschner it my protégé and only for protégés I do that secondly 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.410
 I already have two charges with Colette and to use 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.380
 and percent of the pastor could loose and there is currently no time left 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.510
 and Dr is in early October 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.250
 tripled percent 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 why he lies the new head 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.190
 So that's why I do not want to write 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.290
 but we want each year to take office to the b minor op is dense 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.530
 Now I'm going to meet a bit 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.400
 and what I think is very important in this winter 11 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.650
 previously to Leuschner few 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.550
 Pantel the chapeau 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.080
 Landau players have been several times in life percent in the Modern Warfare 2 videos 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.290
 or black box videos can and have 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.050
 and the first points have been moving a lot for you 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.909
 offensive 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.909
 is never to see Lucia today is said Obermann 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.529
 and most important, it will be now 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.939
 he uses these from the top just to defrost faster 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.699
 he runs and runs and runs and runs 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.830
 Ludwig and the building yard finished halfway through 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.169
 to work out a lead 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.369
 to surprise the opponent 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.979
 Add to that Paktika Wattenmeer on "What they have here live and you 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.239
 their opponents had just seen you are lying on the ground Lusche already 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.730
 and again he forgives so has a low hit area us growth 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.439
 it is possible to react to the opponents so fast 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.999
 to press fifth 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.999
 You can also play with the alarm clock with a silencer 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:50.379
 the quality is a marathon very weak 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.699
 but also here is the guy 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.619
 if he thinks of criteria, no agreement can be made on it, why fact 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.159
 between Dobbertin 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.149
 continues 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:03.179
 and here too a piece percent their full burst Corvette c6 sneaking away 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.869
 still find 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.609
 the guy has no chance to kill him again 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.169
 Flight direction Boden and Wittenbergplatz 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.909
 for ORF not 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:12.610
 but what I have to say here now 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.290
 I think I would have the thieves at the TA now in this situation 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.599
 from Gurtweil missing only a single opponent 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.389
 on the way forward with the most expensive city 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.129
 why so Leuschner makes himself 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.579
 I do not know no idea 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.019
 Every player has their own brands there 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.189
 I suffered at the turn-em otherwise 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.250
 Baran, I'll kill him or that would be the type 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.549
 the movie is a nice example why this custom Scots is so effective 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.089
 take a look 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.579
 and indeed affected to Luxembourg Ali attraction in the picture already big 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.039
 I was allowed to take a shower 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:49.459
 and the next three shots four keys opposite Mainkofen way and 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.019
 he can kill the opponent 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.339
 and risk and me 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:54.259
 we do not have an unnecessary test 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.399
 Super important thing 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:58.800
 which is also effective in blogs 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.239
 definitely fictional for every game 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.539
 as simple as never delivered the answer right away with the best possible utmost 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:05.809
 is pleasing 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:09.179
 the local joy was unfortunately wrong 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:10.669
 and not decision makers yes 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.219
 There it falls already 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.379
 has to roll up a bit from the back 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.979
 the account or filthy raised 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.579
 and the drone instead of the forum 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.310
 quite simply with Altonaer being the ManU Kocaman 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.930
 Sunday another two seconds 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.279
 but this number of customers can already be in there 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.469
 very important in some situations yes 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.419
 easy prey can not be described otherwise 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.830
 and now it just means 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.550
 Dufry AG 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.360
 the studios is one of them 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.759
 Often the Finder tracking is still going on 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.990
 yes, every player is off to Islam 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.979
 Unfortunately, her colleague with Norbert Lehmann 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.690
 Rod Stewart's halftime is over three to zero 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.969
 Do you ever come running? 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.090
 a kind of he behind nicely 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.090
 for the good Mr Caputo market 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:02.840
 continues 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.020
 page break 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.460
 and here again the same game secondary ahead 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.039
 Run without a star as fast as possible Run from 1 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:14.469
 be limited 4 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:17.289
 just get used to this thanked Pfeiffer 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.370
 percent 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.400
 and what can I say Freiberg Moscow 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 the world of bible in Warsaw super important 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:26.589
 on the hashtag 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:29.979
 again lucky that we have the support I can expect it 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.819
 has lost price 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:32.780
 the victims 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.919
 Smallpox could 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.449
 Bayer is still a bit nervous 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.769
 Prof just catching up unfortunately again such a fighter 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:42.939
 but well, Zulu needs to be exhausted 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:44.289
 and now something nice is coming 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.289
 Pay attention to these games but now with 1 0 but 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.559
 because next time you have a smarter guy up there 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.660
 But we need a rifle and look at you 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.039
 Guys were 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.689
 for the German then had done quite well 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:58.680
 really go 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.259
 slowly forward so Mennig Smart 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.879
 and whoever slowed extreme played great on this case 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.759
 is prepared 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.080
 not so practiced 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.330
 and here yes 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.520
 Prof subject examination 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.550
 14 clock goes round to raise 2 1 for the login 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.479
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.800
 and yes I say goodbye as always 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.089
 with a good shot 

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.259
 Ottomar Makri on until next time
