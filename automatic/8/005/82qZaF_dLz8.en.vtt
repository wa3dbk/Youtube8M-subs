 of the new wave of friends as you see 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.390
 we are missing aic is that we do not like those of 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.949
 fire emblem but it gives me that in the end 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.080
 we will have to hit with some serious 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.410
 pringar to be able to investigate 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.669
 well let's start with bowser to see 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.109

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.109
 this is a boxing 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.149
 good 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.210
 perfect 1 - lied true 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.410
 good to be in our tower to observe them 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.150
 if in the end we had to fall yes 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.829
 because we do not have another one because 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.739
 you know that this sold out I was comfortable 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.540
 but there was not or I think they have 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.150
 learned from the first runs did not 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.890
 they are at hand this I see it well 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.890
 would show to see the face life is fine 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
 all right 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:16.450
 I do not think it's a little bit 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.450
 little but good 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.800
 It takes a lot of tyrolean bowser good 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.800
 let's open place myself 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.130

 the ducklings today is ok it shows the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.170
 weight difference between this one and this one that 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.460
 it's very big is that it's so big that 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.410
 has eaten more and this one either 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.700
 ratified that the truth was to see the little face 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.700
 and everything and from the sentry box 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.130
 on the way back 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.610
 culillo caught drink more 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.210
 more in the support this takes you then 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.730
 neither is it not as it should be that 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.200
 you do not see much good let's get that 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.200
 so he saw grams of knee 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.840
 as never the deferent and that will not do 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.140
 but because to me but you know that I 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.140
 like 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.210
 but it is what there is 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.730
 that already Mexican without table 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.640
 it is also up to touching those that also 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.180
 is rickety good here we have to 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.180
 sheikh 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.300
 means of worship is well in the form of 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.660
 face truth is already in the form 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.810
 Mexico least one chamber 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.400
 it's not bad in the figure, the truth is not 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.380
 that is not badly done the one that happens 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.450
 clear when they are more realistic because it 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.640
 note a little the difference in quality 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.760
 here for example you see there is half 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.010
 hair but not good not bad 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.459
 is not bad and I tell you the support 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.370

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.630
 close 1 and well let's open now the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.640
 tooling we have two because all these 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.370
 figures are super ours a link that 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.349
 I do not have as much desire for collecting 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.739
 of friends this we have buying only 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:12.710
 very little very little and years 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:16.370
 to use them well I also 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.650
 but only those that I like those of so 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.989
 hot 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:25.539
 you will also mount if you also 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:29.870
 Well, you can get them both and both 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:33.639
 we do like this to compare yes yes 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.639
 that you see differences between strike another 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.230
 but it's very cool it was tulle and very 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.820
 cool, let's start with this 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.820
 this is the one that is fine I think 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.709
 you see the little face and it has a texture here 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.270
 special in what is the clothes I do not know if 

00:04:55.709 --> 00:05:00.179
 it is appreciated in the camera but it is a 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.520
 different texture by the device twisted 

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:04.520
 Look, the shield is well done 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.280
 the sword around here just behind 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.360
 we will follow the cursed 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.320

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.890

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.940
 take it out good here is the other one is here 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.390
 change a little bit what is the 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.800
 grip a little more but one has 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.110
 something weird 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.330
 but hey it's very good the truth is 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.669
 that this print seems to improve a 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.090
 I love the tunnel a lot, it's very 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.090
 well fine 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.090
 the truth is that they are very cool the 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.090
 two 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.139
