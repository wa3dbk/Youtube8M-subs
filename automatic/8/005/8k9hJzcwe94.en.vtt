reason<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.740> did<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.280> not<00:00:14.429> intended<00:00:14.759> to

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
reason I did this it's not intended to

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.369 
reason I did this it's not intended to
be<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> cheap<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.660> balance<00:00:16.020> things<00:00:16.170> out

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
be a cheap but to balance things out

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.620 
be a cheap but to balance things out
because<00:00:16.560> alchemy<00:00:17.130> levels<00:00:17.460> really<00:00:17.940> slowly<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
because alchemy levels really slowly and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.990 
because alchemy levels really slowly and
this<00:00:19.230> will<00:00:19.439> help<00:00:19.470> make<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.279> little<00:00:20.490> more<00:00:20.580> fun

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
this will help make it a little more fun

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.670 
this will help make it a little more fun
while<00:00:21.390> keeping<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.869> still<00:00:22.109> balanced<00:00:23.330> so<00:00:24.680> I'm

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
while keeping it still balanced so I'm

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.650 
while keeping it still balanced so I'm
going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.890> show<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.580> comparison<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
going to show you a comparison this is

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.720 
going to show you a comparison this is
without<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.230> mod<00:00:28.410> loaded<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
without the mod loaded and I'm going to

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.370 
without the mod loaded and I'm going to
craft<00:00:29.910> ten<00:00:30.119> potions<00:00:30.539> five<00:00:30.810> fortify

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
craft ten potions five fortify

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.650 
craft ten potions five fortify
two-handed<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.309> five<00:00:32.579> or<00:00:32.850> generate<00:00:33.180> magica

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
two-handed and five or generate magica

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.950 
two-handed and five or generate magica
and<00:00:34.010> here's<00:00:35.010> look<00:00:35.670> at<00:00:35.790> where<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.059> start<00:00:36.480> about

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and here's look at where we start about

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.380 
and here's look at where we start about
maybe<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.469> quarter<00:00:38.510> up<00:00:39.510> into<00:00:39.960> 34<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.760> that's

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
maybe a quarter up into 34 and that's

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.299 
maybe a quarter up into 34 and that's
the<00:00:42.629> first<00:00:42.899> five<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:44.040> craft<00:00:44.460> five<00:00:46.309> short

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the first five and then craft five short

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.459 
the first five and then craft five short
of<00:00:47.399> 35<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.750> I'm<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.989> close<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> game

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
of 35 so I'm going to close out the game

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.580 
of 35 so I'm going to close out the game
and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.340> i'm<00:00:50.550> going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> show<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.469> what<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and then i'm going to show you what it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.010 
and then i'm going to show you what it
looks<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.520> comparison<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.270> my<00:00:54.750> mob

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
looks like in comparison with my mob

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.760 
looks like in comparison with my mob
load<00:00:55.289> ok<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.250> my<00:00:56.610> mod<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.270> loaded<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.960> as

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
load ok so my mod is now loaded and as

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
load ok so my mod is now loaded and as
you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.280> starting<00:00:59.910> from<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> same<00:01:00.510> place

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
you can see starting from the same place

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.650 
you can see starting from the same place
as<00:01:00.930> before<00:01:00.960> reloaded<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.770> last<00:01:02.010> save<00:01:02.660> not

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
as before reloaded the last save not

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.800 
as before reloaded the last save not
quarter<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> way<00:01:04.379> into<00:01:04.949> 34<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.330> crafting

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
quarter of the way into 34 so crafting

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.530 
quarter of the way into 34 so crafting
five<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.920> already<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> little

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
five we can already see it's a little

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.500 
five we can already see it's a little
bit<00:01:09.659> farther<00:01:09.960> than<00:01:10.260> before<00:01:11.180> craft<00:01:12.180> another

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
bit farther than before craft another

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.120 
bit farther than before craft another
five<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.229> difference<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:17.040> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
five and so the difference if you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.149 
five and so the difference if you
remember<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:19.500> know<00:01:19.590> over<00:01:19.979> Ted

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
remember it is is you know over Ted

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.410 
remember it is is you know over Ted

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
flick the actual bar and that'll add up

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.500
