chord<00:00:52.820> progression<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:53.839> I<00:00:53.870> have<00:00:54.079> a<00:00:54.110> lesson

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
chord progression so I have a lesson

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.229 
chord progression so I have a lesson
together<00:00:54.649> on<00:00:54.829> this<00:00:55.010> at<00:00:55.280> totally<00:00:55.730> guitars<00:00:56.030> as

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
together on this at totally guitars as

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.560 
together on this at totally guitars as
part<00:00:56.480> of<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.659> target<00:00:56.870> program<00:00:57.409> where<00:00:58.570> you

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
part of the target program where you

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.360 
part of the target program where you
don't<00:00:59.720> see<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.019> guitar<00:01:00.290> until<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.949> very<00:01:01.100> end

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
don't see the guitar until the very end

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.889 
don't see the guitar until the very end
because<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.820> whole<00:01:02.000> lesson<00:01:02.360> is<00:01:02.479> really<00:01:02.510> an

ear training lesson if you're trying to
figure<00:01:04.519> out<00:01:04.580> what<00:01:04.850> chords<00:01:05.180> they<00:01:05.300> are<00:01:05.449> we<00:01:05.869> hear

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
figure out what chords they are we hear

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.580 
figure out what chords they are we hear
a<00:01:06.050> few<00:01:06.290> chords<00:01:06.560> in<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.800> beginning<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:12.080> then

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
a few chords in the beginning and then

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:23.330 
a few chords in the beginning and then
possibly<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.369> key<00:01:13.759> change

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.429 

and<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:24.090> was<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> whole<00:01:24.390> song<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:24.990> what<00:01:25.350> we

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
and there was the whole song but what we

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.780 
and there was the whole song but what we
do<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.740> lesson<00:01:26.100> though<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.490> kind<00:01:26.759> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
do in this lesson though is kind of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.520 
do in this lesson though is kind of
break<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.149> down<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.540> even<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.020> finding<00:01:28.259> this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
break it down to even just finding this

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.859 
break it down to even just finding this
first<00:01:28.770> chord<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.180> can't<00:01:30.390> find<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
first chord and if you can't find the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.359 
first chord and if you can't find the
core<00:01:31.110> by<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.680> playing<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.979> few<00:01:32.100> different

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
core by just playing a few different

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.499 
core by just playing a few different
chords<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.700> playing<00:01:32.939> something<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.329> know

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
chords and playing something you know

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.499 
chords and playing something you know
look<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.259> at<00:01:34.350> least<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> bass<00:01:34.770> note<00:01:35.360> which<00:01:36.360> is

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
look for at least the bass note which is

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.160 
look for at least the bass note which is
right<00:01:36.689> there

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
right there

so<00:01:44.530> all<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:45.009> is<00:01:45.430> stuff<00:01:45.640> this<00:01:45.820> lesson<00:01:46.090> is

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
so all of that is stuff this lesson is

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.120 
so all of that is stuff this lesson is
very<00:01:46.479> long<00:01:46.720> because<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.409> kept<00:01:47.590> I'll<00:01:47.830> give<00:01:48.070> you

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
very long because it kept I'll give you

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.770 
very long because it kept I'll give you
a<00:01:48.189> little<00:01:48.400> bit<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.759> and<00:01:48.909> then<00:01:49.000> have<00:01:49.659> you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
a little bit of it and then have you

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.380 
a little bit of it and then have you
figure<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.200> rest<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:50.560> out<00:01:50.650> but<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:52.000> key<00:01:52.210> to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
figure the rest of it out but the key to

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.570 
figure the rest of it out but the key to
ear<00:01:52.720> training<00:01:53.049> is<00:01:53.350> first<00:01:54.009> figure<00:01:54.250> out<00:01:54.369> what

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
ear training is first figure out what

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.389 
ear training is first figure out what
key<00:01:54.850> it's<00:01:55.000> probably<00:01:55.630> in<00:01:56.130> probably<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.250> this

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
key it's probably in probably in this

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.280 
key it's probably in probably in this
key<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.939> then<00:01:58.210> figure<00:01:58.509> out<00:01:58.570> what<00:01:58.659> chords<00:01:59.170> are

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
key and then figure out what chords are

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.010 
key and then figure out what chords are
in<00:01:59.409> that<00:01:59.649> key<00:01:59.890> knowing<00:02:00.399> Accords<00:02:00.820> 1<00:02:01.030> 4<00:02:01.299> &amp;<00:02:01.450> 5<00:02:01.630> are

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
in that key knowing Accords 1 4 &amp; 5 are

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.039 
in that key knowing Accords 1 4 &amp; 5 are
major<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.710> 2<00:02:02.890> 3<00:02:03.130> &amp;<00:02:03.250> 6<00:02:03.460> are<00:02:03.759> minor<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:04.840> figure

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
major and 2 3 &amp; 6 are minor so figure

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.719 
major and 2 3 &amp; 6 are minor so figure
out<00:02:05.110> what<00:02:05.200> chords<00:02:05.710> are<00:02:05.860> likely<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.399> be<00:02:06.520> in<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
out what chords are likely to be in the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.169 
out what chords are likely to be in the
song<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.180> then<00:02:08.489> play<00:02:09.489> them<00:02:09.580> all<00:02:09.759> until<00:02:10.149> you

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
song and then play them all until you

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.800 
song and then play them all until you
find<00:02:10.479> what<00:02:10.959> they<00:02:11.110> are<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:12.630> don't<00:02:13.630> do<00:02:13.690> this

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
find what they are so I don't do this

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.479 
find what they are so I don't do this
too<00:02:13.959> often<00:02:14.110> but<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.650> lesson<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.370> I

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
too often but this is a lesson that I

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.670 
too often but this is a lesson that I
really<00:02:15.760> turned<00:02:15.940> into<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.300> an<00:02:17.170> ear<00:02:17.380> training

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
really turned into a an ear training

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.910 
really turned into a an ear training
project<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.870> goes<00:02:20.019> on<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.709> quite

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
project and so it goes on it's quite

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.350 
project and so it goes on it's quite
long<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:21.640> if<00:02:21.730> you'd<00:02:21.819> like<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.000> check<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.269> out

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
long but if you'd like to check it out
