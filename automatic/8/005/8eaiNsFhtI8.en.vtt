okay so here we have my latest little

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.930 
okay so here we have my latest little
widget<00:00:06.870> which<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.290> call<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:09.019> Python<00:00:10.580> it's<00:00:11.580> a

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
widget which I call the Python it's a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.529

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.660 
plus the GB GSM module and the TFT
screen<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:51.930> nice<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.660> standalone

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
screen so it's all nice and standalone

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.700 
screen so it's all nice and standalone
so<00:00:56.670> when<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.329> power<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
so when I power it on you can see the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.950 
so when I power it on you can see the
power<00:00:59.039> LEDs<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.890> Raspberry<00:01:01.890> Pi<00:01:02.840> see<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
power LEDs on the Raspberry Pi see the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.550 
power LEDs on the Raspberry Pi see the
power<00:01:04.170> LEDs<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:06.920> GSM<00:01:07.920> card<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:10.320> there<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
power LEDs on the GSM card and there it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.289 
power LEDs on the GSM card and there it
is<00:01:10.619> trying<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> associate<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> cellular

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
is trying to associate with the cellular

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.920 
is trying to associate with the cellular
network<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:14.630> that's<00:01:15.630> all<00:01:15.780> part<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.140> nicely

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
network and that's all part up nicely

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.850 
network and that's all part up nicely
then<00:01:18.930> when<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:21.110> have<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.200> lot<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.500> arrives

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
then when we have a lot on that arrives

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.230 
then when we have a lot on that arrives
being<00:01:23.070> boot<00:01:23.250> there<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.580> cells<00:01:23.759> taking<00:01:24.090> some

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
being boot there are cells taking some

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.399 
being boot there are cells taking some
time<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.479> boot<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:27.170> book<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
time to boot and but it's a book it's a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.719 
time to boot and but it's a book it's a
bit<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.710> mess<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.100> wouldn't<00:01:29.369> actually<00:01:29.460> use

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
bit of a mess we wouldn't actually use

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.940 
bit of a mess we wouldn't actually use
in<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> real<00:01:30.150> word<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.900> Python<00:01:31.500> Python

thanks a lot bye I just press the hang
up<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.060> hang<00:03:09.209> up<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.920> there<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.220> see

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
up to hang up so there you see

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.740 
up to hang up so there you see
demonstration<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:15.269> what's<00:03:15.510> interesting

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
demonstration of and what's interesting

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.720 
demonstration of and what's interesting
I<00:03:16.110> think<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:16.860> powered<00:03:17.160> from<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.550> PI

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
I think is that it's powered from a PI

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.580 
I think is that it's powered from a PI
phone<00:03:17.970> now<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.209> does<00:03:18.360> apart<00:03:18.959> from<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.230> dipole

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
phone now it does apart from a dipole

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.479 
phone now it does apart from a dipole
and<00:03:21.470> enclose<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.709> thing<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.100> does<00:03:23.280> get<00:03:23.459> a

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
and enclose the thing is it does get a

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.630 
and enclose the thing is it does get a
bit<00:03:23.550> warm<00:03:23.910> because<00:03:24.330> it's<00:03:24.450> not<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.630> lot<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:24.930> air

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
bit warm because it's not a lot of air

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.550 
bit warm because it's not a lot of air
to<00:03:26.640> go<00:03:26.790> away<00:03:26.880> from<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.209> Raspberry<00:03:27.540> Pi<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:28.410> get

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
to go away from the Raspberry Pi to get

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.860 
to go away from the Raspberry Pi to get
away<00:03:28.650> from<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.980> CPU<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:30.330> can<00:03:30.540> feel<00:03:30.750> it

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
away from the CPU so you can feel it

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.780 
away from the CPU so you can feel it
getting<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.140> little<00:03:31.170> bit<00:03:31.470> warm<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.920> doesn't

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
getting a little bit warm it doesn't

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.340 
getting a little bit warm it doesn't
crash<00:03:33.150> or<00:03:33.330> anything<00:03:33.510> but<00:03:33.750> I'm<00:03:33.870> sure<00:03:34.080> it

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
crash or anything but I'm sure it

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.900 
crash or anything but I'm sure it
wouldn't<00:03:34.680> be<00:03:34.920> good<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.370> put<00:03:35.550> it<00:03:35.700> in<00:03:35.820> an

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
wouldn't be good to put it in an

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.940 
wouldn't be good to put it in an
enclosure<00:03:36.709> without<00:03:37.709> some<00:03:37.950> sort<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.310> heat<00:03:39.090> sink

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
enclosure without some sort of heat sink

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.740 
enclosure without some sort of heat sink
anyway<00:03:40.950> that's<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.370> demo<00:03:41.580> hope<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.480> enjoyed

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
anyway that's the demo hope you enjoyed

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.950 
anyway that's the demo hope you enjoyed
us<00:03:42.900> catch<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.830> later
