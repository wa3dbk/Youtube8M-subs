00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
can get the dampers on there for a more

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.770 
can get the dampers on there for a more
muted<00:02:10.800> sort<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.190> softer<00:02:11.640> sound<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.540> still

kind of standard music man stingray it's

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.750 
kind of standard music man stingray it's
exactly<00:02:22.530> them<00:02:22.860> off<00:02:23.010> they're<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.430> which<00:02:23.640> is

exactly them off they're just which is
more<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:24.330> you're<00:02:24.660> sort<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.470> more<00:02:26.010> than

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
more for like you're sort of more than

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.650 
more for like you're sort of more than
 you<00:02:26.580> know<00:02:26.670> faster<00:02:27.120> plane<00:02:27.300> whereas<00:02:27.540> this

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
 you know faster plane whereas this

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.540 
 you know faster plane whereas this
one<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.260> still<00:02:28.530> has<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> lot<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.920> speed<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.460> I

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
one it still has a lot of speed on it I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.410 
one it still has a lot of speed on it I
feel<00:02:29.820> but<00:02:30.030> again<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.270> really<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.110> way

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
yeah with it yeah this is yeah the

of<00:02:39.310> something<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.930> music<00:02:41.290> man<00:02:41.440> put<00:02:41.950> out

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
of something that the music man put out

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.309 
of something that the music man put out
a<00:02:42.520> while<00:02:42.970> ago<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.300> originally<00:02:43.750> I<00:02:43.780> think<00:02:43.900> I

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
a while ago and originally I think I

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.990 
a while ago and originally I think I
mean<00:02:44.470> sterling<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.010> name<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.459> Ernie<00:02:45.730> balls

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
mean sterling to the name of Ernie balls

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.170 
mean sterling to the name of Ernie balls
son<00:02:46.660> that's<00:02:46.900> right<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.459> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
son that's right and and the the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.809 
son that's right and and the the
sterling<00:02:49.950> initially<00:02:50.950> was<00:02:51.130> brought<00:02:51.400> out<00:02:51.430> as<00:02:51.790> a

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
sterling initially was brought out as a

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.090 
sterling initially was brought out as a
smaller<00:02:52.209> version<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.800> Stingray

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
smaller version of the of the Stingray

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.150 
smaller version of the of the Stingray
this<00:02:54.610> would<00:02:54.730> be<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.850> base<00:02:55.060> for<00:02:55.090> level<00:02:55.600> one<00:02:55.780> yeah

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
this would be a base for level one yeah

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.420 
this would be a base for level one yeah
yeah<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.540> yes<00:02:58.690> so<00:02:58.870> in<00:02:59.590> exactly<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.310> it

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
yeah so so yes so in exactly that so it

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.979 
yeah so so yes so in exactly that so it
has<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.610> smaller<00:03:00.940> body<00:03:01.150> it's<00:03:01.510> very<00:03:01.569> similar

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
has a smaller body it's very similar

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.430 
has a smaller body it's very similar
looking<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:03.130> stingray<00:03:03.850> but<00:03:04.390> everything's<00:03:05.290> a

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
looking to a stingray but everything's a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.670 
looking to a stingray but everything's a
little<00:03:05.650> bit<00:03:05.800> more<00:03:06.580> tweaked<00:03:06.940> on<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.510> um<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.260> to

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
little bit more tweaked on it um and to

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.800 
little bit more tweaked on it um and to
be<00:03:08.800> easier<00:03:09.069> around<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.790> think<00:03:10.000> for<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> narrow

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
be easier around I think for a narrow

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.900 
be easier around I think for a narrow
neck<00:03:11.110> profile<00:03:11.590> as<00:03:11.709> well<00:03:11.890> yeah<00:03:12.160> exactly<00:03:12.340> so

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
neck profile as well yeah exactly so

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.479 
neck profile as well yeah exactly so
yeah<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.660> mean<00:03:13.959> yes<00:03:14.110> yeah<00:03:14.650> exactly<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:15.010> standard

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
yeah I mean yes yeah exactly a standard

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.650 
yeah I mean yes yeah exactly a standard
stingray<00:03:15.819> it's<00:03:15.970> going<00:03:16.090> to<00:03:16.150> be<00:03:16.209> kind<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.480> quite

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
stingray it's going to be kind of quite

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.500 
stingray it's going to be kind of quite
wide<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:17.260> flat<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.370> yeah<00:03:18.850> this<00:03:19.030> one's<00:03:19.269> this

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
wide and flat and yeah this one's this

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.000 
wide and flat and yeah this one's this
one's<00:03:19.720> got<00:03:19.870> quite<00:03:20.049> a<00:03:20.080> nice<00:03:20.230> taper<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.830> it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
one's got quite a nice taper to it

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.699 
one's got quite a nice taper to it
modern<00:03:21.549> mat<00:03:21.790> feel<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:22.569> yeah<00:03:22.870> this<00:03:23.019> is<00:03:23.200> kind<00:03:23.500> of

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
modern mat feel so yeah this is kind of

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.470 
modern mat feel so yeah this is kind of
I<00:03:23.950> mean<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.549> pretty<00:03:24.760> basic<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.390> know

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
I mean this is pretty basic you know

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.759 
I mean this is pretty basic you know
it's<00:03:25.569> black<00:03:25.780> on<00:03:25.810> back<00:03:26.110> with<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.319> rosewood<00:03:26.560> neck

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
it's black on back with a rosewood neck

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.150 
it's black on back with a rosewood neck
but<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.730> kind<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.120> player's<00:03:28.630> base

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
but it's it's kind of a player's base

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
but it's it's kind of a player's base
whereas<00:03:30.160> shines<00:03:30.430> though<00:03:30.670> there's<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
whereas shines though there's the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.090 
whereas shines though there's the
circuitry<00:03:31.630> on<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.900> which<00:03:32.049> is<00:03:32.080> very<00:03:32.560> advanced

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
circuitry on it which is very advanced

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.759 
circuitry on it which is very advanced
you've<00:03:33.519> got<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.850> 3<00:03:34.660> band<00:03:34.840> EQ<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.260> master<00:03:35.620> volume

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
you've got a 3 band EQ and master volume

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.590 
you've got a 3 band EQ and master volume
like<00:03:36.040> you'd<00:03:36.160> get<00:03:36.310> on<00:03:36.400> most<00:03:36.640> sort<00:03:36.880> of<00:03:36.910> 3eq

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
like you'd get on most sort of 3eq

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.830 
like you'd get on most sort of 3eq
stingrays<00:03:38.109> but<00:03:38.829> you<00:03:38.980> also<00:03:39.160> have<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.840> three-way

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
stingrays but you also have a three-way

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.900 
stingrays but you also have a three-way
call<00:03:41.109> selection<00:03:41.560> switch<00:03:41.680> like<00:03:42.489> you<00:03:42.609> get<00:03:42.790> on

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
call selection switch like you get on

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.180 
call selection switch like you get on
standard<00:03:43.420> as<00:03:43.600> on<00:03:44.079> a<00:03:44.109> five<00:03:44.380> string<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.010> yeah

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
standard as on a five string so yeah

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.410 
standard as on a five string so yeah
single<00:03:45.970> coil<00:03:46.180> uh<00:03:47.130> humbucker<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.430> rear<00:03:49.180> a

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
single coil uh humbucker and rear a

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.940 
single coil uh humbucker and rear a
single<00:03:49.720> core<00:03:49.870> so<00:03:50.019> you<00:03:50.079> can<00:03:50.200> get<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.560> real
