 normal steering wheel claws 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.469
 the advantage of the kfz hall is that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.329
 The thief first time not in the vehicle 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.760
 that means he has to come from the outside 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.469
 first apply force around in ever 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.100
 The vehicle comes and systems too 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.480
 remove 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.430

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.940
 source to use 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.530
 they only need one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.119
 central locking or electrical 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.350
 windows they have a 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.540
 Remote control or via the door lock 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.040
 can open and close and you 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.510
 The thief could not get in the car 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.670
 or not pure 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.299

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.040
 once right on the left and hang 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.040

 that usually starts after two 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.390
 because of 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.140
