00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
fades into am just picking one here by

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.500 
fades into am just picking one here by
the<00:02:17.730> way<00:02:17.910> kind<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.690> phasing<00:02:19.200> lega<00:02:20.359> almost<00:02:21.359> like

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
