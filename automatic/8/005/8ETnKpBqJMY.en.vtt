00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
started so starting off with the basics

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.420 
started so starting off with the basics
of<00:00:25.019> my<00:00:25.199> hair<00:00:25.380> my<00:00:25.560> hair<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.859> naturally<00:00:26.400> straight

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
of my hair my hair is naturally straight

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.150 
of my hair my hair is naturally straight
so<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.630> interesting<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.890> don't

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
so it's not that interesting and I don't

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.279 
so it's not that interesting and I don't
have<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> typical<00:00:29.849> asian<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:31.019> which

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
have like the typical asian here which

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.470 
have like the typical asian here which
is<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.650> thick<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.189> coarse<00:00:32.430> hair<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.239> hair

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
is like thick and coarse hair so my hair

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.090 
is like thick and coarse hair so my hair
is<00:00:33.510> different<00:00:33.840> because<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:34.649> thinner

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
is different because it's thinner

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.250 
is different because it's thinner
strands<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.120> strands<00:00:36.630> itself<00:00:37.050> are

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
strands but the strands itself are

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
strands but the strands itself are
strong<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.219> just<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.700> lot<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:39.030> strands

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
strong and I just have a lot of strands

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.970 
strong and I just have a lot of strands
it's<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.469> really<00:00:40.739> thick

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
it's not like I have really thick

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.979 
it's not like I have really thick
strands<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.910> thinner<00:00:42.300> strands<00:00:42.809> but

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
strands I just have thinner strands but

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.779 
strands I just have thinner strands but
a<00:00:43.050> lot<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> them<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.160> found<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.460> out<00:00:44.520> by

I<00:06:33.449> use<00:06:33.689> a<00:06:33.719> different<00:06:34.229> leave-in<00:06:34.409> conditioner

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069 
I use a different leave-in conditioner

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:36.439

like<00:06:35.310> I<00:06:35.460> always<00:06:35.729> go<00:06:35.849> back<00:06:35.969> to<00:06:36.030> this<00:06:36.240> one

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
like I always go back to this one

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.360 
like I always go back to this one
because<00:06:36.659> the<00:06:37.229> other<00:06:37.349> ones<00:06:37.620> don't<00:06:37.830> really<00:06:38.129> work

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
because the other ones don't really work

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.399 
because the other ones don't really work
and<00:06:38.610> this<00:06:38.729> has<00:06:38.939> so<00:06:39.210> much<00:06:39.360> moisture<00:06:39.750> and<00:06:40.169> also

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:40.409 
and this has so much moisture and also

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:41.990 
and this has so much moisture and also
I've<00:06:40.530> noticed<00:06:40.889> that<00:06:41.009> the<00:06:41.129> consistency<00:06:41.849> is<00:06:41.969> a

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
I've noticed that the consistency is a

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.820 
I've noticed that the consistency is a
little<00:06:42.300> bit<00:06:42.389> thicker<00:06:42.719> so<00:06:43.110> it<00:06:43.259> really<00:06:43.530> does

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
little bit thicker so it really does

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.619 
little bit thicker so it really does
restore<00:06:44.250> that<00:06:44.370> moisture<00:06:44.789> back<00:06:45.000> into<00:06:45.030> my<00:06:45.419> hair

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:45.629 
restore that moisture back into my hair

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:47.450
