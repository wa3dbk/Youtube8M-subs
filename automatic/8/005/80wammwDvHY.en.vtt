because<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.930> are<00:00:40.080> cutting<00:00:40.560> metal<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.490> you

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
because you are cutting metal so you

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.370 
because you are cutting metal so you
want<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> make<00:00:41.910> sure<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.210> take<00:00:43.080> every

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
shear I have this one here and it locks

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.430 
shear I have this one here and it locks
in<00:00:49.710> place<00:00:49.770> when<00:00:50.340> you're<00:00:50.460> storing<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.170> like<00:00:52.170> so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
in place when you're storing it like so

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.420 
in place when you're storing it like so

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
to unlock it just go like that and then

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.100 
to unlock it just go like that and then
you'll<00:00:56.580> see<00:00:56.700> it<00:00:56.760> opens<00:00:57.060> up<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.780> particular

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
you'll see it opens up this particular

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.710 
you'll see it opens up this particular
set<00:00:58.650> of<00:00:58.680> sheers<00:00:59.100> will<00:00:59.490> cut<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.000> 20<00:01:00.510> gauge

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
set of sheers will cut up to 20 gauge

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.660 
set of sheers will cut up to 20 gauge
metal<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.890> blanks<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.250> we're<00:01:02.460> using

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
metal and the blanks that we're using

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.490 
metal and the blanks that we're using
and<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.000> sheets<00:01:03.270> are<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.630> to<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.840> 22<00:01:04.140> gauge

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and the sheets are going to be 22 gauge

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.940 
and the sheets are going to be 22 gauge
so<00:01:05.220> they're<00:01:05.370> going<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.519> cut<00:01:05.730> with<00:01:05.940> no<00:01:06.120> problem

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
so they're going to cut with no problem

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.080 
so they're going to cut with no problem
I'm<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> show<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> exactly<00:01:08.700> how<00:01:08.910> easy

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you're going to be using these which are

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.010 
you're going to be using these which are
for<00:01:16.350> metal<00:01:16.620> and<00:01:16.880> just<00:01:17.880> cut<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.510> I'm<00:01:18.660> not<00:01:18.840> using

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
for metal and just cut and I'm not using

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.450 
for metal and just cut and I'm not using
much<00:01:19.290> pressure<00:01:19.620> here<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.860> cut<00:01:23.100> through

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
much pressure here and just cut through

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.880 
much pressure here and just cut through
just<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:24.480> that

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.580 

there<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:28.580> go<00:01:28.729> now<00:01:29.210> might<00:01:29.570> have<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:30.170> little<00:01:30.470> bit

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
there you go now might have a little bit

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.410 
there you go now might have a little bit
of<00:01:30.830> curling<00:01:31.280> on<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.610> end<00:01:31.760> when<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.090> do<00:01:32.240> that

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
of curling on the end when you do that

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.270 
of curling on the end when you do that
you'll<00:01:32.630> see<00:01:32.690> it's<00:01:32.900> not<00:01:32.990> quite<00:01:33.050> flat<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:34.070> can

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
you'll see it's not quite flat you can

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.800 
you'll see it's not quite flat you can
just<00:01:34.400> take<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.729> rubber<00:01:34.970> mallet<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.630> bench

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
just take a rubber mallet and a bench

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.960 
just take a rubber mallet and a bench
block<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.140> Hammer<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.220> down<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:37.640> it's<00:01:37.729> flat

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
block and Hammer that down so it's flat

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.609 
block and Hammer that down so it's flat
again<00:01:38.300> you<00:01:38.810> also<00:01:38.930> might<00:01:39.170> want<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.409> take<00:01:39.590> a

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
again you also might want to take a

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.590 
again you also might want to take a
diamond<00:01:40.040> file<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.580> file<00:01:40.820> down<00:01:41.119> any<00:01:41.360> rough

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
diamond file and file down any rough

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.109 
diamond file and file down any rough
edges<00:01:42.040> now<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.070> brought<00:01:43.400> over<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.670> sharpie

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
edges now I brought over a sharpie

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.460 
edges now I brought over a sharpie
marker<00:01:44.150> here<00:01:44.720> because<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:45.020> want<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:45.229> show<00:01:45.410> you
