00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
cloth or towel over the cage you'll

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.870 
cloth or towel over the cage you'll
probably<00:02:33.260> go<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.380> pick<00:02:34.530> up<00:02:34.650> some<00:02:34.710> food<00:02:35.130> but<00:02:35.610> I

probably go and pick up some food but I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.590 
probably go and pick up some food but I
have<00:02:36.540> not<00:02:36.720> seen<00:02:37.140> him<00:02:37.230> eat<00:02:37.440> at<00:02:37.620> all<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:39.420> is

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
have not seen him eat at all but that is

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.360 
have not seen him eat at all but that is
proof<00:02:39.900> right<00:02:40.140> there<00:02:40.410> at<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.620> bottom<00:02:40.770> is<00:02:41.190> that

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
proof right there at the bottom is that

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.800 
proof right there at the bottom is that
he<00:02:41.670> has<00:02:42.180> eaten<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.140> gotten<00:02:43.590> poop<00:02:44.930> okay<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.680> I

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
he has eaten and gotten poop okay so I

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.230 
he has eaten and gotten poop okay so I
and<00:02:48.810> if<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.800> were<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.580> want<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.880> hand
