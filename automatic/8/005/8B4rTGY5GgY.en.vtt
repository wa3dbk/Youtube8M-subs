 new chapter a new video will have 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.540
 as rules 2 if you know this series of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.970
 we are fighting and good guys today I am 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.710
 it has happened to do a pretty combat 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.920
 interesting I think I'm going to fight with 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.970
 vegeta against cells but this time already 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.590
 is to win or is it going to 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.119
 rewrite history remember that 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.590
 you have to stop the comments in 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.420
 the combats if you want to see in agreement and 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.830
 those who most like the assumptions 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.600
 comments in the next fight os 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.460
 look agree and do not forget that 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.960
 I did online matches, I'm 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.430
 thinking about it maybe if I do not 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.870
 because this game has the twine but 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.430
 instead you have to because the truth 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.290
 that I have run out of the x lion so 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.490

 minecraft but and it's not going to be that way 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.350
 that today I have to upload this little 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.460
 video of dragon ball but nothing to say 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.680
 what minecraft games are you going to have 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.330
 extra this week of games the main 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.770
 graphs to be able to finish it and those 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.930
 five or six episodes that are left for 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.130
 kill the dragon and for all 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.810
 those various things that we have to 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.280
 do agree and nothing to announce that 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.410
 there is a new series it is very possible that 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.670
 already begins to fall this week assigns 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.650
 guys let's get to the subject 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.390
 Lets put 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.700
 that always passes the same law of murphy 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.110
 and guillermo does not know we have to 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.000
 Of course we caught a hard vegetable 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.580
 on steroids where these recipes here 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.650
 we have to catch him I do not know if this is 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.300
 the most we can use is up 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.250
 super leave agree we're going to 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.510
 catch us the normal but good of 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.770
 people should have more thanks the 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.840
 true that is a stroke and you only have 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.280
 two costumes in this game and you tell me 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.080
 a lot of sense because you use the racing 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.729
 two and new the ultimate tenkaichi good 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.380
 it has you hooked up to me it seems like a 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.880
 game shit honestly by the way 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.369
 let's fight against perfect cell 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.720
 perfect form nothing of normal cell and 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.580
 the customized one that can give me a 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.860
 tremendous beating and the random map by 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.940
 supposed as always when you ask me 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.250
 what because like this game of a 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.410
 ultimate tenkaichi to my routine and you have 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.610
 it seems to me a garbage is all cinematic 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.380
 so that a fighting game you have to 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.619
 fight you not the cinematic abb x xrt x 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.119
 and you look perfect, good guys, let's go 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.800
 back in situation remember that 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.670

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.939
 the games I want to end this and 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.860
 it's perfect but I've spent a year 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.480
 rather a day in the area of 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.549
 training and not in the rival for me 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.549

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.430
