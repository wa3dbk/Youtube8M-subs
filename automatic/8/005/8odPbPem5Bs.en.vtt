 that has emerged and that has already come out 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.080

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.970
 let's go up the second call of call tlc 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.259
 duty advanced warfare right now 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.300
 establishing background an image yo 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.890
 I'll know put with the four maps that 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.010
 the new weapon that already the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.320
 we have all and the pack of maps the pack 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.140
 of maps and the zombie map valet the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.210
 ex or zombies infection good guys guys 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.650
 before I start telling you that this dlc 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.030
 I liked it, I liked it 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.860
 you'll see this game at the beginning I do not 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.200
 I liked it and you all know it because I 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.060
 he said is not simply good, it is a 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.860
 different beauty color which needs 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.510
 a little more skill to be able 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.860
 kill and I'm not a person who has 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.180
 a lot of time therefore I have not 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.770
 I could put the hours that I had 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.240
 liked this game and I do not have the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.530
 enough skill to be able 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.360
 make me the games that made me 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.620
 whites 2 not in addition to the match making that 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.659
 has color and hated right now 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.579
 warfare that looks for you by ratio of casualties 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.560
 deaths by good ability and you will be 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.460
 seeing the new weapon they have gotten worth 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.880
 is the weapon the hm the omm which says 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.219
 suicide above d 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.140
 shot that had hidden themes and you 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.670
 I made a video a gameplay with her is 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.649
 pretty good is a machine gun that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.899
 it becomes a shotgun that is laser and 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.060
 good that is pretty well liked 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.289
 the weapon is nothing that we say is not what 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.119
 that I was really waiting for me 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.070
 I was waiting for a submachine gun or something for the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.409
 style but good is not bad is not 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.810
 bad good we start with the first map 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.960
 of this second dlp the map is called 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.429
 perú plex and it's a quite a map 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.950
 pretty reminds me a lot the pipeline in 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.590
 2025 because in the shape of houses and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.479
 the rest is a bit modern, not that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.149
 it consists of this map not like how 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.009
 this map works because it is a house or 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.810
 several houses do not detract you do not see 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.549
 not much but good is like a 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.750
 house that is made by blocks and there 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.299
 some moves that move the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.399
 blocks and good the map is dynamic 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.349
 it's not logical not if you move the blocks 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.720
 because it 's dynamic so that's the 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.069
 first map of all which for me 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.920
 I think it's going to be the most billet 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.650
 simply because they remind me of 2025 and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.239
 because it seems to be a very small map what 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.769
 What I like about this map is that it has 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.510
 a new exhibit of the same as 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.280
 hyperactivity and so on, it has a 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.350
 hook accessibility which is a hook 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.720
 what has 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.230
 which you can hook to any 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.540
 part of the map and there that plan flying in 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.460
 the in the campaign already left got hooked on 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.980
 a part of the campaign therefore 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.750
 Well, it's another way to get fucked 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.340
 streaks 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.630
 ie are you see a point map 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.060
 the uncle comes to you with the hook and have 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.550
 criterion but good is dynamic I do not 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.420
 like I like we go with the second map 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.010
 the second map is called sainz 244 the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.750
 which seems to be a destroyed ship or 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.490
 something like that, not like an airplane 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.500
 giant that crashed to them for 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.500
 power like a landfill that's not the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.750
 map pretty well and has a secret the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.420
 map does not have like a hidden streak the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.640
 what good is like a kind of egg 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.260
 of someone green is super weird that if 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.730
 you eat them you can see through the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.500
 walls to the enemies is like a 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.870
 increase what you are seeing on screen 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.550
 everyone will be leaving images well 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.280
 Currado and everything to make it clear 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.650
 everything and good is the map I think it's going to 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.970
 have more is not going to be weirder with 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.530
 this green egg this is going to be a 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.270
 bit strange because in any 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.850
 moment you can kill yourself there 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.850
 for nothing that the enemy gets a 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.820
 pellet 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.770
 because they know where they are but good 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.470
 like and we go with the third map the 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.330
 map called climent is a map which 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.360
 It's very beautiful because it's like jungle and 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.640
 well it is very very flowery with many 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.170
 trees and those very green things and that's the 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.600
 true that the sight is very happy and 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.640
 good has a hidden streak like all 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.100
 according to all maps not which good 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.020
 the water arrives as a sediment at the end of the 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.600
 map not as below the map which is 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.660
 water but there is a super transformer that 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.160
 when it explodes the water becomes 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.770
 acid and kills all the people who 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.200
 they are inside that pond not that 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.330
 enclosure with water so one is a map 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.150
 dynamic like all the other colonies 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.070
 warfare or almost all and this can be 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.750
 very dangerous I do not always think of 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.130
 the gusts because the truth get a 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.230
 range who does not want to get a 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.790
 streak not because it can be a fucking day if 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.140
 you're on a roll and this happens to you 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.900
 someone activates that shit or activates 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.790
 alone and it kills you can be very funny and 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.830
 we go with the last map called top 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.500
 shop which has left me a little 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.419
 pale I do not know let's see it's a map that 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.220
 well it's dark it's pretty dark 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.770
 is why 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.660
 at night it is in plan the square map of 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.270
 white 2 to give you an idea and 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.640
 has seen in the trailer that the uncle 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.460
 shows the toaster white 2 is 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.410
 I do not know what it was called the mirror of 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.720
 white 2 that warmed people and 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.150
 frei to the west they used to kill 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.390
 campers, it 's on that map, it's worth 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.000
 a turret but with that with that put 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.100
 then I do not know it 's very weird dude is very 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.780
 strange but the guy gets a low 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.700
 multiple with that I hope I do not know that no 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.670
 be so seated because if it would not be a 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.650
 unfortunate but good that map is 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.330
 the one that I liked the least and now 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.610
 we spend with the zombies as you are 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.350
 seeing on screen exactly admit 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.780
 a zombie goya 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.090
 This is a cucumber and I do not know what that is 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.270
 but it can be very dangerous not a 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.340
 goliat zombie no sir will have to count to 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.140
 kill I say it already a mother trip I've 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.360
 admitted good as that the map 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.340
 infection I think it's called that exodus 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.960
 thousand which I will leave an image I did not find 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.480
 many images of this is also not that 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.340
 I know a lot of exo zombies in all 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.460
 case when the air tlc leaves a 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.530
 direct 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.750
 the miso exodus upload a game or what 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.560
 be it but now guys the information is 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.360
 what there is 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.370
 I hope that the game of 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.259
 bottom lines I go with the asm 1 is 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.330
 piqué and serves as a floor assistant 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:52.090
 and I almost make a relentless streak 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.370
 was the game started and I got some 42 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.960
 to 10 if I'm not wrong so nothing 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.520
 I hope the mole of this kind of 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.470
 videos information as it costs a 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.759
 little compiled everything do not have 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.110
 had time to do it before that 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.960
 I have taken a long time do not 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.669
 it took quite a few hours sgc you're 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.139

 I just went up to do things 23 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.400

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.500
 problem that I have every time I changed 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.500
 of color even now class
