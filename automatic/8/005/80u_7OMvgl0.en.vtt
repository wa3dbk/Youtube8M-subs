00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
protected area but at the moment I think

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
protected area but at the moment I think
we're<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.040> gonna<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.400> free-for-all<00:01:18.240> free

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
for everybody just to build wherever you

the<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.150> future<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.409> easily

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the in the future so that we can easily

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
the in the future so that we can easily
warp<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> different<00:01:26.520> parts<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> map<00:01:27.060> I'm

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
warp to different parts of the map I'm

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.030 
warp to different parts of the map I'm
gonna<00:01:27.659> try<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.200> actually<00:01:28.380> before<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
gonna try and do that actually before I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.429 
gonna try and do that actually before I
actually<00:01:29.220> launch<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.119> server<00:01:30.930> before<00:01:31.380> I

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
actually launch the server before I

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.020
