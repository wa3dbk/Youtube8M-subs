this<00:01:44.060> thing<00:01:44.360> sharp<00:01:49.390> it's<00:01:50.390> quite<00:01:50.810> sharp<00:01:51.229> out<00:01:51.530> of

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
this thing sharp it's quite sharp out of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.469 
this thing sharp it's quite sharp out of
the<00:01:51.770> box

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.179 

it's<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.630> way<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:57.079> are<00:01:57.200> playing<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.860> don't

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
it's the way that are playing it don't

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.809 
it's the way that are playing it don't
matter<00:01:59.560> not<00:02:00.560> for<00:02:00.770> this<00:02:00.890> type<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.189> cutting

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.490 

people<00:02:04.819> might<00:02:05.000> compare<00:02:05.450> this<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.929> Voyager

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
people might compare this to the Voyager

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.449 
people might compare this to the Voyager
it<00:02:06.649> is<00:02:07.000> around<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.239> same<00:02:08.450> size<00:02:08.780> maybe<00:02:09.429> 0.1<00:02:10.429> or

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
it is around the same size maybe 0.1 or

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.380 
it is around the same size maybe 0.1 or
two<00:02:10.759> inches<00:02:11.180> longer<00:02:11.480> in<00:02:11.750> blade<00:02:12.080> length<00:02:12.440> and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
two inches longer in blade length and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.870 
two inches longer in blade length and
the<00:02:14.390> handle<00:02:14.810> length<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.349> also<00:02:15.950> longer<00:02:16.459> but

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
the handle length is also longer but

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.839 
the handle length is also longer but
it's<00:02:17.780> basically<00:02:18.349> a<00:02:18.470> comparable<00:02:19.190> size<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.730> the

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
it's basically a comparable size to the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.710 
it's basically a comparable size to the
Voyager<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:21.769> does<00:02:22.040> cost<00:02:22.340> significantly<00:02:22.720> more

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
Voyager it does cost significantly more

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.759 
Voyager it does cost significantly more
in<00:02:24.110> price<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.370> worth<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.910> well<00:02:26.440> it's<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
in price is that worth it well it's the

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.569 
in price is that worth it well it's the
same<00:02:28.040> type<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.400> steel<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.150> same<00:02:29.420> Triad<00:02:29.989> lock

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
same type of steel the same Triad lock

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.890 
same type of steel the same Triad lock
the<00:02:31.579> main<00:02:31.790> difference<00:02:32.299> you<00:02:32.450> know<00:02:32.569> aside<00:02:32.840> from

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
the main difference you know aside from

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.410 
the main difference you know aside from
the<00:02:33.260> blade<00:02:33.500> shape<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:34.670> main<00:02:34.880> difference<00:02:35.299> is

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
the blade shape the main difference is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.130 
the blade shape the main difference is
to<00:02:35.569> handle<00:02:35.900> material<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.799> have<00:02:36.829> g10<00:02:37.959> which<00:02:38.959> is

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
to handle material you have g10 which is

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.340 
to handle material you have g10 which is
stronger<00:02:39.680> versus<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.519> grigory<00:02:41.139> which<00:02:42.139> is

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
stronger versus the grigory which is

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.479 
stronger versus the grigory which is
lighter<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.160> you<00:02:43.220> decide<00:02:44.560> but<00:02:45.560> overall<00:02:45.950> I

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
lighter so you decide but overall I
