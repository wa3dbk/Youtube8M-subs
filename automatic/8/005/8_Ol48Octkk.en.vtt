00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
there and this ran to not a 9-volt I got

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.499 
there and this ran to not a 9-volt I got
to<00:01:59.369> nine<00:01:59.579> volts<00:01:59.880> 9-volt<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.509> each<00:02:00.630> side<00:02:00.930> so

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
to nine volts 9-volt on each side so

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.910 
to nine volts 9-volt on each side so
anyway<00:02:03.509> I've<00:02:03.810> never<00:02:04.020> seen<00:02:04.290> anyone<00:02:04.619> do
