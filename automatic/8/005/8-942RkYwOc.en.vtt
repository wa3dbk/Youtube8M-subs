00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.410 

okay<00:00:01.620> just<00:00:02.460> that<00:00:02.700> some<00:00:03.410> people<00:00:04.410> asked<00:00:04.950> him

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
okay just that some people asked him

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.379 
okay just that some people asked him
about<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:07.020> new<00:00:07.649> velocity<00:00:08.550> that<00:00:09.059> we've<00:00:09.179> done

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
about the new velocity that we've done

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.320 
about the new velocity that we've done
basically<00:00:12.679> the<00:00:13.679> questions<00:00:14.130> were<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:15.059> you

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
basically the questions were what you

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.599 
basically the questions were what you
gain<00:00:15.630> here<00:00:15.900> or<00:00:15.960> what<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.440> lose<00:00:16.680> him<00:00:16.890> by<00:00:17.100> having

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
gain here or what you lose him by having

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.630 
gain here or what you lose him by having
a<00:00:17.640> concave<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:19.039> compared<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.539> I'd<00:00:21.539> say<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> full

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
a concave but compared to I'd say a full

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.830 
a concave but compared to I'd say a full
back<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.970> baton<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> traditional<00:00:25.050> style

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
back of a baton the traditional style

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.269 
back of a baton the traditional style
there's<00:00:27.840> something<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.260> I've<00:00:28.529> talked<00:00:29.099> about

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
there's something that I've talked about

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.770 
there's something that I've talked about
for<00:00:29.490> many<00:00:29.910> years<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:31.099> even<00:00:32.099> though<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.430> make

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
for many years that even though we make

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.080 
for many years that even though we make
the<00:00:33.780> bigger<00:00:34.020> looking<00:00:34.440> bats<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.520> concave

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the bigger looking bats with the concave

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.500 
the bigger looking bats with the concave
again<00:00:36.480> I've<00:00:37.230> always<00:00:37.649> said<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
again I've always said that it's it's a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660 
again I've always said that it's it's a
fashion<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.320> trend<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.399> would<00:00:41.489> make

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
fashion it's a trend and it would make

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.740 
fashion it's a trend and it would make
them<00:00:41.910> because<00:00:42.239> they<00:00:42.390> sell<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:47.430> me<00:00:47.640> con<00:00:48.239> caving

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
them because they sell to me con caving

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.410 
them because they sell to me con caving
can<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.200> very<00:00:49.890> detrimental<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.120> if

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
can be very detrimental to the but if

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.720 
can be very detrimental to the but if
it's<00:00:51.570> too<00:00:51.870> fierce<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.190> takes<00:00:53.460> too

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it's too fierce because it takes too

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.660 
it's too fierce because it takes too
much<00:00:53.879> wood<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.719> actual<00:00:54.840> hitting<00:00:55.440> area

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
much wood out of the actual hitting area

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.189 
much wood out of the actual hitting area
just<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> sake<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.270> having<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.960> bigger

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
just for the sake of having a bigger

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:06.109 
just for the sake of having a bigger
edge<00:01:01.190> but<00:01:03.110> that's<00:01:04.110> where<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:05.010> worked<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
edge but that's where I worked on a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.719 
edge but that's where I worked on a
different<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.960> few<00:01:07.260> different<00:01:08.130> stars<00:01:08.430> of

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
different a few different stars of

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.020 
different a few different stars of
concave<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.220> settled<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.250> what<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.700> use

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
concave it and settled with what we use

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.800 
concave it and settled with what we use
which<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.420> quite<00:01:12.659> delicate<00:01:13.020> gentle<00:01:13.950> shape<00:01:14.810> and

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
which is quite delicate gentle shape and

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.300 
which is quite delicate gentle shape and
you'll<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.320> why<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.799> second<00:01:18.229> but<00:01:19.229> there's<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you'll see why in a second but there's a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.920 
you'll see why in a second but there's a
general<00:01:20.790> rule<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.729> old<00:01:23.880> bat<00:01:24.090> still<00:01:24.450> work<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
general rule the old bat still work the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.980 
general rule the old bat still work the
old<00:01:25.110> traditional<00:01:25.740> bat<00:01:25.979> still<00:01:26.369> work<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.420> what

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
old traditional bat still work so what

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.069 
old traditional bat still work so what
I'm<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.259> do<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.619> going<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> show<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
I'm going to do is I'm going to show you

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.710 
I'm going to do is I'm going to show you
one<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.710> specter<00:01:32.640> bats<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.210> hasn't<00:01:33.479> got

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
one of the specter bats which hasn't got

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.359 
one of the specter bats which hasn't got
a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> concave<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.890> actually<00:01:35.250> it's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
a lot of concave in in actually it's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.319 
a lot of concave in in actually it's
quite<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.610> gentle<00:01:36.119> concave<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:38.329> then

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
quite a gentle concave in there and then

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.450 
quite a gentle concave in there and then
the<00:01:40.340> velocity<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.630> put<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:44.040> internet

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the velocity that I put on the internet

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.990 
the velocity that I put on the internet
yesterday<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.490> just<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.820> get

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
yesterday I think it was just so you get

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.030 
yesterday I think it was just so you get
see<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.810> two<00:01:49.020> different<00:01:49.439> shapes<00:01:50.689> so<00:01:52.040> that's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
see the two different shapes so that's

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.260 
see the two different shapes so that's
the<00:01:53.220> specter<00:01:55.040> quite<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> big<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.549> big<00:01:56.820> edge<00:01:57.000> on

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the specter quite a big but big edge on

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:06.850 
the specter quite a big but big edge on
it<00:01:58.430> with<00:02:00.110> 40<00:02:01.110> milliliters

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:14.320 

okay<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.520> gentle<00:02:09.090> shape<00:02:09.360> their

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:22.300 

velocity<00:02:18.140> more<00:02:19.140> tapered<00:02:19.739> edge<00:02:19.890> there

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.339 

no<00:02:23.310> concave<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.030> it's<00:02:24.180> up<00:02:24.330> put<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.170> two

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
no concave and it's up put the two

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:36.370 
no concave and it's up put the two
together<00:02:31.040> there<00:02:32.040> we<00:02:32.310> go<00:02:34.400> see<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.580> difference

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
together there we go see the difference

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.280 
together there we go see the difference
okay<00:02:37.880> now<00:02:41.630> when<00:02:42.630> we're<00:02:42.810> trying<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.140> hit

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
okay now when we're trying to hit

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.410 
okay now when we're trying to hit
cricket<00:02:43.769> ball<00:02:43.920> where<00:02:44.400> are<00:02:44.489> we<00:02:44.549> trying<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.849> hit

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.920 

hit<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.750> ball<00:02:53.120> we've<00:02:54.120> got<00:02:54.360> four<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
hit the ball we've got four and a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.509 
hit the ball we've got four and a
quarter<00:02:55.080> inches<00:02:55.560> there<00:02:55.769> we're<00:02:56.069> trying<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.430> hit

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
quarter inches there we're trying to hit

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.620 
quarter inches there we're trying to hit
in<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.760> middle<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> bat<00:02:57.410> okay<00:02:59.420> that's<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
in the middle of the bat okay that's the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.190 
in the middle of the bat okay that's the
bulk<00:03:00.840> of<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.200> but<00:03:02.660> doesn't<00:03:03.660> matter<00:03:03.720> how<00:03:03.959> big

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
bulk of the but doesn't matter how big

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.370 
bulk of the but doesn't matter how big
these<00:03:04.349> edges<00:03:04.739> are<00:03:05.299> or<00:03:06.299> how<00:03:06.540> thick<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.989> toe<00:03:07.200> is

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
these edges are or how thick the toe is

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.309 
these edges are or how thick the toe is
on<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.620> bat<00:03:08.150> they're<00:03:09.150> not<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.510> hitting<00:03:09.720> areas

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
on the bat they're not the hitting areas

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.199 
on the bat they're not the hitting areas
you're<00:03:10.980> going<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.220> get<00:03:11.370> more<00:03:11.549> response<00:03:12.000> from

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
you're going to get more response from

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.160 
you're going to get more response from
here<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:13.680> are<00:03:13.890> down<00:03:14.160> here<00:03:14.190> or<00:03:15.090> up<00:03:15.269> here<00:03:15.980> but

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
here you are down here or up here but

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.720 
here you are down here or up here but
simply<00:03:19.170> speaking<00:03:19.739> we're<00:03:20.040> looking<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.459> hit<00:03:20.640> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
simply speaking we're looking to hit the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.900 
simply speaking we're looking to hit the
ball<00:03:20.940> in<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.389> area<00:03:21.959> so<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:23.160> we<00:03:25.670> will<00:03:26.670> take

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
ball in that area so if we will take

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.099 
ball in that area so if we will take
those<00:03:27.750> two<00:03:28.019> bats<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.910> cut<00:03:30.209> sections<00:03:30.690> out<00:03:30.870> of

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
those two bats and cut sections out of

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:38.170 
those two bats and cut sections out of
them<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:35.040> would<00:03:35.220> be<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.430> concave<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.090> area

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
them that would be the concave in area

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.330 
them that would be the concave in area
concave<00:03:39.180> piece<00:03:43.069> that<00:03:44.069> is<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.000> full<00:03:45.420> bodied

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
concave piece that is the full bodied

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:54.379 
concave piece that is the full bodied
back<00:03:47.340> okay<00:03:48.829> now<00:03:49.850> if<00:03:50.850> we<00:03:51.090> think<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:53.389> thicker

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
back okay now if we think of thicker

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.460 
back okay now if we think of thicker
edges<00:03:54.870> how<00:03:55.680> much<00:03:55.889> are<00:03:56.069> we<00:03:56.100> losing<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:56.940> bat

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.650 
edges how much are we losing in that bat
how<00:03:58.470> much<00:03:58.859> wood<00:03:59.280> are<00:03:59.549> we<00:03:59.700> losing<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.239> crucial

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
how much wood are we losing that crucial

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.289 
how much wood are we losing that crucial
area<00:04:00.870> where<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.049> want<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.260> hit<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.470> ball<00:04:02.060> well

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.099 

this<00:04:06.299> is<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.599> full<00:04:06.810> piece<00:04:07.139> full<00:04:08.099> bodied<00:04:08.430> piece

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
this is the full piece full bodied piece

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.330 
this is the full piece full bodied piece
I've<00:04:10.109> drawn<00:04:11.870> round<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.139> concave<00:04:13.650> piece<00:04:14.100> on

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
I've drawn round that concave piece on

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.330 
I've drawn round that concave piece on
there<00:04:14.549> so<00:04:14.880> what<00:04:15.090> we<00:04:15.180> were<00:04:15.269> losing<00:04:16.280> losing<00:04:17.280> a

there so what we were losing losing a
bit<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.729> edges

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
bit on the edges

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.770 
bit on the edges
a<00:04:19.079> little<00:04:19.769> bit<00:04:19.919> from<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.129> camera<00:04:20.509> to<00:04:21.509> lose

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
a little bit from the camera to lose

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.110 
a little bit from the camera to lose
what<00:04:22.500> we<00:04:22.530> lose<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:22.860> about<00:04:24.169> 2/3<00:04:25.169> ml<00:04:25.560> roughly<00:04:26.159> out

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
what we lose in about 2/3 ml roughly out

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.110 
what we lose in about 2/3 ml roughly out
of<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.509> actual<00:04:27.870> hitting<00:04:28.319> area<00:04:28.470> over<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.860> bar

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
of the actual hitting area over the bar

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.980 
of the actual hitting area over the bar
up<00:04:30.120> here<00:04:30.289> okay<00:04:32.090> what<00:04:33.090> do<00:04:33.240> we<00:04:33.360> lose<00:04:33.539> if<00:04:33.960> we

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
up here okay what do we lose if we

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.100 
up here okay what do we lose if we
compare<00:04:35.090> full-bodied<00:04:36.090> one<00:04:36.800> become<00:04:37.800> cubed<00:04:38.190> one

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
compare full-bodied one become cubed one

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.020 
compare full-bodied one become cubed one
lose<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.139> little<00:04:40.349> bit<00:04:40.530> off<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.770> edge<00:04:41.009> about<00:04:41.310> 2-3

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
lose a little bit off the edge about 2-3

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.129 
lose a little bit off the edge about 2-3
mm<00:04:42.860> okay<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:45.409> in<00:04:46.409> essence<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:48.690> way<00:04:48.870> we've

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
mm okay so in essence the way we've

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.920 
mm okay so in essence the way we've
tried<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:49.949> put<00:04:50.430> gentle<00:04:50.940> scooping<00:04:51.629> into<00:04:51.840> the

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
tried to put gentle scooping into the

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.959 
tried to put gentle scooping into the
bus<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:55.440> actual<00:04:55.800> hitting<00:04:56.190> area<00:04:56.370> is<00:04:56.759> always

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:56.969 
bus the actual hitting area is always

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.119 
bus the actual hitting area is always
going<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.270> be<00:04:57.330> there<00:04:57.710> okay

00:04:59.119 --> 00:04:59.129 
going to be there okay

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:01.850 
going to be there okay
so<00:05:00.030> we<00:05:00.330> can<00:05:00.509> harvest<00:05:00.690> thicker<00:05:01.050> ages<00:05:01.469> as<00:05:01.590> one

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
so we can harvest thicker ages as one

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.270 
so we can harvest thicker ages as one
here<00:05:02.159> they<00:05:03.000> could<00:05:03.210> be<00:05:03.330> six<00:05:03.539> inches<00:05:03.750> thick<00:05:04.280> make

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
here they could be six inches thick make

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.140 
here they could be six inches thick make
a<00:05:05.310> very<00:05:05.580> heavy<00:05:05.849> bar<00:05:06.150> but<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:06.900> won't<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:09.000> won't

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
a very heavy bar but it won't it won't

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.540 
a very heavy bar but it won't it won't
go<00:05:09.419> any<00:05:09.690> any<00:05:10.050> differently<00:05:10.500> from<00:05:10.590> here<00:05:10.949> it's

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
go any any differently from here it's

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.200 
go any any differently from here it's
this<00:05:11.789> area<00:05:12.090> here<00:05:12.539> that<00:05:12.750> we're<00:05:12.900> looking<00:05:13.169> at<00:05:14.210> the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
this area here that we're looking at the

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.959 
this area here that we're looking at the
central<00:05:16.699> area<00:05:17.699> of<00:05:17.729> the<00:05:17.819> bar<00:05:18.090> so<00:05:19.490> if<00:05:20.490> you've<00:05:20.789> got

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969 
central area of the bar so if you've got

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.769 
central area of the bar so if you've got
fierce<00:05:21.979> scalloping<00:05:22.979> on<00:05:23.159> a<00:05:23.190> bat<00:05:23.520> if<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.300> was<00:05:24.509> to

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:24.779 
fierce scalloping on a bat if I was to

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:33.350 
fierce scalloping on a bat if I was to
you<00:05:27.050> got<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.080> pen<00:05:30.620> so<00:05:31.729> if<00:05:32.729> you've<00:05:32.909> got<00:05:33.029> fierce

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
you got a pen so if you've got fierce

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.600 
you got a pen so if you've got fierce
collar<00:05:33.779> pee<00:05:34.020> on<00:05:34.139> a<00:05:34.169> bat<00:05:35.569> there<00:05:37.310> that<00:05:38.310> would

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
collar pee on a bat there that would

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:49.969 
collar pee on a bat there that would
then<00:05:42.259> drop<00:05:43.259> into<00:05:43.560> their<00:05:43.860> lineup<00:05:48.590> so<00:05:49.590> all<00:05:49.740> of<00:05:49.889> a

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
then drop into their lineup so all of a

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:57.890 
then drop into their lineup so all of a
sudden<00:05:50.449> you've<00:05:51.449> lost<00:05:55.340> that<00:05:56.340> area<00:05:56.849> there<00:05:57.090> to

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
sudden you've lost that area there to

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.769 
sudden you've lost that area there to
hit<00:05:58.080> it<00:05:58.729> lost<00:05:59.729> a<00:05:59.879> lot<00:06:00.060> of<00:06:00.090> wood<00:06:00.360> you've<00:06:00.539> lost

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:00.779 
hit it lost a lot of wood you've lost

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.439 
hit it lost a lot of wood you've lost
probably<00:06:01.770> five<00:06:02.039> a<00:06:02.069> good<00:06:02.490> five<00:06:02.819> milliliter

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
probably five a good five milliliter

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.909 
probably five a good five milliliter
side<00:06:04.250> so<00:06:05.300> when<00:06:06.300> you're<00:06:06.419> looking<00:06:06.659> at<00:06:06.810> about<00:06:06.919> try

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
side so when you're looking at about try

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.040 
side so when you're looking at about try
and<00:06:08.039> look<00:06:08.129> for<00:06:08.330> gentle<00:06:09.330> shaping<00:06:09.840> in<00:06:09.990> the

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
and look for gentle shaping in the

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.070 
and look for gentle shaping in the
concave<00:06:10.620> it<00:06:10.879> rather<00:06:11.879> than<00:06:12.120> a<00:06:12.180> fierce<00:06:12.509> concave

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
concave it rather than a fierce concave

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:21.019 
concave it rather than a fierce concave
it<00:06:15.289> edges<00:06:16.289> don't<00:06:16.889> really<00:06:17.250> matter<00:06:17.400> for<00:06:20.029> going

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
it edges don't really matter for going

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:25.939 
it edges don't really matter for going
for<00:06:21.150> the<00:06:21.240> edges<00:06:21.539> there<00:06:24.440> you<00:06:25.440> still<00:06:25.680> got<00:06:25.860> as

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
for the edges there you still got as

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.159 
for the edges there you still got as
much<00:06:26.099> hitting<00:06:26.400> area<00:06:26.819> there<00:06:27.029> is<00:06:27.570> you<00:06:27.779> having<00:06:28.050> a

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
much hitting area there is you having a

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.540 
much hitting area there is you having a
concave<00:06:29.070> but<00:06:30.320> because<00:06:31.320> it's<00:06:31.889> fuller<00:06:32.219> it's

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
concave but because it's fuller it's

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.670 
concave but because it's fuller it's
just<00:06:32.789> on<00:06:32.940> the<00:06:33.060> very<00:06:33.210> edge<00:06:33.509> where<00:06:34.349> we've<00:06:34.440> taken

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
just on the very edge where we've taken

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.399 
just on the very edge where we've taken
the<00:06:34.770> weight<00:06:34.949> out<00:06:35.219> to<00:06:36.029> lose<00:06:36.240> some<00:06:36.509> wood<00:06:36.719> to<00:06:37.289> get

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
the weight out to lose some wood to get

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.339 
the weight out to lose some wood to get
the<00:06:37.560> way<00:06:37.710> to<00:06:37.770> the<00:06:38.099> bats<00:06:38.339> down<00:06:38.669> okay<00:06:39.419> doesn't

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
the way to the bats down okay doesn't

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.709 
the way to the bats down okay doesn't
matter<00:06:40.620> what<00:06:40.830> happens<00:06:41.370> whatever<00:06:42.210> shape

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
matter what happens whatever shape

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:46.129 
matter what happens whatever shape
you've<00:06:43.320> got<00:06:43.500> to<00:06:43.680> lose<00:06:43.889> wood<00:06:44.190> somewhere<00:06:44.990> to<00:06:45.990> get

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 
you've got to lose wood somewhere to get

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:52.430 
you've got to lose wood somewhere to get
the<00:06:46.320> weight<00:06:46.560> down<00:06:47.389> okay<00:06:48.560> so<00:06:51.020> that's<00:06:52.020> the<00:06:52.229> skill

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
the weight down okay so that's the skill

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.050 
the weight down okay so that's the skill
of<00:06:52.469> the<00:06:52.649> bat<00:06:52.800> make<00:06:53.039> take<00:06:53.520> it<00:06:53.639> from<00:06:53.789> the<00:06:53.880> right

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
of the bat make take it from the right

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.089 
of the bat make take it from the right
areas<00:06:55.339> to<00:06:56.339> keep<00:06:56.490> performance<00:06:57.089> in<00:06:57.240> the<00:06:57.360> back

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:58.099 
areas to keep performance in the back

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:01.040 
areas to keep performance in the back
okay<00:06:59.099> that's<00:06:59.669> it<00:06:59.940> made<00:07:00.300> a<00:07:00.330> bit<00:07:00.539> of<00:07:00.569> sense<00:07:00.659> for

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
okay that's it made a bit of sense for

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.019 
okay that's it made a bit of sense for
you<00:07:02.029> if<00:07:03.029> not<00:07:04.310> let<00:07:05.310> me<00:07:05.339> know<00:07:05.460> and<00:07:05.669> I'll<00:07:05.759> try<00:07:05.969> to

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:06.029 
you if not let me know and I'll try to

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.839 
you if not let me know and I'll try to
explain<00:07:06.149> in<00:07:06.479> another<00:07:06.690> way
