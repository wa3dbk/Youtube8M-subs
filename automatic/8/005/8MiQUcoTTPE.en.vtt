00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 tell a little story my dad had 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.250
 implanted chile guajillo when 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.680

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.570
 advantage for example there to the field to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.690

 they are controlling their needs 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.880
 it may be dirty and it may be 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.820
 polluted is very important that 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.590
 whenever we're going to use a chili 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.689
 just like the vegetables also like 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.429

 tantito not burn them and we will 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.140
 stop hydrating are dry there are two 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.569
 types of drying in the sun or in dryer

 well liquefied and if you can this one for the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.170

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.930
 the variety of chiles they want 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.069
 we go there we can see how they are when 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.069
 perfectly 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.739

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.840
 leaves are those used to make the 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.400
 bottoms or broths are tall pots and 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.190
 thin is very important 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.630
 and what I like most the truth that I 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.120
 like it seems that is what more than soil 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.090
 in the home kitchen do this kind of 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.390
 movement where I saw my grandmother 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.550

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.130
 kitchen thank you heart let's fry the 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.940
 for a few minutes we can see 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:49.180
 how it starts to jump jumps fast 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.620
 nothing more what a delight those who said I 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.410
 of the marrow the only thing that I was 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.340
 what I put was some little carrots 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.230
 here I tie them a little thread to keep 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.270
 the marrow and then do not leave 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.510
 until I'm dancing there all over 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.550
 the distance across the east for all 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.140
 the pot not yes because I did not enjoy it anymore 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.210
 then when the guest arrives 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.520
 the beginning very nice with your consuelito 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.440
 that we can only withdraw goals what 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.310
 we can withdraw from before on arrives 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.310
 if it is not very good 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.590
 in a few minutes I already have 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.540
 the spicy already fried here is already ready 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.340
 to add I think we're not going to see 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.470
 this guy nor dear artisan like 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.410
 a mini lies like washing perfectly 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.240
 what the vegetables said 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.860
 and coming back we will add all these 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.940
 ingredients of this delicious mole and 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.190
 again fruits and vegetables can 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.740
 be contaminated by harmful germs 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.830
 pesticides and dirt when 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.740
 we buy that's why it's advisable to know 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.170
 how you have to wash them since doing it wrong 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.190
 can lead to the loss of their 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.050
 nutrients for that is recommended 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.710
 wash them with plenty of water with a 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:07.030
 handful of salt and a splash of vinegar 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.800
 these will have a bactericidal action 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.470
 The whole process should not be superior to 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.440
 15 or 20 minutes as many 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.850
 vegetables have water-soluble vitamins 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.850
 and they could lose their properties 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.689
 nutritional if they undergo processes 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.580
 longer 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.530
 he came back 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.090

 about 15 minutes not only you know it 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.819

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.710
 television times we have to 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.909
 Hurry a bit but I'm already 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.830
 seeing that you are breaking the point of 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.879
 boiling we can see the movement of 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.759
 the malls how to start moving 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.620
 russia movement if they are up to some 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.389
 small bubbles that we can see there 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.250
 that is saying he is breaking 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.610
 the point of view we are going to add the 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.610

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.520

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.500
 Minimum seals are small balls 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.470
 we are not going to sting them in code 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.150
 So much the step of the hoop and we're going to 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.370
 unveil with him for closing 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.870
 as this is where grain is requested 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.419
 and apart is a very complete dish not 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.789
 they are totally buy one more dish 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.280
 that self-sufficient everything that jumped 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.139
 tortillitas not good images of 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.670
 marrow when it comes out with the taste of 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.530
 all 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.990
 Now I'm going to feel that I did not do it 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.690
 you in your house can put to cook 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.960
 these marrow bones and have them there 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:30.210
 already ready and is to make a with a background 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.680
 sorry to the bottom with this but I 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.620
 As I am the other way around I like to do 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.110
 practice and the taste will not vary 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.970
 because this go they must release meat 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.260
 this is a juice and release the flavor 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.720
 then the truth 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.040
 I decided to do it as I do in my 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.740
 house to share it with you 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.090
 it was a more professional technique but 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.100
 as I know that sometimes we do not have the time 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.460
 clear talking about how we do it 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.590
 quickly ok ok we're all 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.150
 let's integrate 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.760
 from here he is beginning to read 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.910
 delicious let's add what are the 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:09.920
 that have more cooking time 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:14.210
 exactly we are going towards the marrow 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:17.120
 what do you think if we add the low 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:20.420
 the strait knows here exactly and 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.540
 brazil add me do the water and already the 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.030
 green beans the carrots have less this 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.070
 its urgency is much more delicate 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.710
 all of the zucchini we're going to 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.009
 wait 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.100
 a little more time 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:44.000
 Y 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:47.090
 there he will put the carrot so that 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.290
 are soft and at this moment I am going to 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.290
 add so much salt 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.240
 It's not so good 

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.389
