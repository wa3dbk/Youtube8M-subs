 three years ago he presented it in the

 to the national water commission 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.980
 it is also presumed to the secretariat 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.480
 of economics they even praised him in 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.689
 the secretariat of protection to the environment 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.900
 environment but not anyone 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:27.050
 dependency shelter to your project just 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.400
 they wished luck to someone who said 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.400
 I'm not at the level of the president 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.670
 calderÃ³n that I am re thing of shamans 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.590
 well, in what head can this be? 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.300
 understand then it turns out that innovation 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.239
 technology of this Mexican engineer 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.480
 of the polytechnic triumph but in 11 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.520
 countries russia india colombia where 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.280
 they opened the door they recognize that 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.250
 it's an innovative theme that can 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.010
 revolutionize the world's agriculture and 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.590
 You can solve hunger 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.510
 poverty and malnutrition 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.790
 after seeing the waste of water in 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.690
 agricultural risks jesus rico created the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.490
 called magic dust on average 80 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.360
 percent of all fresh water from 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:16.240
 country is wasted in agriculture 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.210
 because irrigation systems are made 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.690
 without measure when this called dust 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.150
 magical is in contact with the rain the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.550
 solidifies this rain can be saved 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.460
 in sacks under the shade and you can 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.460
 sow during any month of the year 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.390
 and so leave it like when you crush 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.120
 a jelly and it's always the rain with 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.600
 the seeds and you already have the humidity 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.060
 for that seed to germinate and grow 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.250
 plant without a drop of rain or 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.860
 watering your invention also called rain 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.110
 solid can counteract the drought that 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.750
 whips various regions of the country that 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.620
 instead of losing the entire harvest 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.280
 because it stopped raining 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.620
 a meter away with this technique 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.290
 we take 15 tons of corn this powder 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.090
 that he already sells to 11 countries can do 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.220
 that the crops resist up to 10 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.370
 years without water when you do not have this 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.500
 technique these shade pots of the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.590
 interiors 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.159
 and I would consume 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.950
 52 risks per year instead of 2 and 400 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.629
 liters of water per year instead of that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.209
 you're a restless Mexican who does not know 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.069
 Render says that in this sexennium again 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.069
 is going to touch the doors 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.620
 I will continue to insist 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.800
 and if it takes another ten years for it to 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.750
 I hope I live those in the history of 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.750
 galicia up to here news
