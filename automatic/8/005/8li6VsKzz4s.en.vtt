00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
nice and smoothly and going to check the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.310 
nice and smoothly and going to check the
resistance<00:01:38.000> on<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.299> terminals<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> make<00:01:40.110> sure

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
resistance on the terminals to make sure

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.710 
resistance on the terminals to make sure
there<00:01:40.530> isn't<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.860> short<00:01:41.220> or<00:01:41.340> anything<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.970> they

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

there isn't a short or anything and they
have<00:01:42.899> these<00:01:43.130> ferrofluid<00:01:44.149> cooled<00:01:45.149> tweeters

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
have these ferrofluid cooled tweeters

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.609 
have these ferrofluid cooled tweeters
built<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:47.540> I<00:01:48.540> imagine<00:01:49.350> those<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.680> okay<00:01:50.600> and

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.399 

yeah<00:01:54.159> very<00:01:54.670> nice<00:01:54.969> the<00:01:55.570> grills<00:01:55.899> are<00:01:56.170> in

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
yeah very nice the grills are in

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.380 
yeah very nice the grills are in
excellent<00:01:56.950> condition<00:01:56.979> both<00:01:57.579> of<00:01:57.789> them<00:01:57.909> have<00:01:58.119> no

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
excellent condition both of them have no

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.490 
excellent condition both of them have no
signs<00:01:58.689> of<00:01:58.899> any<00:01:59.549> tearing<00:02:00.549> or<00:02:00.820> or<00:02:01.539> anything<00:02:01.840> no

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
signs of any tearing or or anything no

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.950 
signs of any tearing or or anything no
runs<00:02:02.829> in<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.159> fabric<00:02:03.960> or<00:02:04.960> signs<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.350> damage<00:02:06.960> so

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
runs in the fabric or signs of damage so

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.509 
runs in the fabric or signs of damage so
I'm<00:02:08.019> gonna<00:02:08.140> pull<00:02:08.410> one<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.649> these<00:02:08.830> drivers<00:02:09.129> out

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
I'm gonna pull one of these drivers out

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.550 
I'm gonna pull one of these drivers out
just<00:02:09.879> to<00:02:10.000> see<00:02:10.239> if<00:02:10.450> there's<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.780> production<00:02:11.349> data

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
just to see if there's a production data

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.400 
just to see if there's a production data
I<00:02:11.890> believe<00:02:12.549> there's<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.849> way<00:02:13.299> of<00:02:13.510> telling<00:02:13.780> when

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
I believe there's a way of telling when

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.530 
I believe there's a way of telling when
these<00:02:14.530> are<00:02:14.709> made<00:02:14.890> these<00:02:15.879> speakers<00:02:16.330> were<00:02:16.480> in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
these are made these speakers were in

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.949 
these are made these speakers were in
production<00:02:17.910> throughout<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.060> 1980s<00:02:19.810> and

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
production throughout the 1980s and

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.900 
production throughout the 1980s and
possibly<00:02:20.879> early<00:02:21.879> 90s<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:24.099> I<00:02:24.370> go<00:02:24.670> ahead<00:02:24.730> and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
possibly early 90s so I go ahead and

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.380 
possibly early 90s so I go ahead and
take<00:02:25.060> one<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.330> these<00:02:25.390> out<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:25.810> take<00:02:25.959> a<00:02:25.989> look<00:02:26.230> at

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.180

production date underneath it's August
28<00:02:38.790> 1986<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:42.280> yeah<00:02:42.579> that's<00:02:42.970> pretty<00:02:43.060> cool<00:02:47.879> and

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
28 1986 so yeah that's pretty cool and

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.369 
28 1986 so yeah that's pretty cool and
as<00:02:49.750> long<00:02:49.989> as<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:52.079> don't<00:02:53.079> know<00:02:53.140> what<00:02:53.290> you

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
as long as the I don't know what you

as long as the I don't know what you
would<00:02:53.470> call<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.250> diaphragm<00:02:54.610> is<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.540> good

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
would call that the diaphragm is in good

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.539 
would call that the diaphragm is in good
condition<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.530> believe<00:02:56.769> these<00:02:56.950> speakers<00:02:57.340> are

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
condition I believe these speakers are

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.420 
condition I believe these speakers are
entirely<00:02:57.970> repairable<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.139> this<00:03:00.069> will<00:03:00.220> be<00:03:00.310> my

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
entirely repairable and this will be my

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.430 
entirely repairable and this will be my
first<00:03:00.700> time<00:03:01.090> ever<00:03:01.150> trying<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:02.019> reform

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
first time ever trying to reform

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.949 
first time ever trying to reform
speakers<00:03:03.100> so<00:03:03.459> I'm<00:03:03.880> actually<00:03:04.209> looking<00:03:04.450> forward

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
speakers so I'm actually looking forward

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.809 
speakers so I'm actually looking forward
to<00:03:05.079> this<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:08.829> believe<00:03:08.889> the<00:03:09.280> combs<00:03:09.609> are

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
to this and I believe the combs are

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.780 
to this and I believe the combs are
still<00:03:10.450> good<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:12.099> they<00:03:12.250> seem<00:03:12.849> to<00:03:12.880> be<00:03:13.000> any<00:03:13.239> way

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
still good and they seem to be any way

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.629 
still good and they seem to be any way
this<00:03:15.790> just<00:03:15.849> comes<00:03:16.389> off<00:03:16.630> all<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.280> cells<00:03:18.280> or<00:03:18.519> the

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
this just comes off all the cells or the

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.170 
this just comes off all the cells or the
foam<00:03:18.849> just<00:03:19.209> dissolves<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.139> turns<00:03:20.410> into<00:03:20.590> mush

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
foam just dissolves and turns into mush

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.319 
foam just dissolves and turns into mush
and<00:03:22.180> given<00:03:22.599> that<00:03:22.720> they're<00:03:22.930> about<00:03:24.299> 23<00:03:25.299> years

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.409 
and given that they're about 23 years
old<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:25.989> not<00:03:26.049> surprising<00:03:26.349> I<00:03:27.030> did<00:03:28.030> read<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.239> lot
