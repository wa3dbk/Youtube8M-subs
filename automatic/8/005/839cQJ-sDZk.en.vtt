00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.140
So Petra, congratulations...it s was beautiful moment..

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.260
here I have a gift for you

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.620
because we found that you are a fan of our series of Surgery in the rose garden (Czech Series)

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.360
So here are a few gifts

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.300
and I would like to ask

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.180
What would you say to a minor role?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.800
The First, thank you for gifts and  thank you for your congratulations..

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:27.144
This series I am watching a long time

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
so I am fan..

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.440
when I hear on tour something in Czech, it's a nice change

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.980
because I am all the time in foreign countries

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.680
And. .. it's kind of show that does not end

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so

00:00:37.378 --> 00:00:39.098
still there is something happening

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.000
and if the offer came at a smaller role

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.980
I would probably had to hard thinking

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.540
So now, you don´t say YES?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.540
today no :-)

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.540
ok

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.680
What else, are you doing on tour during the evening?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.220
So, I also like reading

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.940
so I have a lot of books

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:11.120
when the coach thinks that I might like some book, he gives this book..and I read it in plane or in hotel

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.080
or I watch movies

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.160
and so on :)

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.460
Tell something about Champions ball? How did you choose the dress?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:35.760
so on Sunday afternoon, I was in the locker room complex

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.040
there was a selection about of forty dresses

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.940
a lady suggested me four, five dresses..

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.480
so I tried it and selected the one

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.440
and the ball was amazing...it was in Wimbledon spirit

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.040
they appreciated every member

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.440
there were many Wimbledon champions

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.400
and it was an honor for me to stand there as this year's champion

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.240
Who sent you sms and who congratulated you?

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.020
aaa, so..

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.260
So, if I not count family and friends who are especially important for me

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.960
they stand by me in times of trouble

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.680
so congratulations were from

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.720

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.500
and everyone hope , it's not my last title

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.340
so I'll try to make it was not the last

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.140
Do you know what you do with the prize money?

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.660
No, I have no idea what I'll do with it.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.100
I'd finally built family house to my parents.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.645

00:02:56.645 --> 00:02:59.405
to finally improved it..

00:02:59.405 --> 00:03:02.340

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.100
