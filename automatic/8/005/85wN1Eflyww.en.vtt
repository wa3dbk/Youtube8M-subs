00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:03.529 
what's a lovely day today and I thought

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:05.780 
what's a lovely day today and I thought
because<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.680> sun<00:00:04.950> shining<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.520> few<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.730> the

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
because of sun shining and a few of the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.220 
because of sun shining and a few of the
flowers<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.330> stuff<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.810> thought<00:00:06.930> would<00:00:07.049> walk

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
flowers and stuff I thought would walk

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.500 
flowers and stuff I thought would walk
down<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.710> pond<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.040> we<00:00:08.370> took<00:00:09.030> out<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> few

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
down to the pond that we took out a few

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.020 
down to the pond that we took out a few
years<00:00:09.690> ago<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.380> did<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> YouTube<00:00:11.309> video<00:00:11.820> that's

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
years ago I did a YouTube video that's

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.230 
years ago I did a YouTube video that's
of<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> JCB<00:00:12.870> there<00:00:13.519> and<00:00:14.519> I'm<00:00:14.849> really<00:00:15.059> done<00:00:15.210> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
of the JCB there and I'm really done a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.750 
of the JCB there and I'm really done a
recap<00:00:15.690> on<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.049> but<00:00:16.289> I'm<00:00:17.190> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.550> look

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
recap on it but I'm going to have a look

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.519 
recap on it but I'm going to have a look
is<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.029> what's<00:00:18.750> really<00:00:19.050> nice<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.500> I

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
is that what's really nice is that I

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.109 
is that what's really nice is that I
planted<00:00:19.800> some<00:00:19.920> wildflower<00:00:20.460> mix<00:00:20.730> around<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
planted some wildflower mix around the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.480 
planted some wildflower mix around the
edge<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> pond<00:00:21.689> years<00:00:22.230> ago<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:23.310> that's

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
edge of the pond years ago and that's

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.950 
edge of the pond years ago and that's
all<00:00:23.670> come<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.240> fact<00:00:24.480> just<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.750> little

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
all come out in fact just a little

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.080 
all come out in fact just a little
couple<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.289> golf<00:00:25.470> inches<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.920> think<00:00:25.949> floor<00:00:27.019> so

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
couple of golf inches I think floor so

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.630 
couple of golf inches I think floor so
yeah<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:31.009> got<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> nice<00:00:32.219> array

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
yeah can you see here got a nice array

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.270 
yeah can you see here got a nice array
of<00:00:32.850> them<00:00:33.320> sort<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.380> moon<00:00:34.590> daisies<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.100> think

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
of them sort of moon daisies I think

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.060 
of them sort of moon daisies I think
they<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:36.110> growing<00:00:37.110> around<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.620> edge<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
they are growing around the edge of the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.410 
they are growing around the edge of the
pond<00:00:38.280> okay<00:00:38.489> lattice<00:00:38.790> lovely<00:00:39.180> isn't<00:00:39.329> it

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
pond okay lattice lovely isn't it

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.110 
pond okay lattice lovely isn't it
because<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.640> they<00:00:41.640> wouldn't<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:41.940> there

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
because then they wouldn't be there

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.520 
because then they wouldn't be there
without<00:00:42.270> my<00:00:42.600> intervention<00:00:42.840> without<00:00:43.320> me

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
without my intervention without me

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.069 
without my intervention without me
putting<00:00:43.770> these<00:00:44.070> seeds<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.899> bare

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
putting these seeds on the on the bare

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.520 
putting these seeds on the on the bare
earth<00:00:46.110> when<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:46.910> being<00:00:47.910> dug<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.440> we

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
earth when it was being dug out and we

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
earth when it was being dug out and we
see<00:00:49.710> next<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.280> willow<00:00:50.579> there<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
see next to a little willow there that I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.810 
see next to a little willow there that I
actually<00:00:52.320> put<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.949> into<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> stick<00:00:53.610> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
actually put that into the stick of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.660 
actually put that into the stick of
about<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:55.230> they<00:00:55.500> probably<00:00:55.710> 10<00:00:55.949> years<00:00:55.980> ago<00:00:56.309> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
about and they probably 10 years ago and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.270 
about and they probably 10 years ago and
I<00:00:57.390> did<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> prune<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> other<00:00:58.829> year<00:00:59.100> so

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I did to prune it up the other year so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.380 
I did to prune it up the other year so
it's<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.460> starting<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.820> shoot<00:01:00.000> out<00:01:00.180> really

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
it's just starting to shoot out really

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.430 
it's just starting to shoot out really
well<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.719> done<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> look<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.230> proper

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
well it's done to look like a proper

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.810 
well it's done to look like a proper
tree<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.090> but<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.149> actual<00:01:03.420> pond<00:01:03.660> itself<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
tree now but the actual pond itself a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.070 
tree now but the actual pond itself a
lot<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.909> Education<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:06.750> at<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> moment

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
lot of Education in there at the moment

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.060 
lot of Education in there at the moment
not<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> lot<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.220> water<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:10.530> only<00:01:10.860> runs

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
not a lot of water because it only runs

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.120 
not a lot of water because it only runs
office<00:01:11.549> or<00:01:11.790> run<00:01:11.970> off<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.420> fields<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
office or run off of the fields and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.469 
office or run off of the fields and
there<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.430> land<00:01:14.670> drain<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.090> goes<00:01:15.270> in

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
there is one land drain that goes in

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.880 
there is one land drain that goes in
there<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.869> there's<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.259> lot<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.470> water<00:01:16.680> at

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
there so there's not a lot of water at

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.859 
there so there's not a lot of water at
the<00:01:16.950> moment<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.729> still<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> good<00:01:18.540> haven

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the moment but I'm still a good haven

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020
