00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
 Hi guys Chris Fix here and today I'll show you 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.700
 How to prevent your car windows from clogging due to water vapor. 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.960
 Sure, you can use products from the store to keep your car windows from fogging 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.760
 But you know that you can find products all over your house that can perform the same function 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.900
 In this video we will test potatoes, baby shampoo, hand soap and shaving cream 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.360
 Against the anti-fouling that you bought from the store 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.100
 So let's first know why the cars windows are rusted 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.980
 Fog occurs because of a difference in temperature, because there is moisture in the air ... 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.780
 Now the atmosphere is cool outside, body temperature is warm, my breath warm and moist in high air ... 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.860
 This creates fog in the winter. 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.540
 In summer the opposite happens, the atmosphere is warm outside ... 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.760
 But you are running the air conditioner inside, so the atmosphere is cool inside and any moisture inside the car ... 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.500
 It will turn into a mist on your windshield. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.960
 For fog on the glass I have a bowl of hot water ... 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.640
 As you can see ... 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.860
 We did this test to see if we could successfully shut down the glass 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.480
 Now I can go and clean the glass ... 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.740
 The window will be trimmed into 5 parts to test each mist-proof. 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140
 Now with window divided into 5 parts ... 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.440
 Let's test the products. 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.580
 The first product is Rain.X Anti fog ... 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.260
 She says directions to put some of it on a towel ... 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.180
 Just wipe it on the glass. 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.000
 Make sure you cover all of the glass ... 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.700
 Then take a dry spot on a paper towel and wipe gently until it removes any traces. 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.180
 So the upper-left box is Rain.X. 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.460
 The next product is shaving cream. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.260
 All you have to do with shaving cream is to get some of it on the glass ... 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.860
 And then a towel with a paper towel. 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.720
 I use a new paper towel so that there is no mixing. 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.200
 Make sure all the glass is covered again. 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.760
 Now we can scan until the window becomes clean 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.860
 Eventually it will become clean, this definitely takes more effort compared to Rain.X Pal ... 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.820
 Well we've finished shaving cream 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.700
 We will go down to the right corner. 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.780
 At the bottom of the corner I will use the old diving trick that I use for my persuasion. 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.280
 If the mask is prevented from fogging the stone feet under the surface of the water 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.500
 Must work on my truck 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.800
 So we will put it, again and make sure we get it everywhere 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.500
 Then you will get a clean paper towel and gently wipe it on the top 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.100
 So we remove any traces and get a clean window 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.840
 When you do this you do not want to remove the layer you set 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.820
 You just want to make sure you can see through the glass and it's clean and clear 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.780
 Now test potatoes 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.540
 Now you can be amazed by the use of the cover 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.560
 This is one of the urban legends when divers, supposed to be able to split potatoes 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.420
 Then just take the end here 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.480
 And rub it on the glass 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.120
 Make sure you cover all of the glass 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.060
 The liquid of the potato is actually very clear, maybe this will actually work 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.800
 In order to be honest with you, I have never really tried it 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.360
 Then bring a paper towel and wipe gently until it removes any traces. 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.980
 And these look good 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.880
 Then another one is a sterile hand material 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.520
 Just get a little and put it on the glass 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.400
 Then we will rub 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.120
 Then you will get a new paper towel and wipe it 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.380
 Absolutely clear like others 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.400
 So in this corner we have a rain.x 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.040
 Shaving cream 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.120
 Children soap 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.740
 potato 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.100
 Hand sterile material 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.440
 Now go get hot water for steaming and see how it works 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.260
 So we have a pot of hot water 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.180
 Lets test it out 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.080
 So that we can see our rain.x 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.100
 And we have a shaving cream 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.260
 Worked very well 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.480
 Now if we went down here 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.740
 We have a children's shampoo which left some effects 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.400
 So it does not look that good 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.980
 A touch like soap and this thing is not strange 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.500
 We have the potatoes again, left some sort of residue, does not seem to be clear, not soap at least 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.280
 Then we have a hand senatiser that is the reason alcohol drives people to say it works because alcohol has it 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.740
 That obviously does not work 

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.720
 So from our results we can see that it is the best two results which are at the top 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.040
 Those Tuesday did not work well 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.960
 The worst was the sterile hand material 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.160
 Potatoes and baby soap did not work 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.180
 In the summary, shaving cream works at the same level as rain.x 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.780
 Everyone has a shaving cream at home 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.800
 So in my opinion it's a clear winner, you do not need to go out and buy anything special 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.340
 The fog was not above, looks nice and clear, and was very easy to apply 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.640
 The results speak for themselves 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.060
 before and after 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.600
 No shaving cream 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.720
 Shaving cream 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.480
 The difference is very clear there 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.040
 I hope this video was helpful
