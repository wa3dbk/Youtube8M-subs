pretty

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.999 
pretty
so<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.659> opted<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.259> 30ml<00:01:22.979> bottle

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so I just opted for the 30ml bottle

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
so I just opted for the 30ml bottle
because<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.869> probably<00:01:25.259> want<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.500> for

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
because I do just probably want it for

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.109 
because I do just probably want it for
fall<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.040> winter<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.580> wanted<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:26.939> get

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
fall and winter and it wanted like get

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.240 
fall and winter and it wanted like get
like<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> huge<00:01:27.600> bottle<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> was<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> fragrance

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
like a huge bottle if it was a fragrance

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.469 
like a huge bottle if it was a fragrance
that<00:01:29.310> I'd<00:01:29.460> wear<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.880> year<00:01:30.060> round<00:01:30.119> then<00:01:30.450> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that I'd wear all year round then I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.789 
that I'd wear all year round then I
probably<00:01:30.750> would<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.619> that's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
probably would have just because that's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.190 
probably would have just because that's
how<00:01:31.950> much<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.250> love<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.810> knew<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> was

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
how much I love it but I knew it was

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.560 
how much I love it but I knew it was
probably<00:01:34.380> only<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.490> seasonal<00:01:36.060> scent<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.509> I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
probably only like a seasonal scent so I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.550 
probably only like a seasonal scent so I
don't<00:01:36.720> want<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> big<00:01:37.320> one
