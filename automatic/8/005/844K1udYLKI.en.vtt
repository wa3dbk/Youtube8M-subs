so<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.690> know<00:02:19.780> we<00:02:20.260> get<00:02:20.620> fine<00:02:20.860> cards<00:02:21.310> that

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
so that you know we get fine cards that

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.980 
so that you know we get fine cards that
we<00:02:21.550> don't<00:02:21.730> necessarily<00:02:21.940> remember<00:02:22.690> off<00:02:22.960> the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
we don't necessarily remember off the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.470 
we don't necessarily remember off the
top<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.200> our<00:02:23.410> head<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.560> lot<00:02:23.770> easier<00:02:24.360> all<00:02:25.360> right

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
top of our head a lot easier all right

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.360 
top of our head a lot easier all right
so<00:02:25.750> we're<00:02:26.320> just<00:02:26.440> gonna<00:02:26.530> build<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.890> deck<00:02:27.070> you

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
so we're just gonna build the deck you

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.440 
so we're just gonna build the deck you
know<00:02:27.400> but<00:02:27.730> too<00:02:27.880> much<00:02:28.060> glass<00:02:28.270> at<00:02:28.630> for<00:02:28.930> those<00:02:30.450> and

necessarily<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.640> deck<00:02:33.880> part<00:02:34.180> that's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
necessarily the deck part that's

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.070 
necessarily the deck part that's
important<00:02:35.020> for<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.350> it's<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:37.450> know<00:02:37.510> showing

through this part all right so we got
the<00:02:43.900> base<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.260> our<00:02:44.320> decade<00:02:44.800> now<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:49.570> can

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
really useful that shows you rarity but

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.350 
really useful that shows you rarity but
that's<00:03:22.870> no<00:03:23.140> not<00:03:23.650> really<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:23.980> relevant

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
that's no not really that relevant

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.580 
that's no not really that relevant
alright<00:03:25.360> so<00:03:25.510> what<00:03:25.810> you're<00:03:25.930> gonna<00:03:25.989> do<00:03:26.320> is

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
alright so what you're gonna do is

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.740 
alright so what you're gonna do is
mostly<00:03:27.400> some<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.030> these<00:03:28.120> don't<00:03:28.239> do<00:03:28.450> anything

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
mostly some of these don't do anything

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.560 
mostly some of these don't do anything
like<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.959> deck<00:03:29.170> name<00:03:29.410> doesn't<00:03:29.739> do<00:03:29.830> anything

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
like the deck name doesn't do anything

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.180 
like the deck name doesn't do anything
if<00:03:31.570> you<00:03:31.690> click<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:31.989> deep<00:03:32.290> analysis<00:03:32.890> these<00:03:33.130> are

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
if you click on deep analysis these are

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.470 
if you click on deep analysis these are
some<00:03:33.489> really<00:03:33.610> cool<00:03:33.730> things<00:03:33.910> like<00:03:34.269> the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
some really cool things like the

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.860 
some really cool things like the
probability<00:03:34.989> thing<00:03:36.090> shows<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.239> like<00:03:37.420> by<00:03:37.840> a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
probability thing shows you like by a

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.390 
probability thing shows you like by a
certain<00:03:38.260> turn<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:39.100> know<00:03:39.160> what's<00:03:39.340> the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
certain turn you know what's the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.880 
certain turn you know what's the
probability<00:03:39.730> you'll<00:03:40.000> have<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> certain<00:03:40.480> card

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
probability you'll have a certain card

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.470 
probability you'll have a certain card
that<00:03:41.890> can<00:03:42.040> show<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.310> starting<00:03:42.850> hands<00:03:43.120> but

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
that can show you starting hands but

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.790 
that can show you starting hands but
this<00:03:43.570> is<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.900> coolest<00:03:44.230> thing<00:03:44.350> that<00:03:44.620> George

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
this is the coolest thing that George

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.000 
this is the coolest thing that George
Baxter<00:03:45.160> analysis<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.900> what<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:47.560> does<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.890> it

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
Baxter analysis it what it does is it

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.190 
Baxter analysis it what it does is it
looks<00:03:48.160> at<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.370> color<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.820> manicott<00:03:49.780> there

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
looks at the color the manicott there

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.650 
looks at the color the manicott there
are<00:03:50.290> colored<00:03:50.590> symbols<00:03:51.250> in<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.430> mana<00:03:51.640> cost<00:03:51.700> and

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
are colored symbols in the mana cost and

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.810 
are colored symbols in the mana cost and
breaks<00:03:52.870> them<00:03:53.050> down<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:54.370> have<00:03:54.580> you<00:03:54.670> hit

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
breaks them down and you have you hit

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
each type of land slot you need so like

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.690 
each type of land slot you need so like
you<00:04:02.380> know<00:04:02.440> obviously<00:04:02.560> dual<00:04:03.100> lands<00:04:03.340> will<00:04:03.550> give

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
you know obviously dual lands will give

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.690 
you know obviously dual lands will give
you<00:04:03.790> two<00:04:03.970> colors<00:04:05.070> but<00:04:06.070> it<00:04:06.160> shows<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.459> how<00:04:06.640> many

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
you two colors but it shows you how many

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.850 
you two colors but it shows you how many
of<00:04:06.940> each<00:04:07.090> color<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:07.690> need<00:04:08.049> to<00:04:08.260> have<00:04:08.410> access

of each color you need to have access

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.650 
of each color you need to have access
for<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.190> make<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.519> run<00:04:09.640> smoothly<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.480> if<00:04:10.570> you

for to make it run smoothly and if you

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.240 
for to make it run smoothly and if you
have<00:04:10.750> cars<00:04:10.959> look<00:04:11.110> like<00:04:11.140> flashback<00:04:11.920> or

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
have cars look like flashback or

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.470 
have cars look like flashback or
anything<00:04:12.430> like<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.150> need<00:04:13.330> an

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
anything like that that you need an

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.870 
anything like that that you need an
extra<00:04:13.810> color<00:04:14.049> for<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.500> can<00:04:14.680> add<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:14.950> string<00:04:15.549> and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
extra color for you can add a string and

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.900 
extra color for you can add a string and
type<00:04:16.510> those<00:04:16.720> colors<00:04:17.140> and<00:04:17.169> manual

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
type those colors and manual

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.870 
type those colors and manual
and<00:04:18.239> what<00:04:19.170> it'll<00:04:19.320> do<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.620> it'll<00:04:20.040> add<00:04:20.340> those<00:04:20.610> to

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
and what it'll do is it'll add those to

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.670 
and what it'll do is it'll add those to
the<00:04:20.910> thing<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.930> those<00:04:22.050> are<00:04:22.260> things<00:04:22.470> like

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
the thing so those are things like

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.410 
the thing so those are things like
kicker<00:04:23.010> or<00:04:23.400> anything<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.790> has<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.030> different

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
kicker or anything that has a different

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.240 
kicker or anything that has a different
color<00:04:24.600> that's<00:04:25.080> not<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.380> McMahon<00:04:25.800> accost<00:04:26.100> you

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
color that's not a McMahon accost you

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.370 
color that's not a McMahon accost you
can<00:04:26.340> put<00:04:26.520> those<00:04:26.670> on<00:04:26.880> alright<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:27.690> now<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.840> we

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
can put those on alright so now that we

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.200 
can put those on alright so now that we
have<00:04:28.560> that<00:04:28.740> information<00:04:28.950> we're<00:04:29.880> gonna<00:04:29.970> go

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
have that information we're gonna go

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.540 
have that information we're gonna go
build<00:04:30.630> our<00:04:30.990> land<00:04:31.290> base<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.860> can<00:04:32.040> check<00:04:32.370> off

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
build our land base you can check off

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.940 
build our land base you can check off
all<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:32.790> lands<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:34.440> know<00:04:34.530> this<00:04:34.680> is<00:04:34.800> just

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
all the lands and you know this is just

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.800 
all the lands and you know this is just
you<00:04:35.250> know<00:04:35.340> this<00:04:35.460> is<00:04:35.610> just<00:04:35.640> like<00:04:35.940> adding<00:04:36.270> normal

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
you know this is just like adding normal

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.230 
you know this is just like adding normal
cards<00:04:37.200> you<00:04:37.320> know<00:04:37.470> add<00:04:37.680> force<00:04:38.040> dragons<00:04:38.790> go<00:04:38.940> some

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
cards you know add force dragons go some

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.270 
cards you know add force dragons go some
that's<00:04:40.790> etc<00:04:41.790> so<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:43.050> now<00:04:43.170> you<00:04:43.230> have<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.920> complete

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
that's etc so so now you have a complete

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.300 
that's etc so so now you have a complete
deck<00:04:44.520> but<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.090> don't<00:04:45.300> have<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.840> sideboard

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
deck but you don't have a sideboard

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.920 
deck but you don't have a sideboard
so<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.990> add<00:04:49.140> sideboard<00:04:49.710> cards<00:04:50.130> just<00:04:50.940> like<00:04:51.090> you

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
so you add sideboard cards just like you

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.090 
so you add sideboard cards just like you
add<00:04:52.080> any<00:04:52.320> other<00:04:52.470> cards<00:04:53.960> we're<00:04:54.960> at<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.260> Rio<00:04:55.950> if

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
add any other cards we're at the Rio if

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.020 
add any other cards we're at the Rio if
you<00:04:56.190> hit<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:56.400> little<00:04:56.610> button<00:04:56.700> right<00:04:57.000> here

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
you hit this little button right here

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.840 
you hit this little button right here
resets<00:04:57.690> your<00:04:58.140> filter<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:59.250> sometimes<00:04:59.670> if<00:04:59.760> you

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
resets your filter and sometimes if you

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.700 
resets your filter and sometimes if you
like<00:04:59.970> filter<00:05:00.390> more<00:05:00.630> than<00:05:00.810> certain<00:05:01.470> amount<00:05:01.650> of

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
like filter more than certain amount of

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.500 
like filter more than certain amount of
time<00:05:01.890> you<00:05:02.100> have<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.310> reset<00:05:02.700> it<00:05:02.730> piece<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.420> all

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
time you have to reset it piece of all

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.540 
time you have to reset it piece of all
let<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:03.900> so<00:05:04.350> we're<00:05:04.440> gonna<00:05:04.500> recheck<00:05:05.190> all<00:05:05.400> the
