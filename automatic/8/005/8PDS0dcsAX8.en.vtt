00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.640
 a beautiful city started yesterday in the second class leader Groningen boys 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.589
 received seven houses that are in a very nice third place 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.570
 the guests the start a good to the game this was also brown with 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.160
 apron that passes through the chest into the hands of the keeper erwin oosterhof 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.509
 then a great opportunity for defender within fifteen minutes and hits the post 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.239
 after a good attack 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.419
 shortly thereafter through the brown on a muscle often died on the left good 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.930
 gave up 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.510
 the ball ends up at karin dreijer in the short corner a good save again 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 keeper oosterhof 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.620
 minutes later the ball is eliminated but comes at the feet of the fast 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.690
 and chiel slijngard 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.690
 he passes two men 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.380
 and a traffic jam that runs the great poverty 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.260
 in the rebound, leniency could be lost with a hard shot from the back of sti 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.869
 walk thunder from vrc keeper of the cages 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.869
 through the head of nico klundertenaar centrumsteden 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.740
 and we can empathize 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.560
 good pass from step sister sister markermeer here again lacks a good control 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 possibility of vrc to open the score 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.759
 but you lose the ball after just a few million set up on the evening itself 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.980
 with the ball back 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.060
 search the space and shoot 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.060
 Peter had to take that ball 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.930
 another new attack from the home team 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.290
 slijngard passes the ball before the ball passes over the field 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.550
 and the big with the shot 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.420
 so many chances but still no goals 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.840
 the groninger boys come better in the match and the money scores after one 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.840
 half an hour of playing but also opening 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.510
 Joos Army top to walk into the East Bank and she has the ball over goalkeeper Tim 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.270
 cler 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.270
 so he makes the e-mail 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.269
 and then it goes fast this is the seven minutes later 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.010
 very nice attack set up by pong clemencia lyrics to schreuder 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.279
 the ball back 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.570
 in 2009 he was rightly given all the space 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.699
 shoot is 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.629
 and Sint van Koornwaard's outside world is the Sint Jansplein 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.629
 with the way his team brings to 2 0 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.519
 we haven't seen anything in yellow sea for hours, maybe for hours 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.109
 we throw the brown walk through one gets the ball back 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:44.109
 but the shot between easy for goalkeeper oosterhof 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:49.989
 the chrono becomes a stroke of tranquility the fast vineyard and through fifteen minutes 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.659
 it a corner 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.189
 see joure slijngard in the corner and find one at the first goal on the east 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.490
 or 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.490
 he simply nods the ball in and thus makes a second of the match 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:02.580
 so we go with 3 0 for the normal boys 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.580
 and that is flattering 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:11.219
 images of the second half, just like at the start of the game, pressure from gfc 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.339
 groningen 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.339
 and a stop is sent away 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.509
 but you have a leg and in the middle nico klunder completely free 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.749
 he had a bunch of himself the beams he wanted to have that ball 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.790
 with, among other things, beautiful jump leniency on the largest that can shoot 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.349
 and weather oosterhof city well to keep 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.650
 then the corner for the guests 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.110
 there will be a fatal accident 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.079
 with next to it 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.749
 despite the great backlog, the sea did not win and remains 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:47.749
 a fight with two new penalty but the cross pass 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.289
 the ball becomes the penalty area you prevent the interim leader 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.289
 so many chances but still no goal for the guests 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:03.439
 trainer Fred Rutten wants more fierceness in the port of the already too large 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.209
 parts for the attackers the building process and the geer cs also get more opportunities 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.009
 but the first boys 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.719
 a window is stopped here on Friday evening, but no new street got it 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.409
 before that yellow 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:21.949
 it would be the greatest chance of scoring a goal for the top shooter 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:22.759
 ground 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.330
 the scotch via of the kurried ball are on the bar not much later would be great 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.289
 be exchanged 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.590
 and then keeps coming back 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.419
 klunder opens on the left 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.400
 and via via the ball comes to the feet of learning 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.630
 he dines with the three renÃ© for just under ten minutes to play 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.630
 control makes alalst 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.370
 last minute of the match 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.150
 nico klunder takes a quick free-kick 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.400
 social media which books 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.550
 he was fine in the far corner 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.080
 3 2 through to the document 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.289
 would it still work for mobile 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.289
 jarno kuipers for the ball once again forward 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.379
 hassan checks 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.379
 nothing and then the boys are gone 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.870
 8 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.630

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.679
 hoogervorst congratulations for trainer jan veldhuis 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.770
 his team strengthened the lead and 4 7 homes remain despite it 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.270
 loss of points are in third place 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.560
 no goals so from the second big this afternoon but dreams comfort his task 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.440
 he scored twice 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.680
 quite a bit of rvc a corrugated iron under or that is nice that you can win today 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.370
 with 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.159

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.729

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:01.529
 to go 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.389
 the theme fell in the second half 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.749
 the control of the match was still the same as with most homes 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:07.639
 deserved victory today
