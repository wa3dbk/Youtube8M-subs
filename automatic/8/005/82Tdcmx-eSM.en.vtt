00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.990 

let's<00:00:12.380> try<00:00:12.559> a<00:00:12.590> unison<00:00:13.129> bend<00:00:13.370> here<00:00:13.700> on<00:00:13.849> the

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
let's try a unison bend here on the

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.480 
let's try a unison bend here on the
third<00:00:14.299> in<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:14.629> second<00:00:15.019> string<00:00:15.290> now<00:00:16.189> because

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
third in the second string now because

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.339 
third in the second string now because
of<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:16.760> offset<00:00:17.210> tuning<00:00:17.630> of<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:17.869> third<00:00:18.170> in<00:00:18.289> the

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
of the offset tuning of the third in the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.830 
of the offset tuning of the third in the
second<00:00:18.710> string<00:00:19.090> where<00:00:20.090> it's<00:00:20.240> tuned<00:00:20.480> to<00:00:20.720> the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
second string where it's tuned to the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.730 
second string where it's tuned to the
fourth<00:00:21.560> fret<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:22.550> 3rd<00:00:22.910> string<00:00:23.590> it's<00:00:24.590> going

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
fourth fret of the 3rd string it's going

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.140 
fourth fret of the 3rd string it's going
to<00:00:24.800> be<00:00:24.890> done<00:00:25.070> just<00:00:25.220> a<00:00:25.369> little<00:00:25.640> bit<00:00:25.759> differently

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
to be done just a little bit differently

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.290 
to be done just a little bit differently
the<00:00:27.220> first<00:00:28.220> and<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.490> second<00:00:28.820> string<00:00:29.000> or<00:00:29.150> tuned

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
the first and the second string or tuned

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.679 
the first and the second string or tuned
to<00:00:29.480> fourth<00:00:29.720> apart<00:00:30.609> whereas<00:00:31.609> the<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.390> third<00:00:32.599> in

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
to fourth apart whereas the the third in

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.210 
to fourth apart whereas the the third in
the<00:00:32.780> second<00:00:33.080> string<00:00:33.260> or<00:00:33.410> tuned<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:33.710> major<00:00:33.890> third

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
the second string or tuned a major third

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.100 
the second string or tuned a major third
so<00:00:34.519> it's<00:00:34.670> going<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.850> be<00:00:34.910> a<00:00:35.239> little<00:00:35.870> bit

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
so it's going to be a little bit

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
finger here on the fourteenth fret of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.800 
finger here on the fourteenth fret of
the<00:01:53.070> 3rd<00:01:53.430> string<00:01:54.740> pick<00:01:55.740> them<00:01:55.890> both<00:01:56.460> together

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.969 

notice<00:02:00.810> again<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.080> tension<00:02:01.560> from<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.830> whole

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
notice again the tension from that whole

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.540 
notice again the tension from that whole
step<00:02:02.220> interval

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
step interval

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.520 
step interval
and<00:02:05.210> then<00:02:05.330> as<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.510> bend<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.050> tension<00:02:06.410> goes

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
and then as you bend the tension goes

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.470 
and then as you bend the tension goes
away<00:02:07.360> you<00:02:08.360> can<00:02:08.479> bring<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:08.720> right<00:02:08.810> back<00:02:08.869> down

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.000 

you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.830
