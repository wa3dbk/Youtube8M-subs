00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
but whatever so let's start this off I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.450 
but whatever so let's start this off I
think<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.780> steel<00:00:40.079> frame<00:00:40.350> high<00:00:40.860> ten<00:00:41.129> steel

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
think it's a steel frame high ten steel

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.630 
think it's a steel frame high ten steel
but<00:00:41.780> whatever<00:00:42.840> okay<00:00:43.260> frame<00:00:43.469> could<00:00:44.129> maybe<00:00:44.460> use

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
but whatever okay frame could maybe use

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.069 
but whatever okay frame could maybe use
a<00:00:44.670> different<00:00:44.940> frame<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> future<00:00:45.960> but

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
a different frame in the future but

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.110 
a different frame in the future but
whatever<00:00:46.649> um<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:49.010> Brown<00:00:50.010> grips<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> be

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
whatever um so Brown grips and to be

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.700 
whatever um so Brown grips and to be
honest<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.539> don't<00:00:51.690> know<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.350> are
