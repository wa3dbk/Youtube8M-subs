00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:04.370 

the<00:00:02.879> next<00:00:03.120> type<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.330> indeterminate<00:00:04.170> form

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
the next type of indeterminate form

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.519 
the next type of indeterminate form
we'll<00:00:04.529> talk<00:00:04.740> about<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.000> form<00:00:06.420> 0<00:00:07.140> times

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
we'll talk about is of the form 0 times

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.530 
we'll talk about is of the form 0 times
positive<00:00:08.189> or<00:00:08.340> negative<00:00:08.700> infinity<00:00:08.940> or

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
positive or negative infinity or

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.959 
positive or negative infinity or
vice-versa<00:00:10.230> positive<00:00:11.130> negative<00:00:11.490> infinity

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
vice-versa positive negative infinity

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.020 
vice-versa positive negative infinity
times<00:00:12.210> 0<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.590> idea<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.670> two

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
times 0 and the idea is you have two

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.380 
times 0 and the idea is you have two
functions<00:00:15.330> f<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.199> X<00:00:16.410> times<00:00:16.770> G<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.160> X<00:00:17.369> what<00:00:18.240> we're

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
functions f of X times G of X what we're

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.730 
functions f of X times G of X what we're
going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.960> we're<00:00:19.140> basically<00:00:19.260> going<00:00:19.680> to

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
going to do is we're basically going to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.390 
going to do is we're basically going to
make<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.160> into<00:00:20.490> an<00:00:21.529> indeterminate<00:00:22.529> fraction

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
make this into an indeterminate fraction

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.630 
make this into an indeterminate fraction
by<00:00:24.090> putting<00:00:25.010> leaving<00:00:26.010> 1<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> numerator

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
by putting leaving 1 in the numerator

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.880 
by putting leaving 1 in the numerator
and<00:00:27.240> putting<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.779> over<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.260> other<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and putting one over the other in the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.490 
and putting one over the other in the
denominator<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.840> doesn't<00:00:31.140> matter<00:00:31.260> which

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
denominator and it doesn't matter which

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.580 
denominator and it doesn't matter which
one<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.890> put<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.669> top<00:00:32.880> or<00:00:33.120> bottom

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
one you put on top or bottom

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.720 
one you put on top or bottom
algebraically<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.710> should<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.160> careful<00:00:35.610> though

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
algebraically I should be careful though

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.420 
algebraically I should be careful though
there's<00:00:36.329> definitely<00:00:36.899> some<00:00:37.170> problems<00:00:37.710> like

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
there's definitely some problems like

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.209 
there's definitely some problems like
the<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:38.879> about<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.480> where<00:00:40.040> you<00:00:41.040> may

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the one I'm about to do where you may

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.700 
the one I'm about to do where you may
take<00:00:41.489> one<00:00:41.879> over<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.079> functions<00:00:43.530> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
take one over one of the functions and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.290 
take one over one of the functions and
put<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> denominator<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.910> find<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
put it in the denominator and find that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
put it in the denominator and find that
you're<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:45.629> getting<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.110> more

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you're actually getting a more

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.250 
you're actually getting a more
complicated<00:00:46.710> expression<00:00:47.600> if<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.809> happens

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
complicated expression if that happens

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.900 
complicated expression if that happens
just<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.070> try<00:00:50.250> putting<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> other

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
just go back and try putting the other

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.110 
just go back and try putting the other
one<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.360> denominator<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:53.879> case

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
one in the denominator so in this case

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.029 
one in the denominator so in this case
I've<00:00:54.360> got<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.600> limit<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.079> X<00:00:55.320> approaches<00:00:55.800> zero

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
I've got the limit as X approaches zero

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.650 
I've got the limit as X approaches zero
from<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> right<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.520> square<00:00:57.000> root<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.210> x<00:00:57.390> times

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
from the right of square root of x times

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.830 
from the right of square root of x times
Ln<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> X<00:00:58.489> notice<00:00:59.489> as<00:00:59.820> X<00:01:00.030> approaches<00:01:00.510> zero<00:01:00.809> from

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
Ln of X notice as X approaches zero from

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.279 
Ln of X notice as X approaches zero from
the<00:01:01.020> right

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the right

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.840 
the right
square<00:01:01.710> root<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.980> X<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.699> be

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
square root of X is just going to be

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.649 
square root of X is just going to be
zero<00:01:04.159> Ln<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.250> X<00:01:05.460> though<00:01:05.670> approaches<00:01:06.330> negative

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
zero Ln of X though approaches negative

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.500 
zero Ln of X though approaches negative
infinity<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.640> indeterminate

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
infinity so I have this indeterminate

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.250 
infinity so I have this indeterminate
form<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.490> I've<00:01:11.490> got<00:01:11.729> two<00:01:12.420> choices<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.049> could

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
form and I've got two choices I could

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.590 
form and I've got two choices I could
either<00:01:13.500> take<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:14.280> over<00:01:14.460> Ln<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.970> X<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.450> put

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
either take one over Ln of X and put

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
either take one over Ln of X and put
that<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> bottom<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.220> when<00:01:17.369> you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that in the bottom but I think when you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
that in the bottom but I think when you
go<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.909> start<00:01:18.090> taking<00:01:18.270> derivatives<00:01:18.990> you're

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
go and start taking derivatives you're

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.749 
go and start taking derivatives you're
going<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.439> find<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.920> actually<00:01:20.310> gives<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
going to find that actually gives you a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.840 
going to find that actually gives you a
slightly<00:01:21.299> more<00:01:21.630> complicated<00:01:22.049> expression<00:01:23.040> so

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
slightly more complicated expression so

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.810 
slightly more complicated expression so
my<00:01:24.659> X<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> one-half<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> move

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
my X to the one-half I'm going to move

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.819 
my X to the one-half I'm going to move
him<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> denominator<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.140> make<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> X<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
him to the denominator and make it X to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.920 
him to the denominator and make it X to
the<00:01:28.950> negative<00:01:29.100> 1/2<00:01:29.729> times<00:01:30.290> Ln<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> X<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.930> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the negative 1/2 times Ln of X and you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.539 
the negative 1/2 times Ln of X and you
can<00:01:34.110> convince<00:01:34.439> yourself<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.189> now<00:01:35.340> going

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
can convince yourself this is now going

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.200 
can convince yourself this is now going
to<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> form<00:01:36.060> infinity<00:01:36.600> over<00:01:37.200> infinity

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
to be of the form infinity over infinity

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.139 
to be of the form infinity over infinity
so<00:01:39.210> I'll<00:01:39.509> use<00:01:39.750> l'hopital's<00:01:40.290> rule<00:01:44.000> well<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so I'll use l'hopital's rule well the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.679 
so I'll use l'hopital's rule well the
derivative<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.689> Ln<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.110> X<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.560> 1<00:01:46.829> over<00:01:46.860> X<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.689> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
derivative of Ln of X is 1 over X in the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.289 
derivative of Ln of X is 1 over X in the
denominator<00:01:48.780> I'll<00:01:49.470> get<00:01:49.619> negative<00:01:49.829> 1/2<00:01:50.490> X<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
denominator I'll get negative 1/2 X to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.209 
denominator I'll get negative 1/2 X to
the<00:01:51.420> negative<00:01:51.710> 3<00:01:52.710> halves<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:54.860> now<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.100> going

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the negative 3 halves and now I'm going

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.469 
the negative 3 halves and now I'm going
to<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.490> some<00:01:56.700> algebra<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.619> clean<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.799> up<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.450> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
to do some algebra to clean this up so I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.920 
to do some algebra to clean this up so I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
left out my negative two I'll just

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.979 
left out my negative two I'll just
squeeze<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.650> back<00:02:29.799> in<00:02:30.010> there<00:02:33.540> when<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.569> put<00:02:34.840> that

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
squeeze in back in there when I put that

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.170 
squeeze in back in there when I put that
back<00:02:35.170> in<00:02:35.410> there<00:02:35.590> I'll<00:02:35.830> have<00:02:36.099> negative<00:02:36.370> two<00:02:36.849> and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
back in there I'll have negative two and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.490 
back in there I'll have negative two and
I'll<00:02:38.110> be<00:02:38.260> left<00:02:38.500> with<00:02:38.760> square<00:02:39.760> root<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.120> X<00:02:40.500> so

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
I'll be left with square root of X so

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.780 
I'll be left with square root of X so
I'll<00:02:41.620> have<00:02:41.739> X<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.160> one<00:02:42.340> half<00:02:42.519> when<00:02:42.760> I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
I'll have X to the one half when I

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.000 
I'll have X to the one half when I
simplify<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.510> part<00:02:43.780> down<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:46.590> now<00:02:47.590> as<00:02:47.860> X

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
simplify that part down and now as X

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.319 
simplify that part down and now as X
approaches<00:02:48.549> zero<00:02:48.819> from<00:02:48.879> the<00:02:49.030> right

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
approaches zero from the right

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.420 
approaches zero from the right
well<00:02:49.930> square<00:02:50.560> root<00:02:50.769> of<00:02:50.890> x<00:02:51.010> is<00:02:51.160> going<00:02:51.370> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
well square root of x is going to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.369 
well square root of x is going to
approach<00:02:51.700> zero<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:52.660> have<00:02:52.840> negative<00:02:53.019> two

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
approach zero so you have negative two

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.720 
approach zero so you have negative two
times<00:02:53.620> zero<00:02:53.769> or<00:02:54.579> zero<00:02:55.329> as<00:02:56.049> your<00:02:56.349> answer<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:57.549> it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
times zero or zero as your answer so it

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.150 
times zero or zero as your answer so it
says<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.329> answer<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.200> original<00:02:59.319> problem

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
says the answer to the original problem

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.729 
says the answer to the original problem
is<00:03:00.310> just<00:03:00.640> going<00:03:00.760> to<00:03:00.819> be<00:03:00.970> simply<00:03:01.420> equal<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.959> zero

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
is just going to be simply equal to zero

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.339 
is just going to be simply equal to zero
and<00:03:03.160> again<00:03:03.879> be<00:03:04.209> careful<00:03:04.420> zero<00:03:05.019> times<00:03:05.230> negative

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
and again be careful zero times negative

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.440 
and again be careful zero times negative
infinity<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.370> can't<00:03:06.609> conclude<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.299> it

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
equals zero all it says is one things

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.089 
equals zero all it says is one things

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
getting small one things getting big

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.819 
getting small one things getting big
well<00:03:12.880> in<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.630> case<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.230> small<00:03:14.560> things

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
well in this case the small things

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.370 
well in this case the small things
getting<00:03:15.310> small<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.940> guess<00:03:16.480> faster<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.230> can

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
getting small I guess faster you can

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.339 
getting small I guess faster you can
think<00:03:17.530> about<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.829> that<00:03:17.980> way<00:03:18.930> let's<00:03:19.930> do<00:03:20.139> one

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
think about it that way let's do one

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.099 
think about it that way let's do one
more<00:03:20.380> of<00:03:20.889> these<00:03:21.370> indeterminate<00:03:21.870> products<00:03:22.870> is

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
more of these indeterminate products is

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.409 
more of these indeterminate products is
what<00:03:23.500> they're<00:03:23.620> known<00:03:23.799> as<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:27.760> let's<00:03:28.030> look<00:03:28.209> at

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
what they're known as so let's look at

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.180 
what they're known as so let's look at
the<00:03:28.569> limit<00:03:28.959> as<00:03:28.989> X<00:03:29.769> approaches<00:03:30.459> zero<00:03:31.090> of

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
the limit as X approaches zero of

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:44.059 
the limit as X approaches zero of
cotangent<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:36.090> 2x<00:03:37.799> divided<00:03:38.799> by<00:03:39.389> sine<00:03:40.389> of<00:03:42.419> 6x

you'll<00:03:57.160> get<00:03:57.280> cotangent<00:03:57.880> of<00:03:58.239> zero<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:58.930> if<00:03:59.739> you

you'll get cotangent of zero and if you

you'll get cotangent of zero and if you

actually goes to infinity sine of zero
is<00:04:04.870> zero<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.799> again<00:04:06.099> we're<00:04:06.280> getting<00:04:06.489> this

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
is zero so again we're getting this

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.909 
is zero so again we're getting this

indeterminate form infinity times zero

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.710 
indeterminate form infinity times zero
again<00:04:11.919> I<00:04:11.950> have<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.310> put<00:04:12.549> one<00:04:12.579> of<00:04:12.819> these<00:04:13.120> in<00:04:13.569> the

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
again I have to put one of these in the

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.719 
again I have to put one of these in the
denominator<00:04:14.349> I'm<00:04:15.040> going<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.400> put<00:04:15.609> the

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:20.800

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810

over<00:04:23.939> cotangent<00:04:24.180> but<00:04:25.110> one<00:04:25.319> over<00:04:25.560> cotangent<00:04:25.770> is

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
over cotangent but one over cotangent is

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.559 
over cotangent but one over cotangent is
the<00:04:26.550> same<00:04:26.759> thing<00:04:26.969> as<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:27.539> tangent<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:28.319> 2x

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
the same thing as just tangent of 2x

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.740 
the same thing as just tangent of 2x
sine<00:04:30.569> of<00:04:30.710> 6x<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.400> again<00:04:32.759> notice<00:04:32.969> I<00:04:33.180> basically

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
sine of 6x and again notice I basically

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.450 
sine of 6x and again notice I basically
turned<00:04:33.990> this<00:04:34.110> back<00:04:34.319> into<00:04:34.560> an<00:04:34.830> indeterminate

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
turned this back into an indeterminate

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.830 
turned this back into an indeterminate
quotient<00:04:35.669> this<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.120> now<00:04:36.240> going<00:04:36.479> to<00:04:36.539> be<00:04:36.629> of<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
quotient this is now going to be of the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.339 
quotient this is now going to be of the
form<00:04:37.080> zero<00:04:37.650> over<00:04:38.099> zero<00:04:38.960> you<00:04:39.960> don't<00:04:40.139> have<00:04:40.229> to

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
form zero over zero you don't have to

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.260 
form zero over zero you don't have to
check<00:04:40.560> that<00:04:40.740> it's<00:04:41.550> always<00:04:41.699> going<00:04:41.969> to<00:04:42.060> turn

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
check that it's always going to turn

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.179 
check that it's always going to turn
into<00:04:42.449> an<00:04:42.659> indeterminate<00:04:43.319> form<00:04:43.349> but<00:04:43.919> just

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
into an indeterminate form but just

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.270 
into an indeterminate form but just
pointing<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.610> out<00:04:45.740> so<00:04:46.740> now<00:04:46.860> I've<00:04:46.979> got<00:04:47.129> the

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
pointing it out so now I've got the

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.059 
pointing it out so now I've got the
limit<00:04:47.430> as<00:04:47.699> X<00:04:48.030> approaches<00:04:48.539> zero<00:04:49.069> the

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
limit as X approaches zero the

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.070 
limit as X approaches zero the
derivative<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.639> sine<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:51.300> going<00:04:51.599> to<00:04:51.659> be<00:04:51.780> cosine

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
derivative of sine is going to be cosine

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.930 
derivative of sine is going to be cosine
of<00:04:52.789> 6x<00:04:53.930> times<00:04:54.930> six<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:56.370> derivative<00:04:56.849> of

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
of 6x times six the derivative of

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.300 
of 6x times six the derivative of
tangent<00:04:57.210> is<00:04:57.690> secant<00:04:58.379> squared<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:59.509> 2x<00:05:01.310> times

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
tangent is secant squared of 2x times

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.770 
tangent is secant squared of 2x times
two<00:05:02.699> and<00:05:04.069> as<00:05:05.069> X<00:05:05.310> approaches<00:05:05.909> zero<00:05:06.419> you're

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
two and as X approaches zero you're

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.010 
two and as X approaches zero you're
going<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:06.960> get<00:05:07.110> cosine<00:05:07.590> of<00:05:07.620> zero<00:05:08.389> well<00:05:09.389> cosine

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
going to get cosine of zero well cosine

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.649 
going to get cosine of zero well cosine
of<00:05:10.050> zero<00:05:10.440> is<00:05:10.500> one<00:05:10.909> so<00:05:11.909> you'll<00:05:12.029> get<00:05:12.150> one<00:05:12.389> times

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
of zero is one so you'll get one times

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:13.360 
of zero is one so you'll get one times
six

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
six

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.749 
six
you'll<00:05:14.370> get<00:05:14.550> secant<00:05:15.029> squared<00:05:15.419> of<00:05:15.569> zero<00:05:15.900> so

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
you'll get secant squared of zero so

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.369 
you'll get secant squared of zero so
secant<00:05:17.759> of<00:05:17.879> zero<00:05:17.939> that's<00:05:18.479> one<00:05:18.659> over<00:05:18.689> cosine<00:05:19.349> of

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:19.379 
secant of zero that's one over cosine of

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.339 
secant of zero that's one over cosine of
zero<00:05:19.800> cosine<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.550> zero<00:05:20.939> is<00:05:21.000> one<00:05:21.090> so<00:05:21.960> secant

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
zero cosine of zero is one so secant

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.379 
zero cosine of zero is one so secant
squared<00:05:22.889> of<00:05:23.069> zero<00:05:23.370> is<00:05:23.550> also<00:05:23.699> going<00:05:23.909> to<00:05:23.969> be<00:05:24.060> one

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
squared of zero is also going to be one

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.790 
squared of zero is also going to be one
so<00:05:25.319> we're<00:05:25.469> simply<00:05:25.650> left<00:05:25.979> with<00:05:26.190> 1<00:05:26.460> times<00:05:26.669> two<00:05:27.029> or

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
so we're simply left with 1 times two or

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.200 
so we're simply left with 1 times two or
three<00:05:28.800> as<00:05:29.009> our<00:05:29.190> solution<00:05:29.699> in<00:05:29.819> this<00:05:29.940> problem

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
three as our solution in this problem

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.200 
three as our solution in this problem
and<00:05:31.190> this<00:05:32.190> again<00:05:32.400> is<00:05:32.490> going<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.639> be<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:32.879> basic

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
and this again is going to be the basic

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.119 
and this again is going to be the basic
idea<00:05:33.509> in<00:05:33.599> all<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:33.960> l'hopital's<00:05:34.409> rule<00:05:34.440> cases

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:35.129 
idea in all the l'hopital's rule cases

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:36.559 
idea in all the l'hopital's rule cases
you're<00:05:35.279> going<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.460> try<00:05:35.669> to<00:05:35.699> usually<00:05:36.300> just

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.569 
you're going to try to usually just

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.619 
you're going to try to usually just
pretty<00:05:36.750> much<00:05:36.930> turn<00:05:37.199> them<00:05:37.409> back<00:05:37.589> into<00:05:37.620> an

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:38.629 
pretty much turn them back into an

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:43.339 
pretty much turn them back into an
indeterminate<00:05:40.430> quotient<00:05:41.430> if<00:05:41.729> you<00:05:41.819> can<00:05:42.029> and<00:05:42.360> go

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
indeterminate quotient if you can and go

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.680 
indeterminate quotient if you can and go
from<00:05:43.500> there
