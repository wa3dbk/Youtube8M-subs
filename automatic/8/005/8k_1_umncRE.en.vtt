00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.980
 This video I would like to small battery 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.990
 customer lithium ions and everyone 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.360
 call reasons 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.450
 for flashlights because time after time 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.430
 Maybe you can come there 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.640
 Couple ask if you have the video yourself 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:27.060
 look at it clarify 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:31.740
 short and most recent chargers 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:39.710
 Of course, every extra vp 1 certainly 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:44.430
 the latest and most modern with display 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:49.140
 from the wall number and a downright 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.649
 it was universally guaranteed 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.840
 the layers in the two touch with two 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.430
 wally 4 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.430
 but have now all tell me so much 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.859
 I still have two lamps one for approx 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.600
 123 battery or battery and one for 18 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.110
 650 or 2 21 23 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:12.630
 so we start from the left here 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:16.830
 i triple aaa batteries and battery 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:23.850
 Battery Battery 1.5 volt battery nickel 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.750
 Metal hydride has 12 volt, there is also 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.290
 one of them is called 10 440 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.479
 acquisition 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.689
 but then has 37 volts nominal 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.780
 loaded 42 want to have basically 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.150
 all batteries when they are loaded here 42 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:51.439
 the chargers want to load the with 42 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.439
 Here we have an AAA battery 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.280
 Paying a lukaku knows a bit 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.090
 weaker 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:09.270
 and also this same size as aa the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:13.009
 with 16 14 500 richard schickel lithium 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.009
 ion battery with built-in 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.450
 So that's a little chip here 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.580
 is set off thereby the cell 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.590
 always a piece longer than 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.260
 Protected cells are what tomorrow 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.510
 Now here I believe very well 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.760
 behind they are flush so 1 2 mm 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.550
 longer than unprotected count 14 500 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.170
 Incidentally, this means 14 mm diameter and 50 mm 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.880
 mm long 50 meters long 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.540
 where then the protected, however 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.280
 already 41 52 mm 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.530
 Here we have to mention that he 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.739
 I know if I do not recognize it 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:59.200
 the conversion even if it says it 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:06.520
 3 volts of the 123 then it's the ten 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.650
 million batteries and if good chart 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.220
 shovel on the 3.7 well on it stands 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.220
 then there are batteries here we have 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.920
 this is a very bad example 16 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.870
 340 are 37 mm long 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.700
 here the trust celebration is so almost 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.650
 no lamp to use there is 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.570
 since all push it broke because the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.260
 mounting frame simply everything is faster 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.390
 what I say 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.640
 without hesitation I'll say something wrong 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.410
 is in between but always at ten 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.670
 years of experience with batteries and 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.100
 Chargers so here sometimes 16 340 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.709
 not so even if they are unprotected in 17 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.700
 33 5 then they are actually 17 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:51.700
 diameter and 33 mm in diameter 5 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:56.200
 but the general name is 16,340 that is 16 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.620
 mm diameter and 34 mm long there's 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.829
 Of course, as unprotected 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:07.480
 here we have even a battery-em r 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:11.049
 although it's size 18 650 he only has 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.049
 1500 milliamps that's because of this 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.100
 em he batteries can be much more power in 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.330
 deliver the time 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:24.160
 I say again 5 amps or something 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:26.450
 and it has to be the way you can 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.200
 that they do not have that much 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.740
 capacity of the effect of a lamp 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.110
 There would be some freaks saying that 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.740
 then yes there is the lamp cellar because the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.420
 then instead of 25 volt with three 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.400
 ampere be operated with three amps 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.340
 Of course, the cellar is also possible 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.910
 i think of that a lot because so much 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.480
 that does not matter that is also one 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:56.030
 the panasonic cell 3100 by the way the the 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.590
 green ones in unprotected one sees 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.130
 again in size as none 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.320
 protection is here again in protection 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.320
 what you can see here the paragraph 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:14.830
 so here you have to be careful too if the 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:18.080
 no elevated pluspol have in some 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.640
 lamps is not the required one 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.270
 elevated pluspol that really in 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.430
 fits the opposite pole 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.650
 this again there are different 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.910
 capacities 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.250
 but is always in question yes which is 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.200
 a better one which i recommend you 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.770
 recommend that for your application on 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.560
 best here is the cost I say 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:44.630
 around the twelve euros of the cost the 21 euros 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.870
 currently it's worth the 3400 too 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.160
 buy yes it is worth it if you 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.540
 traveling for hours because at night 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.760
 security service or something and want 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.540
 they are constantly taking their batteries away 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.720
 this one here 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.710
 the 3400 at least 50 percent more 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.640
 capacity but our solar funds 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.110
 standard battery also in most 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:10.040
 falls is when we load picture 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.050
 to offer is a super battery of 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.680
 the very high has really proved itself 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.060
 streams ivanka near the shelter turns off 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.310
 I can only recommend you 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.580
 if you have a lot of capacity 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.650
 They do not want to change that often 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.060
 When you have it off the lamps in the car 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.770
 who lie and use only occasionally 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:33.300
 then of course the 3400 ag is enough 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:38.280
 and here we have another 26 650 that 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:42.539
 This means 26 diameters and 26 6 50 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:44.520
 and 65 0 millimeter long as these are times 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:48.449
 so the most common batteries there are 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:52.490
 Of course there are still others 18 3 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:54.870
 50 are 36 mm long and have 18 diameters 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:58.259
 unprotected fits some lamps 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:03.509
 rhine still her little hint this 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:06.210
 night chorus batteries in 26 and 31 of the or 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:08.490
 Batteries are relatively long on some 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.380
 There are now problems with lamps 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.419
 But the lamp manufacturers have changed 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:16.349
 adapted that the batteries longer and longer 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:19.550
 were because the more power goes to pull 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:24.419
 let the thicker and the needs of 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.699
 will protect the job you have to 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:31.199
 build land 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:35.580
 I would like to say with the participants 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:38.219
 26 I recommend the envy coruxo because I 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.630
 I already noticed that here 

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:41.159
 maybe a little too short 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.659
 not enough voltage in the lamp 

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:47.009
 trade a bit rattled so 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:51.120
 Maybe if you take the envious chorus 

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:52.940
 yes that was our customer 

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.719
 absolutely an important sarah 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:59.729
 The lithium ion batteries lose so well 

00:07:57.719 --> 00:08:03.270
 how no tension we have ten years 

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:05.909
 experience and that is such a battery 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:09.240
 I put down now for a long time with 4.2 volts 

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:11.639
 I had in two three years 

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.139
 still 418 probably who loses as well as 

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:15.139
 no tension that is so
