half feet so what you do want to Palmer

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.779 
half feet so what you do want to Palmer
it's<00:01:16.619> human<00:01:17.810> there<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.899> go<00:01:19.020> three<00:01:19.289> eye<00:01:19.789> that's

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
it's human there you go three eye that's

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.240 
it's human there you go three eye that's
tagging<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:22.470> then<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.679> want<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> work<00:01:23.070> it

back through the eye again so you got a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.830 
back through the eye again so you got a
loop<00:01:26.069> coming<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.660> like<00:01:27.660> at<00:01:27.929> all<00:01:28.429> right<00:01:29.429> and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
loop coming out like at all right and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.460 
loop coming out like at all right and
then<00:01:30.840> you're<00:01:31.020> gonna<00:01:31.140> tie<00:01:31.440> an<00:01:31.740> overhand<00:01:32.039> an

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
then you're gonna tie an overhand an

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.370 
then you're gonna tie an overhand an
overhand<00:01:34.470> knot<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:36.479> you're<00:01:36.630> spinning<00:01:36.929> it<00:01:37.170> this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
overhand knot so you're spinning it this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.910 
overhand knot so you're spinning it this
way<00:01:37.940> it's<00:01:38.940> coming<00:01:39.330> over<00:01:39.560> clip<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.679> with<00:01:40.800> this

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
way it's coming over clip it with this

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.690 
way it's coming over clip it with this
hand<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.599> got<00:01:42.599> this<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.830> loop<00:01:44.160> here<00:01:44.369> goes

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
hand you got this this loop here goes

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.830 
hand you got this this loop here goes
back<00:01:45.690> through<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.110> bean<00:01:46.349> hole<00:01:46.649> main<00:01:47.190> loop

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
back through the bean hole main loop

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.839 
back through the bean hole main loop
okay<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.259> push<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.039> down<00:01:50.069> a<00:01:50.220> little<00:01:50.429> bit

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
okay just push it down a little bit

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.820 
okay just push it down a little bit
now<00:01:51.330> you're<00:01:51.479> gonna<00:01:51.599> Brona<00:01:52.020> bring<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.649> hook

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
now you're gonna Brona bring your hook

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.309 
now you're gonna Brona bring your hook
through<00:01:53.390> see<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.569> we're<00:01:54.690> taking<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.080> big

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
through see that we're taking this big

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.809 
through see that we're taking this big
loop<00:01:55.849> bring<00:01:56.849> hook<00:01:57.209> through<00:01:57.599> and<00:01:58.550> push<00:01:59.550> it<00:01:59.729> it

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
loop bring hook through and push it it

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.830 
loop bring hook through and push it it
up<00:02:00.229> now<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.500> very<00:02:01.770> important<00:02:02.550> that<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.390> grab

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
up now it's very important that you grab

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.130 
up now it's very important that you grab
this<00:02:04.140> loop<00:02:04.500> up<00:02:05.369> top<00:02:06.050> grab<00:02:07.050> it<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.349> here<00:02:08.000> alright

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
this loop up top grab it up here alright

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.410 
this loop up top grab it up here alright
and<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.379> you're<00:02:10.560> gonna<00:02:10.709> start<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.190> push<00:02:11.489> pull

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and now you're gonna start to push pull

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.290 
and now you're gonna start to push pull
everything<00:02:12.840> down<00:02:16.700> now<00:02:17.700> here's<00:02:17.970> where<00:02:18.150> it's

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
everything down now here's where it's

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.240
