have a few different systems the ps3
version<00:02:21.720> should<00:02:21.989> be<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.290> lowest<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.860> your

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.630 
version should be the lowest on your
proverbial<00:02:23.580> totem<00:02:24.299> pole<00:02:24.709> but<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.950> said<00:02:26.310> it's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
proverbial totem pole but that said it's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.330 
proverbial totem pole but that said it's
still<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:27.060> solid<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:28.019> very<00:02:28.530> entertaining<00:02:29.160> game

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
still a solid and very entertaining game

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.570

through the levels or anything but

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.980 
through the levels or anything but
rather<00:05:26.310> it's<00:05:26.699> more<00:05:27.000> about<00:05:27.210> your<00:05:27.419> style<00:05:27.810> of

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
rather it's more about your style of

play now that may sound like a thin
difference<00:05:30.780> but<00:05:31.110> it<00:05:31.229> does<00:05:31.410> tailor<00:05:31.889> the<00:05:32.070> game

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
difference but it does tailor the game

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.460 
difference but it does tailor the game
to<00:05:32.460> your<00:05:32.580> specific<00:05:33.120> style<00:05:33.479> and<00:05:33.750> it<00:05:34.110> affords

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
to your specific style and it affords

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.469 
to your specific style and it affords
much<00:05:34.680> more<00:05:34.919> replay<00:05:35.400> value<00:05:35.580> than<00:05:35.970> bound<00:05:36.240> in

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479
