00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
hinge but they do have rotation so you

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:37.550

there is weapons storage for all four of
these<00:03:15.540> which<00:03:15.690> you'll<00:03:15.840> see<00:03:15.989> in<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.170> second<00:03:16.500> I

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
these which you'll see in a second I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.660 
these which you'll see in a second I
mean<00:03:16.650> even<00:03:16.830> though<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:16.920> think<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.280> head<00:03:17.430> scope

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.190 
mean even though I think the head scope
is<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.820> little<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.180> large<00:03:18.420> side<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.810> think

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
is a little on the large side I think

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.560 
is a little on the large side I think
this<00:03:19.320> is<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> great<00:03:19.980> head<00:03:20.250> sculpt<00:03:20.670> regardless

did<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:42.000> really<00:04:42.150> good<00:04:42.360> job<00:04:42.419> with<00:04:42.660> these<00:04:42.780> boots

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
did a really good job with these boots

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.750 
did a really good job with these boots
and<00:04:43.380> they<00:04:43.470> do<00:04:43.530> have<00:04:43.890> peg<00:04:44.100> holes<00:04:44.280> at<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.490> bottom

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
and they do have peg holes at the bottom

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.890 
and they do have peg holes at the bottom
of<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:44.940> feet<00:04:45.120> like<00:04:45.330> how<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.479> head<00:04:45.659> can<00:04:45.870> move

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900

spider-man<00:05:44.400> I<00:05:44.490> think<00:05:44.729> this<00:05:44.849> is<00:05:44.969> a<00:05:45.090> very<00:05:45.330> cool

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
spider-man I think this is a very cool

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.420 
spider-man I think this is a very cool
figure<00:05:45.990> yeah<00:05:46.229> I<00:05:46.259> have<00:05:46.469> my<00:05:46.650> gripes<00:05:46.979> about<00:05:47.250> some

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
figure yeah I have my gripes about some

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.040 
figure yeah I have my gripes about some
of<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.580> proportions<00:05:47.909> and<00:05:48.389> when<00:05:48.629> he<00:05:48.719> holds<00:05:48.960> the

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
of the proportions and when he holds the

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.019 
of the proportions and when he holds the
shotgun<00:05:49.560> it's<00:05:49.710> a<00:05:49.830> little<00:05:50.250> weird<00:05:50.460> but<00:05:50.639> not<00:05:50.849> too

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
shotgun it's a little weird but not too

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:52.700 
shotgun it's a little weird but not too
bad<00:05:51.270> I<00:05:51.330> mean<00:05:51.629> I<00:05:51.659> think<00:05:51.810> it's<00:05:52.020> just<00:05:52.080> really<00:05:52.409> cool

that<00:05:52.830> it<00:05:52.919> comes<00:05:53.069> with<00:05:53.159> the<00:05:53.310> ton<00:05:53.460> of<00:05:53.490> weapons

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:53.879 
that it comes with the ton of weapons

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.640 
that it comes with the ton of weapons
and<00:05:54.180> I<00:05:54.300> really<00:05:54.569> like<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:54.900> base<00:05:55.139> too<00:05:55.500> so
