00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.020
 and so it is today, July 30 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.220
 today we slept 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.540
 first cleaning tobacco here is a whole leaf 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:32.380
 somewhere 50 70 kilograms I will now 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.650
 string air temperature 35 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.640
 degrees so the process of collecting the sheet 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.700
 I did not shoot it, I think it is enough 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.739
 just and so a few words from taxes on 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.420
 her zone 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.690
 I use such homemade ones 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.450
 needles for on them about 35 centimeters 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.860
 ordinary steel wire deuce with 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.320
 one side for exactly the other time 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.300
 wake up 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.060
 made not a hole for which hole I 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.220
 I think everyone understands once we pass into it 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.390
 thread on which we will hang 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.770
 further string here you see 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.420
 actually pull the thread 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.759
 helped this most convenient and fast 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.580
 available for all saved cloning 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.119
 sheet 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.000
 all the words yes for 15 20 minutes can be 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.190
 for half an hour Russian yes and so then bacman 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.060
 they zone a little bit not on 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.840
 calculations instead of 15 20 minutes but they call 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.240
 zara hour instead of 70 kilograms received 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.410
 somewhere around 200 how it doesn't seem 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.429
 weird one who is very hard to see 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.429
 here u on green yellow 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.180
 I would like to immediately answer a few 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:04.360
 questions that create from year to year 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:07.940
 a dozen times a week as he lay down there 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.610
 after picking me there is no way I am there 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.730
 gathered strung on a thread kapron 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.870
 hung up 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.950
 under the canopy so it will climb to hang from 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.820
 weeks to two 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.880
 during this time he will turn yellow and 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:30.010
 then we will send there in the attic 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.010
 it is very hot and to him she is 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.280
 second moment many leaves say there 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:44.360
 After all , you need to spend time with a brush 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:48.580
 wipe with a cloth wash I rinse 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.220
 I think that this is nonsense why I think so 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.470
 by this 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.060
 lesson you can do say so 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.650
 only if you do not have other occupations and 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.920
 coming out you have nothing else to do and for 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.880
 the second option and you 15-20 bushes here 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.580
 if I have about 200 kilos cleaning today 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.430
 I don't call a leaf for half an hour 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:17.590
 imagine how much it would take them 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.020
 clean two days probably that is it 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.900
 option for those who have ten leaves 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.680
 blew cleaned hang on what else 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.660
 wanted to say a lot of very questions now 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.520
 for such a state to dry sheet 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.990
 dry until the beetles become 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.470
 fragile in the thickest place 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.360
 bend if it means breaking 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.120
 tobacco is ready and continue to clean on 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.490
 saving in what way already on the site 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.920
 told many times now that today 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:55.680
 harvesting day is coming to an end 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:04:01.750
 tired let's go show you now 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:08.730
 Looks like the plan qashqai ran already lower 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.730
 tier removed by the way I will note such a thing 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:21.650
 need about the testes lower tier too 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:25.590
 cut off read so much so let's say 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.700
 literate and or even rarity that is 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.970
 old literature 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.970
 that did so a hundred years ago 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.250
 telling why it is done now not 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:42.180
 I 'll write later but there is 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:47.570
 sense i'm doing the second year already and 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:52.080
 I want to show you something now 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:55.910
 the testes are leaving so you are very early 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:59.880
 covered with flower stalks 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:09.090
 take the situation away from me like 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:12.690
 spring with contrast a little bit here in 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:17.180
 Generally tightened as a circle on it is not good 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:21.120
 need to open a dressing or here's another 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:24.300
 option to see it so much growth 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:30.200
 broke through the principle is okay too 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:34.550
 need to cut that is covered you 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:38.460
 flower stalks come in a week 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.410
 bandage it will fall plant only 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.750
 for good 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.430
 otherwise, if not bandage and you can 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:50.130
 until the end you develop it will turn out 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:53.610
 bad seeds well for today all all 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:58.010
 thank you for your attention subscribe to 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.010
