00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 and as a player I admired her a lot 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.790
 before knowing that because they played 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.370
 independent I followed them and someone in 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.690
 Spain and we will see details because 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.130
 We have received many mails asking us 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.570
 they wanted to see gustavo lopez like 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.370
 player these images we have seen 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.179
 call times is the famous lost against 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.650
 hurricane 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.050
 recently we saw that we put together several 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.550
 players from among them to the graphic no 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.279
 break but let's see especially in the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.289
 zaragoza in the Celtic let's say in your support 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.750
 Spanish football also independent 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.970
 a good soccer school that 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.650
 traditionally it takes out players very 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.510
 skilled who carry the ball tied and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.910
 you say grandpa, it's been pretty 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.910
 but this is a ball to cañizares 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:47.430
 as a lefty was fabulous in the video that 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.170
 has dribble speed power in the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.589
 shot and above all is very well the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.329
 soccer very clever games and solutions 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:59.129
 where he puts the ball open one 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.049
 left could also play a single 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.180
 forward do not you think that currently with 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:04.589
 the modern football that there is now could 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.450
 play a lot on the right leg 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.630
 shirts and surely if you could to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.630
 that 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.990
 and now I think it would have marked 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.579
 many more goals to one 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.600
 well I was playing a game in addition to 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.990
 that intentional sentence by the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.149
 Argentina too 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.840
 Calderón with the Zaragoza in the Romareda 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.030
 the romareda forgiveness if you mill an athletic 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.229
 Olympic champion in Atlanta reminds them 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.850
 be independent when he started others 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.390
 titles with independent remember evil 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.789

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.750

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.959
 of this guy who knows how to watch football and 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.280

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.810

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.030

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.740
 technical agreement now for good good 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.090
 moment to remember the good game of 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.039

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.030
 matches in victory signal 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.020

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.000

 It must be said that gustavo hooked a 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.789
 bright Celtic stage I remember 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:09.399

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.940
 intention and also was in the world 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.280

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.910
 like it would be a play for a fast 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.760
 grace of being and there is one that has changed 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.440
 sideways and taking the left to 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.030
 move towards him in goal 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.540

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.870
 variable stage graphics but one 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.420
 life with that goal to bolivia plus what 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.849
 I will remember with the right 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.290

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.290
 group 6 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.610

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.610
 he said that with the right 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.530
