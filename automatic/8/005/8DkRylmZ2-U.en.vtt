00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 work at this time outdoors where who 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.440
 does that already like 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.750
 but in many activities leads no 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.450
 off past here on the apron 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.610
 Frankfurt Airport shows today 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.650
 the thermometer only minus six degrees 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.690
 because there is hardly any wind protection here 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.670
 but there are enough free 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.519
 It can also feel like it is here 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.900
 minus 30 degrees reach which tactic 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.900
 helps here not to freeze 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.550
 because Peter Kroll is mixed is one 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.800
 out of a total of 90 tractor drivers 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.079
 fraport and they are out in the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.629
 but have it still cuddly 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.969
 warm with service beginning but he also has to 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.539
 out in the cold first time the vehicle 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.110
 check 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.030
 his today bolide an asc 1x of 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.940
 goldhofer 1360 hp two motor rods 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.230
 he can even take the airbus a380 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.210
 press and drag 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.250
 because you could be jealous 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.430
 Not only would he be 30 kilometers per hour 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.979
 driving is everything goes well 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.119
 Get started on the first order 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.090
 the tractor drivers from the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.310
 Control center here at the control table one 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.220
 Joachim is sitting with his 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.189
 three colleagues turn around each month 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.159
 Awarded 15,000 orders to the driver 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.229
 yes the control system test four have 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.090
 here to control our plane 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.579
 haul here at the airport and then 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.119
 you can see on the left side the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.860
 Vehicles available to me 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.560
 in the second column, position where 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 they are and in the third 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.829
 split the status of what you are doing 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.280
 or 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.500
 so it must're up here I 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.930
 three pieces are free because I have two 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.340
 Tugs that are active 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.500
 Incoming orders receive the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 booker from the airlines, the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.060
 Tractor drivers look up to their tasks 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.460
 the display in the cab of the tractor 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.829
 itself is used for two operations 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.200
 on the one hand to a plane of the 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.690
 to press park position called push 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.819
 back that happens just before the start 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.069
 because a reverse gear has no 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.499
 plane 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.810
 on the other a flier of one 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:18.950
 position on another or in the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.280
 shipyard to tow 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.769
 peter grollmisch current order the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.430
 vietnam airlines on position d1 too 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.530
 tow 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.109
 currently she is on the surfaces in 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.639
 south of the airport after the chronic 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.959
 all safety precautions taken 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:37.280
 he drives slowly up to the bugrad 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.859
 hydraulically this is raised 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.019
 so he can do that around 300 tons 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.150
 Simply push and steer the plane 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.189
 once the plane on the dismantling line 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.109
 the radio is the driver to the ramps 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.900
 control that he is ready 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.239
 I will then my instructions 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.260
 then tell me to drive now 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.870
 november you have to lima the must 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.889
 I then repeat from the wording and 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.629
 that will be with those on tape 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.189
 is recorded at later him 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.900
 safety if somehow something went wrong 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.519
 gone or so close that time 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.949
 kabul is now the reconstruct 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.780
 error happens flawlessly nobody is 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:13.459
 but in Peter cross longer 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.129
 Tug driver time is not him yet 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.229
 Malheur happens what you to tug 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.780
 Above all, driving requires a truck 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.549
 and tarmac driving license as well as skill 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.870
 I 've been there with little ones 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.459
 I have that toy cars 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.090
 taught very small and as I said 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.409
 I started the trucks backwards 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.849
 to push now I have the feeling 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.280
 I get a little bit clean 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.319
 I saw how the trailer reacts 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.379
 has and then that somehow then 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.419
 transferred as I then chose stop 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.669
 was tug for the plane job 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.939
 then we actually go loose from the 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:48.189
 hand 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.189
 the last order for today is due 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.400
 a push back here is similar 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.739
 as when hauling once the release 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.810
 peter 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.269
 grudgingly the fully occupied Lufthansa 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.949
 press machine backwards after that is 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.290
 shift to the next 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.290
 Start of service outside in the warm
