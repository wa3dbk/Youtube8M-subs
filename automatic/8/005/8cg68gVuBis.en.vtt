well<00:00:01.740> John<00:00:01.950> if<00:00:02.040> it<00:00:02.130> was<00:00:02.219> a<00:00:02.250> lively<00:00:02.880> second<00:00:03.389> off

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
well John if it was a lively second off

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.150 
well John if it was a lively second off
particularly<00:00:03.959> but<00:00:04.200> there<00:00:04.380> was<00:00:04.649> a<00:00:04.680> draw<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> fair

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
particularly but there was a draw a fair

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.309 
particularly but there was a draw a fair
result<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:05.670> think<00:00:06.299> so<00:00:06.660> yeah<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:06.870> think<00:00:06.960> if<00:00:07.230> you

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
result I think so yeah I think if you

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.690 
result I think so yeah I think if you
look<00:00:07.470> at<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.649> balance<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:08.100> it<00:00:08.250> they've<00:00:08.520> had<00:00:08.670> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
look at the balance of it they've had a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.629 
look at the balance of it they've had a
few<00:00:08.760> chances<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:10.129> prob<00:00:11.129> breakaways

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
few chances and prob breakaways

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.070 
few chances and prob breakaways
obviously<00:00:12.090> from<00:00:12.209> our<00:00:12.330> corners<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.869> things

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
obviously from our corners and things

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.629 
obviously from our corners and things
but<00:00:13.230> then<00:00:13.650> again<00:00:13.860> we've<00:00:14.129> had<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.279> couple<00:00:14.459> of

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
but then again we've had a couple of

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.010 
but then again we've had a couple of
good<00:00:14.789> chances<00:00:14.820> we've<00:00:15.360> had<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.660> cleared<00:00:15.900> off

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
good chances we've had one cleared off

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.600 
good chances we've had one cleared off
the<00:00:16.049> line<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.500> gold<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.800> made<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.010> great<00:00:17.400> save

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
the line the gold is made a great save

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.340 
the line the gold is made a great save
at<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.820> end<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.150> looking<00:00:18.990> back<00:00:19.020> on<00:00:19.140> it

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
at the end so looking back on it

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.890 
at the end so looking back on it
probably<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> point<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.130> fair<00:00:20.940> result<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.720> were

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
probably a point is fair result you were

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.630 
probably a point is fair result you were
a<00:00:21.930> gold<00:00:22.560> down<00:00:22.770> at<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.070> break<00:00:23.250> did<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.460> feel<00:00:23.610> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
a gold down at the break did you feel a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.550 
a gold down at the break did you feel a
bit<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.910> grief<00:00:24.090> by<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.510> because<00:00:24.630> apart<00:00:25.470> from

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
bit of grief by that because apart from

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.470 
bit of grief by that because apart from
the<00:00:26.039> opening<00:00:26.430> go<00:00:26.610> he<00:00:26.730> seemed<00:00:27.000> fairly<00:00:27.300> in

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the opening go he seemed fairly in

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.230 
the opening go he seemed fairly in
control<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> most<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.440> other<00:00:28.590> and

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
control for the most of the other and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.689 
control for the most of the other and
yeah<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.539> didn't<00:00:30.720> start<00:00:30.900> very<00:00:31.140> well<00:00:31.350> and

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
yeah but we didn't start very well and

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.860 
yeah but we didn't start very well and
it<00:00:32.699> took<00:00:32.879> us<00:00:33.000> 10<00:00:33.180> minutes<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> get<00:00:33.570> into<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
it took us 10 minutes to get into the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
it took us 10 minutes to get into the
game<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.260> Blackburn<00:00:35.190> took<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> opportunity

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
game and Blackburn took the opportunity

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
game and Blackburn took the opportunity
well<00:00:36.180> from<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> corner<00:00:36.810> and<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.020> they<00:00:37.470> set

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
well from the corner and then they set

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.040 
well from the corner and then they set
themselves<00:00:37.829> up<00:00:38.130> to<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.370> hard<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.060> we

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
themselves up to be hard to be and we

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.540 
themselves up to be hard to be and we
had<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> word<00:00:40.380> about<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.800> at<00:00:40.920> halftime<00:00:41.070> about

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
had a word about that at halftime about

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
had a word about that at halftime about
we<00:00:41.670> needed<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> tempo<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.870> little<00:00:42.960> bit

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
we needed to up the tempo a little bit

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.380 
we needed to up the tempo a little bit
and<00:00:43.380> we<00:00:44.280> managed<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> early<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.270> in

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and we managed to do that early on in

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.850 
and we managed to do that early on in
the<00:00:45.450> second<00:00:45.750> half<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.260> obviously<00:00:46.590> got<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the second half and obviously got the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.220 
the second half and obviously got the
goal<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.309> which<00:00:48.300> was<00:00:48.420> cleaned<00:00:48.660> pleasing<00:00:49.200> for

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
goal and which was cleaned pleasing for

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.500 
goal and which was cleaned pleasing for
myself<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.520> manages<00:00:50.880> to<00:00:51.059> create<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> few

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
myself and it manages to create a few

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.760 
myself and it manages to create a few
more<00:00:51.660> chances<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> temple<00:00:52.559> being<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
more chances with the temple being a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.350 
more chances with the temple being a
little<00:00:52.920> bit<00:00:53.040> higher<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> goal<00:00:54.090> did

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
little bit higher and the goal did

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.520 
little bit higher and the goal did
commit<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.719> spell<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.260> you're<00:00:55.380> really

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
commit a spell that you're really

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
commit a spell that you're really
enjoying<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:56.100> well<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> few<00:00:56.489> chances<00:00:56.790> had<00:00:57.090> gone

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
enjoying as well a few chances had gone

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.119 
enjoying as well a few chances had gone
close<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.750> before<00:00:58.050> though<00:00:58.200> yeah<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:59.040> was

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
close just before though yeah there was

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
close just before though yeah there was
here<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.430> had<00:00:59.460> Clayton<00:00:59.940> chance<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.510> before

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
here we had Clayton chance just before

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.520 
here we had Clayton chance just before
that<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:02.160> couple<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.000> others<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.450> but<00:01:04.409> we

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
that and a couple of others and but we

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.169 
that and a couple of others and but we
needed<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.009> goal<00:01:05.339> think<00:01:05.579> we<00:01:05.700> needed<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:06.179 
needed that goal think we needed it to

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:07.789 
needed that goal think we needed it to
lift<00:01:06.389> us<00:01:06.569> and<00:01:06.929> we<00:01:07.109> started<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.499> second<00:01:07.770> half

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
lift us and we started the second half

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.410 
lift us and we started the second half
while<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.249> we<00:01:08.310> probably<00:01:08.520> deserved<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.209> at

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
while and we probably deserved it at

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.230 
while and we probably deserved it at
that<00:01:09.600> time<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.189> but<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.369> setback<00:01:11.789> just

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that time and but then the setback just

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.059 
that time and but then the setback just
came<00:01:13.079> at<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.259> wrong<00:01:13.350> time<00:01:13.590> again<00:01:13.859> but<00:01:13.950> we

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:14.069 
came at the wrong time again but we

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:15.620 
came at the wrong time again but we
managed<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.310> kick<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.209> the<00:01:15.299> equalizer

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
managed to kick on and get the equalizer

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.050 
managed to kick on and get the equalizer
it<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:16.200> your<00:01:16.409> goal<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.859> drew<00:01:17.459> the<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.850> first

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
it was your goal that drew the the first

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.699 
it was your goal that drew the the first
equaliser<00:01:18.630> you've<00:01:18.929> been<00:01:19.049> coming<00:01:19.200> close<00:01:19.469> in

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:19.709 
equaliser you've been coming close in

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:21.590 
equaliser you've been coming close in
recent<00:01:20.369> weeks<00:01:20.399> nice<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.969> get<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.389> over<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
recent weeks nice to get one over the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.870 
recent weeks nice to get one over the
line<00:01:21.779> it<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.350> yeah<00:01:22.590> especially<00:01:23.520> after<00:01:23.609> sat

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
line it is yeah especially after sat

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.340 
line it is yeah especially after sat
idea<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.420> probably<00:01:24.749> think<00:01:25.109> I<00:01:25.170> should<00:01:25.319> have
