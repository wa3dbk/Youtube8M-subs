00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
or slip down at all which is definitely

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.770 
or slip down at all which is definitely
something<00:00:42.070> I've<00:00:42.370> experienced<00:00:43.060> in<00:00:43.210> other

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
something I've experienced in other

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.200 
something I've experienced in other
pairs<00:00:44.140> of<00:00:44.290> spandex<00:00:44.770> or<00:00:45.190> compression<00:00:45.730> shorts

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
pairs of spandex or compression shorts

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.510 
pairs of spandex or compression shorts
that<00:00:46.330> I've<00:00:46.480> worn<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:47.230> leg<00:00:47.650> for<00:00:48.010> me<00:00:48.220> was<00:00:48.489> a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
that I've worn the leg for me was a

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.790 
that I've worn the leg for me was a
little<00:00:48.970> loose<00:00:49.300> from<00:00:49.720> just<00:00:50.110> above<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.410> knee

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
little loose from just above the knee

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.400 
little loose from just above the knee
below<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:52.420> three-quarter<00:00:52.960> length<00:00:53.140> so<00:00:53.290> they

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
below the three-quarter length so they

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.070 
below the three-quarter length so they
only<00:00:53.530> go<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:54.070> about<00:00:54.220> mid<00:00:54.640> calf<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.630> for<00:00:55.989> me

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
only go to about mid calf and for me

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.660 
only go to about mid calf and for me
they<00:00:56.200> were<00:00:56.260> a<00:00:56.380> little<00:00:56.590> bit<00:00:56.830> loose<00:00:57.040> towards<00:00:57.550> the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
they were a little bit loose towards the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.220 
they were a little bit loose towards the
bottom<00:00:57.820> but<00:00:58.270> it<00:00:58.390> didn't<00:00:58.630> really<00:00:58.750> bother<00:00:59.020> me

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
bottom but it didn't really bother me

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.660 
bottom but it didn't really bother me
and<00:00:59.470> that<00:00:59.620> might<00:00:59.800> just<00:00:59.920> be<00:01:00.040> because<00:01:00.130> I'm<00:01:00.520> not

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
and that might just be because I'm not

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
and that might just be because I'm not
very<00:01:00.970> tall

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.429 

okay<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.450> thoughts<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.929> material<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
okay so thoughts on the material the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.859 
okay so thoughts on the material the
material<00:01:07.469> is<00:01:08.009> great<00:01:08.460> they<00:01:08.820> feel<00:01:09.119> cool<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.479> you

material is great they feel cool and you
put<00:01:10.079> them<00:01:10.229> on<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.649> soon<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.009> started<00:01:11.310> playing

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
put them on as soon as I started playing

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.609 
put them on as soon as I started playing
in<00:01:11.880> them<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.179> felt<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.539> they<00:01:12.719> warmed<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.350> just

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
in them I felt like they warmed up just

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.260 
in them I felt like they warmed up just
to<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.859> temperature<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.579> want<00:01:14.909> them<00:01:15.090> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
to the temperature that you want them to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.289 
to the temperature that you want them to
be<00:01:15.390> without<00:01:15.829> getting<00:01:16.829> too<00:01:17.039> hot<00:01:17.219> so<00:01:18.030> how<00:01:18.149> they

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
be without getting too hot so how they

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.240 
be without getting too hot so how they
feel<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.719> touch<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> touch<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.950> felt

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
feel to touch then to the touch I felt

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.520 
feel to touch then to the touch I felt
like<00:01:20.429> they<00:01:20.609> were<00:01:21.090> super<00:01:21.539> slippery<00:01:22.140> they

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
like they were super slippery they

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.249 
like they were super slippery they
almost<00:01:22.679> felt<00:01:23.069> liquidy<00:01:23.959> compared<00:01:24.959> to<00:01:25.110> my<00:01:25.229> other

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
almost felt liquidy compared to my other

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.169 
almost felt liquidy compared to my other
compression<00:01:25.979> shorts<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.640> felt<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:26.939> they<00:01:27.119> were

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
compression shorts I felt like they were

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.419 
compression shorts I felt like they were
just<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.569> little<00:01:27.719> bit<00:01:28.020> thinner<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:29.159> would<00:01:29.310> be

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
just a little bit thinner which would be

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.580 
just a little bit thinner which would be
nice<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.909> days<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.299> aren't<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.719> cold<00:01:31.350> as

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
nice on days that aren't as cold as

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.499 
nice on days that aren't as cold as
others<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> marketing<00:01:32.909> point<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.299> five

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
others so a marketing point that five

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
others so a marketing point that five
makes<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:34.200> these<00:01:34.319> compression<00:01:34.770> pants<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.159> they

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
makes on these compression pants as they

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940 
makes on these compression pants as they
have<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.429> four-way<00:01:35.939> stretch<00:01:36.329> fabric<00:01:36.860> did<00:01:37.860> you

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
have a four-way stretch fabric did you

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.770 
have a four-way stretch fabric did you
notice<00:01:38.130> anything<00:01:38.340> about<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.970> didn't

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
notice anything about that I didn't

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.600 
notice anything about that I didn't
notice<00:01:40.020> them<00:01:40.200> being<00:01:40.530> stretchier<00:01:41.130> than<00:01:41.130> other

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
notice them being stretchier than other

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.029 
notice them being stretchier than other
pairs<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.149> spandex<00:01:42.599> that<00:01:42.750> I've<00:01:42.989> worn<00:01:43.349> but<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
pairs of spandex that I've worn but I

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.039 
pairs of spandex that I've worn but I
did<00:01:44.310> notice<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.759> they<00:01:45.149> stayed<00:01:45.450> markedly

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
did notice that they stayed markedly

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.830 
did notice that they stayed markedly
cooler<00:01:47.039> than<00:01:47.280> other<00:01:47.489> pairs<00:01:47.819> of<00:01:48.030> spandex<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
cooler than other pairs of spandex I

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.719 
cooler than other pairs of spandex I
definitely<00:01:49.259> felt<00:01:49.469> warm<00:01:49.860> enough<00:01:50.129> wearing<00:01:50.579> them

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
definitely felt warm enough wearing them

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.330 
definitely felt warm enough wearing them
but<00:01:50.969> they<00:01:51.179> wick<00:01:51.959> the<00:01:51.989> sweat<00:01:52.259> away<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:53.009> well

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.830 

imagine<00:01:56.340> features<00:01:56.879> for<00:01:57.149> compression<00:01:57.479> pants

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
imagine features for compression pants

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.959 
imagine features for compression pants
they're<00:01:58.170> few<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.500> far<00:01:58.619> between<00:01:58.770> what's<00:01:59.670> five

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
they're few and far between what's five
