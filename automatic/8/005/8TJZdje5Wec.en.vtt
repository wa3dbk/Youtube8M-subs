00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.039 
the cabinets up top I thought this was
somewhat<00:02:54.970> strange<00:02:55.329> there's<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.599> little<00:02:55.840> bit<00:02:55.959> of

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
somewhat strange there's a little bit of

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.780 
somewhat strange there's a little bit of
discoloring<00:02:56.620> from<00:02:56.920> one<00:02:57.099> cabinet<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
discoloring from one cabinet to the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.990 
discoloring from one cabinet to the
other<00:02:58.650> those<00:02:59.650> are<00:02:59.799> factory<00:03:00.189> cabinets<00:03:00.670> I<00:03:00.819> guess

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
other those are factory cabinets I guess

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.220 
other those are factory cabinets I guess
I<00:03:01.120> don't<00:03:01.269> understand

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
I don't understand

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.089 
I don't understand
guess<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.799> factory<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:04.900> was<00:03:05.170> off<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.590> day

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.589 

we<00:03:09.099> can<00:03:09.310> definitely<00:03:09.730> do<00:03:10.150> something<00:03:10.510> about

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
we can definitely do something about

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.509 
we can definitely do something about
that<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:11.290> would<00:03:11.560> have<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.769> figure<00:03:12.040> out<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.310> cost

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
that I would have to figure out the cost

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.220 
that I would have to figure out the cost
of<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:12.879> the<00:03:13.090> cabinet<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:13.840> definitely

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
of that the cabinet is definitely

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.630 
of that the cabinet is definitely
functional<00:03:14.439> there's<00:03:14.859> nothing<00:03:15.099> wrong<00:03:15.250> with<00:03:15.489> it

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
functional there's nothing wrong with it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.030 
functional there's nothing wrong with it
but<00:03:16.329> at<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.540> same<00:03:16.720> time<00:03:16.959> it<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.319> off<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:17.799> color
