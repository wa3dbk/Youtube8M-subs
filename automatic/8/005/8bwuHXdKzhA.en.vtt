humans<00:00:02.700> like<00:00:03.030> most<00:00:03.270> animals<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.840> plants

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
humans like most animals and plants

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.610 
humans like most animals and plants
reproduce<00:00:04.440> sexually<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.879> means<00:00:06.240> that<00:00:06.390> each

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:06.620 
reproduce sexually this means that each

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.320 
reproduce sexually this means that each
individual<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.830> new<00:00:08.189> genetic<00:00:08.519> combination

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
individual is a new genetic combination

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.870 
individual is a new genetic combination
from<00:00:09.570> two<00:00:09.840> different<00:00:10.110> parents<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:11.550> video

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
from two different parents this video

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.610 
from two different parents this video
will<00:00:12.090> look<00:00:12.179> at<00:00:12.330> how<00:00:12.420> sex<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.960> determined<00:00:13.530> in

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
will look at how sex is determined in

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.310 
will look at how sex is determined in
humans<00:00:13.980> why<00:00:14.490> some<00:00:14.849> diseases<00:00:15.269> are<00:00:15.599> sex<00:00:15.900> linked

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
humans why some diseases are sex linked

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.950 
humans why some diseases are sex linked
and<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.619> mostly<00:00:17.039> affect<00:00:17.490> males<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.119> also<00:00:18.750> look

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and so mostly affect males and also look

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.900 
and so mostly affect males and also look
at<00:00:18.990> some<00:00:19.109> fertility<00:00:19.590> treatments<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.369> how

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
at some fertility treatments and how

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.400 
at some fertility treatments and how
they<00:00:21.090> could<00:00:21.150> be<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.510> use<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.779> people<00:00:22.260> with

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
they could be of use to people with

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.740 
they could be of use to people with
different<00:00:22.619> fertility<00:00:23.369> problems<00:00:23.789> there's<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
different fertility problems there's a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.929 
different fertility problems there's a
separate<00:00:25.199> video<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.039> menstrual<00:00:26.490> cycle

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
separate video on the menstrual cycle

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.759 
separate video on the menstrual cycle
and<00:00:27.060> how<00:00:27.210> sperm<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.750> eggs<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.080> adapted<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
and how sperm and eggs are adapted to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.840 
and how sperm and eggs are adapted to
their<00:00:28.949> role<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.429> sexual<00:00:30.210> reproduction<00:00:31.850> humans

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
their role in sexual reproduction humans

called<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.920> sex<00:00:41.160> chromosomes<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.910> these

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
called the sex chromosomes and these

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.450 
called the sex chromosomes and these
determine<00:00:43.079> whether<00:00:43.290> someone<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.860> male<00:00:44.219> or

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
determine whether someone is male or

chromosomes both known as X whereas

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.549

and one copy of a Y chromosome from this

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.979 
and one copy of a Y chromosome from this
we<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.730> see<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.030> when<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> woman<00:00:57.629> produces

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
we can see that when a woman produces

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.410 
we can see that when a woman produces
eggs<00:00:58.320> through<00:00:58.770> meiosis<00:00:58.949> each<00:00:59.850> egg<00:01:00.149> must

eggs through meiosis each egg must

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.869 
eggs through meiosis each egg must
contain<00:01:00.899> an<00:01:01.109> X<00:01:01.289> chromosome<00:01:01.710> however<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:02.850> a

male<00:01:03.180> produces<00:01:03.629> sperm<00:01:04.170> through<00:01:04.500> meiosis<00:01:04.650> half
