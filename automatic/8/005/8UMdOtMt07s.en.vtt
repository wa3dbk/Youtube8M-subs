play<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.200> likes<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.590> de<00:02:32.130> Bruin<00:02:32.490> benteke<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
play the likes of de Bruin benteke and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.570 
play the likes of de Bruin benteke and
Lukaku<00:02:33.630> as<00:02:33.930> long<00:02:34.380> as<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> cam<00:02:34.800> gets<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.310> green

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
Lukaku as long as the cam gets to green

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.460

links<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.480> striker<00:02:36.720> does<00:02:36.900> as<00:02:37.020> well<00:02:37.200> and

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
links and the striker does as well and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.380 
links and the striker does as well and
then<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.100> think<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.460> actually<00:02:38.760> all<00:02:38.880> fine<00:02:39.180> guys

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
then I think it's actually all fine guys

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.080 
then I think it's actually all fine guys
so<00:02:39.630> overall<00:02:40.080> um<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:41.400> could<00:02:41.520> probably<00:02:41.700> take<00:02:41.940> it

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
so overall um you could probably take it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.910 
so overall um you could probably take it
down<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.300> about<00:02:42.330> 100,000<00:02:43.170> coins<00:02:43.290> compared<00:02:43.830> to

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
down to about 100,000 coins compared to

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.680 
down to about 100,000 coins compared to
the<00:02:43.980> 5.5<00:02:44.520> minute<00:02:44.790> I'd<00:02:44.880> probably<00:02:45.030> go<00:02:45.210> for<00:02:45.300> 100k

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
the 5.5 minute I'd probably go for 100k

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.690 
the 5.5 minute I'd probably go for 100k
version<00:02:46.140> but<00:02:46.770> again<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.250> just<00:02:47.340> for<00:02:47.490> video

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700

version but again this is just for video
purposes<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.570> tend<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:48.990> rush<00:02:49.530> every
