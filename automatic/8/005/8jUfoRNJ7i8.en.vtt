 and military leader within the covenant 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.890
 are responsible for representing their 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.379
 interests about the usual covenant 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.809
 they are armed with the track and a powerful 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.870
 ceremonial hammer exclusive only for 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.370
 that hierarchy rank possess in a armor 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.230
 crimson black 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.149
 they prefer to fight hand to hand so 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.700
 who use the gravity hammer or 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.190
 Energy swords sometimes use 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.170
 grenades figures when they use 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.259
 invincibility and his armor of power will 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.119
 they become practically invincible 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.610
 Captain Ultra are the captains over 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.440
 high rank and they use heavy weapons like 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.500
 Gross barrel and barrel guns 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.630
 veteran captain fuel have 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.720
 extensive experience in battle and commands 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.300
 large groups of ground troops 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.160
 they use mostly gross captain truck 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.140
 of lower rank than the previous ones 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.159
 leaders 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.770
 mainly commands squads 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.750
 Terrestrial honor guards are 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.640
 high-ranking and reliable escorts 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.229
 warriors and not just to protect their 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.689
 hierarch but also to the prophets 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.329
 they seem to be the gross homologs of 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.640
 the elite guard honor bodyguard 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.250
 are responsible for the protection of their 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.069
 hierarchs are also responsible for 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.380

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.009
 camouflage often use james radar to 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.840
 confuse their prey and they are the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.880
 main outbreaks that the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.700
 incendiary grenades 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.950
 for these veterans crosses use and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.380
 a pax to launch air attacks from 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.170
 away and use their greater mobility to 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.180
 the brute guerrilla tactics ultras 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.730
 make up the best of the soldiers of 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.120
 infantry showing touch skill and 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.489
 cunning brute force greater are warriors 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.130
 fierce and lethal are promoted from rank 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.140
 due to the casualties that cause gross 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.340
 minor are the lowest grade within 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.849
 the brute forces 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.930
 they are usually armed by speakers 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.239
 worlds ranges 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.250
 ultra wear a color armor 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.349
 white and they are the commanders of others 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.200
 groups in battle still do not send 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.329
 other special operations groups 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.579
 they wear a black armor and 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.370
 they are commanded by operational elites 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.290
 specials have been seen using the cannon 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.469
 of fuel more often than 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.810
 Other heavyweight grunge hammerman dress 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.909
 a green armor its purpose 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.120
 The main thing is to mount and operate 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.219
 Plasma and turrets get older dress 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.810
 an armor / red and brown and are the 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.579
 veteran groups and it has been seen that 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.310
 can lead a squadron of crosses 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.340
 younger minors wear a suit of armor 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.409
 orange and they are the simplest they carry 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.430
 plasma pistols and flee battle 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.650
 when they kill their leader ranges and carl 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.260
 rogers are trained for places of 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.719
 zero gravity or very little seriousness 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.939
 they use jetpacks however they use the 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.799
 same accessories as a gel bunk by 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.599
 what can attack in places where no 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.030
 there is a lot of gravity like space 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.040
 outside or outside of a ship they saw 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.150
 for the first time in the battle of areas in 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.060
 the summer of 2,550 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.310
 sniper commonly appear in halo 2 already 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.349
 3 and it can be very frustrating and 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.260
 dangerous if you are playing in 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.599
 higher levels of difficulty and greater 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.720
 They are difficult and should not be taken down 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:59.150
 his own pace however rarely seldom 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.790
 find alone they are often found 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.040
 with minor leaders tend to the 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.870
 overload of plasma guns and the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.629
 use of their shields to block the 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.629
 enemy fire the best way to kill them 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:14.390
 is to use a fragmentation grenade 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:17.239
 I will also talk a little about the pro 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.160
 I recorded my one driving born when a proto 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.799
 Serious child reaches a certain mass 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.510
 criticism is the personality of the fruits 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.640
 and it carries the genetic memory 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.490
 obtained from millennia of war 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.470
 and lethargy so it's practically 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.480
 omniscient proto de l'avenir a 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.610
 Unlike other forms of the fruits 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.070
 apparently it is immobile and passive in 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.430
 Combat himself have not been observed 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.740
 being damaged firearms prophet 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.540
 prophet form is a term that fans 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.310
 have created to describe the pact 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.500
 prophets that have been infected and 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.840
 overcome by the gnaw due to its 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.930
 unusual character are not considered 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.850
 as fight flow hearn out is called 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.220
 well for its size and its power 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.020
 the giant flower is very big around 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.050
 of the times as high as the boss 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.820
 master and elites the giant club can 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.560
 jump twice as high as 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.680
 regards the already impressive capacity 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.810
 to jump in a way and fight form 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.390
 she is a new type of club 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.700
 that have been used in the three as 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.560
 implies its name the pure forms are 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.560
 the product of infecting a principle 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.780
 biological host but instead 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.550
 it is composed entirely of biomass um 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.669
 but the worms that make up the 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.380
 carrier hunters is a normal type 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.690
 in a fluid form used mainly 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.820
 for the transport and creation of 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.529
 forms of infection in this way the 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.469
 spread of floods 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:41.449
 combat is formed when a parasitic club 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:44.329
 has infected the vertebrate living being as 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.329
 human elites or outbreaks use weapons 

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:49.939
 varied of the three types infection 

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:51.979
 also known as a spore flow is 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:53.719
 the first stage of the flutey variant 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.249
 is the most common stage view of the 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:58.219
 flood and the way of life that 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:59.929
 infect another or other living beings that 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.639
 it's all I hope to find more 

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:03.349
 Hilarious curiosities to follow 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.059
 uploading videos of this type 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.539
 well subscribe I know it's free and
