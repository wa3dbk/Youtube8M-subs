00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.180
 hi guys in this life video is a 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.780
 moment has time for the estimate we see 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.780
 immediately the exercises 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.310
 let's start with the oarsman with barbell 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.630
 how do you see this the correct posture that 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.490
 you will go to keep the curves 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.350
 the back of the same physiological 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.820
 legs slightly bent the area 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.680
 lumbar does not have to intervene in a manner 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.029
 therefore important will be contracted for 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.470
 maintain posture but must not 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.390
 absolutely supports too much effort 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.340
 high weight therefore mainly 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.470
 burden on the ridges 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.500
 this is threshing then mine 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.690
 I suggest to vary doing mit exercise 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.860
 but with this to go to hit in 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.860
 differently in pink 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.610
 second exercise in this case 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.170
 we train the trapezius that we can be 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.160
 tells workout for the do it in 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.910
 the one for the back so it's a lot 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.680
 staff 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.269
 this movement corrected the barbell 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.190
 the same as before itself created with 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.440
 very light but anyway it is there 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.729
 guarantees namar very effective 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.899
 this correct movement then ski 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.300
 andretta to keep them bull e 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.860
 physiological I recommend the careful 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.930
 liberation therefore and expire when you carry 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.180
 instrument barbell and inspire 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.460
 in the other phase iii fakoly of the maximum 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.960
 on the burden on the exercise only between 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.960
 pes not on other muscle 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.630
 now we see the openings to hit i 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.550
 backbones in this case the positive 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.590
 posture and the same view for the 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.300
 I recommend a barbell paddle there 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.040
 not crossbow contracted but still the 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.660
 load will not bear on it is also 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.720
 slightly bent and sport 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.250
 mainly for the backbones 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.170
 very important aspiration therefore e 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.640
 spiri when you go to open or if you with 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.890
 trainor fails to spend another 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.930
 variant that I recommend keeps the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.930
 back straight as always stopped me 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.950
 now let's see the single handlebar rower 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.450
 obviously first one arm with the other 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.979
 in this case this is the posture 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.670
 correct then as always back 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.110
 starboard 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.270
 I lean on a bench that can be 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.409
 ordered or plus inclined end 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.210
 the important thing is that I go to 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.500
 target the backbone then the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.720
 back especially without 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.280
 involve the we lumbar breath 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.480
 when i go to check their stories 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.550
 second door the pool barbell 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.720
 close to the chest and inspire in the other fas 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.370
 I recommend it 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.780
 as you see also the ii and from the video uses a 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.780
 weight a very light handlebar 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.330
 now we see the rower made with i 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.890
 dumbbells as always the same posture 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.780
 view for opening and for the oarsman 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.520
 with the bar excuses hand for 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.840
 this case slightly heavier but 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.910
 as long as they can guarantee you one 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.380
 impeccable technique because even a little 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.510
 weight could really feel good 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.100
 work the ridges as backs always 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.810
 tips to keep them geological clean 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.520
 lumbar area should not intervene legs 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.260
 slightly bent and atonement 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.970
 very important therefore and spiri when 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.080
 carry but no chest forecast and 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.080
 inspire in the other phase 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.209
 the last exercise with straps or trx 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.400
 depends on the poles of the instrument 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.530
 in this case the exercise is really 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.150
 very effective the whole body will be in 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.530
 tension in the dominate area will be 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.239
 contracted to maintain posture 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.620
 therefore indirectly we go to 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.510
 also train the first course 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.489
 central then abdominals why 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.690
 however, link the goal of stabilizing 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.099
 obviously in good practice 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.480
 mainly on their salts 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.730
 breathing as always a lot 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.590
 important then and spirit went bay 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.359
 dorsal opposites therefore when in fact 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.459
 go and approach the handle 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.819
 decide to clarify and inspire in the other 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.819
 phase
