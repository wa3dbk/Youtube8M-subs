00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.120 

yeah<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:23.030> Duke<00:04:23.900> Nukem<00:04:24.080> access<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.770> has<00:04:24.889> two

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
sides one sides in English one sides and

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.810 
sides one sides in English one sides and
I'm<00:04:28.639> guessing<00:04:29.150> Spanish<00:04:30.280> there's<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.340> Spanish

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
I'm guessing Spanish there's a Spanish

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.570 
I'm guessing Spanish there's a Spanish
side<00:04:32.740> cover<00:04:33.740> up<00:04:33.919> that<00:04:34.070> name<00:04:36.340> access<00:04:37.340> code

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
side cover up that name access code

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.350 
side cover up that name access code
there<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:42.580> even<00:04:43.580> think<00:04:43.759> the<00:04:43.849> codes<00:04:44.090> on<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
there I even think the codes on the

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.070 
there I even think the codes on the
outside<00:04:45.370> hey<00:04:46.370> just<00:04:47.090> in<00:04:47.150> case<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:47.479> is<00:04:49.870> so<00:04:50.870> on<00:04:50.990> the
