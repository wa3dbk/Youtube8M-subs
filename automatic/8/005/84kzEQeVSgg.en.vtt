honey badger i have been using the
Ripper<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.629> thought<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> heard<00:00:49.469> footsteps<00:00:49.829> right

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
Ripper I thought I heard footsteps right

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.470 
Ripper I thought I heard footsteps right
over<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:51.079> areas<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:53.430> his<00:00:54.000> buddy<00:00:54.210> was<00:00:54.270> right

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
over here areas and his buddy was right

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.670 
over here areas and his buddy was right
there

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.980 

so<00:00:58.370> far<00:00:58.580> I'm<00:00:58.700> not<00:00:58.730> seeing<00:00:59.060> much<00:00:59.360> of<00:00:59.420> dome<00:00:59.750> out

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
so far I'm not seeing much of dome out

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.390 
so far I'm not seeing much of dome out
of<00:01:00.080> this<00:01:00.200> map<00:01:00.470> but<00:01:00.830> that's<00:01:01.160> probably

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
of this map but that's probably

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.430 
of this map but that's probably
something<00:01:01.550> once<00:01:02.120> I<00:01:02.240> sort<00:01:02.630> of<00:01:02.690> get<00:01:02.810> a<00:01:02.840> grasp<00:01:03.080> and

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
something once I sort of get a grasp and

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.240 
something once I sort of get a grasp and
grass<00:01:04.250> for<00:01:04.430> where<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:04.610> am<00:01:04.820> we<00:01:05.600> will<00:01:05.750> see<00:01:06.250> start

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
grass for where I am we will see start

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.620 
grass for where I am we will see start
to<00:01:07.340> see<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> little<00:01:07.670> bit<00:01:07.760> more<00:01:07.940> dome<00:01:08.180> coming<00:01:08.510> out

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
to see a little bit more dome coming out

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.450 
to see a little bit more dome coming out
this<00:01:09.350> guy<00:01:09.530> was<00:01:09.650> getting<00:01:09.800> shot<00:01:09.980> in<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.160> back<00:01:10.310> I

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.670 
believe oh wow I'm getting shot in the
back<00:01:13.160> to<00:01:14.140> where<00:01:15.140> am<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:15.470> oh<00:01:15.729> that's<00:01:16.729> great<00:01:17.680> just

trying<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.070> get<00:01:19.190> my<00:01:19.310> bearings<00:01:19.490> here<00:01:19.790> and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
trying to get my bearings here and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:30.690 
trying to get my bearings here and
there's<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.270> guy<00:01:20.420> right<00:01:20.600> behind<00:01:20.660> me

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.780 

we'll<00:01:31.700> just<00:01:31.850> keep<00:01:32.000> pushing<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.570> guess<00:01:36.790> that

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
we'll just keep pushing I guess that

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.950 
we'll just keep pushing I guess that
might<00:01:38.000> have<00:01:38.150> been<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.270> stupid<00:01:38.570> move<00:01:38.720> running

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
might have been a stupid move running

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.320 
might have been a stupid move running
into<00:01:39.230> their<00:01:39.410> into<00:01:40.190> their<00:01:40.340> line<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.610> fire<00:01:40.790> but<00:01:41.060> i

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
into their into their line of fire but i

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.510 
into their into their line of fire but i
don't<00:01:42.140> know<00:01:42.170> i<00:01:42.230> thought<00:01:42.500> i<00:01:42.530> would<00:01:42.770> have<00:01:43.340> time

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
don't know i thought i would have time

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.360 
don't know i thought i would have time
to<00:01:43.550> actually<00:01:43.760> shoot<00:01:44.060> somebody<00:01:44.270> there<00:01:45.280> so<00:01:46.280> they

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
to actually shoot somebody there so they

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.950 
to actually shoot somebody there so they
should<00:01:46.520> be<00:01:46.550> spawning<00:01:46.820> over<00:01:47.090> here<00:01:47.360> just

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
should be spawning over here just

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.240 
should be spawning over here just
judging<00:01:48.290> by<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.620> positioning<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.130> my

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
judging by the positioning of my

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.740 
judging by the positioning of my
teammates<00:01:49.490> i<00:01:49.670> have<00:01:49.790> no<00:01:50.180> knowledge<00:01:50.390> of<00:01:50.630> the

something I think oh did I just call it

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.640 
something I think oh did I just call it
in<00:04:31.500> on<00:04:31.590> top<00:04:31.800> of<00:04:31.950> here<00:04:32.510> I<00:04:33.510> landed<00:04:34.350> outside<00:04:34.470> of

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
in on top of here I landed outside of

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.290 
in on top of here I landed outside of
the<00:04:34.710> map<00:04:34.800> but<00:04:35.010> it's<00:04:35.190> just<00:04:35.370> an<00:04:35.460> IMS<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:36.030> can't

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
the map but it's just an IMS I can't

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.730 
the map but it's just an IMS I can't
believe<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:36.540> did<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.870> looked<00:04:37.200> up<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.590> saw

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
believe I did that I looked up and I saw

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.770 
believe I did that I looked up and I saw
it<00:04:37.770> was<00:04:38.010> open<00:04:38.310> so<00:04:38.550> I<00:04:38.580> don't<00:04:39.510> know<00:04:39.570> I<00:04:39.600> thought

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
it was open so I don't know I thought

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.480 
it was open so I don't know I thought
I'd<00:04:39.900> be<00:04:39.930> safe<00:04:40.230> there<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.710> uh<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:41.130> call<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.400> in

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
I'd be safe there to uh to call it in

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.120 
I'd be safe there to uh to call it in
where<00:04:41.640> I<00:04:41.670> was<00:04:42.170> obviously<00:04:43.170> a<00:04:43.290> bad<00:04:43.650> move<00:04:43.860> though

long<00:05:27.930> I'm<00:05:28.930> really<00:05:29.410> liking<00:05:29.590> this<00:05:29.770> map<00:05:29.949> so<00:05:30.099> far

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
long I'm really liking this map so far

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.439 
long I'm really liking this map so far
it<00:05:31.180> is<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.630> lot<00:05:32.410> like<00:05:32.770> dome<00:05:33.130> but<00:05:33.550> there<00:05:34.210> are

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
it is a lot like dome but there are

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.170 
it is a lot like dome but there are
enough<00:05:34.870> differences<00:05:35.710> that<00:05:36.370> that<00:05:36.729> makes<00:05:36.910> it<00:05:37.030> a

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
enough differences that that makes it a

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.450 
enough differences that that makes it a
new<00:05:37.360> map<00:05:37.569> so<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.020> get<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.620> same<00:05:38.770> sort<00:05:39.039> of<00:05:39.099> feel

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
new map so you get the same sort of feel

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.480 
new map so you get the same sort of feel
of<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.789> map<00:05:39.990> but<00:05:40.990> there<00:05:41.800> are<00:05:41.949> quite<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.430> few

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
of the map but there are quite a few

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.279 
of the map but there are quite a few
differences<00:05:43.000> that<00:05:43.210> I'm<00:05:43.330> seeing<00:05:43.690> so<00:05:43.870> far<00:05:43.900> oh<00:05:44.229> I

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
differences that I'm seeing so far oh I

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.100 
differences that I'm seeing so far oh I
thought<00:05:44.530> that<00:05:44.620> was<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:44.800> guy<00:05:44.919> in<00:05:45.160> a<00:05:45.250> ghillie<00:05:45.460> suit
