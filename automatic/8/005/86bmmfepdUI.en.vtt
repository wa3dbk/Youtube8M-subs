sure you do this 110 men and I think
that<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.119> fastest<00:00:27.660> ways<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.230> get

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that this is the fastest ways to get

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.460 
that this is the fastest ways to get
like<00:00:28.680> 50<00:00:29.039> leather<00:00:29.699> pieces<00:00:30.140> you<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.260> only<00:00:31.349> do

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
like 50 leather pieces you can only do

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.240 
like 50 leather pieces you can only do
it<00:00:31.529> five<00:00:31.679> times<00:00:31.710> an<00:00:32.040> hour

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
it five times an hour

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.900 
it five times an hour
obviously<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:34.460> with<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> amount<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.790> stuff

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
obviously but with the amount of stuff

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.299 
obviously but with the amount of stuff
that<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.180> get<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.570> pretty<00:00:37.140> crazy

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
that you get it's pretty crazy

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
so if you a grocery area everything

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.040 
so if you a grocery area everything
comes<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.719> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
as you can see I mean obviously this is

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.180 
as you can see I mean obviously this is
not<00:02:21.530> my<00:02:22.530> gear<00:02:23.420> 538<00:02:24.440> not<00:02:25.440> amazing

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
not my gear 538 not amazing

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.370 
not my gear 538 not amazing
I'm<00:02:27.000> not<00:02:27.150> even<00:02:27.390> combat<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.050> don't<00:02:28.320> really

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
I'm not even combat so I don't really

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.890 
I'm not even combat so I don't really
have<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.950> great<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.370> OE<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.870> I

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
have like that great of a OE and so I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.920 
have like that great of a OE and so I
mean<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:33.030> harder<00:02:33.630> thing<00:02:33.660> to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
mean this is this is a harder thing to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.080 
mean this is this is a harder thing to
do<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.830> if<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.160> have<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.310> good<00:02:35.490> gear<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.970> you

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
do but if you have a good gear and you

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.540

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
a place where they're not just gonna

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.280 
a place where they're not just gonna
aggro<00:03:02.520> or<00:03:02.790> sort<00:03:03.600> their<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.900> isn't<00:03:04.080> just<00:03:04.110> gonna

the<00:03:40.799> way<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.010> make<00:03:41.310> sure<00:03:41.519> is<00:03:41.700> three<00:03:42.060> bond<00:03:42.810> down

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
the way to make sure is three bond down

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.620 
the way to make sure is three bond down
there<00:03:43.530> that's<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.799> nexus<00:03:44.280> up<00:03:44.670> there<00:03:45.090> that's

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
there that's the nexus up there that's

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.360 
there that's the nexus up there that's
where<00:03:45.900> my<00:03:46.049> logo<00:03:46.200> says<00:03:46.620> okay<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.070> don't<00:03:47.190> want

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.280 
to be either of those places
neither<00:03:49.560> one<00:03:49.920> all<00:03:50.640> right<00:03:51.120> go<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.019> just<00:03:52.049> on

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
oculus and this is actually really easy

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.440 
oculus and this is actually really easy
to<00:04:00.510> do<00:04:00.690> like<00:04:01.470> if<00:04:01.829> you're<00:04:02.310> if<00:04:02.610> you're<00:04:02.880> not<00:04:02.910> like

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
obsidian sanctum this is definitely a

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.400 
obsidian sanctum this is definitely a
pretty<00:04:08.400> close<00:04:08.670> pretty<00:04:09.090> close<00:04:09.690> alternative

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
pretty close pretty close alternative

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:22.520 
pretty close pretty close alternative
and<00:04:11.599> all<00:04:12.599> you<00:04:12.900> do<00:04:13.080> is<00:04:13.940> just<00:04:14.940> run<00:04:15.270> down<00:04:15.450> here

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
good place to to farm and neither strike

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.529 
good place to to farm and neither strike
their<00:06:11.890> own<00:06:11.950> Keith<00:06:12.280> even<00:06:13.240> though<00:06:13.360> they're

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
their own Keith even though they're

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.090 
their own Keith even though they're
Raptors<00:06:14.020> at<00:06:14.169> the<00:06:14.320> end<00:06:14.410> there<00:06:14.650> are<00:06:14.740> not<00:06:14.919> that

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
Raptors at the end there are not that

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.029 
Raptors at the end there are not that
many<00:06:15.280> of<00:06:15.460> them<00:06:16.080> these<00:06:17.080> two<00:06:17.380> places<00:06:17.650> I<00:06:18.010> think

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 
many of them these two places I think

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.279 
many of them these two places I think
are<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.669> most<00:06:18.910> effective<00:06:19.539> for<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:19.960> amount<00:06:20.200> of

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
are the most effective for the amount of

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.969 
are the most effective for the amount of
time<00:06:20.440> that<00:06:20.680> you<00:06:20.770> spend<00:06:20.800> doing<00:06:21.250> them<00:06:21.580> and<00:06:22.979> these

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
time that you spend doing them and these

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.219 
time that you spend doing them and these
these<00:06:24.370> here<00:06:24.640> as<00:06:25.090> I<00:06:25.360> said<00:06:25.570> before<00:06:25.720> unlike<00:06:26.050> lot

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
these here as I said before unlike lot

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:27.510 
these here as I said before unlike lot
of<00:06:26.289> other<00:06:26.440> videos<00:06:26.710> the<00:06:26.890> elites<00:06:27.099> have<00:06:27.310> a<00:06:27.340> higher

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
of other videos the elites have a higher

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.770 
of other videos the elites have a higher
chance<00:06:27.550> of<00:06:28.150> giving<00:06:28.659> you<00:06:28.930> more<00:06:29.229> than

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
chance of giving you more than

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.400 
chance of giving you more than
and<00:06:30.620> so<00:06:30.860> yeah<00:06:31.070> obviously<00:06:31.130> we<00:06:31.580> want<00:06:31.880> to<00:06:32.410> find

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
and so yeah obviously we want to find

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.800 
and so yeah obviously we want to find
places<00:06:33.650> where<00:06:33.830> there<00:06:34.130> are<00:06:34.160> elites<00:06:34.810> especially

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
places where there are elites especially

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.190 
places where there are elites especially
if<00:06:35.930> you<00:06:36.050> have<00:06:36.170> like<00:06:36.650> very<00:06:37.100> good<00:06:37.310> gear<00:06:37.960> anyway
