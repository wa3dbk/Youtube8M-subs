00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.480
 what would you do with a sandwich 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.590
 squid i think a bloody mary will 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.590
 could go pretty well 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.290
 Find out the stoves by chance and 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.760
 ended up being top tep contestant and 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.730
 one of the youngest cooks 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.580
 promising good first thing what is your 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.700
 favorite copy because if not some the dry 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.930
 dry martini but I like it a lot 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.329
 but it's a bit that it would not be the first 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.369
 check you tested I did not start so hard 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.689
 the first was a minute I have a lot 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.820
 Honey the truth because I really liked it 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.710
 the nuances of bourbon and obviously here 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.480
 have you see this from the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.790
 good bartenders stars I think 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.370
 every time you are looking more like the 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.469
 chefs not which I think is not 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.969
 bad I think that there you have the part of that 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.010
 you are in a bar and there is a lot of show 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.410
 to tell us and in the kitchen we have 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.539
 many instruments many techniques that 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.910
 I think they can come very well at the time 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:56.410
 to prepare different cocktails I think 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.390
 that is positive I think it is 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.070
 great has been a professor of techniques 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.839
 gastronomic for bartenders but 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.370
 recognizes that his true talent in a 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.070
 bar is to enjoy drinking a good 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.020
 cocktail that you think the kitchen brings 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.450
 to the bar 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.509
 and the way we can 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.950
 help is without a doubt with your 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.820
 knowledge about alcohols 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.530
 nuances that have 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.370
 the different aromas and the others maybe 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.990
 now the whole subject of techniques and 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.900
 utensils that are in the market then 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.090
 I think you can make a union 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.920
 rather curious to see what you think a 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.619
 ability bartender to determine if 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.810
 or continue in the kitchen good the nitrogen 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.280
 liquid right now I think we 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.780
 would give so many possibilities behind 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.580
 a bar along with the siphon that is a 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.070
 tense and what I love and that 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.170
 has many possibilities and the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.509
 Pairing with burning and giving is already 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.910
 a cup of angels for angels I think 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.100
 that would go very well a fish in this 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.380
 case I can think of a nice marinade with 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.300
 a little salt of sugar and grated 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.009
 pretty orange citrus in the form of 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.720
 attack or sashimi with a perhaps with a 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.720
 wasabi ice cream 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.200
 molecular we could do it in the 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.850
 base we have an infusion which we have 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.470
 vanilla and cinnamon used skin 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.519
 orange and inside the cone we have made 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.070
 some popcorn with that cocktail 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.280
 wonderful that you have prepared with 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.930
 effect of the siphon and nitrogen and what 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.700
 We topped off with some chips 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.940
 natural raspberry 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.290
 We have broken and an air of Pedro XimÃ©nez 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.510
 that is going to give a touch and also that 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.129
 it only goes here what is important as 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.120
 in everything is that the base is good and the 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.120
 cocktail your dream has come out 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.359
 i 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.650
 welcome to some with keys and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.650
 we wait when you want the uncles 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.250
 and 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.250
 to
