it says use with five to two hundred
watt<00:00:47.380> amplifiers<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:49.690> gives<00:00:49.840> a<00:00:49.900> frequency

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
watt amplifiers and it gives a frequency

Koh Audio model one eight three a we got

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.530 
Koh Audio model one eight three a we got
serial<00:01:03.490> number<00:01:03.700> seven<00:01:04.000> zero<00:01:04.210> three<00:01:04.510> eight

serial number seven zero three eight

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.710 
serial number seven zero three eight
zero<00:01:05.640> give<00:01:06.640> me<00:01:06.760> one<00:01:06.910> moment<00:01:07.060> I<00:01:07.300> turn<00:01:07.480> around

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
zero give me one moment I turn around

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:16.710 
zero give me one moment I turn around
the<00:01:07.840> other<00:01:07.990> one<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.880> have<00:01:16.060> a<00:01:16.090> second<00:01:16.630> one

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
the other one and we have a second one

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.590 
the other one and we have a second one
which<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:17.280> serial<00:01:18.280> number<00:01:18.550> seven<00:01:18.880> zero<00:01:19.180> three

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
which is serial number seven zero three

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.230 
which is serial number seven zero three
nine<00:01:19.630> two<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:21.520> means<00:01:21.820> these<00:01:22.030> were<00:01:22.150> not

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
nine two which means these were not

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.090 
nine two which means these were not
actually<00:01:22.600> sold<00:01:22.840> these<00:01:23.740> were<00:01:23.920> sold

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
actually sold these were sold

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.260 
actually sold these were sold
individually<00:01:24.250> in<00:01:24.670> stores<00:01:24.940> that<00:01:25.030> were<00:01:25.150> not

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
individually in stores that were not

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.880 
individually in stores that were not
actually<00:01:25.540> sold<00:01:25.720> as<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.840> pair<00:01:25.930> of<00:01:26.290> speakers<00:01:26.560> and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
actually sold as a pair of speakers and

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.500 
actually sold as a pair of speakers and
that's<00:01:27.490> why<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.729> serial<00:01:28.090> numbers<00:01:28.360> do<00:01:28.479> not

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
that's why the serial numbers do not

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.050 
that's why the serial numbers do not
match<00:01:29.310> otherwise<00:01:30.310> it'd<00:01:30.640> probably<00:01:30.820> be

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
match otherwise it'd probably be

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.080 
match otherwise it'd probably be
consecutive<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:33.840> little<00:01:34.840> dusty<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:36.729> we<00:01:36.850> have

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
consecutive a little dusty here we have

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.710 
consecutive a little dusty here we have
the<00:01:37.360> airport<00:01:38.110> there<00:01:38.320> in<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.650> back<00:01:38.830> which<00:01:39.790> if

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
the airport there in the back which if

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.790 
the airport there in the back which if
you<00:01:40.810> look<00:01:40.930> at<00:01:41.080> me<00:01:41.140> I<00:01:41.170> can<00:01:41.320> actually<00:01:41.440> see<00:01:41.680> the

you look at me I can actually see the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.890 
you look at me I can actually see the
back<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.220> tweeter<00:01:42.550> which<00:01:43.270> gives<00:01:43.509> good<00:01:43.720> air

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
back of the tweeter which gives good air

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.480 
back of the tweeter which gives good air
flow<00:01:43.930> for<00:01:44.380> cooling<00:01:44.440> down<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.830> tweeter

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.000 

you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> corners<00:01:51.480> are<00:01:51.890> decent<00:01:52.890> this

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
you can see the corners are decent this
