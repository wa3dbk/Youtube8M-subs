lot more thicker on all parts of the gel
compared<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> last<00:01:09.030> one<00:01:09.360> where<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.630> was

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
compared to the last one where it was

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.560 
compared to the last one where it was
really<00:01:10.049> concentrated<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.070> both<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.180> ends

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.280 
lot thicker than the last formula and
the<00:01:54.240> last<00:01:54.509> video<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.350> used<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
the last video that I used to do and

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
the last video that I used to do and
again<00:01:58.290> I'll<00:01:58.500> probably<00:01:58.829> end<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.090> all

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
again I'll probably end up with it all

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.810 
again I'll probably end up with it all
over<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.750> face<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.590> can't<00:02:01.920> really<00:02:02.280> see<00:02:02.610> what

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
over my face as I can't really see what

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.880 
over my face as I can't really see what
I'm<00:02:02.939> doing<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:05.009> ok<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.020> gel<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
I'm doing so ok so I have the gel on and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.710 
I'm doing so ok so I have the gel on and
you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.190> already<00:02:08.429> tell<00:02:08.700> between<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.539> two

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
you can already tell between the two

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.240 
you can already tell between the two
lashes<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> there's<00:02:10.709> definitely<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
lashes that there's definitely a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.620 
lashes that there's definitely a
difference<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.330> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
difference just with the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.100 
difference just with the
on<00:02:12.930> okay<00:02:13.650> while<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.850> gel<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.120> still<00:02:15.540> wet<00:02:15.780> what

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
on okay while the gel is still wet what

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.110 
on okay while the gel is still wet what
you<00:02:16.290> want<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.650> do<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:17.100> take<00:02:17.400> your<00:02:17.550> little<00:02:17.760> fiber

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
you want to do is take your little fiber

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.720 
you want to do is take your little fiber
wand<00:02:18.510> will<00:02:19.410> unscrew<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.370> can<00:02:20.520> see

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
wand will unscrew that and you can see

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.510 
wand will unscrew that and you can see
all<00:02:20.760> these<00:02:21.030> little<00:02:21.330> teeny<00:02:21.690> tiny<00:02:21.990> fibers<00:02:22.520> the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
all these little teeny tiny fibers the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.820 
all these little teeny tiny fibers the
good<00:02:23.880> thing<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.690> unique<00:02:24.930> made<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
good thing is is that unique made the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.130 
good thing is is that unique made the
fibers<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> bunch<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.970> different<00:02:27.150> lengths<00:02:27.900> now

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
fibers a bunch of different lengths now

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.630 
fibers a bunch of different lengths now
on<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:29.130> brush<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.150> therefore<00:02:31.310> you're<00:02:32.310> going

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
on the brush so therefore you're going

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.940 
on the brush so therefore you're going
to<00:02:32.760> get<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.940> more<00:02:33.270> natural<00:02:33.990> look<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.920> course

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
to get a more natural look and of course

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.490 
to get a more natural look and of course
while<00:02:35.460> I'm<00:02:35.610> doing<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.420> hope<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.930> can<00:02:37.140> see

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
while I'm doing this I hope you can see

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.370 
while I'm doing this I hope you can see
my<00:02:37.800> lashes<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.730> dramatically<00:02:39.450> getting

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
my lashes just dramatically getting

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.260 
my lashes just dramatically getting
longer<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.220> longer<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.030> longer<00:02:42.770> okay<00:02:44.270> some

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
longer and longer and longer okay some

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.210 
longer and longer and longer okay some
people<00:02:45.630> blink<00:02:46.020> when<00:02:46.200> they<00:02:46.380> do<00:02:46.440> this<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.830> bunch

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
people blink when they do this a bunch

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.220 
people blink when they do this a bunch
and<00:02:47.490> I'm<00:02:47.730> surprised<00:02:48.180> I'm<00:02:48.390> not<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:48.960> this<00:02:49.170> is

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
and I'm surprised I'm not but this is

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.920 
and I'm surprised I'm not but this is
the<00:02:49.560> way<00:02:49.740> that<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.340> put<00:02:50.820> on<00:02:50.970> my<00:02:51.210> stuff<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.900> I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
the way that I put on my stuff so that I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.110 
the way that I put on my stuff so that I
don't<00:02:52.050> get<00:02:52.410> them<00:02:52.530> all<00:02:52.680> over<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.040> place<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
don't get them all over the place so you

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.240 
don't get them all over the place so you
can<00:02:54.240> tell<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.690> with<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.500> one<00:02:55.800> I'm<00:02:56.040> going<00:02:56.190> to

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
can tell that with this one I'm going to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.950 
can tell that with this one I'm going to
get<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> close-up<00:02:56.760> here<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.300> don't<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.720> bunch

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
get a close-up here I don't have a bunch

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.140 
get a close-up here I don't have a bunch
of<00:02:58.080> fibers<00:02:58.560> all<00:02:58.800> on<00:02:58.980> my<00:02:59.130> cheek<00:02:59.460> they<00:02:59.970> actually

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
of fibers all on my cheek they actually

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.320 
of fibers all on my cheek they actually
are<00:03:00.570> securing<00:03:01.200> better<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.430> jail<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.030> not

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
are securing better to the jail and not

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330 
are securing better to the jail and not
ending<00:03:03.780> up<00:03:03.870> down<00:03:04.080> here<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.710> my<00:03:04.860> eyes<00:03:05.040> or

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
ending up down here in my eyes or

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.990 
ending up down here in my eyes or
anything<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.680> again<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.890> reason<00:03:08.070> we<00:03:08.400> have<00:03:08.610> two

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
anything so again the reason we have two

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.170 
anything so again the reason we have two
tubes<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.660> so<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.890> do<00:03:11.160> as<00:03:11.430> much<00:03:11.910> or

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
tubes is so that you can do as much or

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.570 
tubes is so that you can do as much or
as<00:03:12.240> little<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.020> fiber<00:03:13.320> process<00:03:14.160> as<00:03:14.340> you

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
as little of the fiber process as you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.450 
as little of the fiber process as you
want<00:03:14.820> so<00:03:15.420> if<00:03:15.720> i<00:03:15.930> was<00:03:16.080> going<00:03:16.320> to<00:03:16.440> be<00:03:16.590> done<00:03:16.920> what<00:03:17.430> i

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
want so if i was going to be done what i

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.480 
want so if i was going to be done what i
would<00:03:17.640> do<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:17.970> take<00:03:18.240> my<00:03:18.270> jail<00:03:18.780> again<00:03:18.960> and

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
would do is take my jail again and

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.910 
would do is take my jail again and
simply<00:03:20.490> go<00:03:20.790> over<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.540> top<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:22.020> them<00:03:22.260> again

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
simply go over the top of them again

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.610 
simply go over the top of them again
just<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.820> secure<00:03:24.120> all<00:03:24.660> those<00:03:24.990> little<00:03:25.200> fibers

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
just to secure all those little fibers

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.930 
just to secure all those little fibers
that<00:03:26.400> have<00:03:26.640> gone<00:03:26.820> on<00:03:27.120> my<00:03:27.510> lashes<00:03:27.950> already<00:03:28.950> okay

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
that have gone on my lashes already okay

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.630 
that have gone on my lashes already okay
so<00:03:30.630> if<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:30.870> was<00:03:31.050> done<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.860> is<00:03:32.070> what<00:03:32.250> my<00:03:32.400> look

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
so if I was done this is what my look

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.750 
so if I was done this is what my look
would<00:03:32.850> be<00:03:33.060> with<00:03:33.540> just<00:03:33.930> one<00:03:34.020> coat<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.950> this

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
would be with just one coat and this

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.000 
would be with just one coat and this
would<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.180> probably<00:03:36.450> taken<00:03:36.900> me<00:03:37.260> two<00:03:37.860> to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
would have probably taken me two to

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.040 
would have probably taken me two to
three<00:03:38.310> coats<00:03:38.550> with<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.970> old<00:03:39.150> formula<00:03:39.600> so

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
three coats with the old formula so

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.460 
three coats with the old formula so
hands<00:03:40.440> down<00:03:40.830> awesome<00:03:41.640> how<00:03:42.240> boring<00:03:42.780> how

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
hands down awesome how boring how

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.550 
hands down awesome how boring how
