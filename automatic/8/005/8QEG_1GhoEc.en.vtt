are going to be discussing proper
mulching<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:18.240> can<00:00:18.449> see<00:00:18.660> we're<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> very

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
mulching as you can see we're on a very

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.470 
mulching as you can see we're on a very
impressive<00:00:19.800> commercial<00:00:20.490> landscape<00:00:21.000> site<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
impressive commercial landscape site and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.929 
impressive commercial landscape site and
obviously<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> owner<00:00:22.710> values<00:00:23.189> his<00:00:23.369> landscape

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
obviously the owner values his landscape

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.820 
obviously the owner values his landscape
and<00:00:24.090> has<00:00:24.420> spent<00:00:24.660> lots<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.050> time<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.529> money

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and has spent lots of time and money

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.939 
and has spent lots of time and money
investing<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.230> proper<00:00:28.230> mulching<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.710> very

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
investing in it proper mulching is very

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
investing in it proper mulching is very
beneficial<00:00:29.160> for<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.760> landscape<00:00:30.210> such<00:00:30.420> as<00:00:30.599> this

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
beneficial for a landscape such as this

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.020 
beneficial for a landscape such as this
but<00:00:31.650> one<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> most<00:00:32.160> common<00:00:32.520> mistakes<00:00:32.880> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
but one of the most common mistakes I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.930 
but one of the most common mistakes I
see<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.540> over<00:00:33.989> mulching<00:00:34.559> let's<00:00:35.520> take<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> look

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
see is over mulching let's take a look

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.010 
see is over mulching let's take a look
at<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> few<00:00:36.270> examples

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
at a few examples

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
at a few examples
when<00:00:37.469> mulch<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> piled<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.250> against<00:00:38.610> its<00:00:38.760> stem

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
when mulch is piled up against its stem

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.290 
when mulch is piled up against its stem
the<00:00:39.719> trunk<00:00:40.020> or<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.200> Flair<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> tree<00:00:41.040> it

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
the trunk or the Flair of the tree it

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.209 
the trunk or the Flair of the tree it
creates<00:00:42.300> excessive<00:00:42.840> moisture<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.440> which

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
creates excessive moisture in here which

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.700 
creates excessive moisture in here which
in<00:00:44.399> turn<00:00:44.640> creates<00:00:45.480> fungus<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.050> disease

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
in turn creates fungus and disease

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.479 
in turn creates fungus and disease
it<00:00:47.250> also<00:00:47.460> gives<00:00:47.820> insects<00:00:48.210> place<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.780> Harbor<00:00:49.489> we

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it also gives insects place to Harbor we

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.889 
it also gives insects place to Harbor we
want<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> pull<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> mulch<00:00:51.270> away<00:00:51.600> from<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
want to pull the mulch away from the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229 
want to pull the mulch away from the
tree<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.250> not<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.520> against<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> flare

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239

tree so it's not up against the flare
stem<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.750> trunk<00:00:55.910> want<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> mimic<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> wild<00:00:57.870> and

stem or trunk want to mimic the wild and
put<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> tree<00:00:58.500> back<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.920> natural<00:00:59.370> setting

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
put the tree back in a natural setting

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.630 
put the tree back in a natural setting
if<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.530> went<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> walk<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> forest

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
if we went for a walk in the forest

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.880 
if we went for a walk in the forest
you'd<00:01:03.329> never<00:01:03.570> see<00:01:03.870> mulch<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.409> turf<00:01:04.589> grass
