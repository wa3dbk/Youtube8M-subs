corrosion inside of the fuel rail you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700 
corrosion inside of the fuel rail you
could<00:00:33.329> clean<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.570> out<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.170> corrosion<00:00:34.469> is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
could clean it out but the corrosion is

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
could clean it out but the corrosion is
going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.950> keep<00:00:35.100> growing<00:00:35.340> later<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.300> that

what<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.399> want<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.239> want<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> remove

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
what I want to do is I want to remove

what I want to do is I want to remove
the<00:00:46.530> factory<00:00:46.739> rubber<00:00:48.230> o-ring<00:00:49.230> seal<00:00:52.399> now<00:00:53.399> it's

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the factory rubber o-ring seal now it's

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.580 
the factory rubber o-ring seal now it's
not<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> good<00:00:53.969> idea<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.570> destroy<00:00:55.050> them<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.410> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
not a good idea to destroy them like I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.160 
not a good idea to destroy them like I
am<00:00:58.579> because<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.609> never<00:00:59.850> know<00:01:00.149> when<00:01:01.050> you're

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
am because you never know when you're

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.139 
am because you never know when you're
going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> need<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.680> again<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.789> I'm<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.000> going

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
going to need it again so I'm just going

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.600 
going to need it again so I'm just going
to<00:01:03.180> take<00:01:03.359> some<00:01:03.390> oil<00:01:03.890> put<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.979> right<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> tip

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
to take some oil put it right on the tip

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940 
to take some oil put it right on the tip
because<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.689> don't<00:01:06.840> want<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.080> damage<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.439> new

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
because we don't want to damage the new

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.830 
because we don't want to damage the new
o-ring<00:01:09.619> if<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.070> want<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:12.180> better<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.689> put

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
o-ring if you want it's better to put

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.990 
o-ring if you want it's better to put
the<00:01:13.110> oil<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.070> part<00:01:14.340> instead<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.790> just

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the oil on the part instead of just

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.399 
the oil on the part instead of just
dipping<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> o-ring<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.960> there

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.240 

so<00:01:26.409> we're<00:01:26.680> going<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:26.829> lube<00:01:27.039> the<00:01:27.070> o-ring<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:30.130> we

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
so we're going to lube the o-ring and we

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.370 
so we're going to lube the o-ring and we
want<00:01:30.460> this<00:01:30.729> remember<00:01:31.420> this<00:01:31.539> little<00:01:31.840> washer<00:01:32.259> we

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
want this remember this little washer we

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.740 
want this remember this little washer we
want<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.619> drop<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:32.829> down<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:34.210> maybe<00:01:34.600> we

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
want to drop that down there maybe we

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.580 
want to drop that down there maybe we
should<00:01:34.930> just<00:01:35.020> place<00:01:35.320> it<00:01:35.350> here<00:01:36.149> to<00:01:37.149> ensure<00:01:37.590> that

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
should just place it here to ensure that

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.950 
should just place it here to ensure that
it's<00:01:38.890> secure<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.579> we're<00:01:40.390> just<00:01:40.570> going<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:40.750> take

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
it's secure and we're just going to take

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.840 
it's secure and we're just going to take
the<00:01:41.110> injector<00:01:44.729> let's<00:01:45.729> eat<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.090> right<00:01:46.270> in<00:01:47.850> I'm

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
the injector let's eat it right in I'm

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.660 
the injector let's eat it right in I'm
going<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.090> place<00:01:49.329> this<00:01:49.539> cap<00:01:49.899> on<00:01:50.140> top<00:01:50.429> this<00:01:51.429> is

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
going to place this cap on top this is

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.429 
going to place this cap on top this is
the<00:01:51.819> secure<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.329> fuel<00:01:52.600> injector<00:01:53.110> on<00:01:55.439> these

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
the secure the fuel injector on these

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.010 
the secure the fuel injector on these
screws<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:57.189> could<00:01:58.000> put<00:01:58.149> some<00:01:58.330> silicone<00:01:58.599> on

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
screws you could put some silicone on

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.139 
screws you could put some silicone on
the<00:01:59.049> threads<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.979> will<00:02:00.520> prevent<00:02:00.849> them<00:02:01.090> from

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
the threads it will prevent them from

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.600 
the threads it will prevent them from
getting<00:02:01.539> corroded<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.429> like<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.819> use<00:02:03.970> oil

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
getting corroded but I like to use oil

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.089 
getting corroded but I like to use oil
see<00:02:06.610> these<00:02:07.450> threads<00:02:07.899> are<00:02:08.080> very<00:02:08.410> likely<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:09.009> get

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
see these threads are very likely to get

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:20.880 
see these threads are very likely to get
corroded

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.430 

so<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:21.950> want<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.250> make<00:02:22.370> sure<00:02:22.580> when<00:02:22.850> you're

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
so you want to make sure when you're

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.480 
so you want to make sure when you're
tightening<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.800> cap

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
tightening this cap

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:32.440 
tightening this cap
they're<00:02:26.480> turning<00:02:26.720> inside<00:02:27.610> evenly<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.330> an

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
they're turning inside evenly this is an

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.199 
they're turning inside evenly this is an
effort<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.870> bring<00:02:32.990> the<00:02:33.500> injector<00:02:34.209> evenly

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
effort to bring the injector evenly

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:53.259 
effort to bring the injector evenly
seated<00:02:35.690> inside<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.319> its<00:02:36.500> rail<00:02:52.030> let's<00:02:53.030> take

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
seated inside of its rail let's take

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.310 
seated inside of its rail let's take
another<00:02:53.390> look<00:02:53.769> at<00:02:54.769> what<00:02:55.010> really<00:02:55.310> going<00:02:55.880> on

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
another look at what really going on

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.280 
another look at what really going on
let's<00:02:57.320> take<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> lot<00:02:57.769> of<00:02:57.800> look<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.780> before<00:03:00.140> we

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
let's take a lot of look so before we

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.870 
let's take a lot of look so before we
can<00:03:00.410> replace<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.950> injector<00:03:01.070> we<00:03:01.519> want<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.760> make

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
can replace the injector we want to make

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.690 
can replace the injector we want to make
sure<00:03:02.030> we<00:03:02.209> check<00:03:02.510> our<00:03:02.840> marking<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:04.310> we<00:03:04.459> place

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
sure we check our marking that we place

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.550 
sure we check our marking that we place
before<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:06.410> place<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.980> injector<00:03:07.519> in<00:03:08.560> the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
before and place the injector in the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.170 
before and place the injector in the
correct<00:03:10.030> part<00:03:11.030> for<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.300> rail<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:11.870> we<00:03:12.050> have<00:03:12.260> our

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180
