00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.750
 welcome and once again 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.570
 I welcome you to 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.050
 an info view and the bronze in 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:21.369
 form we never come directly to the in 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.829
 game values ​​money is 17 years old 174 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.930
 big as 63 pounds comes from gambia 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.390
 strong foot right work in attack 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.750
 ears the defensive with a weak foot 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.160
 two stars special movement three stars 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.870
 if we now equal to the physical 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.210
 one will come to attributes as well 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.989
 directly see what 's up there 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.609
 ultimately so distinguished 94 starts 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:49.390
 agility 79 balance 82 bounce 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:51.309
 78 and sprint speed 93 though 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.429
 you want to grab it by the word 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.679
 manni is an absolute pace search the 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.399
 mental attributes with 54 aggressiveness 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:02.350
 See 56 position play and 52 overview 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.519
 not so bad when bronze 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.980
 players still have to be played 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.520
 Consider Calcutta or Calcutta 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.780
 manet is a bronze player 71 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.110
 dribbling 71 graduation 70 shots 71 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.970
 eleven meters 84 shot power and a volley 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.250
 worth of 69 rank at the 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.710
 skills attributes no that's all 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.439
 leaves a really solid 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.640
 impression but how performance 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.500
 Ultimately money in the place and 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.130
 that's what I want to show you because 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.159
 money is an absolute beast i have 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.530
 two of them play in relatively few 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.240
 so many scenes are collected 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.009
 also see who go next because 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.509
 in the end it would be pretty bold 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.939
 if I just showed how 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.609
 many gates he shoots or what he does 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.759
 shoots because his shot you have to completely 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:54.820
 to say clearly can be dangerous 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.609
 but he is just 16 in 16 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.159
 or if only in the 16s 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:03.100
 otherwise the sea ​​are so larifari 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.469
 shots that go on the gate times 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.570
 go next to it so you already noticed 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.369
 shot is the finishing value of something 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.470
 low but the firepower is 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.710
 perfectly fine but what draws 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.600
 manie is very competitive 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.730
 Shit money is fast 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.260
 rapidly with distance one of the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.140
 the fastest player I believe 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.240
 so far completely fifa 14 ultimate team gives 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.610
 when the guy starts to sprint 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.990
 there is no one is growing behind 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.840
 no land there is no grass growing 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.940
 nothing at all is also over and over 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.980
 and that ultimately makes him one 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.480
 also very competitive 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.310
 because in many situations yes how should 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.050
 To say that is not to be said 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.240
 Combat because he is just too fast 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.650
 just run away and normally 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.020
 you just have to hit high balls on it 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.820
 play and in the high balls by 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.520
 that a jumping value is also relatively high 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.960
 is somehow bock to jump 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.150
 the one with the breast to accept or 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.410
 somehow different and is then at the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.150
 defend past because they stop 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.660
 decelerate and then stands out of the gate 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.760
 but two stars is weak foot but 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.530
 in my opinion, they make possible 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.250
 much better than for example in the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.440
 Fund melandri and would therefore say that 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.460
 3 star weak foot he gets there 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.060
 it feels like 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:25.040
 So really money for the price 200k 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.750
 on the pc 150 on the ps3 xbox 360 130 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.690
 km so that's pretty neat 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.210
 Of course, the league and all that is 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.020
 to do that is not quite perfect 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.460
 me my gambia out of mls me good me 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.810
 was relatively good team they built 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.730
 you can be glad it's the left 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.650
 midfielder gives the bar 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.520
 or as it is called also comes from Gambia 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.200
 then it works but otherwise never take 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.760
 The guy got me completely out of the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.850
 Do not have socks carved with it 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.170
 and the 92 tempo I can give you 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.730
 say the guy is running faster than that 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.500
 lavezzi in shape and various others 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.380
 player in my opinion really 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.120
 one of the fastest cards in there 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.470
 fifa 14 gives if not even the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.480
 The fastest one is the man of the bolt 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.730
 his own player and presses the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.620
 then absolutely pure grass we come to 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.720
 conclusion as you already said on the wheel 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.660
 per page exaggerated entrance plus 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.270
 extremely fast pace, very fast 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.520
 Change of direction, I think the more 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.650
 better if you look at him in chemistry sniper 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.750
 are pressing the committee defends and 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.430
 dribble worth up in the penalty room a lot 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.260
 pleasant shots you have to do it completely 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.510
 leave completely in left with 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.680
 regulatory bottlenecks average the 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.120
 barking but again 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.460
 very cool but that is unfortunately included 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.350
 so easy to play for any player 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.240
 because the type is simply ultrafast 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.009
 and decent dribbling too 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.169
 dribbling three stars tricks movie industry 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.150
 player it is perfectly alright 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.289
 So I myself do not dream anymore 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.039
 to demand I am fully 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.639
 satisfied 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:50.870
 I really have to say that 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.729
 if we now come to the opposite side 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.460
 this time we're lucky she falls 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.470
 not as big as Landau II 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.180
 there is head over there is weak 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.440
 that's right jumping is worth in 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.060
 okay but I do not think so 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.280
 a header made with him except 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.169
 any rebound it likes 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.090
 Two stars weak on football leaves 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.240
 I argue about it, I think it's ok and 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.710
 nation plus league difficult to use though 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.259
 Nevertheless, he gets his thumb up 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.509
 quite up to my opinion 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.280
 after conclusion, four stars value for money 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.199
 two and a half stars and receives the 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.720
 rating of 8.4 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.940
 why 8.4 why not if I am so 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.229
 doll hard of them 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.639
 it's really just that, after all 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.660
 pace which makes them outstanding 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.880
 shoot well is alright and everything 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.880
 others are okay too but he is like that 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.620
 enormously strong by his pace and that is 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.270
 relatively cool because it is really fun with 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.180
 to play him and just to watch 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.800
 no player comes after him 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.139
 Accordingly, 84 is my opinion 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.190
 after attached and bronze player if 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.510
 you only play bronze now 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.490
 one could consider that 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.900
 rating maybe a bit higher 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.240
 but in the end i have to play all players 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.900
 put into proportion around there is 84 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.550
 very well served and what can you 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.159
 otherwise to make matters actually say 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.870
 nothing like four stars said two 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:07.250
 stars value for money film industry 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.860
 players already very expensive 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.729
 but that was it from my side up 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.720
 next time 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.720
 tap
