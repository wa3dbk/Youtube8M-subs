00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.950
 since so many vegetarian people 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.169
 the races follow me 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.879
 I decided to dedicate the next one to them 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:17.850
 videoricetta I decided to prepare the 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.460
 totally vegan chocolate cupcakes 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.590
 they are delicious and very soft and nobody 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.540
 would bet that they are not there 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.540
 ingredients of animal origin 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.650
 let's start sifting some flour immediately 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.220
 double zero all the doses you will find them 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.500
 at the end of the video as we always go 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.650
 then add sugar 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.650
 granulated 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.130
 if we also make bitter cocoa 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.710
 we make all the dry ingredients in 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.130
 so if we don't create lumps we combine 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.800
 half a teaspoon of salt that will exalt 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.739
 all the flavors and a teaspoon of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.340
 bicarbonate or half sachet of 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.340
 baking powder 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.630
 now that we have put all the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:15.080
 dry ingredients together we mix them 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.080
 therefore we can pour water 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:28.000
 a teaspoon of white vinegar and in 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.520
 last in the oil and use of the oil of 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.069
 olive not extra virgin because it would be 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.399
 too strong would cover the 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.289
 delicate flavor of the sacred 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.069
 we mix everything together until 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:46.929
 obtain a very smooth consistency 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:48.939
 creamy like this then we take gods 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.939
 in this case, the paper cups 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.130
 used silicone if you have them of others 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.259
 materials remind you to induce them and 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.560
 flour them and fill up to three there 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.860
 fourth of their capacity we set there 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.009
 then in a preheated oven at 180 degrees 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.140
 for about 20 minutes 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.500
 then we prepare the icing we go to 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.940
 add to vegetable margarine 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.540
 of icing sugar and let's start a 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.099
 work the ingredients together 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.260
 you can of course use the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.620
 planetary as in my case or the 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.840
 electric whips or work by hand if 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.510
 use the kneading machine but remember 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.319
 to go and collect the ingredients 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.069
 that could settle on the sides 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.069
 we continue to work 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.250
 then we add bitter cocoa because 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.250
 the sugar dose is already sufficient 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.290
 let's combine about two points 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.030
 milk if you want to make them vegetarian 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.730
 you can use cow's milk 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.760
 otherwise you can use milk from 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.850
 almond or rice or soy what 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.270
 the more you like it 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.819
 we continue to work everything so that 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.880
 cocoa sugar is absorbed 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.760
 from the butter until you get one 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.370
 creamy consistency like this before 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.769
 icing ri cupcake and advise you to do 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.800
 rest the cream for about 10 15 minutes 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:30.160
 in the fridge if not 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.290
 very liquid let it cool though 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.420
 completely the cupcakes otherwise the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.400
 glaze will melt in contact with the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.380
 hot cupcake you can frost rli thanks 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.180
 to the help of a sac Ã  poche as I have 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.739
 I made it 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.340
 try to taste them because they are 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.569
 really yummy very very soft 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:56.579
 so now let's see all the ingredients 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.579
 these are for the base 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.480
 these instead are for the icing I hope 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.959
 you liked the recipe there 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.959
 see you next time
