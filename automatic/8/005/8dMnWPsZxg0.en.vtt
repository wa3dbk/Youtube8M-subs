to the small wire on the starter of the
cold<00:00:30.929> wire<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> call<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.769> not<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
cold wire I like to call it not the

thick one a small one
it's<00:00:35.219> an<00:00:35.399> eight<00:00:35.579> mil<00:00:35.820> nut<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.450> can't<00:00:36.660> miss

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
it's an eight mil nut so you can't miss

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
it's an eight mil nut so you can't miss
it<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> second<00:00:38.730> wire<00:00:38.910> goes<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.480> fuse

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
it and the second wire goes to a fuse

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.810 
it and the second wire goes to a fuse
preferably<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.160> comes<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
preferably one that comes on with the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.590 
preferably one that comes on with the
key<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.870> don't<00:00:43.020> drain<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> battery<00:00:44.600> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
key so you don't drain the battery and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.660 
key so you don't drain the battery and
let's<00:00:46.410> say<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.680> push<00:00:47.129> starter<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:48.450> simple

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
let's say you push starter very simple

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.779 
let's say you push starter very simple
then<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:52.340> turn<00:00:53.340> your<00:00:53.550> key

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
then all you have to do is turn your key

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.439 
then all you have to do is turn your key
on<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:56.250> also<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.730> run<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> fuel<00:00:57.180> pump

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
on and also you can run the fuel pump

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.049 
on and also you can run the fuel pump
and<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.170> accessories<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.219> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and the accessories and all that and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.820 
and the accessories and all that and
then<00:01:00.510> push<00:01:00.750> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 

and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.550> only<00:01:05.880> difference<00:01:05.970> between

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
and then the only difference between

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.400 
and then the only difference between
this<00:01:06.870> and<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.850> is<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.690> fact<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.050> it's<00:01:10.260> kind

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
this and this is the fact that it's kind

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.270 
this and this is the fact that it's kind
of<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.740> spring-loaded<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:12.210> don't<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
of it's spring-loaded you don't have to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.530 
of it's spring-loaded you don't have to
like<00:01:14.280> hold<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.640> up<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.940> then<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.180> soon<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.390> it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
like hold it up and then as soon as it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.070 
like hold it up and then as soon as it
starts<00:01:15.870> pushing<00:01:16.110> down<00:01:17.600> it's<00:01:18.600> all

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
starts pushing down it's all

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630 
starts pushing down it's all
spring-loaded<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.070> press<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.460> like

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
spring-loaded so you just press it like

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.950 
spring-loaded so you just press it like
any<00:01:20.820> other<00:01:21.030> button<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:24.660> if<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.810> press

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
any other button and then if you press

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.940 
any other button and then if you press
it<00:01:25.050> again<00:01:25.550> to<00:01:26.550> grind<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.940> starter<00:01:27.950> which

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
it again to grind the starter which

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.330 
it again to grind the starter which
isn't<00:01:29.100> good<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:30.510> this<00:01:31.320> neutral<00:01:32.100> safety

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
isn't good and this neutral safety

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.260 
isn't good and this neutral safety
switch<00:01:32.790> once<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.150> demonstrated<00:01:35.030> which<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.180> I

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
switch once I demonstrated which if I

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.000 
switch once I demonstrated which if I
play<00:01:36.480> around<00:01:36.600> with<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.320> screws<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.770> my

underground for cruise control I'll

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.140 
underground for cruise control I'll
explain<00:01:55.020> once<00:01:55.260> again<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:56.580> reason<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.940> have

since I put in a standard ax 15
standards<00:02:13.470> don't<00:02:13.590> even<00:02:13.830> come<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.040> these

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
standards don't even come with these

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.430 
standards don't even come with these
switches<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:14.970> have<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.239> have<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.260> work<00:02:16.410> with

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
switches so I have to have to work with

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.100 
switches so I have to have to work with
it<00:02:16.739> make<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:16.950> work<00:02:17.190> now<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.209> can<00:02:18.600> either<00:02:18.690> have<00:02:18.930> it

it make it work now I can either have it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.990 
it make it work now I can either have it
always<00:02:19.290> grounded<00:02:19.950> which<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.310> easy<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.760> do<00:02:20.970> just

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
always grounded which is easy to do just

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.110 
always grounded which is easy to do just
run<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> wire<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> piece<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.410> metal<00:02:22.970> then<00:02:23.970> it

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
run a wire to a piece of metal then it

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.340 
run a wire to a piece of metal then it
starts<00:02:24.390> every<00:02:24.600> tired<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.080> kind<00:02:25.260> of

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
starts every tired but you kind of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.720 
starts every tired but you kind of
cruise<00:02:25.590> control<00:02:25.950> because<00:02:26.130> it's<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:26.400> park<00:02:26.640> or

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
cruise control because it's in park or

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.370 
cruise control because it's in park or
neutral<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.640> I'm<00:02:30.239> grounded<00:02:30.750> believe<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.230> in

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
neutral so I'm grounded believe it's in

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.890 
neutral so I'm grounded believe it's in
the<00:02:31.470> other<00:02:31.590> gears<00:02:32.300> then<00:02:33.300> of<00:02:33.420> my<00:02:33.510> vehicle<00:02:33.810> won't

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
the other gears then of my vehicle won't

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.470 
the other gears then of my vehicle won't
start<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.530> what<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.130> hell<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.550> figured<00:02:36.360> I'd

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
start so what the hell I figured I'd

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.720 
start so what the hell I figured I'd
have<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.660> switch<00:02:36.980> which<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.130> good<00:02:38.370> because<00:02:38.520> if

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
have a switch which is good because if

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.400 
have a switch which is good because if
it's<00:02:38.850> ungrounded<00:02:41.750> vehicle<00:02:42.750> won't<00:02:42.840> start<00:02:43.200> cuz

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
it's ungrounded vehicle won't start cuz

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.060 
it's ungrounded vehicle won't start cuz
it<00:02:43.530> thinks<00:02:43.770> it's<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.040> Drive<00:02:44.310> or<00:02:44.970> gear<00:02:45.890> but<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:46.980> I

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
it thinks it's in Drive or gear but if I

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.970 
it thinks it's in Drive or gear but if I
have<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.220> grounded<00:02:48.350> vehicle<00:02:49.350> will<00:02:49.470> start<00:02:49.739> which

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
have a grounded vehicle will start which

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.740 
have a grounded vehicle will start which
I'm<00:02:50.100> not<00:02:50.220> gonna<00:02:50.370> piss<00:02:50.610> around<00:02:50.760> with<00:02:51.120> show<00:02:51.690> you

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750

that was good but cool thing with this

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.009 
that was good but cool thing with this

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
you won't be able to start it with the

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.860 
you won't be able to start it with the
