the hair
and<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:52.990> I<00:03:53.050> use<00:03:53.080> our<00:03:53.440> date<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:53.950> I'm<00:03:54.340> gonna

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
and that I use our date so I'm gonna

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.570 
and that I use our date so I'm gonna
figured<00:03:54.940> out<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.360> it's<00:03:55.840> not<00:03:55.960> gonna<00:03:56.350> be<00:03:56.650> more

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
figured out that it's not gonna be more

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.120 
figured out that it's not gonna be more
color<00:03:58.120> compared<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:59.110> one<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.830> less

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
color compared to the one that is less

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.250 
color compared to the one that is less
hair<00:04:00.520> strands<00:04:00.880> open<00:04:01.270> it<00:04:01.390> up<00:04:01.540> and<00:04:01.750> see<00:04:01.960> the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
hair strands open it up and see the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.860 
hair strands open it up and see the
results<00:04:02.890> is<00:04:03.100> not<00:04:03.180> completely<00:04:04.180> colored<00:04:04.630> all

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
results is not completely colored all

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.990 
results is not completely colored all
the<00:04:05.020> way<00:04:05.140> but<00:04:05.500> if<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:06.010> want<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.340> apply<00:04:06.640> more

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
the way but if you want to apply more

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.660 
the way but if you want to apply more
color<00:04:07.270> you<00:04:07.360> can<00:04:07.660> we<00:04:08.020> wrap<00:04:08.260> again<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:09.190> wait<00:04:09.640> a

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
color you can we wrap again and wait a

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.640 
color you can we wrap again and wait a
minute<00:04:09.760> 20<00:04:10.180> minutes<00:04:10.450> it's<00:04:10.720> inside<00:04:11.050> this<00:04:11.350> side

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
minute 20 minutes it's inside this side

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.710 
minute 20 minutes it's inside this side
has<00:04:11.890> more<00:04:12.130> color<00:04:12.430> than<00:04:12.700> this<00:04:12.970> side<00:04:13.240> because

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
has more color than this side because

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.500 
has more color than this side because
this<00:04:14.110> time<00:04:14.350> I<00:04:14.620> tend<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.040> use<00:04:15.190> thinner<00:04:16.000> strands

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
this time I tend to use thinner strands

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.380 
this time I tend to use thinner strands
than<00:04:17.109> this<00:04:17.680> side<00:04:17.950> but<00:04:18.340> um<00:04:18.519> it's<00:04:18.820> okay<00:04:19.060> looks
