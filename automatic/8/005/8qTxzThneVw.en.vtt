great<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.550> willow<00:01:35.940> pretty<00:01:36.660> good<00:01:36.840> grain<00:01:37.080> there

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
great one willow pretty good grain there

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.810 
great one willow pretty good grain there
as<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:40.160> good<00:01:41.160> craftsmanship

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
as you can see good craftsmanship

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.050 
as you can see good craftsmanship
meaning<00:01:42.510> that<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.590> bat<00:01:43.950> despite<00:01:44.760> having

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
meaning that this bat despite having

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.100 
meaning that this bat despite having
huge<00:01:45.770> edges<00:01:46.770> they're<00:01:47.210> quite<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> bit<00:01:48.450> profile

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
huge edges they're quite a bit profile

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.710 
huge edges they're quite a bit profile
still<00:01:50.010> picks<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:50.520> quite<00:01:50.970> light<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.450> nice

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
still picks up quite light and nice

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.330 
still picks up quite light and nice
picks<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.140> picks<00:01:52.410> up<00:01:52.560> Moss<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:52.920> right<00:01:53.070> so

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
picks up picks up Moss all right so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.850 
picks up picks up Moss all right so
these<00:01:53.940> have<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> general<00:01:55.020> weight<00:01:55.530> range

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
these have a general weight range

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.060 
these have a general weight range
probably<00:01:56.580> range<00:01:57.330> between<00:01:57.630> time<00:01:58.230> so<00:01:58.410> -<00:01:58.470> right<00:01:58.830> -

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
probably range between time so - right -

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.170 
probably range between time so - right -
t<00:01:59.390> no<00:02:00.390> doubt<00:02:00.740> this<00:02:01.740> will<00:02:01.920> pin<00:02:02.220> very<00:02:02.460> nicely<00:02:02.790> as

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
t no doubt this will pin very nicely as

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.370 
t no doubt this will pin very nicely as
well

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.190 

pretty<00:02:09.580> normal<00:02:10.580> middle<00:02:11.240> around<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.780> middle<00:02:12.080> I

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
pretty normal middle around the middle I

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.640 
pretty normal middle around the middle I
wouldn't<00:02:12.800> say<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.010> it's<00:02:13.400> too<00:02:13.640> low<00:02:13.850> or<00:02:14.090> high

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
wouldn't say that it's too low or high

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.230 
wouldn't say that it's too low or high
probably<00:02:15.650> suit<00:02:15.980> Australian<00:02:16.550> conditions

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
probably suit Australian conditions

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.690 
probably suit Australian conditions
pretty<00:02:17.540> nicely<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.320> I<00:02:18.500> think<00:02:19.340> that's<00:02:19.520> just
