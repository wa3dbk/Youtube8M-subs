00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.660 

so<00:02:43.200> if<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.440> use<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.830> one<00:02:44.010> ear<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
so if I use this one ear so this is the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.729 
so if I use this one ear so this is the
top<00:02:44.970> sort<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.240> top<00:02:45.420> gear<00:02:45.600> one<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:45.989> if<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.260> some

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
top sort of top gear one so if you some

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.400 
top sort of top gear one so if you some
sort<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.950> car<00:02:47.190> enthusiasts<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:49.110> can<00:02:49.260> actually

sort of car enthusiasts you can actually

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.740 
sort of car enthusiasts you can actually
get<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:49.890> for<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:51.270> we<00:02:51.360> go<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:51.720> just

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
get this for it here we go so just

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.740 
get this for it here we go so just
literally<00:02:52.380> insert<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.190> there<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.750> that

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
literally insert that in there and that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.040 
literally insert that in there and that
pins<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.350> their<00:02:56.300> largest<00:02:57.300> perfectly<00:02:57.750> as<00:02:57.870> well

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
pins in their largest perfectly as well

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.199 
pins in their largest perfectly as well
so<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.950> might<00:02:59.100> have<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.250> just<00:02:59.550> align<00:03:00.030> it

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
so you might have to just align it

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.240 
so you might have to just align it
properly<00:03:00.540> before<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.020> do<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.470> for<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.709> just<00:03:01.950> do

this there we go and press it in you get
that<00:03:06.720> clicking<00:03:07.280> feedback<00:03:08.280> as<00:03:08.459> well<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.760> let

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
that clicking feedback as well to let

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.070 
that clicking feedback as well to let
you<00:03:08.970> know<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.209> it's<00:03:09.270> fully<00:03:09.450> kicked<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.900> and

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
you know that it's fully kicked in and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.070 
you know that it's fully kicked in and
then<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:10.770> just<00:03:10.890> pop<00:03:11.100> your<00:03:11.130> iphone<00:03:11.580> 5<00:03:12.080> back
