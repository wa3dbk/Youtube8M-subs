printing<00:00:02.399> an<00:00:02.520> AutoCAD<00:00:02.970> is<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.210> bit<00:00:03.449> more

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
printing an AutoCAD is a bit more

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.390 
printing an AutoCAD is a bit more
complicated<00:00:03.990> than<00:00:04.470> your<00:00:04.650> average<00:00:04.830> Windows

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
complicated than your average Windows

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.330 
complicated than your average Windows
program<00:00:05.899> this<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.049> because<00:00:07.350> AutoCAD<00:00:07.859> places

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
program this is because AutoCAD places

you're<00:00:13.679> usually<00:00:13.889> going<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.700> letter<00:00:15.000> legal

print to a much wider range paper sizes
you're<00:00:22.830> also<00:00:23.130> concerned<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.670> line<00:00:23.970> weights

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
you're also concerned with line weights

you don't have to deal with in a typical
word-processed<00:00:29.460> document<00:00:32.540> AutoCAD<00:00:33.540> uses

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
word-processed document AutoCAD uses

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.560 
word-processed document AutoCAD uses
what<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.260> called<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.860> layout<00:00:35.130> view<00:00:35.610> from<00:00:36.390> which

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
what is called a layout view from which

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.229 
what is called a layout view from which
you<00:00:36.809> would<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.410> your<00:00:37.620> plotting<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.059> get

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
you would do your plotting you can get

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.970 
you would do your plotting you can get
to<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> layout<00:00:39.629> view<00:00:39.989> by<00:00:40.170> clicking<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.590> layout

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
to a layout view by clicking the layout

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.630 
to a layout view by clicking the layout
one<00:00:41.280> tool<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.120> status<00:00:42.480> bar<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.460> can<00:00:44.460> also

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
one tool in the status bar you can also

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.549 
one tool in the status bar you can also
use<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.149> quick<00:00:45.329> view<00:00:45.600> layout<00:00:45.930> tool<00:00:46.200> which

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
use the quick view layout tool which

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.779 
use the quick view layout tool which
gives<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> preview<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.730> your<00:00:47.760> layout<00:00:48.180> views

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
gives you a preview of your layout views

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.920 
gives you a preview of your layout views
AutoCAD<00:00:50.789> lets<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.270> several<00:00:51.660> layout

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
AutoCAD lets you have several layout

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.500 
AutoCAD lets you have several layout
views<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.160> set<00:00:53.340> up<00:00:53.370> multiple<00:00:53.520> ways<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
views so you can set up multiple ways to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.310 
views so you can set up multiple ways to
print<00:00:54.660> your<00:00:54.809> drawing<00:00:56.690> by<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.750> way

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
print your drawing by the way

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.799 
print your drawing by the way
AutoCAD<00:00:58.890> refers<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.280> printing<00:00:59.879> as<00:01:00.090> plotting

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
AutoCAD refers to printing as plotting

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.189 
AutoCAD refers to printing as plotting
so<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.949> say<00:01:02.190> plot<00:01:02.579> your<00:01:02.789> drawing<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.989> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
so if I say plot your drawing that is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.130 
so if I say plot your drawing that is
the<00:01:04.290> same<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.710> saying<00:01:04.890> print<00:01:05.309> your<00:01:05.460> drawing

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
the same as saying print your drawing

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.539 
the same as saying print your drawing
when<00:01:07.140> you're<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.470> layout<00:01:07.680> view<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.340> see

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
when you're in a layout view you see

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.250 
when you're in a layout view you see
your<00:01:08.760> drawing<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.540> will<00:01:09.659> appear<00:01:10.020> in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
your drawing as it will appear in

printed form before you print your
drawing<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.590> need<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> little<00:01:14.250> setup

let's<00:01:16.409> take<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> look<00:01:16.950> at<00:01:17.100> how<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.280> might<00:01:17.580> print

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
let's take a look at how you might print

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.820 
let's take a look at how you might print
