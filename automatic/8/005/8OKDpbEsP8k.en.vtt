00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 fifa with will be able cheap and fast and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.390
 in that description very good to all 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.770
 and welcome to my channel welcome to 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.510
 a new video and how he delivered a new 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.160
 cheap team this time a team that you 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.200
 you will be able to do it by simply 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.519
 about 7000 coins and I assure you that the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.170
 performance that will give the team in 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.150
 comparison to the coins that is worth 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.130
 today they are very very few will be 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.930
 impressive but always before 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.400
 jealousy the team is supported with likes and 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.779
 you support with I like it so what 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.029
 I really appreciate it and if we can get there 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.619
 at 100 likes it would be great so 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.119
 let's start as always below 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.420
 for the middle goal I have both already 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.680
 in its version 80 I always half 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.760
 I put the truth that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.040
 I think he's the best goalie in the league 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.829
 Spanish but this one that went very well 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.390
 I liked what I tried and I liked the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.730
 What I think is an alternative series to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.320
 squares plus it's cheaper so 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.820
 I recommend it one hundred percent 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.489
 if you have more coins then with that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.469
 I like it more but I'm sure 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.730
 that will give you a great level 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.500
 then in the area and we have the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.750
 left to bernat and to the right of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 two quite fast laterals that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.079
 they defend quite well physically 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.399
 they are also quite good and that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.630
 incorporate quite well to the attack on 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.940
 all bernat 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.410
 / go down I still like it a lot 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.690
 plants have flavor I think 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.580
 they are two of the best gold centers 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.820
 not bright they are íñigo martínez and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.770
 borgetti the two are pretty fast 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.450
 physically both are very well on 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 all íñigo martínez and in the subject 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.140
 defensive ones that come out like I say 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.000
 I think they are one of the best 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 gold centers not bright for not 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.420
 say the two best 9,000 hundreds of 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.550
 effective we have starting with the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.460
 left to borja valero is a game that 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.400
 gives a lot of balance to the whole field 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.869
 to the whole team sorry and I like it a lot 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.369
 in all aspects even 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.840
 defensively 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.170
 maybe physically he's missing a bit of 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.909
 force but you 'll talk about that with the rest of 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.800
 things that the rsc also does the physical 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.600
 it's not a problem about everything that 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.150
 like it is the long pass that has 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 has a great long pass at the time of 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.470
 make game changes has managed to make 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.290
 a pass to the forward or something to the media 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.360
 offensive the long mostly comes off in 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.009
 short, it's easier not to fail 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.229
 any player could not fail in 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.300
 short but long much more difficult 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.340
 of frames fails very little in the pass of 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.780
 long and then on the right we have a 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.030
 player a little different one player more 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.200
 defensive that is riding and that is not 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.390
 uses a lot and the truth is that it has 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.790
 liked quite as you see has 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.489
 statistics in all above 70 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.080
 the except the rhythm that 70 is a player 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.060
 that has a good shot is turn and has 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.380
 a good shot and then defensively something 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.330
 which is very good in a strong color 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.820
 high and had no problem the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.680
 truth is that by discard price 650 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.000
 seven hundred coins you have here a 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.560
 player that will join you opening in 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.120
 defense and it will also work for us 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.830
 well the message then the midfielder 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.200
 offensive we have 3 started 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.850
 from the center that he saved a player that 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.950
 I used to use 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.480
 midfielder defensive midfielder and 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.240
 gradually he has gone up slightly 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.710
 position and defensive gets out because 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.880
 you can defend well with him now is 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.380
 time to recover balls in the field 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.060
 and that has gone a long way 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.410
 cons but is that the resources that 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.230
 has even the shot that has inside 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.060
 of the area is an asshole and now it's 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.490
 we've liked a lot more combat in how 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.500
 defend after 1,102 men if you a 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.210
 little more for bands is worth if it opens a little 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.890
 more extreme bands are almost say 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.020
 we have on the left the iago blades 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.310
 because I had tried before 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.560
 there was probable ahead and the age that 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.720
 in front I did not like it a little more though 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.610
 of my offensive center does not just 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.780
 Like the time I think that for 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.459
 buoys it's worth it's pretty good 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.680
 but as he said of forward I liked it better 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.150
 and then on the right we have the palace 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.280
 a player than in any politician who 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.690
 I put it always I just like it well 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.130
 the statistics that are very very 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.890
 impressive is the player who is worth 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.810
 only about six hundred coins is a 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.340
 fast game with a good shot even 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.800
 he has a good pass and that his position 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.510
 original is forward and as I say the one of 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.700
 The forward is a beast but in my 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.680
 profession I also liked a lot and 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.600
 then up front we have Carlos 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.870
 bacca 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.970
 a player who has industries of 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.550
 dribble has bad leg letters and for 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.920
 that does not end I had not just tested 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.540
 so far and when I tried it I said 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.600
 thank goodness I decided to try it 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.860
 because it's a fucking machine this guy does not 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.770
 I have tried many league forward 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.450
 Spanish but this one I think Suarez is 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.040
 the only thing that can overtake him or some 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.320
 but it is that for here I assure you that 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.590
 is a fool is fast I think your 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.030
 rhythm is around 85 86 even his 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.489
 shot is a sure bet that inside 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.140
 of the area you will not fail anything with this 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.940
 uncle even with the left leg that 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.590
 says he has not got you bullet leg but he's 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.910
 that I have done everything with my leg 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.070
 left to try it and I have not had 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.930
 problem even marks more than one goal with 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.080
 the left leg a burrada the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.030
 player in addition then he has 69 physical 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.300
 sorry the rooster that you can think that 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.060
 maybe because it's 60 and 95 is a gray color 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.820
 but for it has 78 strength I think that 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.980
 it's even a little over 181 but it's not 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.870
 sure that in the field he fights a lot 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.120
 the balls and win many balls 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.430
 struggling only with the body of 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.380
 done at the end of the video 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.180
 how many goals have I put on purpose 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.460
 Bayernn goals in which it looks like fight 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.870
 with the center and always ends up winning and 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.310
 Take off watching for speed and finish 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.080
 defining super well inside the area 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.610
 as I say goes with a player that if not 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.500
 you have tried is not only technical but 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.430
 any other try it because it's going to 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.080
 love you I assure you 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.790
 so nothing now I'm going to leave you some 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.940
 how many goals for a little music 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.680
 the song laments in the description that 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.030
 I always see it as a question 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.380
 also put in the team of fut that 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.940
 in case you want to take a look and it 's 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.350
 my mind on my twitter in case you want me 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:25.660
 continue to assign ticos as you are always 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.660
 in the next video until soon 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.380
 now 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.110
 yes 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.860
 what good 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.560
 they do not want to kill me the studies 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.410
 yes
