00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
head's just like yeah 5 p.m. and then

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.139 
head's just like yeah 5 p.m. and then
unfortunately<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.100> over<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.030> other

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
unfortunately if you are over the other

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.100 
unfortunately if you are over the other
side<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> globe<00:01:51.600> where<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.899> hot<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
side of the globe where it's hot and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.620 
side of the globe where it's hot and
sunny<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.560> Australia<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:54.329> that's<00:01:54.509> about

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
sunny in Australia I think that's about

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.080 
sunny in Australia I think that's about
10<00:01:55.020> oh<00:01:55.229> maybe<00:01:55.920> even<00:01:56.130> 11<00:01:56.250> hours<00:01:56.610> ahead<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:56.909> I

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
10 oh maybe even 11 hours ahead so I

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.389 
10 oh maybe even 11 hours ahead so I
think<00:01:57.180> it's<00:01:57.390> probably<00:01:57.920> quite<00:01:58.920> early<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
think it's probably quite early in the

think it's probably quite early in the
morning<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.790> em<00:02:00.000> maybe<00:02:00.329> three<00:02:00.630> am<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.840> don't
