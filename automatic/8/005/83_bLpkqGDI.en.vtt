00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.120
 hello people ii sees neither mgt form and 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.310
 this video is about the one 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.660
 left usb 2.0 hub and that the model 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.240
 the uw h 7 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.559
 this is not a piece of normal usb 2 0 off 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.879
 because we have the special here 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.759
 function that we have about these two 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.500
 black connectors smartphones tablets 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.119
 etc can charge even if the pc 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.929
 off is accordingly 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.509
 In any case, a really interesting 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.300
 but look at us first 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.289
 we have given everything so here 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.580
 Let's have a look at the packaging 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.560
 back to there we have a lot already 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.999
 even a few informative things to 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.439
 For example, we connect the device 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.809
 have the computer or the laptop here 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.739
 there it was then via usb and 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.390
 then we can do it like one 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.699
 normal usb hub stop external 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.020
 hard disk printers digital cameras but 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.850
 also mobile phones etc 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.250
 then everything has something over 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.050
 USB connection has here once 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.850
 small product description what the device 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.410
 I could do that too 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.170
 explain because we have like you 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.820
 you may already have seen five 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.590
 normal usb connections and then here 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.390
 again two black in the reason 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.940
 taken all these are just usb 2.0 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.429
 connections but these two right 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.259
 here are built that is if the pc 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.520
 turned off, the devices get the 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.590
 There are connected via the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.270
 supplied power supply her in it anyway 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.070
 still voltage and current accordingly 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.840
 Can we recharge without us 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.579
 large what must move with power supply 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.110
 So that's definitely what I think 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.520
 solved very elegantly I have the same 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.290
 already play here 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.150
 As you can see , I also have each one directly 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.860
 times connected by that will be more likely 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.090
 charged when the pc is off 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.009
 then this little one cuts too 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.479
 Led on green is definitely one 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.399
 Cool thing I can only recommend 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.840
 all the device costs just under 20 euros 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.320
 or less, even I know it 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.570
 not exactly 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.700
 so in any case a great part 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.079
 but we look at ourselves now for the first time at 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.180
 what we get delivered everything 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.549
 and when we put the packaging on 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.200
 On the one hand we have the device on 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.719
 with the usb cable that hides 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.920
 underneath and in the power supply and then here 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.790
 even his little one click 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.350
 installation guide 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.030
 however, it should not be too hard 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.009
 its a usb hub to connect therefore 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.020
 I think that we leave it aside 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.259
 Just focus on the device 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.360
 itself and here one gets that too 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.610
 already in front of us one sees directly that 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.869
 shines pretty much now i'm personal 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.000
 not even the friend of claudia 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.180
 However, this is a device what optics 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.350
 you touch her relatively little 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.830
 Accordingly, if that is now 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.990
 but on mice 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.950
 Cures or game consoles are like not 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.360
 not really the fan of 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.520
 Weimann unfortunately has fingerprint and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.230
 sees scratches pretty fast and that 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.050
 then usually does not look so great 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.270
 but here it's done just the way we come 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.400
 back to the topic and that is what we have 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.430
 here our said five usb ports 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.190
 the normal and the gardens and on the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.540
 back we find moment so find 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.670
 we then here the connection for 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.240
 power supply and here again the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.280
 connection 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.450
 yes for the usb plug so that we 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.540
 connect the whole synonymous with the pc 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.400
 Otherwise you have the packaging 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.590
 yes still the usb cable that would be once 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.080
 from plug type a to type b to 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.910
 Connected usb hubs with the computer and 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.110
 then the included power supply I 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.670
 she must be able to do something with it 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.650
 you that they can read and indeed 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.000
 Here we have an output voltage of 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.770
 five volts so that's the usb 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.840
 voltage and a current of three amps 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.340
 as a maximum, that's enough 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.500
 at least most devices charge 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.700
 as long as there are no nuclear reactors over 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.970
 so should connect usb 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.040
 Actually , that's what we do 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.100
 then to the usb hub of d-link as I said 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.870
 is the model of uw h 7 does not cost 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.120
 especially much to 20 euro 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.340
 if you regularly yours should 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.790
 smartphone or tablet or something 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.810
 connect via the pc and charge times 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.310
 view is in any case no 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.470
 Bad thing I can only recommend 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.459
 by a thank you for watching and 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.459
 until the next video
