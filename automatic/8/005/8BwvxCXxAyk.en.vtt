00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.900
 today so I'm going to introduce you 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.440
 for the site scam free.com the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.780
 martingale technique 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.980
 so it's basically played at roulette 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.800
 but I adapt them to poker so here we 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.480
 is on the site pokerstars you have some 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 banners on the site you can 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:34.980
 click on it to access it 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:42.360
 consult a psychiatrist what I'm going to do 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:47.190
 tasting of mar is gone this time the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.620
 little club if the psychopath like the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 pokemon with the big beaks the psychopath 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.719
 made 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:01.550
 here you go, here's a name 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.820
 could ride my mouse by end March 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.400
 this is yeah so it's won bid you 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.110
 see my fortune with this technique 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.390
 so I started to show you to 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.700
 7201 euros and here is already a euro of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.869
 win then when we find a fish 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.610
 like that too easy with his avatar of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.960
 sheets 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:32.460
 you do not have to let go of the technique 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.640
 the martingale is quite simple so 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.630
 we have bet one euro in a 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.470
 carpet building and we always stay at 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.860
 carpet it is important not to change and from 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:52.710
 when we win we start again lotto 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:56.130
 the hang of it in gold that is 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.990
 win we start again and if we lose we 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.780
 ride the lease 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.950
 [Music] 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.750
 group sheet and then I'm using the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.989
 satanic bet but it's not necessary 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.390
 there for example he paid oxymoron with 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:23.569
 his nickname you plugs are here I'm going 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:26.150
 so the 3rd life we ​​made 1.7 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.379
 classes with his pseudo of youth cards 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:35.510
 so I did not lose 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:39.829
 so then the principle is very simple to 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.209
 every time you double in time 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.610
 baïne because you lost 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.400
 Well, it allows you to recover the 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.650
 amount lost before and that you 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.290
 allows you to pocket a gain 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.720
 so it's very simple so there so 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.260
 I lost 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:03.560
 so I put a euro and so I change 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.730
 and I make 1 1 1 1 1 exact next 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.829
 so I can not double to roulette 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.170
 I would have doubled I would have gone to 2 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.780
 euros but there on pau 14 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.850
 there is no then I go to 5 euros 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.600
 directly and in fact it's even better 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.180
 because like that I'm going to win 4 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.079
 euros because the five that I win 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.170
 minus the 1 that I lost before so 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.700
 must know that this is a technique 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.040
 which is forbidden in casinos 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.650
 if you do that in a casino you go 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.230
 ask you to go out in a casino 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.150
 traditional of course but there 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.840
 luckily on some sites this is 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.959
 still possible 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.500
 so there on the site pokerstars is 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.540
 possible it is allowed in quotation marks 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.609
 so you have to enjoy one I do not know 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.460
 how long will it last 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:57.770
 but for now it's ok 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:03.820
 so the new opponent who does not know 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.820
 what awaits him ie the defeat 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.080
 so then if you want 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.800
 optimize your chances of gaining me I have 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.670
 some tips 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.110
 so in fact I say a lot so the 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.200
 satanic bet that you already know 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.040
 but also also use the batteries 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.280
 of chips so here it is won 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.970
 so there anyway so there is no 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.370
 the right side 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.370
 oh no I did not understand 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.410
 normally so good so there I lost 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.230
 at 1.5 euros but I did not understand 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.490
 normally if there is no right or no 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.700
 it means me 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.210
 no I do not know but then there 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:51.790
 so I lost 1.5 euro so I 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:54.440
 register me in 1 10 euro and toc 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.540
 mathematically in fact it's a 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.550
 question of stats from time to time that 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.530
 arrives very quickly 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.220
 but from time to time you have to 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.940
 climb a little but in fact it's 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.360
 mathematical because if for example 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.520
 I said the first game I said 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.720
 no I do not have to change 27 % chance 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:22.730
 to win and then the second I 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:26.540
 still no chance of being 36% so and 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:31.160
 then it's 60 63 and then south 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:33.320
 after I still have 51% and bass did 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.210
 114% 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.250
 so that means that since it's more 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.650
 of 100 % that I will inevitably win the 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.110
 third is mathematical 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.940
 it's just so it's me I know you 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.889
 I like all cured stat is 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.020
 used to 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.159
 so here is to be satanic there it's 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.949
 won me I have draws by the thousands 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:56.889
 Megacarte straight hyper mega colors 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:06:01.479
 so here I see the color so 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:03.969
 it's won so there hop 7205 and then 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.340
 we do not accept revenge against a 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:10.259
 with also no one has a little pity for him 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.870
 and here we start again at 1 euro and dokken 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.229
 here's where I almost register the 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.969
 black 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.529
 so that's really not the plan 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:18.520
 because we can not carpet me 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:23.279
 that's what I like doing 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:27.669
 and here is a new pigeon then 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:29.439
 if you do that, I do it 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.199
 one to two hours a day 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:35.830
 it allows me to win between 200 and 250 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:39.310
 euros a day it's a good income 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.080
 complementary saying ben me I'm trying 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.870
 to limit myself a bit because I 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.370
 doubt that it will soon be banned 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.819
 by the sites of a technique also 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.469
 powerful 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:52.150
 so hurry up then if you want 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:54.430
 optimize your chances of winning everything from 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.779
 following a euro there are still some 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.139
 tips that I can give you by 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:02.349
 example the bet and 1260 because your 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:06.759
 way of r6 so the concordance of 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:12.290
 put and cards and sacred so kinds 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:16.860
 combinations that here 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.500
 so there so something else you can 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.660
 to make use of the tokens architecture 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.580
 for example the 996 it's full of 

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.660
 colors that's it privacy a little 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.170
 your opponent with a hand that is 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:31.530
 not very strong as this one while 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:32.790
 here a very strong hand I'm doing 2020 and 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.010
 so it's just a little chip 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.330
 yellow more and then if it's not read 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.370
 he 's just going to see the chips he's going to say 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.730
 it's cheap and that's it and it commits 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:45.090
 with them so that the four it can not 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:51.090
 win because I'm a favorite I think 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:54.630
 and here is to win and so here I am 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:58.470
 will refuse and so I want to 

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:59.970
 him minutes I won 5euro if you 

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.010
 calculate it means that in eight minutes 

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:04.340
 that's about 5000 euros here offended 

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.340
 loser
