light shampoo on this half and it worked

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.440 
light shampoo on this half and it worked
really<00:01:33.130> well<00:01:33.310> because<00:01:33.850> my<00:01:33.970> hair<00:01:34.270> wasn't

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
really well because my hair wasn't

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.410 
really well because my hair wasn't
originally<00:01:35.100> gray<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:36.490> then<00:01:36.910> it<00:01:37.060> turned<00:01:37.300> into

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
originally gray and then it turned into

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.350 
originally gray and then it turned into
sandy<00:01:37.900> blonde<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.620> then<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:39.640> used<00:01:39.790> it<00:01:39.940> once<00:01:40.120> and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
sandy blonde and then I used it once and

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.890 
sandy blonde and then I used it once and
it<00:01:40.450> turned<00:01:41.490> pretty<00:01:42.490> platinum<00:01:43.030> it's<00:01:43.540> just<00:01:43.720> good

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and sorry for not looking good I guess

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.960 
and sorry for not looking good I guess
but<00:01:52.980> I'm<00:01:53.980> waiting<00:01:54.220> on<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:56.430> set<00:01:57.430> in<00:01:57.670> and

but I'm waiting on this to set in and
I'll<00:01:58.930> put<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.110> little<00:01:59.260> bit<00:01:59.440> of<00:01:59.500> heat<00:01:59.740> on<00:01:59.770> it<00:02:00.070> but

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
I'll put a little bit of heat on it but

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.020 
I'll put a little bit of heat on it but
not<00:02:00.790> much<00:02:01.000> because<00:02:01.450> my<00:02:02.320> hair<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.980> pretty<00:02:03.610> fried

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
not much because my hair is pretty fried

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.440 
not much because my hair is pretty fried
I<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:06.040> really<00:02:06.430> wanted<00:02:06.640> lavender<00:02:07.180> hair

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
I just just really wanted lavender hair

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
and hopefully this will turn lavender

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.200 
and hopefully this will turn lavender
and<00:02:09.880> not<00:02:10.090> purple<00:02:10.780> like<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.410> is<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.740> top<00:02:12.210> it's

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210
