waterproofing<00:00:14.099> on<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.730> market<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.389> have

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
waterproofing on a market we have

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.010 
waterproofing on a market we have
different<00:00:16.460> products<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.609> ways<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.660> doing<00:00:18.810> it

different products and ways of doing it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.380 
different products and ways of doing it
I'm<00:00:19.590> very<00:00:19.770> traditional<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.609> using<00:00:21.270> this

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
I'm very traditional is using this

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.750 
I'm very traditional is using this
asphalt<00:00:21.630> layer<00:00:22.050> which<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.010> very<00:00:23.160> common<00:00:23.550> very

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
asphalt layer which is very common very

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.490 
asphalt layer which is very common very
well<00:00:23.970> used<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.480> gives<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.750> guarantees<00:00:25.230> you

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
well used and gives it guarantees you

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980 
well used and gives it guarantees you
can<00:00:26.340> use<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.760> layer<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.449> use<00:00:27.599> two<00:00:27.810> layers

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
can use one layer you can use two layers

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870 
can use one layer you can use two layers
which<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:28.980> mostly<00:00:29.220> done<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.580> cost<00:00:29.760> of

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
which is mostly done in the cost of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.540 
which is mostly done in the cost of
solve<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.900> 10<00:00:31.170> years<00:00:31.309> guarantee<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
solve as it's 10 years guarantee and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
solve as it's 10 years guarantee and
should<00:00:33.149> always<00:00:33.360> be<00:00:33.690> done<00:00:33.809> by<00:00:33.989> professionals

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
should always be done by professionals

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.280 
should always be done by professionals
but<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.700> takes<00:00:35.850> longer<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.540> queue<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.140> it's

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
but it takes longer to queue and it's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.369 
but it takes longer to queue and it's
more<00:00:37.500> delicate<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.129> work<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.870> we<00:00:39.870> try<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.140> use

how<00:01:35.970> does<00:01:36.120> it<00:01:36.150> work<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.080> do<00:01:37.200> basically<00:01:37.740> we

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
how does it work what to do basically we

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.880 
how does it work what to do basically we
close<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.360> drainages<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.650> fill<00:01:40.860> up

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
close up the drainages that they fill up

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.310 
close up the drainages that they fill up
then<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.580> fill<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.910> up<00:01:42.030> with<00:01:42.240> water<00:01:42.480> that<00:01:43.200> you

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
then we fill it up with water that you

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.560 
then we fill it up with water that you
have<00:01:43.440> a<00:01:43.470> whole<00:01:43.680> pool<00:01:43.980> over<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> oil<00:01:44.550> area<00:01:44.880> we

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
have a whole pool over the oil area we

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.300 
have a whole pool over the oil area we
live<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.870> for<00:01:45.960> 72<00:01:46.440> hours<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.040> see<00:01:47.250> it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
live in for 72 hours you can see it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.190 
live in for 72 hours you can see it
filled<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.270> water<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
filled up with water you can see the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.310 
filled up with water you can see the
water<00:01:49.910> once<00:01:50.910> you<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.150> done<00:01:51.270> after<00:01:51.420> 72<00:01:51.900> hours

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
water once you have done after 72 hours

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.620 
water once you have done after 72 hours
what<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.800> we<00:01:53.220> open<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.060> drainage<00:01:54.300> just

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
what to do we open up the drainage just

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.500 
what to do we open up the drainage just
let<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.380> water<00:01:55.560> go<00:01:55.800> down<00:01:55.880> test<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> drainages

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
let the water go down test the drainages

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.990 
let the water go down test the drainages
that<00:01:58.050> we<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.260> no<00:01:58.380> water<00:01:58.590> leaks<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.700> way

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
that we have no water leaks on the way

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.570 
that we have no water leaks on the way
and<00:02:00.240> we've<00:02:01.170> filled<00:02:01.440> up<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> terrace<00:02:02.070> with

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
and we've filled up the terrace with

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.940 
and we've filled up the terrace with
water<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.510> time<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.260> was<00:02:04.410> like<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.650> pool

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
water and this time it was like a pool
