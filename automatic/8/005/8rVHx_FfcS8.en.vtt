00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:14.700
 Well, this time, I'm going to make a nose for you later. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:19.550
 Because prone suicide requires literally loosened threads 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:25.619
 * Actually I get a poem of a slightly different color from the alcohol I am going to do . 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:29.570
 Use the crochet to wait for the desired nose 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.570
 Let's do it this way. 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.420
 I'm trying to catch ten, so I 'll just take ten. 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.219
 2 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.489
 3 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.489
 4 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.390
 After 6 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:53.100
 1 High school stone 9 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:56.770
 Never let go of the witch's loader now. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:02.470
 Cut it. Cut it out. 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:05.980
 So if you grab it so you can reach the nose with the chain removed 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:10.690
 Now that you 're ready to catch your nose. 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:13.570
 Another of the organization is to do this, I slept through the nose 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:19.120
 Let's go to the age 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:22.780
 Originally this front is the fact that you see inde upside down so the chain chain link 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.369
 It looks the same , but for the part that pops out the most, 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.659
 You can grab it. 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:33.799
 Catherine Casser 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:36.340
 Cool looks so good on one nose Ueda pierces this way 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.340
 Duco 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.210
 If you look back, I look like one of the dates that soars into the sky 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.210
 Seiko 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.530
 I did it again 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.590
 Moreover, again 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.590
 Five 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.530
 Again approached the hump 6:00 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.520
 Monster Coco 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.830
 * Cock 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.370
 Out 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.740
 Let's make this Yuku old color. 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:46.060
 In contrast, 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.079
 3g, you can do it yourself. 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:54.640
 I'll see you again. 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:03:00.420
 I'll try to make a turn when I turn inside. 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:07.030
 The way to use the pebble room is that I have already released the seed and saved the nose 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:10.269
 Or go floated down there closer to the decorated with crochet these * 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:18.280
 I'm holding my nose with a thread. 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:22.599
 Kim greeted me or to make a hat or a crochet finish in the General Design 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:26.370
 Sseuim clothes that they do so by using the Hold code * Room 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:32.659
 When I came back this way 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.659
 I'm back on my knees to open the mars organization. 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.880
 * Because I caught my nose, I will never do it. 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.880
 Never Right 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:58.230
 When I go back again, 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:58.230
 never 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.530
 Especially around 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:28.569
 Yes, Colt. Shaqo. Let's do this through the crochet hook. 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:33.509
 The rank code 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.509
 I hold out no-cd yoreotge attend simyeon 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:44.260
 I have already released c and I want to keep this nose when I want to open this organization 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:47.070
 When you want to release it freely, let me get it out and see you. 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.070
 So Nash 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.560
 This is getting us off the hook. 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:12.780
 This way, the food is full. 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.780
 Now, because it is released like this 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.330
 So live code 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.330
 You'll see. I'll cut the grab. 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.020
 What 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:46.130
 Thus it became the bottom may be a part of this progress, the war 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.610
 Handageona a crochet hook or handle a lot of bad in this way when other organizations 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.610
 I am writing
