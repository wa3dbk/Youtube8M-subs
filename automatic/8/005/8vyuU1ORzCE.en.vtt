00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.770
 hello everyone but here's a short video about 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.189
 as 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:11.269
 what is mounted on a motorcycle 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:14.519
 battery homeland battery itself 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.359
 the window is clear that the wires are coming out 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.910
 generator there everything is already redone on 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.630
 the throne began to spin in a nutshell 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.050
 common with the terminals on the wire goes to the rally 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.529
 regulator and from solder wire wire from 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.059
 of war 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:39.710
 there is a video earlier goes to the rally regulator 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:42.210
 also the remaining wires of the d1 go on 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.829
 switch unchanged only goes 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:53.489
 already two wires to the coil and wires so 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:58.160
 and drove further here comes the wires to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.879
 regulator relay we have so two wires and 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.860
 here is this diagonal two wires go 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.729
 just the same from the terminal o 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.680
 and from the clearing wire here is plus minus 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.840
 which goes on battery + goes on 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:20.040
 battery minus goes to battery and 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.900
 grounded here and the second end here 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.009
 this wire from the plus 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.250
 goes to wire which used to be zero 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.880
 two years on my mind 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.520
 this wire is like a wreath a lot 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.210
 consumer in general so here it is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:48.470
 me go to the terminal m-we are you boards 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:48.470
 she doesn't need there anything more to say on 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.470
 battery installed fuse 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.590
 because whether the problem was short 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.360
 short circuit wire there from the frog fell 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.500
 but here everything is unchanged 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.979
 Olhovsky castle for 4 contacts 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.020
 two battery terminals closes but barely 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:18.530
 go on the ignition so but it seems to be more 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:24.950
 tachometer connects so black wire 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:29.570
 goes on + green minus the yellow method 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:34.600
 exceptions we have a minus on everything seems to be 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:43.310
 what else to say charging shows a 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:51.250
 Now you need to close the lid 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:54.250
 He is seen Ension 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.250
 we get 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.790
 but because for now 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.360
 here 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.740
 Well, in general, that's it like this for everyone.
