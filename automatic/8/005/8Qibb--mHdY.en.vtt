guys<00:02:12.599> it's<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.230> little

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
guys it's just a little

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.339 
guys it's just a little
too<00:02:13.769> small<00:02:14.099> for<00:02:14.159> me<00:02:14.549> I'm<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> big<00:02:15.629> guy<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:15.870> this

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
too small for me I'm a big guy so this

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.380 
too small for me I'm a big guy so this
really<00:02:16.799> doesn't<00:02:17.040> quite<00:02:17.340> cover<00:02:17.580> my<00:02:17.819> face<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.239> get

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
really doesn't quite cover my face I get

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.030 
really doesn't quite cover my face I get
a<00:02:18.420> lot<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.690> light<00:02:18.900> let<00:02:19.140> in<00:02:19.319> just<00:02:19.560> around<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
a lot of light let in just around the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.800 
a lot of light let in just around the
orbitals<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.030> stuff<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.390> mean<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.659> is<00:02:21.780> a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
orbitals and stuff so I mean it is a

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.149 
orbitals and stuff so I mean it is a
good<00:02:21.989> frame<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.620> little<00:02:22.799> bit<00:02:22.890> smaller

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
good frame for a little bit smaller

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.880 
good frame for a little bit smaller
