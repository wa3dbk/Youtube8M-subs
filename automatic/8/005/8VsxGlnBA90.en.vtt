00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
half we've started poorly and it

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.050 
half we've started poorly and it
probably<00:00:05.100> starts<00:00:05.430> right<00:00:05.640> at<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.819> start<00:00:06.000> of

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060

ball<00:01:00.870> down<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.379> worked<00:01:01.649> effectively

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
ball down that that's worked effectively

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.719 
ball down that that's worked effectively

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and you know you've got to try and use

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.760 
and you know you've got to try and use
it<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> stop<00:01:06.510> line<00:01:06.750> speed<00:01:07.049> defensively<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.740> so

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
it to stop line speed defensively to so

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.800 
it to stop line speed defensively to so
yeah<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.729> way<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> way<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> modern

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
yeah it was the way the way the modern

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.240 
yeah it was the way the way the modern
games<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.229> turns<00:01:13.470> around<00:01:13.710> kicking<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
games going turns around kicking in the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.399 
games going turns around kicking in the
game<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.630> thought<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.720> repeat<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.170> well<00:01:16.320> in

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
game I thought we repeat very well in

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.469 
game I thought we repeat very well in
the<00:01:16.470> second<00:01:16.770> half<00:01:17.060> we<00:01:18.060> found<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> very

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the second half we found a very

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.910 
the second half we found a very
difficult<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.990> gain<00:01:19.080> momentum<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.740> thought

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
difficult to gain momentum I thought

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460 
difficult to gain momentum I thought
they<00:01:20.040> did<00:01:20.220> well<00:01:20.490> hit<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> break<00:01:21.570> down<00:01:21.840> with

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
they did well hit the break down with

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.870 
they did well hit the break down with
choke<00:01:22.680> tackles<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.220> they<00:01:23.310> got<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.729> was

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
choke tackles and they got to know was

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390 
choke tackles and they got to know was
from<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.590> scrum<00:01:25.590> penalties<00:01:25.979> given<00:01:26.220> field

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
from that scrum penalties given field

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.090 
from that scrum penalties given field
position<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.560> no<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.680> say<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:28.979> just

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
position and no we just say we just

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.319 
position and no we just say we just
needed<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> try<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> foothold<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
needed to try and get a foothold in the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.510 
needed to try and get a foothold in the
game<00:01:30.509> now<00:01:30.540> second<00:01:30.990> half<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.290> can<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
game now second half we can do it and I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.740 
game now second half we can do it and I
think<00:01:32.700> England<00:01:33.000> deserve<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> lot<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.390> credit

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
think England deserve a lot of credit

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.660 
think England deserve a lot of credit
the<00:01:34.020> way<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.259> played<00:01:34.500> they<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.369> played<00:01:35.549> us

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the way they played they all played us

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
the way they played they all played us
in<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> second<00:01:36.210> half<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.020> thought<00:01:37.500> they

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
in that second half and I thought they

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.289 
in that second half and I thought they
deserved<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.040> wind<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> way<00:01:38.430> they<00:01:38.549> played<00:01:38.790> in

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
deserved the wind the way they played in

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.210 
deserved the wind the way they played in
the<00:01:39.570> closings<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.049> 20<00:01:40.320> minutes<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.799> pull<00:01:41.130> ahead

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the closings for 20 minutes I pull ahead

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.109 
the closings for 20 minutes I pull ahead
school<00:01:41.549> was<00:01:41.640> absolutely<00:01:42.299> outstanding<00:01:42.390> today

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
school was absolutely outstanding today

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.840 
school was absolutely outstanding today
you<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.210> cover<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.869> second<00:01:46.380> row<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.070> can't

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
you know cover the second row so I can't

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.050 
you know cover the second row so I can't
see<00:01:48.119> where<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.500> would<00:01:49.619> argue<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.220> England<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
see where you would argue that England a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.170 
see where you would argue that England a
massively<00:01:51.930> depleted<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.070> huge<00:01:53.850> amount<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
massively depleted with a huge amount of

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.520 
massively depleted with a huge amount of
players<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.570> got<00:01:54.689> strength<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.170> depth<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
players have got strength and depth and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.200 
players have got strength and depth and
I<00:01:55.590> thought<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> players<00:01:56.159> are<00:01:56.310> Cameron<00:01:56.640> did<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
I thought the players are Cameron did to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.999 
I thought the players are Cameron did to
the<00:01:57.299> fantastic<00:01:57.600> job<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.020> them<00:01:58.259> particularly

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
the fantastic job for them particularly

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.160 
the fantastic job for them particularly
this<00:01:59.280> section<00:01:59.670> 13<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.060> their<00:02:00.509> outstanding<00:02:00.750> so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
this section 13 of their outstanding so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.560 
this section 13 of their outstanding so
you<00:02:01.829> could<00:02:01.979> argue<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.310> their<00:02:03.270> number-one

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
you could argue that their number-one

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.139 
you could argue that their number-one
players<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.290> mean<00:02:04.490> Tom<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.670> would<00:02:05.820> find<00:02:06.060> it

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
players I mean Tom would would find it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.340 
players I mean Tom would would find it
difficult<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.540> probably<00:02:06.840> get<00:02:06.990> back<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.320> that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
difficult to probably get back in that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.570 
difficult to probably get back in that
team<00:02:07.619> at<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.799> moment<00:02:08.009> out<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.190> way<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.310> high

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
team at the moment out the way that high

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.520 
team at the moment out the way that high
school<00:02:08.789> played<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
school played and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.990 
school played and
you<00:02:10.830> know<00:02:10.920> probably<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.220> big<00:02:11.340> loss<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.550> them<00:02:11.819> as

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
you know probably a big loss for them as

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.960 
you know probably a big loss for them as
to<00:02:12.420> eleni<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:14.100> know<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.250> don't<00:02:14.550> look<00:02:14.790> at<00:02:14.910> it

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
to eleni so you know I don't look at it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.680 
to eleni so you know I don't look at it
and<00:02:15.120> say<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.360> know<00:02:15.690> are<00:02:16.350> we<00:02:16.410> concerned<00:02:16.920> about

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
and say you know are we concerned about

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.880 
and say you know are we concerned about
England<00:02:18.690> missing<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.050> many<00:02:19.140> players<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.680> it's

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
England missing so many players and it's

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.040 
England missing so many players and it's
just<00:02:20.100> it's<00:02:20.370> top<00:02:20.760> level<00:02:21.120> test<00:02:21.330> Metro<00:02:21.660> view<00:02:21.720> then

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
just it's top level test Metro view then

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.740 
just it's top level test Metro view then
you<00:02:22.890> know<00:02:22.950> sometimes<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.580> play<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:24.120> your

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
you know sometimes you play with your

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.240 
you know sometimes you play with your
strength<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.410> depth<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.830> sometimes<00:02:26.130> you

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
strength and depth and sometimes you

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.370 
strength and depth and sometimes you
don't<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.520> thought<00:02:26.700> we<00:02:27.660> were<00:02:27.750> very<00:02:27.900> happy<00:02:28.110> and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
don't I thought we were very happy and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.900 
don't I thought we were very happy and
very<00:02:28.440> comfortable<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.190> first<00:02:29.340> 40<00:02:29.640> minutes
