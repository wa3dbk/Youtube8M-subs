go<00:03:44.940> Tokio<00:03:45.240> or<00:03:45.510> 230<00:03:46.080> so<00:03:46.770> I<00:03:46.800> was<00:03:46.860> thinking<00:03:46.950> out<00:03:47.250> to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
go Tokio or 230 so I was thinking out to

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.910 
go Tokio or 230 so I was thinking out to
post<00:03:47.580> a<00:03:47.730> video<00:03:47.940> about<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.410> I'll<00:03:49.800> do

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
post a video about that and I'll do

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.770 
post a video about that and I'll do
about<00:03:50.100> two<00:03:50.340> weeks<00:03:50.610> worth<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.180> doing<00:03:51.660> this

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
about two weeks worth of doing this

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.930 
about two weeks worth of doing this
every<00:03:52.140> single<00:03:52.290> day<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.800> then<00:03:53.490> after<00:03:53.790> two

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
every single day and then after two

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.270 
every single day and then after two
weeks<00:03:54.090> i'll<00:03:54.330> show<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:54.750> all<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.560> loot<00:03:55.740> i<00:03:55.860> get<00:03:56.100> i

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
weeks i'll show you all the loot i get i

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.350 
weeks i'll show you all the loot i get i
think<00:03:56.550> that<00:03:56.640> i<00:03:56.670> should<00:03:56.760> be<00:03:57.000> pretty<00:03:57.180> awesome

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
think that i should be pretty awesome

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.690 
think that i should be pretty awesome
because<00:03:58.230> i've<00:03:58.470> been<00:03:58.500> told<00:03:58.800> that<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.100> abyssal

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
because i've been told that the abyssal

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.030 
because i've been told that the abyssal
ones<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.210> abuse<00:04:00.510> orbs<00:04:00.930> drop<00:04:01.170> rate<00:04:01.410> is<00:04:01.590> one

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
ones and the abuse orbs drop rate is one

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.790 
ones and the abuse orbs drop rate is one
in<00:04:02.370> about<00:04:02.730> three<00:04:03.000> thousand<00:04:03.540> now<00:04:04.350> correct<00:04:04.680> me

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
in about three thousand now correct me

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.830 
in about three thousand now correct me
if<00:04:04.920> I'm<00:04:05.070> wrong<00:04:05.100> but<00:04:05.310> that's<00:04:05.670> pretty<00:04:06.120> rare<00:04:06.480> and

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
if I'm wrong but that's pretty rare and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.900 
if I'm wrong but that's pretty rare and
I<00:04:07.290> kind<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.500> worked<00:04:07.680> out<00:04:07.860> that<00:04:07.920> hopefully<00:04:08.730> in

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
I kind of worked out that hopefully in

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.370 
I kind of worked out that hopefully in
the<00:04:08.940> two<00:04:09.150> weeks<00:04:09.360> I<00:04:09.510> should<00:04:09.660> get<00:04:09.780> at<00:04:09.930> least<00:04:09.960> one

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
the two weeks I should get at least one

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.090 
the two weeks I should get at least one
or<00:04:10.620> two<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:11.340> each<00:04:12.440> whilst<00:04:13.440> doing<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.830> every

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
or two of each whilst doing it every

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.530 
or two of each whilst doing it every
single<00:04:14.280> day<00:04:14.460> because<00:04:14.610> it<00:04:15.060> kind<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.420> means

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
single day because it kind of means

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.660 
single day because it kind of means
that'll<00:04:15.840> be<00:04:15.900> killing<00:04:16.230> about<00:04:16.470> 3,000<00:04:17.370> anyways

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
that'll be killing about 3,000 anyways

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.220 
that'll be killing about 3,000 anyways
and<00:04:17.970> hopefully<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.600> can<00:04:18.660> get<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.810> bit<00:04:18.960> fortunate

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
and hopefully I can get a bit fortunate

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.960 
and hopefully I can get a bit fortunate
and<00:04:19.680> get<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:20.040> loot<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:20.640> that<00:04:20.790> would<00:04:20.880> actually

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
and get the loot so that would actually

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.700 
and get the loot so that would actually
be<00:04:21.120> pretty<00:04:21.330> insane<00:04:21.750> if<00:04:22.020> I<00:04:22.109> actually<00:04:22.290> can

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
be pretty insane if I actually can

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.030 
be pretty insane if I actually can
actually<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.510> said<00:04:24.510> Cantor<00:04:24.930> Mia<00:04:24.960> times<00:04:25.260> if<00:04:25.860> I

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
actually I said Cantor Mia times if I

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.840 
actually I said Cantor Mia times if I
actually

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
actually

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.360 
actually
and<00:04:26.970> get<00:04:27.450> those<00:04:27.750> two<00:04:28.140> items<00:04:28.290> whilst<00:04:29.160> making

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
and get those two items whilst making

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.740 
and get those two items whilst making
that<00:04:29.610> episode<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:29.970> think<00:04:30.240> that'd<00:04:30.330> be<00:04:30.450> actually

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
that episode I think that'd be actually

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.230 
that episode I think that'd be actually
pretty<00:04:30.900> amazing<00:04:31.170> and<00:04:31.650> would<00:04:32.130> also<00:04:32.340> be<00:04:32.610> pretty

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
pretty amazing and would also be pretty

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.610 
pretty amazing and would also be pretty
good<00:04:33.450> video<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.900> post<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.260> think<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.500> was<00:04:34.590> one

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
good video to post I think that was one

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.770 
good video to post I think that was one
of<00:04:34.740> my<00:04:34.830> ideas<00:04:35.010> i<00:04:35.340> canna<00:04:35.550> came<00:04:35.760> up<00:04:35.940> with<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.630> I

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
of my ideas i canna came up with and I

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.750 
of my ideas i canna came up with and I
was<00:04:36.870> kind<00:04:36.990> of<00:04:37.020> thinking<00:04:37.110> about<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:37.920> obviously

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
was kind of thinking about and obviously

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.030 
was kind of thinking about and obviously
I<00:04:38.850> would<00:04:39.030> tell<00:04:39.210> you<00:04:39.300> guys<00:04:39.420> how<00:04:39.660> many<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:40.170> killed

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
I would tell you guys how many I killed

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.270 
I would tell you guys how many I killed
after<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.850> two<00:04:42.030> weeks<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.740> would<00:04:43.920> kind<00:04:44.220> of

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
after the two weeks so it would kind of

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.820 
after the two weeks so it would kind of
be<00:04:44.400> equivalent<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.060> about<00:04:45.180> 14<00:04:45.750> tasks<00:04:46.380> Werfel

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
be equivalent to about 14 tasks Werfel

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.800 
be equivalent to about 14 tasks Werfel
abyssal<00:04:47.310> demons<00:04:47.490> so<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.540> would<00:04:48.630> be<00:04:48.660> also

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
abyssal demons so that would be also

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.000 
abyssal demons so that would be also
pretty<00:04:49.080> insane<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:51.290> throughout<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.380> may<00:04:52.980> I

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
pretty insane and throughout the may I

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.590 
pretty insane and throughout the may I
