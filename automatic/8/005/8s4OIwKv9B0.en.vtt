you<00:02:08.399> make<00:02:08.670> your<00:02:08.819> starting<00:02:09.270> chain<00:02:09.860> make<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
you make your starting chain make the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.190 
you make your starting chain make the
chains<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.790> long<00:02:12.180> as<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.510> want<00:02:12.690> your<00:02:12.750> scarf<00:02:12.990> to

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
chains as long as you want your scarf to

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.880 
chains as long as you want your scarf to
be<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.530> then<00:02:13.830> add<00:02:14.069> two<00:02:14.730> more<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.990> for

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
be and then add two more on to that for

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.370 
be and then add two more on to that for
our<00:02:17.010> turning<00:02:17.340> chain<00:02:17.570> okay<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.140> make<00:02:19.350> a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
our turning chain okay so to make a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.070 
our turning chain okay so to make a
chain<00:02:19.710> wrap<00:02:20.160> yarn<00:02:20.190> around<00:02:20.550> hook<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.180> bring<00:02:21.990> it

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
chain wrap yarn around hook and bring it

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.280 
chain wrap yarn around hook and bring it
through

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
through

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.890 
through
the<00:02:22.349> loop<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:22.799> like<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.219> I<00:02:23.750> want<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.810> do

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the loop just like that I want to do

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:35.110 
the loop just like that I want to do
about<00:02:25.079> 12<00:02:32.780> 11<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.049> 12

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
about 12 11 and 12

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.960 
about 12 11 and 12
so<00:02:36.120> obviously<00:02:36.629> yours<00:02:36.930> will<00:02:37.079> be<00:02:37.200> longer<00:02:38.150> okay

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
so obviously yours will be longer okay

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.000 
so obviously yours will be longer okay
so<00:02:41.970> we're<00:02:42.810> going<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.989> work<00:02:43.170> our<00:02:43.379> foundation

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
so we're going to work our foundation

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.580 
so we're going to work our foundation

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
row so in the second chain from the hook

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.879 
row so in the second chain from the hook
this<00:02:47.220> loop<00:02:47.459> here<00:02:47.730> does<00:02:47.970> not<00:02:48.000> count<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:49.139> one<00:02:49.560> and

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
this loop here does not count so one and

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.119 
this loop here does not count so one and
two<00:02:50.209> we're<00:02:51.209> going<00:02:51.359> to<00:02:51.480> work<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:52.049> single<00:02:52.129> crochet

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
into the chain and bring up a loop wrap

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.520 
into the chain and bring up a loop wrap
yarn<00:02:59.939> around<00:03:00.120> hook<00:03:00.359> and<00:03:00.780> bring<00:03:01.409> it<00:03:01.500> through

front loop so insert your hook into the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.160 
front loop so insert your hook into the
front<00:04:36.980> loop<00:04:37.160> only<00:04:37.510> we<00:04:38.510> can<00:04:38.630> see<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.930> top<00:04:39.140> view

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
front loop only we can see the top view

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.190 
front loop only we can see the top view
it's<00:04:40.010> kind<00:04:40.190> of<00:04:40.310> like<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.670> and<00:04:40.970> then<00:04:41.750> complete

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
it's kind of like that and then complete

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.240 
it's kind of like that and then complete
your<00:04:42.350> stitch<00:04:42.650> as<00:04:42.860> you<00:04:43.040> normally<00:04:43.190> would<00:04:45.250> so

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
insert the hook into the front loop and

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.150 
insert the hook into the front loop and
work<00:04:50.960> your<00:04:51.110> single<00:04:51.470> crochet<00:04:52.120> front<00:04:53.120> loop<00:04:53.390> and

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
complete the stitch so we're going to do

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.230 
complete the stitch so we're going to do
that<00:04:56.990> all<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:57.170> way<00:04:57.290> across<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:58.030> what<00:04:59.030> this

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
that all the way across and what this

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.750 
that all the way across and what this
does<00:04:59.570> working<00:05:00.410> into<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.650> front<00:05:01.010> loop<00:05:01.190> only<00:05:01.400> is

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
does working into the front loop only is

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.080 
does working into the front loop only is
it<00:05:01.940> creates<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.480> very<00:05:03.430> subtle<00:05:04.430> ribbing

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
it creates a very subtle ribbing

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.470 
it creates a very subtle ribbing
throughout<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.960> scarf<00:05:06.400> that<00:05:07.400> adds<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:08.240> little

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
throughout the scarf that adds a little

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.920 
throughout the scarf that adds a little
bit<00:05:08.630> of<00:05:08.810> texture<00:05:09.230> and<00:05:09.620> interest<00:05:10.930> we're

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
bit of texture and interest we're

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.020 
bit of texture and interest we're
working<00:05:12.260> very<00:05:12.290> simple<00:05:13.010> single<00:05:13.610> crochet

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
working very simple single crochet

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.690 
working very simple single crochet
stitches<00:05:14.500> so<00:05:15.500> this<00:05:15.710> working<00:05:16.130> into<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.430> front

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
stitches so this working into the front

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.930 
stitches so this working into the front
loop<00:05:16.880> here<00:05:17.210> adds<00:05:18.370> just<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.520> little<00:05:19.550> bit<00:05:19.850> of

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
loop here adds just a little bit of

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.690 
loop here adds just a little bit of
texture<00:05:20.390> to<00:05:20.420> our<00:05:20.690> scarf<00:05:21.050> okay<00:05:22.040> and<00:05:22.280> then

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
texture to our scarf okay and then

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.940 
texture to our scarf okay and then

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
you're also going to work a single

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.780 
you're also going to work a single
crochet<00:05:25.130> into<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:26.780> turning<00:05:27.200> Jean<00:05:27.470> as<00:05:27.910> well<00:05:30.790> to

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
crochet into the turning Jean as well to

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.960

finish off your scarf okay so what
you're<00:05:38.090> going<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.419> do<00:05:38.720> is<00:05:38.990> just<00:05:39.590> repeat<00:05:40.010> row

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
you're going to do is just repeat row

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.040 
you're going to do is just repeat row
one<00:05:41.090> until<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.780> scarf<00:05:42.169> is<00:05:42.380> the<00:05:42.530> desired<00:05:42.919> width

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
one until the scarf is the desired width

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.980 
one until the scarf is the desired width
so<00:05:45.050> you'll<00:05:45.200> just<00:05:45.230> repeat<00:05:45.919> Row<00:05:46.340> one<00:05:46.580> by<00:05:46.990> chain

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
so you'll just repeat Row one by chain

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.070 
so you'll just repeat Row one by chain
one<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:48.410> turn<00:05:48.640> and<00:05:49.640> then<00:05:50.060> just<00:05:50.330> work<00:05:50.600> into

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
one and turn and then just work into

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.399 
one and turn and then just work into
these<00:05:51.400> front<00:05:52.400> loops<00:05:52.820> of<00:05:53.120> our<00:05:54.460> scarf
