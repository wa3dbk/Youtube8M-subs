just<00:02:28.290> called<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.739> there<00:02:29.099> was<00:02:29.189> no<00:02:29.400> way<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.640> I

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
just called it there was no way that I

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.039 
just called it there was no way that I
was<00:02:30.060> gonna<00:02:30.319> not<00:02:31.319> only<00:02:32.180> much<00:02:33.180> less<00:02:33.420> win<00:02:33.720> but

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
was gonna not only much less win but

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.470 
was gonna not only much less win but
even<00:02:34.079> get<00:02:34.650> out<00:02:34.829> of<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.099> decisive<00:02:35.940> British

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
even get out of a decisive British

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.059 
even get out of a decisive British
victory<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:38.730> those<00:02:39.480> six<00:02:39.840> turns<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.560> started

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
victory in those six turns I started

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.089 
victory in those six turns I started
pretty<00:02:41.340> heavily<00:02:42.319> here<00:02:43.319> on<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.560> right<00:02:43.739> side<00:02:43.980> of

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
pretty heavily here on the right side of

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.630 
pretty heavily here on the right side of
the<00:02:44.189> map

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
the map

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.740 
the map
with<00:02:44.849> my<00:02:45.030> set<00:02:45.329> up<00:02:45.859> I<00:02:47.269> started<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.329> make<00:02:48.450> some

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
with my set up I started to make some

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.910 
with my set up I started to make some
progress<00:02:49.109> down<00:02:49.709> here<00:02:50.659> with<00:02:51.659> what<00:02:52.470> are<00:02:52.620> some<00:02:52.829> of

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
progress down here with what are some of

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.369 
progress down here with what are some of
these<00:02:53.010> light<00:02:53.310> blue<00:02:53.459> units<00:02:53.940> which<00:02:54.209> are<00:02:54.389> German

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
these light blue units which are German

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.099 
these light blue units which are German
training<00:02:55.829> units<00:02:56.599> but<00:02:57.599> really<00:02:57.840> they<00:02:57.959> were

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
training units but really they were

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.780 
training units but really they were
ultimately<00:02:58.290> too<00:02:58.859> weak<00:02:59.099> to<00:02:59.280> make<00:02:59.430> too<00:02:59.670> much

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
ultimately too weak to make too much

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.910 
ultimately too weak to make too much
progress<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.720> got<00:03:00.870> pushed<00:03:01.170> back<00:03:02.659> my<00:03:03.920> German

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
progress and got pushed back my German

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.360 
progress and got pushed back my German
SS<00:03:05.280> units<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.970> black<00:03:06.180> units<00:03:06.889> really<00:03:07.889> didn't

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
SS units the black units really didn't

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.020 
SS units the black units really didn't
do<00:03:08.760> too<00:03:09.030> much<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.269> anything<00:03:10.250> any<00:03:11.250> progress

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
do too much of anything any progress

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.220 
do too much of anything any progress
that<00:03:12.180> they<00:03:12.299> would<00:03:12.480> make<00:03:12.659> they<00:03:12.930> would<00:03:13.079> get

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
that they would make they would get

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.110 
that they would make they would get
pushed<00:03:13.500> back<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:15.739> frankly<00:03:16.739> I<00:03:16.769> was<00:03:17.040> pretty

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
pushed back and frankly I was pretty

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.740 
pushed back and frankly I was pretty
lightly<00:03:19.040> armored<00:03:20.040> or<00:03:20.220> lightly<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:21.209> didn't<00:03:21.629> have

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
lightly armored or lightly I didn't have

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.420 
lightly armored or lightly I didn't have
too<00:03:21.900> many<00:03:22.019> units<00:03:22.470> here<00:03:22.680> on<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.859> left<00:03:23.099> side<00:03:23.280> of

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
too many units here on the left side of

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.610 
too many units here on the left side of
the<00:03:23.519> map<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.419> don't<00:03:25.230> know

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
the map so I don't know

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.189 
the map so I don't know
I<00:03:25.650> have<00:03:26.549> i<00:03:26.970> don't<00:03:27.209> have<00:03:27.359> mixed<00:03:27.720> feelings<00:03:27.750> about

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
I have i don't have mixed feelings about

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.569 
I have i don't have mixed feelings about
the<00:03:28.500> game<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:29.730> think<00:03:30.680> if<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.829> combine<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
the game I think if you combine the

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.030 
the game I think if you combine the
progress<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:33.299> made<00:03:33.599> or<00:03:33.810> didn't<00:03:34.139> make<00:03:34.319> I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
progress that I made or didn't make I

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.129 
progress that I made or didn't make I
have<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:35.910> pretty<00:03:36.180> strong<00:03:36.269> feeling<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:37.079> the

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
have a pretty strong feeling that the

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.509 
have a pretty strong feeling that the
game<00:03:37.169> is<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:38.389> pretty<00:03:39.389> evenly<00:03:39.840> balanced<00:03:40.519> at

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
game is is pretty evenly balanced at

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.339 
game is is pretty evenly balanced at
some<00:03:41.760> poor<00:03:42.000> dice<00:03:42.180> rolling<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.199> can

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
some poor dice rolling but that can

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.819 
some poor dice rolling but that can
happen<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.709> anyone<00:03:45.230> and<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.470> think<00:03:46.709> that

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
happen to anyone and I think that

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.759 
happen to anyone and I think that
there's<00:03:47.099> with<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.940> little<00:03:48.269> bit<00:03:48.440> better<00:03:49.440> luck

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
there's with a little bit better luck

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.000 
there's with a little bit better luck
and<00:03:50.419> better<00:03:51.419> planning<00:03:51.930> might<00:03:52.709> have<00:03:52.859> had<00:03:52.980> a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
and better planning might have had a

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.319 
and better planning might have had a
certainly<00:03:53.669> a<00:03:53.760> better<00:03:53.940> outcome<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:57.060> was<00:03:57.209> the

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
certainly a better outcome this was the

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.149 
certainly a better outcome this was the
first<00:03:57.569> game<00:03:57.659> that<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:58.169> played<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> storm<00:03:59.010> over

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
first game that I played a storm over

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.979 
first game that I played a storm over
Arnhem<00:03:59.639> and<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.879> same<00:04:00.090> for<00:04:00.329> my<00:04:00.419> friend<00:04:00.449> Jean

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
Arnhem and the same for my friend Jean

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.720 
Arnhem and the same for my friend Jean
so<00:04:01.739> we<00:04:01.889> were<00:04:01.980> definitely<00:04:02.099> learning<00:04:02.639> the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
so we were definitely learning the

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.439 
so we were definitely learning the
system<00:04:03.260> took<00:04:04.260> us<00:04:04.379> for<00:04:04.819> two<00:04:05.819> to<00:04:05.940> three<00:04:06.150> hours

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:06.449 
system took us for two to three hours

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.080 
system took us for two to three hours
sessions<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.620> get<00:04:07.859> through<00:04:08.190> those<00:04:08.519> six<00:04:08.790> turns

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
sessions to get through those six turns

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.360 
sessions to get through those six turns
so<00:04:09.389> we<00:04:09.419> were<00:04:09.900> pretty<00:04:10.199> slow<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.590> our<00:04:10.799> play<00:04:11.040> which

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
so we were pretty slow in our play which

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.009 
so we were pretty slow in our play which
is<00:04:11.519> okay<00:04:11.819> we're<00:04:12.030> again<00:04:12.389> we<00:04:12.510> were<00:04:12.629> learning<00:04:12.840> the

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
is okay we're again we were learning the

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.550 
is okay we're again we were learning the
game<00:04:13.169> I<00:04:13.409> definitely<00:04:14.220> want<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.430> play<00:04:14.669> it<00:04:14.729> again

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
game I definitely want to play it again

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.110 
game I definitely want to play it again
