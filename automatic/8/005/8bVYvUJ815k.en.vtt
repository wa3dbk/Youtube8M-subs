00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.450 
battling at this point so the game makes
for<00:01:56.120> place<00:01:56.390> for<00:01:56.659> me<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:56.810> I'm<00:01:57.080> just<00:01:57.110> gonna<00:01:57.460> try

for place for me and I'm just gonna try
to<00:01:58.520> explain<00:01:58.909> this<00:01:59.090> place<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.540> you<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.659> don't

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
to explain this place to you I don't

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.480 
to explain this place to you I don't
know<00:01:59.960> why<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.260> game<00:02:00.560> made<00:02:00.800> these<00:02:00.980> plays<00:02:01.250> but

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
know why the game made these plays but

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.760 
know why the game made these plays but
it<00:02:01.580> did<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.810> game<00:02:02.960> decide<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.380> go<00:02:03.470> for<00:02:03.500> play

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
it did the game decide to go for play

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.260 
it did the game decide to go for play
rough<00:02:03.980> because<00:02:04.190> i<00:02:04.340> thought<00:02:04.550> you<00:02:04.700> know<00:02:04.730> do<00:02:05.000> good

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
rough because i thought you know do good

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.930 
rough because i thought you know do good
and<00:02:05.360> I'm<00:02:05.600> damaged<00:02:05.990> he<00:02:06.200> trained<00:02:06.500> obviously<00:02:07.370> the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
and I'm damaged he trained obviously the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.490 
and I'm damaged he trained obviously the
game<00:02:08.119> can't<00:02:08.390> switch<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:08.780> out<00:02:08.959> because<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
game can't switch it out because the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.410 
game can't switch it out because the
game<00:02:09.649> is<00:02:09.800> not<00:02:09.890> smart<00:02:10.250> enough<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:10.879> the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
game is not smart enough and now the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.839 
game is not smart enough and now the
game<00:02:11.599> brings<00:02:12.019> in<00:02:12.200> latios<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.709> then<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.700> game

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
game brings in latios and then the game

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.360 
game brings in latios and then the game
predicts<00:02:14.330> him<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.870> switch<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.260> goodra<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
predicts him to switch to goodra and the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.500 
predicts him to switch to goodra and the
game<00:02:16.519> ends<00:02:16.819> up<00:02:16.909> going<00:02:17.060> for<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.330> Draco<00:02:17.750> meteor<00:02:18.489> so

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
game ends up going for a Draco meteor so

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.610 
game ends up going for a Draco meteor so
the<00:02:20.510> gay<00:02:20.629> made<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.109> dumb<00:02:21.730> the

wall and this is where it comes down to

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.620 
wall and this is where it comes down to
just<00:04:55.470> like<00:04:55.819> ultimate<00:04:56.819> predicting<00:04:57.330> this<00:04:57.449> is

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
just like ultimate predicting this is

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.659 
just like ultimate predicting this is
all<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.960> can<00:04:58.110> do<00:04:58.289> he<00:04:58.949> ends<00:04:59.160> up<00:04:59.220> going<00:04:59.400> for<00:04:59.639> a

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
all you can do he ends up going for a

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.460 
all you can do he ends up going for a
sword<00:04:59.910> stance<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.330> knew<00:05:00.870> he's<00:05:01.080> probably<00:05:01.259> going

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
sword stance I knew he's probably going

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.050 
sword stance I knew he's probably going
to<00:05:01.530> do<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.830> but<00:05:01.979> I<00:05:02.039> couldn't<00:05:02.520> risk<00:05:02.669> him<00:05:02.849> going

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
to do that but I couldn't risk him going

to do that but I couldn't risk him going
for<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.360> sucker<00:05:03.569> punch<00:05:03.750> there<00:05:04.020> because<00:05:04.289> i<00:05:04.440> knew

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
for a sucker punch there because i knew

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.680 
for a sucker punch there because i knew
i<00:05:04.680> would<00:05:04.919> have<00:05:05.039> not<00:05:05.280> been<00:05:05.430> able<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.729> take<00:05:05.940> it<00:05:06.120> so

i would have not been able to take it so

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.480 
i would have not been able to take it so
here<00:05:06.930> i<00:05:06.960> go<00:05:07.020> for<00:05:07.259> rouge<00:05:07.470> expecting<00:05:08.009> him<00:05:08.190> go<00:05:08.280> for

here i go for rouge expecting him go for
sucker<00:05:08.669> punch<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.180> that's<00:05:09.330> exactly<00:05:09.509> what

sucker punch and that's exactly what

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.680 
sucker punch and that's exactly what

because<00:05:13.080> i'm<00:05:13.229> gonna<00:05:13.590> again<00:05:13.979> expect<00:05:14.430> me<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.639> go

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
because i'm gonna again expect me to go

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.189 
because i'm gonna again expect me to go
for<00:05:14.970> that<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.360> I<00:05:16.110> now<00:05:16.800> decide<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.460> go<00:05:17.610> for

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
for that and I now decide to go for

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.900 
for that and I now decide to go for
obviously<00:05:19.199> the<00:05:19.500> roost<00:05:19.710> again<00:05:20.340> he<00:05:20.699> ends<00:05:20.849> up

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
obviously the roost again he ends up

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.510 
obviously the roost again he ends up
iron<00:05:21.210> heading<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:21.870> really<00:05:22.740> thought<00:05:22.949> that<00:05:23.130> maybe

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
iron heading I really thought that maybe

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.980 
iron heading I really thought that maybe
he<00:05:23.880> would<00:05:23.910> have<00:05:24.060> gone<00:05:24.270> for<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.570> second<00:05:24.840> punch

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
he would have gone for the second punch

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.170 
he would have gone for the second punch
again<00:05:25.259> and<00:05:25.500> then<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:25.979> know<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.250> next<00:05:26.520> turn<00:05:26.910> I

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
again and then you know the next turn I

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.120 
again and then you know the next turn I
would<00:05:27.449> have<00:05:27.570> probably<00:05:27.900> gone<00:05:28.349> for<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.680> Firewatch

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
would have probably gone for a Firewatch

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.700 
would have probably gone for a Firewatch
trying<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:29.580> knock<00:05:29.729> him<00:05:29.880> out<00:05:30.229> because<00:05:31.229> of<00:05:31.500> what

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
trying to knock him out because of what

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.080 
trying to knock him out because of what
it<00:05:31.740> felt<00:05:31.889> like<00:05:32.039> that's<00:05:32.190> too<00:05:32.550> many<00:05:32.820> sucker
