00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.289
 from the 15th 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.630
 it is here primarily in the energy flow in 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.000
 your body but me 50 meters is too 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.359
 the sportiest of all and it is 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.359
 also definitely a full body exercise 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:39.530
 starting position is like her here 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.050
 the hands are slightly wider than 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 shoulder width so give the feet of the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.809
 distance over the longitudinal axis the value 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.030
 their best feeling in the run and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.210
 under certain circumstances a denied exercise still 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.930
 correct once 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.289
 otherwise in the starting position 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.690
 try to press your heels down and 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.979
 push you way back through me 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.140
 know this is not easy if the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.060
 fans go down the floor then they are 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.820
 First , you have matured the air rifle 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.520
 this exercise also your dare back 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.890
 which and will always be better 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.780
 that is the starting position 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.979
 By the way, a classic attitude from the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 yoga of look down around we go 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:32.759
 then you shift your weight as you do 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:35.630
 in front of the poor are between the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.020
 shoulder blades one of the puck down 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.939
 pulls the shoulder blades backwards 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.009
 the head against the knee makes a 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:48.520
 dismantling in August citizens should then 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.640
 it goes on the shoulder of head 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.079
 inside Reinhold back here is here 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.299
 that the breathing movement here and there 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.509
 front that the respiratory movement therefore 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:08.259
 She pulls her closed eyes in excited 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:16.599
 the breath to head high and led 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:20.799
 In any case exhale goes down again 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:27.299
 should now occur so started 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:30.010
 will inhale now and now 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.260
 and then now again between times 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.549
 on 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.650
 so that you still have air around you here 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:41.799
 a little bit out of that was that 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:50.160
 between breathing occurs again and from 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:55.720
 deep in and out at the front 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.710
 between breath and so on us 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.020
 to attempt 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.850
 the repetition at the beginning once 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.850
 sometime 14 and 21 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:49.630
 also hereby maybe creates 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.630
 compensation after that was
