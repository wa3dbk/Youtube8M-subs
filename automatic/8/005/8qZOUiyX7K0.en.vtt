00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270

 here in the elevator and in barcelona- 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.529
 ready with him was at all points to 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.240
 go for a run and give a few kilometers 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.820
 solidarity for the same 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.889
 today I quit smoking today quit smoking today 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.960
 I stop smoking or tomorrow I do not stop smoking 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.539
 or this month stopped smoking is something that 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.789
 I will have said a hundred times in life 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.689
 less and they have only worked for me once 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.720
 it was a year and two months or so 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.090
 November 2013 when after 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.910
 of having done three ironmans means a 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.410
 ironman and an ultra man finally stop 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.149
 smoking and there came a time that this was 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.710
 the host forbid actions that maybe 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.079
 I smoked a little no no no no no cojones 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.020
 same during the day I smoked five or six 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.460
 cigars 7 at most maximum and then by 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.899
 the night not because it came out but because 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.030
 I was editing videos on the cord 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.910
 They keep sending mails because nothing and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.190
 Generating ideas or whatever suddenly 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.680
 the next day I looked and woke up 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.270
 grace and as you have the neck I looked at the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.500
 ashtray and what was left of the package 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.510
 the six or seven that I had smoked 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.760
 during the day I had lashed them 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.769
 during the night the host of all this 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.960
 it was already when I was riding the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.210
 documentary of ultra mantega 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.500
 and those nights I played a package 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.040
 whole with which the next day 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.040
 I looked and said 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.160
 they are riding an ultra man and you finish 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.170
 of smoking a package by yourself sir so 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.390
 asshole of the human being sorry so 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.100
 asshole is valenti sanjuan then 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.650
 the reef and as you quit smoking 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.330
 very easy a recipe of which 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.220
 the trick then look I know people who 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.230
 it has been left by hypnosis people who 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.310
 I've left with patches people who have 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.800
 left with the electronic cigarette 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.510
 people who have read the larsson method 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.150
 etcetera and other people that simply 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.710
 because as I came one day that 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.180
 after trying it several times or not 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.860
 I see the first one and I tell you that I was 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.320
 the cazurros that had left him one hundred 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.229
 times then one day suddenly I said I'm 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.300
 until the tip of the smoking cock that 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.250
 lead the team thank you so much 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.170
 you helped for me was key to 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.930
 when I quit smoking it was to raise awareness 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.220
 says once and for all I want to leave 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.500
 of smoking the truth that was up to the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.320
 cock and I was sick of going to sleep and 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.910
 say pussy you know ashtray and now it's 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.560
 much easier because by not being able to smoke 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.000
 neither in discotheques nor in bars 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.220
 restaurants and so on 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.320
 or in offices obviously, it is 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.360
 much easier than 15 years ago when 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.920
 you could take it from where it came from 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.780
 cock the truth is that you will say good 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.020
 equal to you and how you smoked little that is not 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.480
 true 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.800
 and we have little smoke, it cost you little not 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.050
 it's not that I was not wearing little I started 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.880
 smoking at 13 or 14 years typical in the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.680
 cole to make you the pimp and I do not know how 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.960
 it was so I do not know that I was hooked and 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.420
 It was mine until I was 30 or 17 years old 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.400
 smoking had smoked more years than 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.040
 I had not smoked that you say good is that 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.540
 Like you smoked for pleasure because I 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.220
 truth is that I think not some of the day 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.050
 the typical of after eating like this 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.540
 yes but I think the other was part 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.520
 for anxiety part by custom part 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.220
 for vice part for being hooked or 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.450
 whatever it is so that I plan you a 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.190
 challenge and the challenge is the hashtag today I leave 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.830

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.780
 who has gone back to smoking and the other thing that 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.700
 going well is because the people around 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.610
 because you will not be controlling all the 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.410
 so long on twitter on twitter now 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.220
 I stop smoking 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.880
 now I stop smoking one of the things that 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.410
 more helped me was to think out a 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.230
 ultra man I have finished three media 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.099
 ironmans and I am unable to beat the 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.269
 tobacco how much have I overcome all this 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.650
 a disease if you have won the 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.209
 work that you have every day 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.060
 problems etc so think the same 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.380
 a fucking cigar is going to break me and it's 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.340
 that if you are very happy smoking 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.960
 yourselves 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.030
 I come back running that I still have 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.290
 six kilometers to run and I look for 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.090

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.830

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.510

 gentlemen who know those of runners watch 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.560

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.360
 sanjuán you are a slob already has or I do you 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.610
 case which I have left here below in 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.710
 the description the article of why it goes 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.930
 well do sport to stop smoking 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.030
 first of all generates eye endorphins 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.560
 that said endorphin not in two world in 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.419
 two mountains what of the application these 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.789
 ends generates hundreds of goods with which 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.500
 it makes you feel good second how are you going to 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.320
 be a fan for buns and you're going to put 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.030
 More morcillo than same freight because it goes 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.530
 well that you do some sport to 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.720

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.990

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.350
 good that I have monkey to stop smoking 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.820
 because in the end that does not stop being 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.090
 nicotine and all these things that 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.220
 they hook up then running 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.680
 and generating all this adrenaline is 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.330
 adrenaline discharge because the truth is 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.010

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.310
 youtube or on Instagram or wherever you want 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.020
 and very important among all I draw the 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.310
 Bethlehem panties were very beautiful 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.470
 they are not but if you have to go to the market 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.100
 to buy two kilos of caval potatoes 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.100
 whole to the center
