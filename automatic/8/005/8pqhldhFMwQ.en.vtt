the girders and it's just this little

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440 
the girders and it's just this little
pipe<00:01:13.140> sticking<00:01:13.439> out<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.950> water<00:01:14.299> now<00:01:15.299> what

just<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.350> keep<00:01:28.439> swimming<00:01:28.770> against<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
just want to keep swimming against it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.490 
just want to keep swimming against it
and<00:01:29.490> tapping<00:01:29.909> X's<00:01:30.270> keep<00:01:30.479> swimming<00:01:30.810> tapping<00:01:31.320> X

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and tapping X's keep swimming tapping X

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.260 
and tapping X's keep swimming tapping X
and<00:01:31.740> eventually<00:01:32.189> you'll<00:01:32.340> see<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.060> get

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and eventually you'll see here I get

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.480 
and eventually you'll see here I get
through<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.930> climb<00:01:34.439> up<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.770> steel<00:01:34.979> beam<00:01:35.220> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
through I climb up to the steel beam and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.030 
through I climb up to the steel beam and
I'm<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.700> now<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:36.869> happens<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
I'm in now what happens here is the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160 
I'm in now what happens here is the
water<00:01:38.310> Yanks<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.090> down<00:01:39.390> being<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
water Yanks you down being that the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.810 
water Yanks you down being that the
currents<00:01:40.500> are<00:01:40.560> strong<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.040> Yangtze<00:01:41.310> Wonder

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
currents are strong in Yangtze Wonder

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.289 
currents are strong in Yangtze Wonder
water<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.799> float<00:01:43.829> slowly<00:01:44.820> back<00:01:45.270> up

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
water and then you float slowly back up

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.960 
water and then you float slowly back up
to<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> top<00:01:45.960> before<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.439> drown<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:47.820> don't

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
to the top before you drown you don't

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.370 
to the top before you drown you don't
have<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.180> touch<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.420> controller<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.229> this

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
have to touch a controller to do this

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.929 
have to touch a controller to do this
you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.740> leave<00:01:49.860> control<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you can leave control you can go to the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.910 
you can leave control you can go to the
movies<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.329> okay<00:01:51.720> well<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.259> think<00:01:52.470> eventually

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
movies you okay well I think eventually

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
movies you okay well I think eventually
you'll<00:01:53.250> get<00:01:53.369> AF<00:01:53.670> KKK's<00:01:54.149> we're<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.450> touching

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
you'll get AF KKK's we're not touching

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.999 
you'll get AF KKK's we're not touching
your<00:01:54.810> controller<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.380> while<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> have

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
your controller for a while so you have

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.819 
your controller for a while so you have
to<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.399> periodically<00:01:56.930> but<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.680> don't

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
to do that periodically but you don't

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
to do that periodically but you don't
have<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> Kentucky<00:01:59.579> controller<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.360> this

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
have the Kentucky controller to do this

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.389 
have the Kentucky controller to do this
personally<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:01.950> gonna<00:02:02.070> take<00:02:02.310> advantage

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
personally I'm not gonna take advantage

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.010 
personally I'm not gonna take advantage
of<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.630> much<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> an

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
of this because I'm not much of an

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.780 
of this because I'm not much of an
exploiter<00:02:04.439> kind<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:04.979> ruin<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.219> purpose<00:02:05.640> of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
exploiter kind of ruin the purpose of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.789 
exploiter kind of ruin the purpose of
the<00:02:05.880> game<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.210> me<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.719> don't<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
the game for me I don't know I like to

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.910 
the game for me I don't know I like to
unlock<00:02:08.129> things<00:02:08.340> slowly<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:09.709> for<00:02:10.709> those<00:02:10.860> who

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
unlock things slowly but for those who

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.760 
unlock things slowly but for those who
lung<00:02:11.790> capacity<00:02:12.330> is

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
lung capacity is

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.500 
lung capacity is
really<00:02:13.130> much<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.520> mean<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.700> be<00:02:13.820> honest<00:02:14.090> how<00:02:14.240> long

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
really much I mean to be honest how long

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.760 
really much I mean to be honest how long
do<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.690> spend<00:02:14.870> in<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> water

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
do you spend in the water

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.460 
do you spend in the water
um<00:02:16.760> once<00:02:17.090> again<00:02:17.360> here's<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.750> map<00:02:17.990> just<00:02:18.230> for<00:02:18.440> a

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
um once again here's the map just for a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.840 
um once again here's the map just for a
reference<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.040> where<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.370> wanna<00:02:19.610> be

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
reference of where you wanna be

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.550 
reference of where you wanna be
um<00:02:21.550> but<00:02:22.550> yeah<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.450> be<00:02:23.480> honest<00:02:23.840> how<00:02:24.140> long<00:02:24.380> do<00:02:24.530> you

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
um but yeah to be honest how long do you

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.410 
um but yeah to be honest how long do you
spend<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.160> water<00:02:25.460> I<00:02:25.790> doubt<00:02:26.090> people<00:02:26.120> are

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
spend in the water I doubt people are

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.610 
spend in the water I doubt people are
gonna<00:02:26.570> be<00:02:26.660> swimming<00:02:26.960> so<00:02:27.140> much<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.500> are

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
gonna be swimming so much of that are

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.380 
gonna be swimming so much of that are
gonna<00:02:27.740> cat<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:28.190> out<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.610> is<00:02:28.790> probably<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
gonna cat this out this is probably the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.780 
gonna cat this out this is probably the
best<00:02:29.630> way<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.870> level<00:02:30.200> out<00:02:30.470> your<00:02:30.500> water<00:02:30.920> while

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
best way to level out your water while

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.470 
best way to level out your water while
your<00:02:32.000> lung<00:02:32.450> capacity<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:33.760> yeah<00:02:34.760> it's<00:02:35.210> also<00:02:35.360> a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
your lung capacity and yeah it's also a

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.160 
your lung capacity and yeah it's also a
little<00:02:35.690> hard<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.080> get<00:02:36.260> out<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:37.750> as<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.930> said<00:02:38.990> I

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
little hard to get out of it as I said I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.870 
little hard to get out of it as I said I
didn't<00:02:39.530> use<00:02:39.650> this<00:02:39.800> exploit<00:02:40.250> all<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:40.670> much

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
didn't use this exploit all that much

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.940 
didn't use this exploit all that much
except<00:02:41.780> when<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.930> first<00:02:42.140> found<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.500> just<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.800> see

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
except when I first found it just to see

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.590 
except when I first found it just to see
if<00:02:43.070> I<00:02:43.130> can<00:02:43.280> actually<00:02:43.550> level<00:02:43.850> up<00:02:43.940> my<00:02:44.120> skill<00:02:44.360> from

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
if I can actually level up my skill from

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.410 
if I can actually level up my skill from
it<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:44.960> can<00:02:45.400> um<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.730> takes<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.240> while

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
it and you can um it takes a while

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.360 
it and you can um it takes a while
though<00:02:47.810> but<00:02:48.200> being<00:02:48.800> that<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.040> don't<00:02:49.190> have<00:02:49.250> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
though but being that you don't have to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.190 
though but being that you don't have to
touch<00:02:49.490> controller<00:02:49.940> do<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.180> can<00:02:50.270> go<00:02:50.390> afk<00:02:50.690> what

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
touch controller do you can go afk what

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.690 
touch controller do you can go afk what
and<00:02:51.410> do<00:02:51.530> whatever<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:51.890> hell<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:52.070> want<00:02:52.370> go<00:02:52.670> on

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
and do whatever the hell you want go on

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.380 
and do whatever the hell you want go on
the<00:02:52.850> internet<00:02:53.060> watch<00:02:53.930> TV<00:02:54.380> whatever<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.390> your

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
the internet watch TV whatever and your

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.540 
the internet watch TV whatever and your
water<00:02:56.750> breathing<00:02:57.260> your<00:02:57.710> lung<00:02:57.950> capacity<00:02:57.980> will

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
water breathing your lung capacity will

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.510 
water breathing your lung capacity will
still<00:02:58.820> go<00:02:59.000> up<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.450> think<00:02:59.720> that's<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.200> great<00:03:00.320> deal

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
still go up I think that's a great deal

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.250 
still go up I think that's a great deal
