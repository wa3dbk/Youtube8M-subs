00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
example I don't know 7-zip you need to

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.830 
example I don't know 7-zip you need to
install<00:04:33.080> on<00:04:33.440> your<00:04:33.470> virtual<00:04:33.890> desktop<00:04:34.370> so<00:04:35.270> click

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
install on your virtual desktop so click

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.030 
install on your virtual desktop so click
here<00:04:35.870> install<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.890> run<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:38.920> after<00:04:39.920> it

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
here install and run and after it

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.670 
here install and run and after it
installs<00:04:40.250> it<00:04:40.940> start<00:04:41.420> right<00:04:42.430> so<00:04:43.430> that's<00:04:44.210> the

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
installs it start right so that's the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.740 
installs it start right so that's the
points<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.860> these<00:04:46.070> it's<00:04:47.030> really<00:04:47.540> interesting

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
points of these it's really interesting

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.190 
points of these it's really interesting
solution<00:04:48.530> it's<00:04:48.890> based<00:04:49.160> on<00:04:49.570> cloud<00:04:50.570> computing

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
solution it's based on cloud computing

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.040 
solution it's based on cloud computing
so<00:04:52.190> maybe<00:04:52.610> there<00:04:53.000> are<00:04:53.150> even<00:04:53.480> some<00:04:53.750> better

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
so maybe there are even some better

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.530 
so maybe there are even some better
solutions<00:04:57.050> on<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.800> web<00:04:57.980> so<00:04:58.370> if<00:04:58.760> anyone<00:04:59.210> finds

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
solutions on the web so if anyone finds
