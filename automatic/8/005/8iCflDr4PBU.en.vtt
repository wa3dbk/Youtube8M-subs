00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.790
 for these little ones we are going to occupy the 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:14.650
 following ingredients 2 containers 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:18.830

 three eggs salt baking soda and 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.130
 icing sugar 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.529
 and clear the molds for the little ones 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.340
 then we will preheat the oven to 180 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.290
 degrees we are going to put in a bowl 100 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.450
 grams of flour that are three quarters of 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.240
 Cup 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.430
 together with the flour we are going to put half 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.270
 tablespoon of baking soda and a quarter of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.270
 tablespoon salt 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.969
 this we are going to stir well and what 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.969
 we will save for later 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.400
 in the other bowl we are going to put half 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.910
 Sugar cup 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.690
 and 100 grams of butter that are 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.180
 past two thirds cup 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.940
 that we will beat well until 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.250
 It is well undone that you have something left 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.290
 so now we are going to add 2 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.460
 tablespoons vanilla essence and 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.460
 let 's go back to rummage 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.649
 and there we are going to add with a colander the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.649
 flour that we had prepared 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.600
 then we will continue to beat until 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.590
 get a homogeneous mixture more or less 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.590
 for three minutes 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.530
 and now we will start filling 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.530
 molds for equipment 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.420
 since we finished filling the molds 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.930
 of the kikitos we are going to put them in the oven 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.930
 Y 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.840
 in what our quequitos go 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.850
 to prepare the glaze in it 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.010
 container that we use to stir 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.840
 the flour the salt and the baking 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.840
 to place a cup of icing sugar 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.739
 to the sugar glass we are going to put the yolk 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.739
 of an egg 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.620
 and with the plastic bottle we are going to 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.620
 remove the leads 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.650
 and we 're going to stir it with a fork 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.640
 after stirring the very well we're going 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.640
 to put another egg 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.750
 and we will stir again now let's 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.750
 split our lemon in half 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.990
 and we're going to squeeze it in our cup 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.470
 now our sugar glas with the yolks 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.830
 we are going to go putting the little juice to 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.830
 little bit 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.560
 since we put it on we are going to stir 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.020
 more when you can not stir anymore and 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.820
 see that you're well stirred him 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.060
 let's add another quarter of sugar 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.060
 glass 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.830
 and we will stir it again until 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.620
 something like that 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.240
 and you can leave it like this to apply it 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.860
 in which I remove we can only put 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.290
 some coloring to make it look more 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.780
 decorated and nice if you want to put 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.420
 dye divide the frosting into three 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.820
 equal parts and leave a little so that 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.340
 see how it looks in normal without some 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.200
 dye in the three equal parts that 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.600
 they divided they're going to apply dye 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.180
 from which you want the brushes of 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.940
 pink green and blue I will put a portion of 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.940
 coloring to each blue frosting 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.690
 green 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.190
 two 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.060
 you have to take out the kikitos first 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 little ones as they have passed 15-20 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.180
 minutes 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.400
 you have to let them cool once 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.680
 we take them out of the molds after 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.480
 we take out the little ones and the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.700
 we will take out as the little ones the 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.680
 we will let cool now we have to leave 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.130
 to cool down once they cool 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.530
 we will put the glaze we will put a point 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.830
 in the center and we'll let it spread 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.830
 single 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.470
 and that's how they would be left to rest 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.240
 Allow time for the glaze 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.550
 harden a little 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.229
 and that's how many little piquitos remained 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.360
 thanks for watching the video and we see them 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:11.639
 the next I will be trying to climb 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.639
 videos every Friday thanks
