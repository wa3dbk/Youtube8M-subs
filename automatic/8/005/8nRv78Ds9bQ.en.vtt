00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and I would certainly suggest taking the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.999 
and I would certainly suggest taking the
laser<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.659> here<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> tattoo<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.740> done

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
laser out here is a tattoo that was done

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.819 
laser out here is a tattoo that was done
a<00:01:29.490> long<00:01:29.640> time<00:01:30.119> ago<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.689> didn't<00:01:31.409> heal<00:01:31.590> well

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
a long time ago that didn't heal well

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.819 
a long time ago that didn't heal well
and<00:01:32.329> it<00:01:33.329> would<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.630> very<00:01:33.689> good<00:01:34.409> candidate

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
and it would be a very good candidate

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.910 
and it would be a very good candidate
for<00:01:35.009> removal<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:37.110> laser<00:01:37.320> treatment<00:01:37.829> on

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
for removal the laser treatment on

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.980 
for removal the laser treatment on
something<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.460> would<00:01:38.880> take<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.270> 10

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
something like this would take about 10

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.880 
something like this would take about 10
seconds<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.360> probably<00:01:42.360> run<00:01:42.720> between<00:01:43.229> 50<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
seconds and probably run between 50 and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
seconds and probably run between 50 and
100<00:01:44.100> bucks<00:01:44.460> depending<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:45.060> where<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.390> go<00:01:45.420> but

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
100 bucks depending on where you go but

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.679 
100 bucks depending on where you go but
this<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.520> would<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> very<00:01:48.390> quick

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
this would this would be a very quick

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.789 
this would this would be a very quick
fix<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:50.159> overly<00:01:50.549> expensive<00:01:51.560> scarring<00:01:52.560> on

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
fix and not overly expensive scarring on

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.219 
fix and not overly expensive scarring on
something<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.729> very<00:01:53.909> minimal

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
something like this will be very minimal

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.810 
something like this will be very minimal
would<00:01:55.229> probably<00:01:55.770> take<00:01:56.009> two<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.549> three<00:01:56.579> times

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
would probably take two to three times

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.120 
would probably take two to three times
to<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.630> completely<00:01:58.259> back<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.950> where<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
to get it completely back to where it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.240 
to get it completely back to where it
