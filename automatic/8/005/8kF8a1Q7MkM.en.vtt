 and Ismail Aissa's style but this time 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.530
 could have been completed earlier by hitting the fish 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.490
 coming off to file 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:32.350
 and on finishing on the site 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.710
 reads 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.000

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.030
 let's that ate looked at the side 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.030
 walls of the Telmar furnace 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.409
 off site 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.409
 you and drive and 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.610
 but really did not have time to run out 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.229
 Ignatiev it was he who was closest to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.910
 Alexander Filimonova at the time of transfer 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.030
 but we at the first repeat well saw 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.430
 we will surely also see the prince cool 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.819
 danced sound sean michaels more than once 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.819
 spoke 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.260
 but did not hide the fact that he on the advice 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.099
 the best in the field of motive juice childbirth and another 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.879
 innings 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.879
 thirty 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.080

 Orsk estimates 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.260
 and feed let's see what's here 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.080
 it was wrong but here 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.860
 as if he ran out osbourne was late but 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.659
 still risked and lost 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.659
 the ball flows straight to Komarovsky's head 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.730
 and in my opinion struck on the shoulder
