00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
quick I was kind of in a hurry and I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.939 
quick I was kind of in a hurry and I
just<00:00:25.760> need<00:00:25.910> something<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.270> throw<00:00:26.449> my<00:00:26.630> hair<00:00:26.869> up

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
so um the reason why I did it was

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.259 
so um the reason why I did it was
because<00:00:30.920> my<00:00:31.279> hair<00:00:31.550> was<00:00:31.580> kind<00:00:32.000> of<00:00:32.059> not

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
because my hair was kind of not

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:33.759 
because my hair was kind of not
completely<00:00:32.750> clean<00:00:32.989> like<00:00:33.199> my<00:00:33.350> bangs<00:00:33.590> were<00:00:33.739> a
