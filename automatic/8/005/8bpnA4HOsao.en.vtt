showing off today we're showing off
transistor<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> beautiful-looking

game<00:00:34.320> tell<00:00:34.590> us<00:00:34.710> about<00:00:34.860> transistor<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:35.820> makes

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
game tell us about transistor what makes

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760 
game tell us about transistor what makes
it<00:00:36.120> different<00:00:36.239> from<00:00:36.480> Bastion<00:00:37.020> what<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.649> new

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
it different from Bastion what your new

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.560 
it different from Bastion what your new
goals<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:38.879> similar<00:00:39.360> goals

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
goals are what are your similar goals

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.510 
goals are what are your similar goals
from<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:40.260> prior<00:00:40.440> game<00:00:40.710> tell<00:00:41.219> us<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:41.460> about

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
from your prior game tell us all about

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.580 
from your prior game tell us all about
it<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.120> transistor<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> new<00:00:43.170> science

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it so transistor is a new science

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.590 
it so transistor is a new science

game at any time plan out your moves
undo<00:01:04.559> them<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> don't<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.519> then

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
undo them if you don't like it and then

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.030 
undo them if you don't like it and then
hit<00:01:06.060> execute<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.830> main

character read perform all the actions
at<00:01:09.900> once<00:01:10.220> then<00:01:11.220> there's<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.549> tense<00:01:11.820> moment

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
at once then there's this tense moment

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
at once then there's this tense moment
while<00:01:12.360> your<00:01:12.540> transistor<00:01:13.260> recharges<00:01:13.770> before

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
while your transistor recharges before

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.320 
while your transistor recharges before
you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.280> use<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> again<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.210> supposed

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
you can use it again and it's supposed

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.969 
you can use it again and it's supposed
to<00:01:15.450> bring<00:01:15.630> some<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.049> sort<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.290> suspense

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
to bring some of this sort of suspense

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.800 
to bring some of this sort of suspense
and<00:01:17.189> pleasure<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.610> turn-based<00:01:17.820> games<00:01:18.270> into<00:01:18.780> a

you<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.570> good<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:21.780> talking<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.770> making

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
you are good at talking to and making

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.460 
you are good at talking to and making
video<00:01:23.310> games<00:01:23.369> oh<00:01:23.810> one<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> things<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.259> loved

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
video games oh one of the things I loved

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.160 
video games oh one of the things I loved
about<00:01:25.530> Bastion<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> narrator<00:01:26.990> how<00:01:27.990> have

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
about Bastion was the narrator how have

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.690 
about Bastion was the narrator how have
you<00:01:28.229> taken<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.770> concept<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> kind<00:01:29.579> of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
you taken that concept of kind of

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.940 
you taken that concept of kind of
voiceover<00:01:30.270> during<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.659> game<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.200> used<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
voiceover during your game and used it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.499 
voiceover during your game and used it
for<00:01:31.979> transition<00:01:32.640> yeah<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.090> we're<00:01:33.329> always

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
for transition yeah so we're always

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.850 
for transition yeah so we're always
interested<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.049> doing<00:01:34.290> stuff<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.650> sort<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
interested in doing stuff with sort of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.380 
interested in doing stuff with sort of
reactive<00:01:35.340> voice<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.790> really<00:01:36.000> worked<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.299> us

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
reactive voice that really worked for us

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.880 
reactive voice that really worked for us
in<00:01:36.570> Bastion<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.079> bashing<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.530> narrator<00:01:37.829> was

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
in Bastion in bashing the narrator was

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.859 
in Bastion in bashing the narrator was
