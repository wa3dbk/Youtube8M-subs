boat itself the offending winch as you

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.060 
boat itself the offending winch as you
can<00:00:33.280> probably<00:00:33.460> hear<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:35.260> sits<00:00:35.559> there<00:00:35.739> and<00:00:35.920> sort

can probably hear it sits there and sort
of<00:00:36.129> mumbles<00:00:36.580> to<00:00:36.730> itself<00:00:37.030> most<00:00:37.330> of<00:00:37.449> the<00:00:37.510> time<00:00:37.690> in

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
of mumbles to itself most of the time in

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.729 
of mumbles to itself most of the time in
that<00:00:37.960> position<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.690> ship<00:00:40.690> control<00:00:41.079> here<00:00:41.620> is

that position the ship control here is

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.450 
that position the ship control here is
right<00:00:41.980> down<00:00:42.339> moments<00:00:43.089> and<00:00:43.449> the<00:00:43.860> trim<00:00:44.860> is<00:00:45.190> just

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
right down moments and the trim is just

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.990 
right down moments and the trim is just
in<00:00:45.610> center<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.230> if<00:00:47.829> you<00:00:47.980> see<00:00:48.160> that<00:00:48.340> the<00:00:48.520> the

near<00:01:21.970> got<00:01:22.209> half<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.569> turn<00:01:22.810> after<00:01:23.110> after<00:01:23.709> about

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
near got half a turn after after about

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.330 
near got half a turn after after about
four<00:01:24.160> cycles<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:24.970> just<00:01:25.569> moving<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.619> sheets<00:01:27.099> a

four cycles of just moving the sheets a

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.510 
four cycles of just moving the sheets a
little<00:01:27.640> why

if we get all the wine that's this way
and<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:41.899> half<00:01:42.049> turns<00:01:42.380> those<00:01:42.679> capable<00:01:43.189> when<00:01:43.520> I

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
and a half turns those capable when I

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.180 
and a half turns those capable when I
come<00:01:43.789> back

the right place on there I added it
about<00:02:41.180> one<00:02:41.330> o'clock<00:02:41.450> previously<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.590> when<00:02:43.280> I

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
moved it away like so when I rigged up

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.660 
moved it away like so when I rigged up
to<00:02:47.930> return<00:02:48.290> back<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.740> same<00:02:49.040> do<00:02:49.430> what

should have been the same place with the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.240 
should have been the same place with the
same<00:02:51.020> stick<00:02:51.440> position<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:51.950> would<00:02:52.070> return

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
same stick position it would return

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.760 
same stick position it would return

u-turns for the fifth problem which is

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.510 
u-turns for the fifth problem which is
just<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.989> nice<00:03:12.140> three<00:03:12.530> circles<00:03:13.010> or<00:03:13.220> nearly

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
just a nice three circles or nearly

particular<00:03:15.470> setter<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:17.360> we<00:03:17.510> put<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.750> back<00:03:17.959> and

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
particular setter and we put it back and

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.100 
particular setter and we put it back and
look<00:03:20.239> at<00:03:20.360> that<00:03:20.480> it's<00:03:20.660> still<00:03:20.870> in<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.080> same

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
look at that it's still in the same

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.240 
look at that it's still in the same
place<00:03:22.840> marvelous<00:03:23.840> stuff<00:03:24.080> it's<00:03:24.890> going<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.130> make

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
place marvelous stuff it's going to make

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.530 
place marvelous stuff it's going to make
all<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.520> difference<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:26.030> maybe<00:03:26.209> now<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.450> can

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
all the difference that maybe now I can

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.120 
all the difference that maybe now I can
get<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.810> sails<00:03:27.140> so<00:03:27.440> that<00:03:27.680> they<00:03:27.800> should<00:03:27.860> be

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
get the sails so that they should be

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.910 
get the sails so that they should be
where<00:03:28.280> they're<00:03:28.459> supposed<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.820> be
