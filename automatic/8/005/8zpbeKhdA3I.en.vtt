00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.300
 yes we come to the last of a biological part and that medical 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.720
 microbiology 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.669
 that is a part Dr 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.519
 in the last few years in physics have come to meaning a bit lost 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.230
 And indeed the question of the questions portion food west are a bit diminished 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.019
 in favor of 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.929
 more 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.079
 So biology, that is molecular and cell biology 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.630
 nevertheless, the meaning of medical microbiology is fundamental 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.810
 too busy 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.859
 because here 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.879
 Of course, the properties of certain bacteria hide behind it 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.410
 under that, too, a topic which is always good for one two three questions 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.960
 is 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.560
 what else there is to give world are the characteristics of certain we would 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.920
 and percent 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.220
 Heiri v and now also some other viruses 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.379
 such as influenza viruses 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.710
 that is so basic features of virus world war action and 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 Propagation are also in demand by now 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.130
 besides that happens again and again in the question 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.500
 which goes in the direction of mushrooms that means mushrooms and fungal toxins 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.030
 and what mechanism these mushroom poisons have and how mushrooms are from others 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.659
 Distinguish organisms 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.790
 so that they have characteristics forums percent 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.590
 Know microorganisms 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.590
 and let us have a look over the 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.240
 to give microorganisms 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.380
 And pathogenic microorganisms fall naturally on one side 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.580
 protozoa 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.110
 in order that I divide again into bacteria mushrooms and production 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.870
 and right away, which is of crucial importance for any questions 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.940
 Bacteria per Kari are down and fungi and protozoa 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.870
 ECG Kari and best times that means everything we do in cell biology 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.170
 have discussed 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.360
 What kind of herbs rea and tables cells money that applies in principle 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.040
 for mushrooms and protozoa but not for bacteria 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.020
 In the middle are then the Irish and British without a social doctrine 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.159
 particle 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.659
 Bobby without Nissen special case that's infection is a protein particle there 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.589
 I'll just say something about it but not much 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.929
 while at the virus that is a bit more to know it does not say it 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:24.709
 already mainly HPV and give influenza viruses or fundamental 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.079
 about virus multiplication 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.559
 on the right side there are the Meta Zone under for example the worms 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:35.269
 So that's not the point that their PP has yet to master - that's one thing 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.269
 the RS approaches you after the Physikum 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.439
 the different ways of life of pathogenic mechanisms were no 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.550
 until recently again and again topic in questions 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.520
 and I have him show me his table by means of which they are the different ones 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.119
 Lifestyles to Watchmen can 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.690
 and this table is so pulled read 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.799
 that you can combine these individual columns with each other 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.729
 for example 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:08.119
 Photo Car Trophy yes so photo 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:10.219
 AUD too 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.870
 this is understood to mean beaver plants that are photosynthesized by boars 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.470
 That means that cars are dead 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.739
 the former 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.680
 To help them put an Irishman in quotes with help 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.630
 the light energy and farmer can build up shot substances 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.609
 that means photo car troph 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.519
 the energy source is drawn on the left side and if light is on 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.689
 the energy source is then it is just photo 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.140
 when the electron Donath gate 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.450
 and because only those who wander will be organic compound electron donors from around 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.039
 we have of the as nutrient 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:54.089
 So if the carbon is in front of the source off the car trophy then so if so too 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:58.389
 Trophic say then inorganic compounds would be the source 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:04.199
 So photo car trophy who at Ebern referring to green plants just 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.279
 that they can just do photosynthesis and carbon dioxide as the only 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:09.709
 source 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.420
 I'll bring a few examples right away 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.170
 which are important 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.870
 we were called shame emergency call 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.910
 that of energy production 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.360
 yes, the energy gained through the implementation of connections 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.530
 and percent 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.979
 in this implementation of this connection way energy free 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.949
 and those processes where energy is released are mostly Boxed 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.360
 Actions processes that they can seamlessly on our metabolic situation 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.520
 transfer 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.449
 Photo Tor on site at the next race the necessary light as an energy source 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.749
 so they do not oxidize nutrients but use the light 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.530
 Organ emergency call 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.060
 means that compounds are used organic nature 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.860
 and which are then used as electron donors 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.910
 that he does not leave the whole thing so abstract are in front of him 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.180
 metabolize carbohydrates 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.460
 then these become carbohydrates of the dead 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.809
 and cabbage miter are just organic compounds so organs emergency call 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:14.599
 Leto consolation would be in the Iceman the just inorganic compounds as 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.719
 Energy source can use and Maier well there we do not of course 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.539
 but these are of course bacteria that can do that
