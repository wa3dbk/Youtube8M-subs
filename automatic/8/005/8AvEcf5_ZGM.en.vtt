that but I don't think it's really fair
if<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.660> change<00:01:45.900> rulings<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.920> makes<00:01:47.190> no

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
if they change rulings on it it makes no

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.510 
if they change rulings on it it makes no
sense<00:01:47.460> why<00:01:48.360> would<00:01:48.680> why<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
sense why would why do we have to have a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.670 
sense why would why do we have to have a
different<00:01:50.820> ruling<00:01:51.270> than<00:01:51.920> ocg<00:01:54.140> like<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.530> know
