00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.700
 ah 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.849
 hello how about you guys in this video I'm going 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.769
 to teach the best way with a lot 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.259
 much difference to make pasta now 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.990
 same in the gta iv I advise you to give it 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:22.150
 cane before they leave because 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.100
 same arrives at the 1.10 the 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.770
 mansions and you have to have pasta for 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.990
 buy it all 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.480
 for this trick we're going to need a 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.840
 bike my advice the bmx is the cheapest 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.570
 800 dots are at fault a car of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.730
 the 1.09 update if you did not have 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.380
 none is as simple as that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.450
 you buy the cheapest one and from there 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.890
 you are doing enough to go buying 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.260
 better cars and that you walk more 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.210
 because for doing the trick once 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.129
 let's have all things clear and ready 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.510
 and ready we will take the car with the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.310
 that we are going to do the trick and we will leave 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.650
 from the garage 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.780
 once we are out of the garage we 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.400
 let's lower the two of the car because 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.770
 you will have to prepare a small trampita 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.630
 to say it somehow then 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.910
 imp that is going to stay 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.410
 by helping out what he's going to do 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.380
 is getting out of the car 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.330
 come here where you see that I go I see 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.700
 the marks that stay on the floor 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.490
 skid those marks leave them always 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.500
 the cars when they leave the garage 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.290
 then the partner then go to help 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.210
 what to do is that area fill it with c4 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.760
 for when we go out with the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.740
 bike bust more 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.600
 it has to be with c4 it is necessarily 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.550
 because the pac has to go back 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.780
 from inside the car if he were going to 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.490
 kill from outside the car when 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.200
 we were going out because with the bike 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.700
 our car would disappear 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.500
 automatically and reappear inside 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.350
 of the garage that's why it's mandatory that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.300
 be c4 once everything is ready 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.490
 Imp is stuck in the car with the 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.550
 makes four bets waiting for me 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.670
 I'll take the bike and I'll go out 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.050
 outside when you are passing over 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.330
 the cheating line that has made me 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.290
 Imp what he will do is catch up 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.370
 on and he warlike to fry asparagus 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.110
 reappear we have quietly do not 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.729
 missing go to play store or turn off the play 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.220
 or make a thousand moves as they were 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.560
 before it is simply reappear and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.900
 tell him hey talk speak come and pick me up 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.580
 wherever the boy comes pick me up 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.940
 quietly because I'm going to walk 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.520
 It's already there and we're going to sell the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.200
 car, nothing to do 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.730
 just go out with the bike that the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.740
 Bust colleagues and sell the car 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.209
 solve or you do not have to go to play store 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.500
 in want me to the story mode there is no need 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.650
 walk around changing from 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.500
 characters 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.989
 once we get to the garage and sell 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.040
 the car when leaving the garage what yes 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.900
 what should be taken into account is that 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.879
 we'll have to call the mechanic to 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.829
 ask them to ask him to bring us closer 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.680
 car if we went back to our 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.269
 garage and we entered our garage 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.829
 we could get to lose the vehicle what 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.689
 what we have to do is just as 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.819
 sell we restore outside the 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.439
 garage we take out the mobile we call the 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.450
 mechanic and we tell him to bring it to us 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.909
 once the mechanic has brought us the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.680
 car we go back to the garage we left another 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.780
 time with the bike and we repeat the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.780
 process for this trick or you have to 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.909
 wait 45 minutes or need to be 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.579
 turning off and on the platinum and the 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.440
 online and that neither history nor change 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.750
 character or that is bursting 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.849
 vehicles simply a bike of 800 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.409
 so guys for me with a lot 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.389
 difference this is the best trick that 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.450
 there is to take advantage of it now that it will arrive 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:26.480
