what<00:00:42.450> does<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.570> mean<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.260> colors<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.940> let's

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
what does that mean for colors so let's

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.760 
what does that mean for colors so let's
count<00:00:45.510> them<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:46.500> two<00:00:46.710> three<00:00:51.050> how<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.469> make

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
count them one two three how do you make

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.459 
count them one two three how do you make
the<00:00:53.010> fourth<00:00:53.309> color<00:00:53.640> appear<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:55.800> stress<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
the fourth color appear you stress it

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.790 
the fourth color appear you stress it
the<00:00:58.469> fourth<00:00:58.859> color<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.699> rosy<00:01:00.449> red<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the fourth color is rosy red and the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.030 
the fourth color is rosy red and the
leaf<00:01:02.070> margins<00:01:02.879> will<00:01:03.239> turn<00:01:03.600> red<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.799> this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
leaf margins will turn red when this

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.850 
leaf margins will turn red when this
plant<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.549> stressed<00:01:05.939> meaning<00:01:06.689> given<00:01:07.439> too<00:01:07.680> much

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
plant is stressed meaning given too much

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.109 
plant is stressed meaning given too much
Sun<00:01:08.460> too<00:01:09.299> much<00:01:09.479> cold<00:01:09.930> or<00:01:10.590> at<00:01:10.920> poor<00:01:11.220> soil<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
Sun too much cold or at poor soil and

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.380 
Sun too much cold or at poor soil and
less<00:01:12.930> water<00:01:13.320> than<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.189> plant<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.909> wants

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
less water than the plant really wants

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.219 
less water than the plant really wants
without<00:01:15.869> going<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.590> far<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.490> kill<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
without going so far that you kill it

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.920 
without going so far that you kill it
okay<00:01:19.229> now<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:21.119> now<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.330> nice<00:01:21.659> thing

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.929 
okay now if you want now the nice thing
about<00:01:22.020> Quadra<00:01:22.680> color<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.490> need<00:01:23.670> from<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
about Quadra color and I need from a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.810 
about Quadra color and I need from a
design<00:01:24.390> standpoint<00:01:24.890> look<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> symmetry

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
design standpoint look at the symmetry

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.480 
design standpoint look at the symmetry
of<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.060> plant<00:01:27.390> isn't<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.840> exquisite<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.740> am

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
of this plant isn't it exquisite I am

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.600 
of this plant isn't it exquisite I am
testing<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.119> in<00:01:30.299> my<00:01:30.479> own<00:01:30.689> garden<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
testing it in my own garden and I have a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.210 
testing it in my own garden and I have a
slope<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.479> see<00:01:33.840> from<00:01:34.530> my<00:01:34.740> office<00:01:34.979> window

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
slope that I see from my office window

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.960 
slope that I see from my office window
and<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.810> are<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.890> slope<00:01:38.400> sort<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and these are on that slope sort of

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.560 
and these are on that slope sort of
staggered<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.490> mean<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:42.540> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
staggered and they they just I mean at a

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.740 
staggered and they they just I mean at a
glance<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.369> slope<00:01:44.759> sparkles

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
glance it's like the slope sparkles

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.280 
glance it's like the slope sparkles
because<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.920> such<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.430> marvelous<00:01:47.880> star

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.310 

it's<00:01:54.290> expensive<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:56.600> doesn't<00:01:57.020> get<00:01:57.140> much

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
it's expensive it doesn't get much

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.750 
it's expensive it doesn't get much
bigger<00:01:57.530> than<00:01:57.680> this<00:01:57.830> it's<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.250> perfect<00:01:58.610> pot

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
bigger than this it's a perfect pot

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.700 
bigger than this it's a perfect pot
