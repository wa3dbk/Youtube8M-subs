00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.030
 the ecoboost 950 engine 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.480
 designed to give it greater towing power than photo 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.639
 keystone 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.639
 and a couple higher than the competing methane rate 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.960
 creature of god 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 now we're going to show the world what it means 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.380
 pernod ricard won 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.359
 it's an ecoboost engine randomly chosen not subjected to the worst 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.550
 Longevity theses 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.550
 to prove what it is despite several injuries 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.750
 in the middle Ages 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.750
 we had all kinds of torture gear 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.230
 today 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 as for the dynamic test room 36 countries 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.780
 with that the usa accelerate the engine to make it undergo 10 years 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.230
 intensive use 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.880
 in 305 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.520
 the means we learn about how our customers use our 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.480
 products and we push them to the extreme haye extreme temperatures 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.120
 Extreme extreme speed loading 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.090
 it will not take ten years to make the equivalent of 241 8 400 km I know 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.400
 a few weeks or months only a dynamometer signs the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.590
 four year tow 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.470

 ban ki-moon 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.870
 very bad 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.650
 for the biker fatick thesis 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.140
 piggyback 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.140
 at full speed 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.320
 after 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.070
 it's never delivered 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.120
 the counselor -20 degrees the internationalization of temperatures 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.120
 as to the chances of his central sick daughter to win 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.020
 better when you've done extreme heat an already very cold engine 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.219
 he begins to dilate in a very design way points of tension 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.250
 begins to appear in the box he greatly 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.930
 it's like not enough rti to serve late in 15 minutes 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.000
 and even 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.630
 and even 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.680
 sincere 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.810
 it is impossible for the client to reproduce the conditions that are simulated 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.890
 it exists on the base on earth on which one could roll in these 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.210
 conditions by passing one extreme temperature to another as quickly 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.589
 he sat down chained one after the other 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:15.829
 after 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.369
 day after day 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.369
 malaysia and indonesia 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.960
 these are friends have awarded 241 8 4 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.870
 on this engine or 2002 after finishing he's asking again engine for 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.850
 inspect it and make sure everything worked perfectly because it's 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.450
 it could be seen as a range assembly plant as well as being installed in 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.739
 a truck a year before what other engine 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.279
 tandja 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.279
 howell 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:53.569
 the local press hand does the equivalent of 241 8 400 km 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.059
 we might think that it has been proven but when you have precisely 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.719
 Do you think 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.579
 during the week of April 21 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.139
 I leave
