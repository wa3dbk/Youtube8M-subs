00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
out the vertical slots that I got in

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.260 
out the vertical slots that I got in
there<00:03:01.870> with<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.110> Dremel<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.700> now<00:03:04.000> I'm<00:03:04.150> gonna

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
there with the Dremel so now I'm gonna

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.690 
there with the Dremel so now I'm gonna
I've<00:03:05.260> got<00:03:05.470> my<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.130> think<00:03:06.370> that's<00:03:06.490> a<00:03:06.580> good

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
I've got my and I think that's a good

I've got my and I think that's a good
shot<00:03:06.850> of<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.060> there<00:03:07.240> so<00:03:08.200> I've<00:03:08.260> got<00:03:08.380> my<00:03:09.840> flathead

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
shot of it there so I've got my flathead

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.710 
shot of it there so I've got my flathead
bit<00:03:11.080> out<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.560> will<00:03:12.190> try<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:12.850> unscrew<00:03:13.360> these<00:03:13.480> now

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
bit out I will try and unscrew these now

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.860 
bit out I will try and unscrew these now
let<00:03:14.320> me<00:03:14.380> just<00:03:14.530> move<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.830> camera<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.750> we'll<00:03:16.750> be

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
let me just move the camera and we'll be

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.330 
let me just move the camera and we'll be
right<00:03:16.990> back<00:03:17.140> with<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:19.890> alright<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.160> give

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
right back with that alright so I give

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.680 
right back with that alright so I give
it<00:03:21.370> an<00:03:21.520> initial<00:03:21.610> try<00:03:22.000> here<00:03:22.270> and<00:03:22.390> I'm<00:03:22.450> still

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
it an initial try here and I'm still

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.420 
it an initial try here and I'm still
having<00:03:22.840> some<00:03:23.050> difficulty<00:03:23.620> one<00:03:24.010> tip<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.280> I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
having some difficulty one tip that I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.940 
having some difficulty one tip that I
did<00:03:24.640> see<00:03:24.790> online<00:03:24.990> is<00:03:25.990> that<00:03:26.380> they<00:03:26.530> do<00:03:26.590> use<00:03:26.830> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
did see online is that they do use the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.650 
did see online is that they do use the
Loctite<00:03:27.640> on<00:03:27.960> on<00:03:28.960> these<00:03:29.140> clip<00:03:29.830> screws<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:31.300> what

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
Loctite on on these clip screws so what

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.880 
Loctite on on these clip screws so what
I'm<00:03:31.750> going<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.900> try<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.200> do<00:03:32.320> is<00:03:32.410> just<00:03:32.560> heat

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
I'm going to try and do is just heat

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.420 
I'm going to try and do is just heat
them<00:03:33.100> up<00:03:33.450> with<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.960> soldering<00:03:35.320> iron<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.890> see<00:03:36.340> if

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
them up with a soldering iron and see if

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.580 
them up with a soldering iron and see if
I<00:03:36.610> can<00:03:38.460> see<00:03:39.460> if<00:03:39.550> I<00:03:39.670> can<00:03:40.050> loosen<00:03:41.050> up<00:03:41.260> some<00:03:41.500> of

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
I can see if I can loosen up some of

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:56.180 
I can see if I can loosen up some of
that<00:03:41.620> Loctite<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.910> I'll<00:03:43.030> give<00:03:43.210> it<00:03:43.270> another<00:03:43.330> go

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:16.930 

alright<00:03:57.190> let's<00:03:57.400> see<00:03:57.550> what<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.700> does

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:36.740 

there<00:04:17.940> we<00:04:18.090> go

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:53.760 

all<00:04:37.750> right<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.470> can<00:04:38.620> get<00:04:38.740> this<00:04:38.919> last<00:04:39.160> one<00:04:52.770> then

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
all right you can get this last one then

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.460 
all right you can get this last one then
frame<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:54.250> little<00:04:54.430> better<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:56.050> I've<00:04:56.169> just<00:04:56.200> got

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
frame a little better so I've just got

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.610 
frame a little better so I've just got
the<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:57.130> soldering<00:04:57.430> iron<00:04:57.550> right<00:04:57.910> in<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.620> the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
the the soldering iron right in the the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.900 
the the soldering iron right in the the
new<00:04:59.740> group<00:04:59.980> that<00:05:00.190> we<00:05:00.250> made<00:05:00.460> with<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.700> dremel

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
new group that we made with the dremel

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.610 
new group that we made with the dremel
and<00:05:04.950> hopefully<00:05:05.950> this<00:05:06.100> is<00:05:07.080> doing<00:05:08.080> its<00:05:08.169> job<00:05:08.350> to

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
and hopefully this is doing its job to

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:18.740 
and hopefully this is doing its job to
heat<00:05:08.800> up<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.979> Loctite<00:05:13.470> all<00:05:14.470> right<00:05:15.990> that<00:05:16.990> aside

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
heat up the Loctite all right that aside

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.360 
heat up the Loctite all right that aside
and<00:05:19.750> just<00:05:20.320> try<00:05:20.530> and<00:05:20.650> just<00:05:20.770> get<00:05:20.889> up<00:05:21.010> this<00:05:21.100> last

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
and just try and just get up this last

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:36.660 
and just try and just get up this last
one

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.110 

alright<00:05:37.670> there<00:05:38.000> we<00:05:38.030> go<00:05:39.370> alright<00:05:40.370> so<00:05:40.520> we've<00:05:40.880> got

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
alright there we go alright so we've got

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.910 
alright there we go alright so we've got
our<00:05:41.420> clip<00:05:41.690> off<00:05:43.240> everything<00:05:44.240> removed<00:05:44.860> as<00:05:45.860> I

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
our clip off everything removed as I

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.470 
our clip off everything removed as I
mentioned<00:05:46.340> I'm<00:05:46.490> gonna<00:05:46.670> run<00:05:46.880> it<00:05:47.000> with<00:05:47.150> just<00:05:47.420> the

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
mentioned I'm gonna run it with just the

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.980 
mentioned I'm gonna run it with just the
lanyard<00:05:47.930> without<00:05:48.800> a<00:05:48.830> pocket<00:05:49.190> clip<00:05:49.840> maybe<00:05:50.840> in

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
lanyard without a pocket clip maybe in

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.170 
lanyard without a pocket clip maybe in
the<00:05:51.050> future<00:05:51.200> I'll<00:05:51.440> put<00:05:52.280> the<00:05:52.370> pocket<00:05:52.550> clip<00:05:53.000> back

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
the future I'll put the pocket clip back

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.920 
the future I'll put the pocket clip back
on<00:05:53.420> and<00:05:53.720> have<00:05:53.750> a<00:05:53.840> tip-up<00:05:54.170> carry<00:05:55.570> if<00:05:56.570> I<00:05:56.870> do

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
on and have a tip-up carry if I do

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.630 
on and have a tip-up carry if I do
decide<00:05:57.380> to<00:05:57.440> do<00:05:57.620> that<00:05:57.770> one<00:05:58.070> thing<00:05:58.100> that<00:05:58.400> I<00:05:58.430> did

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
decide to do that one thing that I did

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.360 
decide to do that one thing that I did
run<00:05:58.970> out<00:05:59.120> and<00:05:59.240> get<00:05:59.450> was<00:06:00.050> replacement<00:06:00.980> hardware

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
run out and get was replacement hardware

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.670 
run out and get was replacement hardware
so<00:06:02.360> I<00:06:02.390> don't<00:06:02.600> have<00:06:02.750> to<00:06:02.870> deal<00:06:03.050> with<00:06:03.470> this<00:06:03.560> whole

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
so I don't have to deal with this whole

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.260 
so I don't have to deal with this whole
problem<00:06:04.040> again<00:06:05.470> you'll<00:06:06.470> see<00:06:06.770> here<00:06:07.340> that<00:06:07.520> the

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
problem again you'll see here that the

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.900 
problem again you'll see here that the
replacements<00:06:08.870> that<00:06:08.930> I<00:06:09.050> did<00:06:09.260> end<00:06:09.410> up<00:06:09.500> getting

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
replacements that I did end up getting

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.800 
replacements that I did end up getting
the<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:12.440> cap<00:06:12.710> on<00:06:12.950> them<00:06:13.220> is<00:06:13.610> bigger<00:06:14.570> in

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
the the cap on them is bigger in

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.430 
the the cap on them is bigger in
diameter<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:17.180> it<00:06:17.300> is<00:06:17.390> gonna<00:06:17.510> be<00:06:17.660> a<00:06:17.690> bit<00:06:17.930> bulkier

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
diameter so it is gonna be a bit bulkier

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:25.020 
diameter so it is gonna be a bit bulkier
but<00:06:18.710> they<00:06:19.040> should<00:06:19.340> fit<00:06:20.890> should<00:06:21.890> fit<00:06:22.160> right<00:06:22.190> on

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.260 

without<00:06:26.030> too<00:06:26.810> much<00:06:26.960> issue<00:06:27.200> is<00:06:27.800> just<00:06:28.040> gonna

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
without too much issue is just gonna

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.650 
without too much issue is just gonna
look<00:06:29.270> a<00:06:29.420> bit<00:06:29.570> bulkier<00:06:30.580> for<00:06:31.580> anybody<00:06:31.910> that's

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
look a bit bulkier for anybody that's

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.020 
look a bit bulkier for anybody that's
looking<00:06:32.870> for<00:06:33.680> the<00:06:33.980> replacement<00:06:34.250> hardware<00:06:34.820> I

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
looking for the replacement hardware I

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.470 
looking for the replacement hardware I
just<00:06:35.840> went<00:06:35.990> to<00:06:36.110> my<00:06:36.140> local<00:06:36.410> hardware<00:06:36.680> store<00:06:37.100> and

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
just went to my local hardware store and

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.040 
just went to my local hardware store and
I<00:06:38.480> will<00:06:39.670> annotate<00:06:40.670> this<00:06:41.030> here<00:06:41.390> and<00:06:41.630> put<00:06:41.870> in<00:06:41.960> the
