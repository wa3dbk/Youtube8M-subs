00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
my 15 years with her was really just

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.380 
my 15 years with her was really just
an<00:02:17.599> education<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:19.340> different<00:02:19.700> thinking<00:02:20.150> I

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
an education of a different thinking I

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.569 
an education of a different thinking I
really<00:02:21.079> believe<00:02:21.500> we're<00:02:21.709> coming<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.129> a<00:02:22.159> world

really believe we're coming to a world

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.770 
really believe we're coming to a world
that<00:02:23.230> we<00:02:24.230> don't<00:02:25.000> we<00:02:26.000> don't<00:02:26.209> look<00:02:26.359> at<00:02:26.510> someone

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
that we don't we don't look at someone

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.809 
that we don't we don't look at someone
like<00:02:26.810> Lauren<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:27.560> think<00:02:27.859> you<00:02:28.250> don't<00:02:28.430> belong

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
like Lauren and think you don't belong

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.179 
like Lauren and think you don't belong
or<00:02:29.329> you're<00:02:29.629> not<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:30.049> there<00:02:30.349> or<00:02:30.709> you're<00:02:30.980> not

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
or you're not in there or you're not

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.020 
or you're not in there or you're not
important<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.969> think<00:02:32.329> that<00:02:32.680> there's<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.799> time<00:02:34.129> we

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
important I think that there's a time we

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.849 
important I think that there's a time we
will<00:02:35.209> look<00:02:35.329> at<00:02:35.480> all<00:02:35.629> individuals<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:36.590> know

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
will look at all individuals and know

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.199 
will look at all individuals and know
that<00:02:37.010> they<00:02:37.129> are<00:02:37.189> important<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.849> know<00:02:38.060> that

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
that they are important and know that

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.670 
that they are important and know that
they<00:02:38.359> are<00:02:38.390> teachers<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.200> know<00:02:39.379> that<00:02:39.500> they

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
they are teachers and know that they

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.860 
they are teachers and know that they
have<00:02:39.709> spiritual<00:02:40.430> reasons<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.510> think<00:02:41.720> that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
have spiritual reasons and I think that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.869 
have spiritual reasons and I think that
that's<00:02:42.049> very<00:02:42.439> powerful<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.519> think<00:02:43.730> it's

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
that's very powerful and I think it's

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.309 
that's very powerful and I think it's
very<00:02:44.000> important<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.480> we<00:02:44.659> look<00:02:44.840> at<00:02:44.989> each

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
very important that we look at each

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.559 
very important that we look at each
other<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.099> know<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:46.849> every<00:02:47.150> single<00:02:47.329> person

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
other and know that every single person

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.199 
other and know that every single person
is<00:02:47.840> important<00:02:48.319> and<00:02:48.579> so<00:02:49.579> it<00:02:49.790> was<00:02:49.909> an<00:02:50.030> honor

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
is important and so it was an honor

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.420 
is important and so it was an honor
being<00:02:50.510> Lauren's<00:02:50.720> mother<00:02:51.109> having<00:02:51.980> her<00:02:52.099> teach

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
being Lauren's mother having her teach

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.610 
being Lauren's mother having her teach
me<00:02:52.639> these<00:02:52.790> little<00:02:53.000> bits<00:02:53.299> and<00:02:53.480> pieces<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:54.170> it

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
me these little bits and pieces and it

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.789 
me these little bits and pieces and it
couldn't<00:02:54.950> come<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:56.000> first<00:02:56.239> year<00:02:56.650> because<00:02:57.650> the

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
couldn't come the first year because the

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.530 
couldn't come the first year because the
first<00:02:58.010> year<00:02:58.069> I<00:02:58.189> really<00:02:58.549> wasn't<00:02:58.790> even<00:02:59.030> able<00:02:59.329> to

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
first year I really wasn't even able to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.050 
first year I really wasn't even able to
deal<00:02:59.689> with<00:02:59.810> anything<00:03:00.109> except<00:03:00.680> my<00:03:01.549> feelings

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
deal with anything except my feelings

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.449 
deal with anything except my feelings
and<00:03:02.209> my<00:03:02.269> emotions<00:03:02.359> and<00:03:03.049> survival<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.919> it

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
and my emotions and survival and it

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.409 
and my emotions and survival and it
really<00:03:05.239> didn't<00:03:05.780> even<00:03:06.549> come<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.849> fifth<00:03:08.090> year

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:08.419 
really didn't even come the fifth year

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.750 
really didn't even come the fifth year
it<00:03:08.629> basically<00:03:09.290> has<00:03:09.439> been<00:03:09.680> just<00:03:09.919> a<00:03:10.040> process<00:03:10.579> of

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
it basically has been just a process of

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.089 
it basically has been just a process of
learning<00:03:11.000> from<00:03:11.480> her<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.019> I<00:03:12.560> think<00:03:12.769> when<00:03:12.889> we

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
learning from her and I think when we

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.710 
learning from her and I think when we
give<00:03:13.370> ourselves<00:03:13.549> opportunity<00:03:13.909> to<00:03:14.599> learn

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
give ourselves opportunity to learn

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.899 
give ourselves opportunity to learn
compassion<00:03:15.169> it's<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.159> very<00:03:16.370> powerful<00:03:16.609> thing

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
compassion it's a very powerful thing

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.569 
compassion it's a very powerful thing
she<00:03:17.629> was<00:03:17.780> teaching<00:03:17.989> other<00:03:18.349> people<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.889> it<00:03:19.400> was

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
she was teaching other people to it was

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.399 
she was teaching other people to it was
another<00:03:19.849> moment<00:03:20.389> that<00:03:20.629> I<00:03:20.720> had<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.019> realize

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
another moment that I had to realize

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.469 
another moment that I had to realize
that<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:21.919> wasn't<00:03:22.129> all<00:03:22.370> about<00:03:22.519> me<00:03:22.879> Lauren

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:23.479 
that it wasn't all about me Lauren

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.149 
that it wasn't all about me Lauren
didn't<00:03:23.750> come<00:03:23.959> here<00:03:24.229> and<00:03:24.319> just<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.680> teach<00:03:24.859> me

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
didn't come here and just to teach me

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.000 
didn't come here and just to teach me
she<00:03:25.970> taught<00:03:26.209> all<00:03:26.510> kinds<00:03:27.049> of<00:03:27.139> people<00:03:27.470> she

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
she taught all kinds of people she

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.589 
she taught all kinds of people she
actually<00:03:28.129> would<00:03:28.459> teach<00:03:28.669> anyone<00:03:29.209> who<00:03:29.449> would

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
actually would teach anyone who would

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.599 
actually would teach anyone who would
show<00:03:29.780> up<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.109> listen<00:03:30.500> or<00:03:30.769> maybe<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.220> observe

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
show up to listen or maybe to observe

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.599 
show up to listen or maybe to observe
and<00:03:32.000> give<00:03:32.659> her<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.870> moment<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:34.220> think<00:03:34.459> that's

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
and give her a moment and I think that's

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.520 
and give her a moment and I think that's
a<00:03:34.729> quite<00:03:34.970> powerful<00:03:35.269> thing<00:03:35.720> for<00:03:35.959> someone<00:03:36.199> to

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
a quite powerful thing for someone to

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.129 
a quite powerful thing for someone to
decide<00:03:36.919> to<00:03:37.609> come<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:37.909> a<00:03:37.970> body<00:03:38.180> that<00:03:38.510> was

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
decide to come in a body that was

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.009 
decide to come in a body that was
riddled<00:03:39.440> with<00:03:39.560> pain<00:03:39.889> filled<00:03:40.639> with<00:03:40.819> drugs<00:03:41.120> the

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
riddled with pain filled with drugs the

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.490 
riddled with pain filled with drugs the
people<00:03:42.319> would<00:03:42.530> basically<00:03:43.449> reject<00:03:44.449> her<00:03:44.720> just

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
people would basically reject her just

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.589 
people would basically reject her just
for<00:03:45.769> being<00:03:46.040> her<00:03:46.400> because<00:03:47.060> they<00:03:47.180> were<00:03:47.269> afraid

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
for being her because they were afraid

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.809 
for being her because they were afraid
of<00:03:47.720> her<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:48.290> afraid<00:03:48.590> of<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:49.190> way<00:03:49.310> she<00:03:49.519> looked

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
of her and afraid of the way she looked

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.539 
of her and afraid of the way she looked
