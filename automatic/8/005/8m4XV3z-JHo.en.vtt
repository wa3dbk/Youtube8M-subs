that so this is something that you know
we're<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> judge<00:01:59.070> look

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
we're going to have to have a judge look

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.830 
we're going to have to have a judge look
at<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.579> make<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> decision<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.600> that's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
at and make a decision on in that that's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.420 
at and make a decision on in that that's
what<00:02:00.960> I'm<00:02:01.049> waiting<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.649> again<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
what I'm waiting on but again the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.039 
what I'm waiting on but again the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
stopping the fighting and that's not the
