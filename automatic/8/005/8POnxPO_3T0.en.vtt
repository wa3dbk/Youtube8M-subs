Hey guys! Get ready for the most amazing Mashup of all time!

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.480
Disney Princesses meet the My Little Pony main 6!

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.580
So guys, imagine a magical mashup of the perfection of Disney Princesses

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.880
combined with the awesomeness of My Little Pony!

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.520
What would that be called? A My Little Disney Prony?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.720
[laughs] True!

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.880
And which MLP character fits best with which Disney Princess?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.740
Let's check it out!

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.620
Okay, first up, Applejack is totally Tiana!

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.380
They're both spunky, hardworking, and they both have those sweet southern accents!

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.440
And, this is what their hybrid would look like.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.360
Appleiana!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.920
Rarity is a great match for Aurora!

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.100
Gorgeous hair,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.400
nice voice,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.820
And, they both have an interest in sewing.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.280
Well, sort of...

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.480
And here's the mashup: Aurority

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.080
Okay, I think Rainbow Dash is totally Elsa!

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.020
Wait, really?

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.220
Okay, hear me out...

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.420
They're both bold, independent,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420
and they have the ability to change the weather.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.720
Oh yeah! I forgot about that one... Great match!

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.320
Let's see what they look like as a prony hybrid.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.720
It's Elsadash!

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.640
Pinky pie is Arielle because they're both optimistic,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.500
with big ideas, and they know how to make a dramatic entrance.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.320
Here's the cute and quirky Ariel Pinkie.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.840
The Little Mer-pony!

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.860
Twilight Sparkle and Belle would make a good match.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.820
Totally! They're both super smart,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.660
they love books, and their sidekicks are adorable!

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.560
We give you: Twilight Belle.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.620
And finally, Fluttershy.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.800
Her Disney Princess matchup is with

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.280
Cinderella!

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.720
They're both quiet, kind, and total animal lovers!

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.560
[singing] Whatever you wish for you keep.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.320
[whistling]

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.020
[singing]

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.100
[mimicking]

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.820
And this is the Fluttershy Cinderella Prony!

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.980
Flutterella!

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.720
