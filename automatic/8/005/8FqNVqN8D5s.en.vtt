see<00:02:28.680> now<00:02:28.890> even<00:02:29.340> though<00:02:29.459> i'm<00:02:29.760> talking<00:02:30.120> at<00:02:30.180> my

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
see now even though i'm talking at my

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.899 
see now even though i'm talking at my
normal<00:02:30.359> voice<00:02:30.829> the<00:02:31.829> volume<00:02:32.040> being<00:02:32.340> down<00:02:32.579> means

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
normal voice the volume being down means

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.440 
normal voice the volume being down means
it's<00:02:33.689> not<00:02:33.959> as<00:02:34.170> loud<00:02:35.129> this<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.939> got<00:02:36.299> to<00:02:36.390> be

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
it's not as loud this is the got to be

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.920 
it's not as loud this is the got to be
more<00:02:36.659> sensitive<00:02:36.870> or<00:02:37.590> less<00:02:37.799> sensitive<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
more sensitive or less sensitive so you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.099 
more sensitive or less sensitive so you
bring<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.170> down<00:02:40.290> here<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.709> there<00:02:40.739> you<00:02:41.579> are

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
bring it down here and there you are

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.599 
bring it down here and there you are
bring<00:02:43.109> that<00:02:43.139> back<00:02:43.439> up<00:02:44.239> so<00:02:45.239> that's<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:46.109> um<00:02:46.609> now

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
bring that back up so that's that um now

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.780 
bring that back up so that's that um now
I<00:02:47.720> simply<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:49.170> at<00:02:49.439> like<00:02:49.950> backed<00:02:50.220> out<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.609> here

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
I simply just at like backed out of here

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.929 
I simply just at like backed out of here
and<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.409> don't<00:02:53.069> think<00:02:53.099> it's<00:02:53.310> saved<00:02:53.549> for<00:02:53.790> me

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
and it I don't think it's saved for me

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.819 
and it I don't think it's saved for me
so<00:02:54.510> what<00:02:54.689> I<00:02:54.720> did<00:02:55.129> to<00:02:56.129> ensure<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.579> it<00:02:56.730> did<00:02:56.879> save

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
so what I did to ensure that it did save

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.030 
so what I did to ensure that it did save
was<00:02:58.829> go<00:02:59.010> up<00:02:59.129> here<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.370> home<00:03:00.230> either<00:03:01.230> ctrl-click
