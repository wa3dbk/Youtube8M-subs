about the words for the moment that the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.209 
about the words for the moment that the

to grow as a player and also as a person
and<00:01:59.549> I<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> big<00:02:01.020> one<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
and I think one of the big one of the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.700 
and I think one of the big one of the
big<00:02:01.729> tipping<00:02:02.729> points<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.990> Sharks

big tipping points was the Sharks

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.130 
big tipping points was the Sharks
Academy<00:02:05.159> which<00:02:06.000> may<00:02:06.210> sit<00:02:06.540> which<00:02:06.810> makes<00:02:07.020> it

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
Academy which may sit which makes it

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.630 
Academy which may sit which makes it
really<00:02:07.290> easy<00:02:07.409> for<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> study<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.369> roll
