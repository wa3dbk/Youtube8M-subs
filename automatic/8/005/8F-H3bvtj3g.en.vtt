thick

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.740 

it's<00:01:32.850> actually<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.360> thick<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.770> see

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
it's actually really thick you can see
stick<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.900> lot<00:01:37.200> thicker<00:01:37.500> than<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> music<00:01:38.369> skins

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640

that<00:01:38.790> I've<00:01:38.940> installed<00:01:39.330> previously<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.830> go

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
that I've installed previously so go

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.510 
that I've installed previously so go
ahead<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.790> install<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.210> onto<00:01:42.479> my<00:01:42.659> phone<00:01:43.520> make

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
ahead and install it onto my phone make

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.670 
ahead and install it onto my phone make
sure<00:01:44.549> we're<00:01:44.970> lined<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:47.869> I<00:01:48.869> think

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
sure we're lined up and I think

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
sure we're lined up and I think
basically<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.430> main<00:01:50.610> thing<00:01:50.940> that<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.180> want

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
basically the main thing that you want

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.060 
basically the main thing that you want
to<00:01:51.450> line<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> camera<00:01:52.710> cut<00:01:52.920> out

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
to line up with is the camera cut out

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.399 
to line up with is the camera cut out
and<00:01:53.780> after<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.070> we'll<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.549> ahead<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
and after that we'll just go ahead and

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.440 
and after that we'll just go ahead and
stick<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.440> on<00:01:58.680> I<00:02:01.490> think<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.670> actually<00:02:03.030> one

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
stick it on I think this is actually one

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.570 
stick it on I think this is actually one
of<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> easiest<00:02:04.140> installs<00:02:04.740> I've<00:02:04.950> ever<00:02:05.220> done

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
of the easiest installs I've ever done

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.949 
of the easiest installs I've ever done
as<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.369> I'm<00:02:08.670> pretty<00:02:09.269> much<00:02:09.330> done<00:02:09.780> with

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
as you can see I'm pretty much done with

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.990 
as you can see I'm pretty much done with
the<00:02:10.140> back<00:02:10.350> already<00:02:11.510> now<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.720> does<00:02:12.959> only<00:02:13.320> cover

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
the back already now it does only cover

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.090 
the back already now it does only cover
this<00:02:15.000> one<00:02:15.420> section<00:02:16.080> pretty<00:02:16.680> much<00:02:16.860> the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
this one section pretty much the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.030 
this one section pretty much the
midsection<00:02:17.580> but<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.630> does<00:02:18.840> look<00:02:19.260> pretty<00:02:19.680> good

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
midsection but it does look pretty good

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.170 
midsection but it does look pretty good
and<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.970> really<00:02:21.330> sticky<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:22.819> hope<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:24.000> it

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
and it is really sticky I hope that it

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.030 
and it is really sticky I hope that it
doesn't<00:02:24.480> leave<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.630> sticky<00:02:24.930> residue<00:02:25.110> as<00:02:25.739> it

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
doesn't leave a sticky residue as it

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.030 
doesn't leave a sticky residue as it
claims<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.420> I'll<00:02:27.750> do<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> follow-up<00:02:28.440> for<00:02:28.800> sure

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
claims so I'll do a follow-up for sure

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.370 
claims so I'll do a follow-up for sure
to<00:02:29.310> show<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:32.150> okay<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:33.569> that<00:02:33.810> we're<00:02:34.019> done<00:02:34.170> with

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
areas are exposed this is mainly I

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.729 
areas are exposed this is mainly I
believe<00:03:52.849> probably<00:03:53.849> just<00:03:54.180> for<00:03:54.360> looks<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.989> um

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
believe probably just for looks and um

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.490 
believe probably just for looks and um
to<00:03:56.489> resist<00:03:57.300> scratching<00:03:57.840> against<00:03:58.349> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500

midsection or these areas here not much

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.309 
midsection or these areas here not much
protection<00:04:02.970> but<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.569> does<00:04:03.750> look<00:04:03.780> pretty<00:04:04.200> good

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
protection but it does look pretty good

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.800 
protection but it does look pretty good
and<00:04:04.770> again<00:04:05.520> I'll<00:04:05.730> do<00:04:05.850> a<00:04:05.880> follow<00:04:06.209> up<00:04:06.330> video<00:04:06.569> to
