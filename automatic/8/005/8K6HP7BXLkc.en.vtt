 it will be clearly more apparent 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.609

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:49.520

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.520
 always helping your pdf for the 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.500

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.869
 small gift packages 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.159
 the trunk of the tree also so I'm 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.670
 serve the always of the colme 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.850
 repositionable the end of the glue 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.380
 textile to stick my little ones 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.869
 pieces side it does not 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.470
 it does not stick but definitely 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:13.060
 during the sewing it keeps the 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.500
 pieces in place then I will take 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.590
 a cotton embroidery 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.170
 no matter the color and I'm going by 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:29.910
 example on this band there do a 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.910
 point of 1 point does not stop 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.519
 the goal is these to maintain in 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.190
 place it's all these bands with 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.959
 an embroidery stitches a stopping point 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.400
 for fact you want a point of 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:57.989
 pin the dots do not a fake point of arette 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.989
 the commission by train finally ferrain 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:06.819
 you embellish your little bands with 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:10.900
 hillsides of colors I did my 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:14.790
 little point here on this strip there on 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.299
 another man I made points do not 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.129
 left 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.310
 you stretch your film right me 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.379
 turn with your slash around the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.920
 base of the wire 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:37.510
 redo a turn with the left hand and 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:38.430
 so you're going to cross do on his 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.489
 location 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:46.180
 so point of point of no cross 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.389
 end here I advance in my bands is 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:55.510
 there to tie my team a little hole 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:04:00.730
 of trees I make a primitive point as 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:03.040
 it simply 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.010
 that is to say that you are wearing 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.799
 left to go to the right and you 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.609
 go up a little further to do the 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:20.979
 same thing from left to right 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:24.160
 in front and here you end yours 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:29.440
 finish your little embroidery yourself you 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.210
 put to keep in place your your 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:38.740
 small gifts with the embroidery stitch 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:42.430
 of your choice on the fabric of 12 cm 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.050
 side you have your sheep and by 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:52.360
 on top of your little tree 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:56.530
 here with an orange embroidery cotton is 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:07.539
 for example you will make stars 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:10.229
 in the sky at one of the points launched in 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.229
 form canvases 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:24.440
 I'm coming back to the center of my star for 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.240
 to leave a little further without crossing 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.570
 the thicknesses to make it clean 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.570
 behind 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.770
 finally crossing the thicknesses more 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.620
 exactly so that the film 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:42.250
 not be visible on the back you 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.250
 start 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:02.180
 here and you do it like that on 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.760
 the whole surface where you want on 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.900
 the bottom and maybe some points 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.000
 before here for how to say maintain 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.330
 the same mallis thickness between them 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.850
 between the bands 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.710
 so I show you how hollow jeans 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:21.080
 my little book so with my in 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.310
 France by simply I take a 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.330
 little distance 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.580
 and then I spray like that 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.180
 it's a little colors and me 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.940
 I really like that 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.170
 then you will just be added 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.460
 when it will be dry 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:39.650
 the little buttons here well I 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.400
 believe that there I make a little one 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.400
 small coffee stand
