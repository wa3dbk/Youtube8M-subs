00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
and that's pretty much the look that I'm

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.940 
and that's pretty much the look that I'm
going<00:06:53.970> for<00:06:54.300> today<00:06:54.720> I'm<00:06:55.140> using<00:06:55.350> the<00:06:55.590> suave

hairspray<00:06:56.790> for<00:06:57.690> finishing<00:06:58.050> touches<00:06:58.440> I<00:06:58.770> like

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
hairspray for finishing touches I like

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.800 
hairspray for finishing touches I like
it<00:06:59.370> because<00:06:59.490> it's<00:06:59.760> a<00:06:59.880> lightweight<00:07:00.090> hold<00:07:00.540> and

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
it because it's a lightweight hold and

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.050 
it because it's a lightweight hold and
it<00:07:01.230> doesn't<00:07:01.620> leave<00:07:01.770> my<00:07:01.980> hair<00:07:02.190> feeling<00:07:02.490> stiff

it doesn't leave my hair feeling stiff

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.660 
it doesn't leave my hair feeling stiff
it<00:07:03.360> leaves<00:07:04.110> it<00:07:04.260> feeling<00:07:04.590> flowy<00:07:04.890> but<00:07:05.280> it<00:07:05.400> still
