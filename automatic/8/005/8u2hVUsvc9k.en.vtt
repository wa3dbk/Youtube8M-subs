00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.279
 ladsous and compass and welcome to another 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 new video as they saw it in the title 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.480
 tuning and review of Carlist dim 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.059
 compact and science I have this vehicle 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.580
 that just came out just for the version 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.139
 of xbox and playstation 4 so let's go to 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.390
 direct us something holy custom for 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.250
 tuning this vehicle and being able to take them out 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.080
 benefit to the fact I already had it a little 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 but I wanted to do something already to the improvement 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.730
 could not and that's why I decided to remake another 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 time the video but I just leave it 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.570
 as of pau letters I put love and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.520
 some small modifications if at all 3 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.930
 I put it but we are going to modify it to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.000
 our taste as you can 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.790
 remember a few days ago I was 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.829
 talking about who was at dinka gomÃ³n 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.899
 that it was a vehicle with stamps of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.730
 apes and try to put that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.770
 personalization but not really 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.350
 I knew how it is applied and I think that only 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.360
 It is the unlock mode 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.070
 story or something like that is I do not remember very 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.680
 well but in the same way after 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.300
 to be doing this video I will follow then 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.770
 investigating and that encounter the way 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.510
 because he will be there of the method no longer 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.219
 also if I play it in the campaign or in 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.300
 any ball that plays it is the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.220
 I will teach so that you can 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.840
 appreciate it but likewise we are going to 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.000
 see how it does not work 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.009
 compact and normal in the mode 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.840
 multiplayer so first of all you 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.609
 let's put the shield and we're going to 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.049
 put the brakes now I put the engine 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.569
 in fact as they see it I already have many 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.609
 things but I just stayed up 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.229
 not here when they see the cro the chest if 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.299
 you can modify we can put one of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.920
 carbon fiber but the one that I away the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.170
 of ventilation so that the car does not 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.929
 hot not the truth that I do not care 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.640
 So now let's put the lights will 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.920
 I stopped the xenon headlights because 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.530
 so it looks much better here in designs 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.840
 neon I put in the most expensive part of 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.119
 all and I put it in neon color the one 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 tribe that is my crew reddish ok 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.810
 Now, just what I'm going to do 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.119
 will be to prevent theft losses 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.950
 they do not have the plate anymore, I put it on 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.840
 black the repainted in this part I 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.969
 I do not know what color to put it on 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.920
 I really do not have lots of colors 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.689
 here as you see the chrome with this 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.670
 remastered version like upload another 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.039
 color that looks much prettier but 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.780
 many people already know that color so 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.459
 I just do not know what color to apply 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.020
 I can put many types of 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.849
 colors indeed the paintings of now 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.500
 I like them much more in fact if I go to 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.389
 continue with the series of strange paintings 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.470
 closed I think the second ones 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.960
 seasons and everything 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.240
 I'll sing it right here as 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.520
 they see it the colors are exaggeratedly 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.100
 colorful are very nice is something that 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.780
 I like it a lot and this I do not know in what color 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.240
 I wanted the fact I was liking 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.920
 in blue I do not know to see what I want is that 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.960
 I do not know is that there are several colors in fact 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.360
 I like that they were like split in two 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.160
 purple abel colors and I was 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.590
 beating in fact I do not know I want to put 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.200
 I'm going to put the Bordeaux and the Bordeaux 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.700
 well just a face you're not going to 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.700
 put burgundy we are going to put a 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.740
 clarified and I want east west I like them 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.560
 many will know my series of paintings 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.209
 strange and weird and I here are the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.820
 Paintings that they like the most can notice 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.400
 which are many types of paintings but not 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.470
 I know I want to see the blue to see the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.880
 blue and 3 the one that looks very good like that 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.250
 I'm going to put this one that's like 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.530
 metallic and just below I'm going to put a 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.209
 lime green color because I like it 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.830
 very much the lime green seriously I enjoy 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.750
 much that color so let's put it 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.880
 olive green and we already have our 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.880
 vehicle the fat looks exaggeratedly 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.770
 weird seriously not it's not our sea looks 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.900
 very weird and let's leave it like this we're going to 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.220
 put the safety cage and 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.530
 continuation 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.240
 here you can put this or look at it 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.210
 can see you put this so you do not get 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.070
 give the sun on the face or I do not know if it helps 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.140
 when it is put in first person but 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.900
 as they see it, they give us the 50 thousand 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.850
 dollars we're going to put on skirts I do not know 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.520
 the skirts I feel that they cover me these 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.110
 lights but at the same time they look very good like this 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.970
 that I'm going to leave the spoiler or 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.500
 great to see there is a big suitcase 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.480
 those are the roads I like the 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.980
 big boys to see we are going to put you in your 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.290
 predictions of careers so that 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.970
 fit the baby much better on the floor and in 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.370
 I'll give you the best transmission 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.410
 races ok on your course we are going to put you 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.600
 the tuning of turbo and on wheels we are going to 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.580
 put a few low rider because 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.890
 I like to see these money are the 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.610
 I like the riders and I'll 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.890
 to put a few colors of rim I do not know 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.709
 they like in purple no no 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.720
 the blue the fluorescent blue of the one 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.310
 sees better of all so just what 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.470
 let's leave here two with the accessories 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.079
 of tires and we're going to put this and 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.260
 this one and we're going to put the back of the 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.040
 I want a green smoke because 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.200
 the 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.460
 the bottom part is green now let's 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.200
 give it back and we will give the 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.420
 windows we are going to put those of 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.270
 limousine and that's our 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.940
 vehicle we are currently given by the 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.210
 amount similar to 100 thousand dollars that 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.790
 93 thousand 690 now we are going to go 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.070
 to test that vehicle on the road and 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.530
 let's see how this behaves 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.060
 vehicle the truth in the big point 4 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.980
 it was good but you will know that the 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.930
 driving in the grand theft auto 4 was 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.580
 exaggeratedly bad with all 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.350
 vehicles but I do not know how it is going to 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.880
 behave with this one not so 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.890
 we are simply seeing in fact I 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.960
 I want to put tantito the first way 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.790
 person how they see the color that I put 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.830
 I really liked it, they are not called 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.960
 in fact as you can notice the interior 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.680
 it's pretty good and we're going to take that 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.750
 branch let's go let's go let's go uy uy uy uy the 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.280
 stabilized or not as well as the 6 11 to them 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.330
 I'm really bad in the first person and how 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.939
 they see it simply because 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.550
 you will know that what we will 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:24.590
 we put as main painting that in my 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.810
 case it was a red paint that painting 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.430
 red is going to be applied to interiors 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.979
 as you can see I put a red paint 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.629
 and the inside of my vehicle is red is 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.610
 something that I like very much as a detail 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.590
 although right now my painting looks something 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.020
 blue the bordeaux belongs to the class of 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.669
 reds and that's why it's considered a 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.289
 red paint not even though you see it 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.990
 blue is truly a red paint 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.509
 with a mother-of-pearl then let's go to 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.219
 try this vehicle just about 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.169
 they collided I did not want them to touch me 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:53.479
 fact they see driving so good that it's 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.280
 that is, they hit me and they stabilized me 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.379
 if you wonder why you do not drive 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.389
 right now so much in the first person because it is 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.639
 because I am exaggeratedly bad with the 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.229
 first person to actually handle me 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.759
 I'm used to driving in third 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.770
 person, because if I drive in the first 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.360
 It makes me much more complicated not to see 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.520
 let's go here and today you want 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.319
 Dolphin's gloves was not 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.120
 something new so let's go for 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:15.740
 here in fact how can you see it 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.330
 traffic has increased a lot but the 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.969
 vehicle is well does not become a 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.219
 normal vehicle is like taking that 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.030
 the gentleman is slower than the buffalo of 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.920
 franklin 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.720
 but at the same time it's a little more 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.940
 fast it should be like the vehicle of 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.590
 michael not to say so not like the one in 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.640
 Trevor walk like Trevor would be the 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.920
 truth that is pretty good 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.270
 vehicle control is very good the 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.070
 true that this vehicle is fine and 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.960
 let's see how it behaves in the 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.460
 mountains, we are not going to try them 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.500
 the mountains nothing else that we spend a 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.090
 a little bit later but the control of 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.250
 vehicle is very good no it is not like the 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.320
 point that you give a turn and the vehicle 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.090
 it turns you in fact if you notice it well 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.580
 I'm going to make a sharp turn and as you see the 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.310
 Disabled vehicle is destabilized 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.050
 but it's very little bruce like 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.240
 fact is very well controlled is in 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.380
 this vehicle and how they see the truth 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.960
 which is quick or to make a 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.940
 compact vehicle that I guess this 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.590
 vehicle will compete against the 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.080
 maybe if he wins it a little bit in speed 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.270
 not only see the vehicle, but simply 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.070
 when you lose control it's easy 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.630
 re-stabilize it in fact 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.210
 now you can see that it does not cost much 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.770
 work put it back in its position 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.720
 initial and the truth that molds 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.970
 quite well so far by the 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.830
 mountain obviously not the pando I think that 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.480
 if it molds much better in the mountains 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.340
 this vehicle like it costs to climb 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.000
 but it is obviously because they are a 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.280
 compactor 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.420
 anyway the car is very good 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.950
