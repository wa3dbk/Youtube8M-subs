00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.610
 and then gang beauty Today video here 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.960
 I met on the xbox bus in the last video 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.340
 of this series than in the five-month series 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.669
 What I did, I'll show you one. 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.019
 little xbox console the year when 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:21.509
 some details shown entries for 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.240
 you here a little of the look of the new 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.730
 microsoft console so it's a 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.710
 visual effect, you can repair the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.349
 console well cast well framed 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.960
 even though it does not have the famous 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.480
 xbox and 60 and it is in the same style and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.880
 playstation 3 one of the first models 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.490
 of 13 which is an inner drawer where 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.290
 You put the blu-ray here have quality 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.020
 remembers a video cassette of the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.270
 the 90's and who the dance company 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.860
 time knows that I'm talking and people 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.470
 which immediately draws attention to the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.290
 console we see here this great 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.290
 air outlet that an outlet is quite large - 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.870
 that will come to you to see that you are going 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.019
 to see you very well with the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.450
 quality of the camera but it is a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.979
 well big air so he has a relationship 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.679
 very good at least this is microsoft 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.990
 so extra care that console 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.990
 the problems that have occurred in the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.409
 xbox 360 at the start of overheating 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.170
 huh 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.590
 - everything is very careful, right? 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.479
 It's all here in the faith above, I'm doing well. 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.729
 slowly because you can despite the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.710
 recording with a hand that has another output 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.649
 of air on the aquino side until you can see 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.259
 how lateral is it just well framed 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.270
 even a big one, it reminds me a little 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.579
 format of the first model of 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.009
 playstation 2 that came out of mine 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.810
 dog of the time you remember it 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.329
 here in front you have only this panel 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.179
 the good black beautiful here even 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.889
 xbox symbol here it is a sensor that only 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.170
 passes from binds 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:55.499
 he is a white led in the background here 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.310
 The disk input looks only at the button and gets 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:02.429
 The sensor also goes back to that already 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.049
 ejected disc has that famous one we warned 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:10.439
 which if the camera will focus well looks 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:12.990
 not only with a new console without removing the 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.700
 on the inside of the disc or the same 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.500
 Notice that we had the button, let's 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.150
 move him because he is well 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.960
 heavy there is no way you keep moving 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.080
 much he 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.580
 After you 're there he'll be there. 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.190
 that yes but a black piano panel 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.020
 very nice, tell me if you pass but bispa 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.510
 radio also risks very easy from here 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.690
 so be careful because he was 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.870
 very easy even has here the wolf xbox 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.550
 He's just very handsome, let's go here too. 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.830
 side of the other side of the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.350
 We have an easy-to-use usb 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.690
 access of another mother who had great 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.200
 console ventilation that side here 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.270
 You'll see and on the side we have here too. 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.040
 the control sync button where 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.410
 button and the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.130
 control synchronization to power is the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.770
 console recognize it seen here in the 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.630
 the back is just you see 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.460
 then the ventilation here so let 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.800
 in a well-ventilated place where 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.830
 overheated, but here we go to the 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.810
 the back of the console we also have 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.060
 here is the microsoft warranty phone 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.890
 even that here it is interesting for you 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.900
 place that safety catch that 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.510
 can optionally put on a notebook 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.640
 when will you travel the same at your house in 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.370
 shop wherever you place it 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.720
 what the entrances and have enough 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.000
 input option will be for each 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.860
 But you were here again one more time. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.410
 a hot air outlet from the 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.360
 console and come to the outputs 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.330
 console entries the first here 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.580
 the network cable and look at the 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:49.410
 just this out I think it's infer 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.920
 infrared the output order of 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.540
 infrared of you to be something 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.390
 to be able to contact the other 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.370
 peripheral do not know 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.350
 soon after the kinect holder 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.240
 as a previous video showed that net 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.610
 he had in the car drawn that same 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.100
 drawing that looks at you 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.870
 kinect is also very different it does not have 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.060
 how to make a mistake like the one in the previous video 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.250
 it's the proof of ass even has no way 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.390
 to err on this island here right? 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.890
 here plus two usb 3.0 ports have more 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:25.130
 one of the side you bought totaling 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:27.920
 three usb ports here hdmi input and there 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.660
 the satellite or cable in the case of your 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.060
 signature you can call here that he 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.470
 has the function of managing your TV by 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.940
 interesting subscription you call 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.970
 you record the hd 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.010
 console also it records programming 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:44.510
 whole 500gb hd console 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.190
 here we have tried spdf in which is a 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.050
 digital audio output 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.790
 if the digital audio output committee 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.700
 that you will have a quality 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.180
 amazing audio even in it here 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.260
 huh 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.630
 and here we have hdmi out for tv 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.330
 the console's video output to 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.270
 television and by the end here the 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.630
 German and from the source 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.790
 can even symbol the xbox x ac of xbox is 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.410
 that I'm seeing on the inside does not 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.980
 I know if you can get it repaired. 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.260
 also illumination will give but we are 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.100
 Seeing that silver part there that one is 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.510
 the console hd that is in there 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.930
 it is probably accessed through 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.580
 this grid that it should open 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.130
 I think she leaves this grid here you 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.240
 has access to hd but the beginning I believe 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.060
 that does not give to be able to change the hd 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.240
 microsoft must have put some 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.310
 restriction that does not leave hd but anyway 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.870
 comes a good size even because people 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.810
 will not stay playing anyway 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.390
 game 1029 once because neither having 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.210
 All this invitation for us to enjoy 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.310
 of the island but more here the island 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.780
 Great, it's only you, it's summer that starts like this. 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.280
 pass on my doubts but until one 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.630
 beautiful advice and has this contrast 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.580
 black piano with black matte he 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.200
 Robust it not my opinion for the 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.150
 least for my tests as long as I 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.800
 I played with him, it does not get too hot. 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.600
 well at least i realized i did not 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.090
 heats up a lot because the hand on him 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.190
 it was neither hot nor low which is good 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.330
 but also good 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.650
 Something else I had to say 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.230
 I also respect this advice with you. 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.360
 buy it the first time you call 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.460
 This is something I found annoying that he 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.860
 not it does not care if you do not upgrade 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.090
 or so you call it was 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.970
 thing that will do you will set up 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.560
 the network you will want to connect to 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.900
 internet it will download a file from 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.810
 about 500 megabytes of download in the 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.940
 slow internet like mine is going to be a 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.750
 Please wait for the night for me. 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.240
 not nearly 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.280
 the eyes download the 500 update 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.080
 mega just for you to get a better idea 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.870
 suggestion is if your internet fast 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.510
 then you'll have no problem asking 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.400
 and soon you're going to play but it 's a 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.430
 thing to talk about when you call it goes 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.800
 pull this update and suck at you 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.820
 waiting for her but then 14 too 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.460
 We had good right 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.290
 so at least until this is a new 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.870
 dashboard a new update for it 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.090
 whether it is also in transit 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.340
 press dashboard as beta test 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.370
 still does not have many details and photos 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.930
 some things in the functionality of the 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.630
 dashboard I also believe that soon 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:20.780
 a new update will appear and correct 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.970
 some errors add more functions of the 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.380
 that already has in the console to facilitate 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.320
 some things that need to be created 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.580
 among other console functions 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.080
 so they lacked a 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.780
 The greater simplicity of you is 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.300
 accessing the rest of the console much 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.730
 good even very well finished as of 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.530
 His ventilation system went very well 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.720
 worked it is not heating up 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.850
 Very honest with me here, it did not heat up. 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.270
 I really stopped playing games two hours 

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.640
 and a half 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.280
 I followed him and did not realize 

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.479
 console overheating worked 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:55.280
 usually without major problems but 

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:57.140
 good people this was the video here the fifth 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.160
 and last video of the series knowing xbox 

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.020
 The year, I hope you liked it. 

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.090
 anything says if you have 

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.620
 something to add also let 

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.620
 in the comments that will help a lot 

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.120
 People are sure but I hope you 

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.590
 have liked the video anything 

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.310
 comment and until the next 

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.310
 we talked
