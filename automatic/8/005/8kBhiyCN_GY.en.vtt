00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.740
 and there's beauty in here today with more 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.590
 of ten thousand 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.070
 In this video I'll show you a 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.609
 great for you to form metal twist and chests 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.510
 treasure on earth in these chests beyond 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.970
 metal genre 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.510
 You can also find in grams 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.189
 rare legendary foreign currencies and 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.770
 also ships 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.270
 so we can get the metal day. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.210
 get these things 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.309
 If lucky for those who do not know the spin 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.000
 metal is good for you 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.940
 enhance armor and legendary weapons and 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.730
 exotic species such as these for example 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.309
 rite legendary and this armor to walk 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.160
 in this place there is also an event 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.739
 then it is a good opportunity to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.809
 you pick up the ascending or 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.329
 lucky ascending energy 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.400
 there are two effective ways to get 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.280
 where we're going to get metal g 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.280
 one by the coexistence of the demons and the other 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.619
 It's by the patrol way we go by 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.810
 patrol mode because if you pick up and 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.030
 to put demons in assault 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.979
 the game will put you in the group and in that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.159
 group probably one of the players 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.540
 really want to make the assault ends 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.030
 disturbing who wants to make the robbery 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.950
 only then I see this enter the mode of 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.680
 catch and follow this path here 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.689
 that a little more than a minute you 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.549
 get there without any problem 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.530
 arriving here the first thing that you 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.400
 will want to do is look for chest inside 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.200
 of building 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.610
 if you do not have the search in the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.740
 head up doing this go left and 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.049
 enter this room 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.820
 look for more chests near the shelves 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.610
 There may be noise from the side of the desk. 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.850
 I also looked for someone doing 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.860
 this follows the way here more 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.530
 enemies that appear 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.450
 they never know when they can steal 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.770
 something in this room can take 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.410
 goal like this 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.629
 passing this you follow the path doubles 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.350
 on the right tries to get on the train 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.530
 first 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.010
 recently you can have a good ari 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.410
 Right in that little corner, follow the path. 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.200
 magician plus some enemies to see if 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.840
 he dropped some on rare grass or the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.170
 legendary in this room 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.300
 look for shelves through the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.940
 songs and donated at the desk 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.760
 follow the same path I'm doing 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.200
 get in those middle bank containers 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.150
 of them can can have another more cash 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.950
 a chest 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.730
 following the way may have another good 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.480
 up here inside the video room and 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.480
 one in the corner 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.040
 follow new path around the corner 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.230
 you find some enemy of an end 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.720
 in the new room 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.800
 look the same in other rooms for 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.920
 shelves and through the corners 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.920
 left 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:21.450
 the gdc the enemy platform 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.580
 right behind the platform you were able to 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.330
 have another good like this one 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.160
 the platform is thus the stone 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.950
 platform has another room 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.650
 You enter her looking for the shelves. 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.680
 that can have another good like this 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.460
 the amount of metal and the items 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.490
 you find the chest depends on luck 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:50.430
 following here look for this 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:54.420
 train may have another flight without path 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:58.620
 Left bi here can be good in the corners 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.650
 this room also climb the hill 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.740
 ari well capable who can have a chest and here 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.520
 back also in the corridor zin we follow 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.020
 way here there are two here one 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.870
 there is another one here 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.060
 first let's look for the 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.230
 shelves and by the corners when you 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.800
 find some tribe and nothing comes out 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.980
 Path has some enemies here if 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.560
 Do you want to be happier or not? 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.250
 I say kill because you never know 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.690
 when it can drop 1 in grass and legendary 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.840
 that can be good 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.810
 here followed by one more room 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.320
 arrival of the corners and the shelves you 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:47.280
 Find anything now, just go to 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:50.550
 end of the route always looking for 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.360
 if you see any metal on the ground 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.160
 fails to pick up now air above also 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.700
 can have another good good up here 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.540
 from this point of being here and going to 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.450
 this room 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.580
 this last room on the route may have 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.130
 plus a box here like this 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.920
 leaving here you make the path abbr 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.960
 beginning you can see and soon 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.360
 time you earn enough in metal 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.160
 after that, just repeat the route and 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.560
 continue forming if this video was 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.300
