00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:12.369
 j the best for 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.369
 besides canfranc 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.349
 by expulsion 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.349
 lead 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.689
 the martini athlete 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.050
 these vehicles 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.769
 I'm not that contention 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.110
 inter 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.480
 it was more than anything 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 As he says, I hope you understand waiting for a transplant 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.100
 participation is expected 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.100
 For my part, my partners 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.400
 now the apple g 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.550
 of unemployment - 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.630
 and then 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.630
 but 'mou' wins 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.600
 first of all I recently won a position to be a starter 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.780
 the second place 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.780
 in Canada this raise the cup 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.479
 that team that nahyan long ago the cup raise it state 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.970
 you will also have to start a good team and face 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 when starting to grab 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.710
 to town 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.710
 force 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.280
 I give myself completely 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.040
 we are convinced víctor ramírez between one of the principles 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.240
 well things to 100% 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.700
 that they have cost a lot of work because they are used to maintaining 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.230
 here is a 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.460
 in time 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.880
 locke because they already have a strong discipline and right now they are 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.060
 committed main island who already know what here in the club have 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.380
 a commitment without every 100 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.399
 without in exchange for money they are doing choirs really love the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.249
 T-shirt by a morals 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:15.029
 and well, more than anything, not so much for that, but for really representing 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.629
 artistically this aspect 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.499
 and for the next championship 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:22.539
 but are your detective profiles of music videos without being 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.469
 the needs 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.229
 the final costs 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.549
 Estevez is that it is very complicated 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.689
 this 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.649
 there are not many teams that are 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:33.299
 talented that you 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.659
 very good players 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.549
 there are very good players but sometimes you are not given the opportunity not for one or for 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.919
 another does not arrive yellow you do not reach the quarterfinals to a semifinal entered 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:48.480
 because it mainly as the head of this project the activist the 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.919
 equipment technique 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:54.519
 I always like challenges I am a woman of challenges I like not to stay at the 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.599
 halfway 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.689
 so 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.649
 it may be that apart from working from them apart the surrender and the struggle of them 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:04.649
 I believe that my work has been reflected 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:10.119
 Well this time together again iris blur and new account to give 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:11.199
 the turn 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:15.199
 page ii does not focus on what happened previously but on the contrary 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.559
 learn from the mistakes we had 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.819
 and well, work on those mistakes that we had 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.909
 to be able to lie more villa and not so much maría the main thing is to qualify 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.139
 once qualified 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.369
 despite touching us not to stay again in the quarterfinals this time move to 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.579
 the semifinals and if why not reach the final and be 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.339
