00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.139
 so I do not even know if I 'm still 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.700
 knows what we want to say I was 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.469
 unfortunately too busy again 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.820
 have the two months no video 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.400
 more I have seen the last one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.650
 video was my review to the iphone 5 it 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.779
 I have the next two weeks now 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 Holiday that means I hope that I am here 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.590
 to produce one or the other video 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.210
 may possibly also be able to produce before 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.730
 So I do not have any say I say 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.279
 let's lose the pleasure of doing videos 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 only it was just with the moment 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.989
 work and the like timely easy 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.390
 not possible for my channel 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.950
 still have some 13 videos to make 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.140
 How can I explain you now? 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.050
 The best way to make a pleasure is also one 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.579
 certain reparation and indeed will 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.579
 I really like you in this video two 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.989
 cool caves from the company caravaggio 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.800
 or how you want to pronounce it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.289
 and I'll both cave in 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.850
 Afterwards we will raffle the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.680
 I can tell you in the end 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.539
 of the video, I want you but only 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.640
 Let me introduce the two cases 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.830
 kindly also directly from the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.760
 company were made available 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.240
 We start with a model that costs 24 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.130
 euro 90 and is both for the iphone 5 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 as well as five it compatible 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.210
 the two iphone model is in full 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 size yes completely identical we have 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.670
 Here is a case made of genuine leather with here 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.259
 above a small magnetic lock and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.630
 then we have a band where we can do that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.250
 iphone from the padded inside 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.990
 we can pull out here 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.509
 really a fine velvet in the middle 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.500
 to show the first I grab the same 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.000
 even my iphone purely 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.369
 So you can do it as you want 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.710
 put in what makes sense in this 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.420
 case, the case has no holes at the bottom 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.759
 for the speaker 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.920
 that means the whole always best 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.860
 infected tuck the other way around is so 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.840
 just into it and then works completely 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.430
 just shut up for one 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.479
 it really fits in exactly 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.280
 you have the two here too 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.590
 speakers or the speakers that 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.969
 microphone free so we make a calls 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.470
 come in the whole sound 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.090
 hears 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.100
 and I'm really good at it 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.990
 not the nice solid case 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.150
 I also think that one or the other 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.250
 fall here is well cushioned as 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.360
 the cover also offers a small bonus 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.040
 the option of two credit cards or what 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.560
 still leads ready to pack 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.240
 I just have my two cards for 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.920
 one from polo and the other from louis 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.570
 At the beginning, the whole thing is still right 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.460
 I do not have the envelope 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.990
 that means you look and 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.760
 After that, the whole thing will be clear 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.900
 continue 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.120
 as far as adapting the cards 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.130
 comfortably out and in can push 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.470
 because the cases are still whole 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.080
 something new is the whole time 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.400
 a little tighter said that iphone is 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.470
 Now really really good in here 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.090
 if you pull on the bottle you get it 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.260
 easy to get out and do it 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.510
 accordingly still easy again 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.500
 you push it all in and out 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.770
 In my opinion, here is one 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.980
 really very elegant case very much 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.170
 high quality is processed in Berlin 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.120
 made and in my opinion for 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.770
 5 or 5 it really is not very 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.450
 simple and decentralized with the good 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.070
 protection factor and also with the option 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.120
 here through these two cards the 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.430
 can be inserted for the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.709
 everyday life can also be very practical 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.010
 good times a purse or pure 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.900
 like that and then to say where I am 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.489
 only with full on the way operationally ready 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.519
 So there is number one model 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.290
 Miami for 24 90 I grab the link 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.530
 Of course, in the description will be 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.720
 the whole directly over Amazon buy 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.209
 we can also come directly to 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.019
 this time in the next model 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:42.170
 Another color in even a brown tone 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:44.120
 this model is called dallas costs 29 90 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.250
 here, too, grabs the link of course 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.480
 a description of the back looks 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.280
 first quite similar 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.090
 we have a camera cut out here and 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.260
 also our two slots for cards 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.049
 if we do it all the way though 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.519
 me it's such an art cover case so 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.140
 the iphone stays here all the time 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.040
 I would say that too 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.060
 just as the first, this flap is here 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.970
 moved away and now here have the 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.530
 possibility directly to our iphone once 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.040
 push in and as soon as it's in there 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.070
 is 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.669
 in hindsight you can work the leather here 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.009
 again 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.090
 bz makes it all pure so that 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.850
 iphone then too accordingly 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.449
 tighter and not fall out 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.590
 At the beginning is a certain frieze 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.020
 For one thing, of course, it does not hurt us that way 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.380
 often and on the other should the whole also 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.360
 stuck in it so if the iphone then 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.460
 in there we sit i would say we would 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.750
 Just go out and work it out 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.759
 whole times to one 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.410
 Magnetic lock very clean the cases 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.229
 really incredibly fitting we have 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.620
 up here to a small recess 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.389
 or indirectly imprinted head so 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.849
 I can then wear the button 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.490
 press have clean down here 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.419
 Exclusions for both the speaker 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.270
 the microphone the connection and also the 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.190
 darling adapters have down here and 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.990
 We are on the back of the camera 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.270
 perfectly cut out including lightning 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.860
 and microphone and also the wsv already 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.949
 had addressed at any time 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.690
 option to insert a card or the 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.520
 Two would like to do the whole thing here too 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.470
 a little bit tighter at the beginning 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.270
 The more commonly used leather is one 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.889
 natural product then expands 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.970
 accordingly a bit and then 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.400
 is in retrospect, the whole 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.810
 much better if you work that out 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.270
 So the cover stays on all the time 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.830
 turn on the inside have me 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.479
 the quieter switch free 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.340
 accessible also really good 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.960
 is operable and underneath we have 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.599
 then directly the option plus and minus 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.830
 also nicely labeled here to use 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.539
 can really be served very well 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.830
 So I think in everyday life when you put it in 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.409
 By the hand , you have to work it out easily 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.570
 so completely without a hand and can be iphone 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.620
 operate also when calling disturbs it 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.900
 really in no way 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.000
 and that's just a case 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.280
 for the people who say they have that 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.320
 whole happy with your device permanently 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.599
 must say also looks just be as 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.909
 they incredibly elegant out there are also 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.409
 in black tone like here the cases for 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:05.180
 you have imagined 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.639
 You can choose whether you like that 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.770
 whole rather embarrassing or classic in the 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.169
 black market also here of course real 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.870
 leather class processing the stitching here 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.860
 are tight and the iphone is yes 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.180
 also really nice to scratch 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.159
 protected here too in the fall of course 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.490
 The question is it is not a case I say 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.440
 times 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.940
 the purpose of the iphone is 100 percent 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.650
 to protect during the fall 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.129
 if it's stupid here on the edge of the field 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.050
 I think 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.179
 sure, but what happens in everyday life 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.270
 racing bag or parquet in and out 

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:33.559
 Let's scratch out against scratching , I'll tell you 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.689
 it is correct in all cases 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:37.639
 well protected that you have the doubt 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.619
 I will tell you today from the company 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.489
 wanted to introduce as I said I am 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:46.639
 not quite in the plan - correctly pronounced 

00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:48.139
 kawakawa or cover and think this 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:51.589
 You can win two shells 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:53.089
 So I could generally write that 

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:54.800
 Just take me the video why you 

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:56.869
 wanted to have one of the two caves 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.699
 I'll think about it 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:00.469
 a two weeks run writes 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.619
 it then of course again directly into 

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:05.419
 video purely what the end or deadline is 

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:07.009
 how long the contest is going and then 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.629
 I will end up with the comments 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:11.929
 see through and the 2 comments the 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:13.610
 convince me the most is then 

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:14.139
 the cover of course for free 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.889
 sent 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:18.079
 In general I know again 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.639
 then it's just there in the next 

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:20.839
 future I do have some planned 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:24.619
 you can follow me on facebook 

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:26.419
 industries 13 or on twitter industries where
