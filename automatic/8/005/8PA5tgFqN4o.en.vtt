my<00:01:42.410> least<00:01:42.710> favorite<00:01:42.860> part<00:01:43.340> about<00:01:43.490> this<00:01:43.730> look

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
my least favorite part about this look

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.030 
my least favorite part about this look
is<00:01:43.970> because<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.690> lips<00:01:44.930> are<00:01:45.170> multiple<00:01:45.710> colours

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
is because the lips are multiple colours

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.000 
is because the lips are multiple colours
like<00:01:46.400> those<00:01:46.640> red<00:01:46.850> on<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.150> top<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:48.010> skintone

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
like those red on the top and skintone

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.490 
like those red on the top and skintone
on<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.250> bottom<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.630> can't<00:01:50.870> rub<00:01:51.140> your<00:01:51.320> lips

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
on the bottom you can't rub your lips

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.740 
on the bottom you can't rub your lips
together<00:01:51.710> which<00:01:52.370> when<00:01:52.940> I<00:01:52.970> have<00:01:53.210> lipstick<00:01:53.600> on

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
together which when I have lipstick on

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.030
