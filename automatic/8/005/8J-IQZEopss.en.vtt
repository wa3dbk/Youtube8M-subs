00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
 the driving technique course today is possible 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.160
 therefore position on the two 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.650
 compositions in general as in many 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.950
 sports are very important because of the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.190
 basic position in all others 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.289
 factions and we're really good at it 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.960
 the bike will be synonymous with all 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.820
 further continuous exercises easier 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.000
 do 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.099
 very important because it finally time 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.059
 to work on your composition 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.190
 okay we go through step by step 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.579
 the first case is simply from and to the top 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.010
 on 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.670
 what is the position of the feet on the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.960
 pedalen 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.960
 I put my pedals horizontally 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.370
 that means that 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.700
 Creation of the clock starts in 39 o'clock 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.910
 position 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.400
 it has just advantage to win 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.840
 this became freedom 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.860
 you see, now is my deepest point 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.950
 every big chainring if I am now 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.510
 In this position, they were asking 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.970
 Immediately I lose a whole 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.460
 ground clearance and of course are here 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.090
 Immediately an obstacle rising riddles 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.399
 or tree trunk on so through this 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.280
 pedal position that's me on 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.280
 Ground clearance of the other 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.730
 as in this position on the pedal in 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.460
 It is important what I always stand for 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.400
 chocolate feet in front have cellar because 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.860
 I just walk with chocolate foot 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.880
 I'm balancing on the other hand 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.980
 feel most comfortable 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.500
 the determined was actually best 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.730
 many snowboarders know that already from 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.140
 home from we are not just around 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.900
 I determine that I'm just saying 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.880
 go by bike it has a lot 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.729
 quickly out if the right or the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.380
 left foot on the front pedal better 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.870
 is suitable for balancing 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.119
 It comes thereby the driving technique exercises 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.640
 is itself important or in the back of the head 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.709
 has with which foot I feel 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.950
 more comfortable and besides also in this 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.780
 position at critical points in the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.959
 terrain now begins to balance 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.090
 or even then also with us in 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.430
 driving technology 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.340
 Ok, so chocolate foot in front 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.500
 this position and maybe it will 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.660
 sometimes to the inside is very 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.129
 important if your position is 18 o'clock 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.379
 12 o'clock with the pedals 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.769
 Imagine that he is coming soon 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:46.959
 if I have now left without bike 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.060
 a pedal down a pedal at 12 o'clock 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.790
 position is the same as if I were 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.280
 stand on your own legs and needed it 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.720
 only a small impulse a small one 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.310
 schubs and already are resulting from the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.239
 balance out chocolates matter before foot 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.950
 the feet are slightly displaced then have 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.590
 I actually stood a stable like 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.510
 the boxer and could balance it 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:16.110
 the better as a background ok more 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.110
 it's 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.930
 hobbies in front of my feet to my knees 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.620
 position of the knee so stand on the 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.720
 bike what I relaxed relaxed in here 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.489
 that meant working as a kneel 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.520
 I'm not stretched through here or 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.350
 overstretched or not too far in 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.150
 the knee but that brings one 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.610
 focus on the back and I'm hanging on 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.700
 handlebars and I also need a lot 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.760
 holding power here in the thighs 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.010
 Great musculature consumes a lot of power 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.580
 a lot of energy you just do not hold 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.670
 long because of this , try loose here 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.700
 slightly springy to play in the knees 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.450
 I do not advise anything too warm 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.330
 what am I between my legs 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.920
 can work so excited 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.180
 position in the team 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.569
 the position of the hip 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.550
 should be about the rotary stock 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.830
 are located 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.959
 so you do not put too much pressure on it 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.270
 handlebars are not on the handlebars 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.970
 support must not be allowed longer 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.590
 is not support when I am 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.830
 in the bottom bracket is also not on 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:35.080
 handlebar hangs a nice and balanced 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:39.160
 position on the wheel then the 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:43.420
 Shoulder blades should be about a line 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.220
 with the handlebar make later at 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.890
 received exercises very much on it 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.120
 enter 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:54.130
 The arms should always be in support 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.190
 position be that is to say the parents 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.540
 Slightly outward or getting hit 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.540
 can cushion well 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.590
 and here too, to steer agility 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.550
 in upper body 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.590
 when the work goes on yearly 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.520
 agility in the upper body can not 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.530
 spring so beautifully 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.640
 that's the same as when you 're pushing 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.100
 wanted to do 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.520
 the elbows all the way inside too 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.680
 a lot harder to support 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.210
 position 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.800
 I can bike here most beautiful 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.830
 job 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.620
 the look important always goes forward 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.690
 How would you notice it as soon as you go slow 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.120
 Driving range goes a lot with balloons 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.759
 works here with the brakes 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.370
 pedaling the australia busy 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:42.159
 By this concentration it sinks 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.590
 always like to down the wheel yes and 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:48.069
 How she gifted it for grad 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.909
 Technical singletrails always looks 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.629
 Forward 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:55.720
 the track read at the wells the root 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:57.460
 the 50 meters before you can see there you can 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.590
 prepare for it could be one 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.110
 select rail track around it if you 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.219
 look in the ground in the time the obstacle 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.180
 suddenly appears 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:08.889
 because you have to dismount or stop 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.020
 exactly what you did not want to fight 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.780
 but that would be better then 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.080
 sensitize and tune because in ours 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.300
 first found exercises it continues 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.659
 next time you can already 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.780
 a bit in the garage practicing in the booth 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:28.449
 your position on the soon to be in the stand 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.199
 modify and then to next time 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.199
 OK
