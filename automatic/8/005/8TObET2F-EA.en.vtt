under<00:03:01.150> its<00:03:01.270> own<00:03:01.390> weight<00:03:02.970> throw<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.180> away<00:03:05.459> and

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
under its own weight throw that away and

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.220 
under its own weight throw that away and
you<00:03:06.520> just<00:03:06.730> keep<00:03:06.880> on<00:03:07.030> doing<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.360> until<00:03:07.750> you

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
you just keep on doing that until you

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.360 
you just keep on doing that until you
cover<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.830> hold<00:03:09.100> of<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.430> mirror<00:03:09.610> surface

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.500 

because<00:03:15.370> by<00:03:15.550> letting<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.880> go<00:03:16.060> under<00:03:16.270> its<00:03:16.420> own

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
because by letting it go under its own

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.850 
because by letting it go under its own
weight<00:03:16.570> you're<00:03:17.050> not<00:03:17.200> putting<00:03:17.350> any<00:03:17.530> pressure

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.600 
thing you want to do is to scratch this
surface<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:24.750> take<00:03:25.750> great<00:03:26.110> care<00:03:26.410> with<00:03:27.250> every

ordinary tap water this final rinse we

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.480 
ordinary tap water this final rinse we
want<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.330> use<00:04:26.450> is<00:04:26.630> still<00:04:26.870> water<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:28.280> they<00:04:28.460> don't

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
want to use is still water so they don't

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.080 
want to use is still water so they don't
leave<00:04:28.850> any<00:04:29.380> residues<00:04:30.850> ordinary<00:04:31.850> tap<00:04:32.060> water

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
leave any residues ordinary tap water

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.790 
leave any residues ordinary tap water
has<00:04:33.100> various<00:04:34.480> materials<00:04:35.480> in<00:04:35.630> it<00:04:36.560> for<00:04:36.740> things

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
has various materials in it for things

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.650 
has various materials in it for things
like<00:04:36.950> calcium<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:37.790> on<00:04:37.970> we<00:04:38.300> want<00:04:38.480> to<00:04:38.540> make

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
like calcium and so on we want to make

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.180 
like calcium and so on we want to make
sure<00:04:38.810> we<00:04:38.960> don't<00:04:39.050> get<00:04:39.170> any<00:04:39.230> calcium<00:04:39.560> deposits

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
sure we don't get any calcium deposits

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.770 
sure we don't get any calcium deposits
on<00:04:40.610> our<00:04:40.880> Morrigan<00:04:41.210> we're<00:04:41.360> finished

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
on our Morrigan we're finished

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.340 
on our Morrigan we're finished
so<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.860> final<00:04:43.250> stage<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:44.930> take<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.169> mirror

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
so the final stage is to take the mirror

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.470 
so the final stage is to take the mirror
yet<00:04:46.250> again<00:04:47.380> put<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.500> in<00:04:48.590> other<00:04:48.740> container<00:04:49.130> and

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
yet again put it in other container and

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.060 
yet again put it in other container and
then<00:04:50.480> thoroughly<00:04:51.110> rinse<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.560> with<00:04:51.680> distilled

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
then thoroughly rinse it with distilled

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.690 
then thoroughly rinse it with distilled
water<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:54.590> still<00:04:54.890> water<00:04:55.130> of<00:04:55.310> course<00:04:55.430> doesn't

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
water and still water of course doesn't

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.640 
water and still water of course doesn't
have<00:04:55.850> any<00:04:57.130> dissolve<00:04:58.130> solids<00:04:58.700> in<00:04:58.970> it

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
have any dissolve solids in it

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.240 
have any dissolve solids in it
so<00:05:01.340> this<00:05:01.490> is<00:05:01.639> a<00:05:01.699> good<00:05:01.880> way<00:05:02.090> guaranteeing<00:05:03.250> the

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
so this is a good way guaranteeing the

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.790 
so this is a good way guaranteeing the
murder<00:05:04.430> services<00:05:04.970> as<00:05:05.060> clean<00:05:05.360> as<00:05:05.510> possible<00:05:05.800> and

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
murder services as clean as possible and

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.189 
murder services as clean as possible and
when<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.100> will<00:05:07.280> to<00:05:07.430> drive<00:05:07.669> on<00:05:07.910> it<00:05:08.080> it's<00:05:09.080> not

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
when the will to drive on it it's not

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.460 
when the will to drive on it it's not
going<00:05:09.620> to<00:05:09.830> affect<00:05:10.669> leaving<00:05:11.630> any<00:05:11.750> deposits<00:05:12.229> at

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
going to affect leaving any deposits at

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.030 
going to affect leaving any deposits at
all<00:05:13.720> now<00:05:14.720> carefully<00:05:15.199> lift<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:15.620> wearer<00:05:15.860> out

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
all now carefully lift the wearer out

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.189 
all now carefully lift the wearer out
the<00:05:16.520> final<00:05:16.940> time<00:05:17.150> and<00:05:18.400> then<00:05:19.400> place<00:05:19.639> it<00:05:19.990> in<00:05:20.990> the

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
the final time and then place it in the

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.219 
the final time and then place it in the
drainer<00:05:21.440> on<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.949> towel<00:05:22.419> at<00:05:23.419> a<00:05:23.750> nice<00:05:23.900> steep

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
drainer on the towel at a nice steep

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.400 
drainer on the towel at a nice steep
angle<00:05:24.650> so<00:05:25.580> that<00:05:25.790> the<00:05:25.880> water<00:05:26.060> can<00:05:26.240> start<00:05:26.660> to<00:05:26.960> run

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
angle so that the water can start to run

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.580 
angle so that the water can start to run
off<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:29.419> if<00:05:29.540> you<00:05:29.570> get<00:05:29.780> any<00:05:29.810> really<00:05:30.290> stubborn

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
off and if you get any really stubborn

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.540 
off and if you get any really stubborn
bits<00:05:31.210> then<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.360> can<00:05:32.540> use<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:33.220> corner<00:05:34.220> of<00:05:34.430> the

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
bits then you can use the corner of the

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:42.700 
bits then you can use the corner of the
kitchen<00:05:34.699> towel<00:05:35.560> just<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.710> dab<00:05:36.949> them<00:05:37.130> away<00:05:41.710> and

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
kitchen towel just to dab them away and

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.020 
kitchen towel just to dab them away and
that's<00:05:43.639> it

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
that's it

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.020 
that's it
one<00:05:44.330> clean<00:05:44.630> up
