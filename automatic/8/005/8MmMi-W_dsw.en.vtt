a half cups of sugar and we're going to

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.609 
a half cups of sugar and we're going to
put<00:00:13.610> it<00:00:13.730> into<00:00:13.940> this<00:00:14.600> pot<00:00:15.219> here<00:00:16.219> we<00:00:16.400> go<00:00:20.410> that's<00:00:21.410> a

put it into this pot here we go that's a
lot<00:00:21.830> of<00:00:21.860> sugar<00:00:22.220> we're<00:00:22.550> putting<00:00:22.910> in<00:00:23.060> here<00:00:25.179> okay

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:26.179 
lot of sugar we're putting in here okay

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:39.610 
lot of sugar we're putting in here okay
that's<00:00:26.570> two<00:00:26.960> cups<00:00:27.289> right<00:00:27.650> there<00:00:38.440> alright<00:00:39.440> this

goes in here too

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:52.599 
goes in here too
then<00:00:42.440> get<00:00:42.980> one<00:00:43.280> cup<00:00:43.610> of<00:00:43.640> water<00:00:51.280> showing<00:00:52.280> here

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
then get one cup of water showing here

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.729 
then get one cup of water showing here
now<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:53.989> can<00:00:54.109> see<00:00:54.260> I'm<00:00:54.379> going<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:54.530> put

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
now and you can see I'm going to put

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.750 
now and you can see I'm going to put
this<00:00:54.920> in<00:00:55.219> here<00:00:55.519> and<00:00:56.620> you<00:00:57.620> see<00:00:58.160> how<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.370> sugar

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
this in here and you see how the sugar

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.709 
this in here and you see how the sugar
starts<00:00:59.410> dissolving<00:01:00.609> right<00:01:01.609> away<00:01:01.969> and<00:01:02.359> just

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
starts dissolving right away and just

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.990 
starts dissolving right away and just
sinks<00:01:03.559> in<00:01:03.710> there<00:01:03.949> I<00:01:05.200> got<00:01:06.200> myself<00:01:06.580> would<00:01:07.580> spoon

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
sinks in there I got myself would spoon

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000 
sinks in there I got myself would spoon
because<00:01:08.420> I<00:01:08.870> know<00:01:09.050> it's<00:01:09.290> going<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.560> get<00:01:09.680> really

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
because I know it's going to get really

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:16.120 
because I know it's going to get really
hot<00:01:12.520> stirring<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.640> around<00:01:13.970> now<00:01:14.620> and<00:01:15.620> turn<00:01:15.950> on

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
hot stirring it around now and turn on

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.550 
hot stirring it around now and turn on
the<00:01:16.310> stove<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:18.970> turning<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.120> up<00:01:20.470> pretty<00:01:21.470> much

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
the stove and turning it up pretty much

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.050 
the stove and turning it up pretty much
too<00:01:21.920> high<00:01:22.130> here<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:24.610> we're<00:01:25.610> going<00:01:25.730> to<00:01:25.880> let

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
too high here and we're going to let

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.480 
too high here and we're going to let
this<00:01:26.300> get<00:01:26.720> hotter<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.290> hotter<00:01:27.590> until<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:28.280> gets

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
this get hotter and hotter until it gets

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.370 
this get hotter and hotter until it gets
to<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.730> boil<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:29.720> can<00:01:29.840> see<00:01:30.020> it's<00:01:30.200> getting

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
to a boil so you can see it's getting

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.150 
to a boil so you can see it's getting
thinner<00:01:30.920> now<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:32.000> getting<00:01:32.330> hotter<00:01:32.770> in<00:01:33.770> fact<00:01:34.010> a

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
thinner now and getting hotter in fact a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.030 
thinner now and getting hotter in fact a
lot<00:01:34.340> of<00:01:34.370> its<00:01:34.640> dissolved<00:01:35.270> at<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:35.600> point<00:01:36.040> but

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
lot of its dissolved at this point but

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.210 
lot of its dissolved at this point but
we're<00:01:37.460> going<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.700> let<00:01:37.880> this<00:01:38.090> go<00:01:38.420> until<00:01:39.010> we<00:01:40.010> get

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
we're going to let this go until we get

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.700 
we're going to let this go until we get
a<00:01:40.280> little<00:01:40.550> boil<00:01:40.840> here<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.990> is<00:01:42.140> starting<00:01:42.620> to

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
a little boil here it is starting to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.190 
a little boil here it is starting to
boil<00:01:42.980> and<00:01:43.370> you'll<00:01:44.210> see<00:01:44.390> look<00:01:44.690> at<00:01:44.780> how<00:01:44.960> it's

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
boil and you'll see look at how it's

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.800 
boil and you'll see look at how it's
starting<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.650> foam<00:01:45.920> up<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:46.460> at<00:01:47.420> first<00:01:47.660> you

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
starting to foam up and at first you

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.180 
starting to foam up and at first you
might<00:01:47.960> think<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:48.710> going<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:48.920> boil

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
might think that this is going to boil

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.930 
might think that this is going to boil
over<00:01:49.630> but<00:01:50.630> in<00:01:50.900> fact<00:01:51.200> in<00:01:51.590> just<00:01:52.100> a<00:01:52.280> moment<00:01:52.670> or<00:01:52.730> so

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
over but in fact in just a moment or so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.910 
over but in fact in just a moment or so
it<00:01:53.180> should<00:01:53.450> suddenly<00:01:53.900> clear<00:01:54.560> up

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:08.520 

and<00:01:59.160> we're<00:01:59.370> going<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.640> wait<00:01:59.970> for<00:02:00.000> it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.010 

see<00:02:09.070> now<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.280> bubbles<00:02:09.729> are<00:02:09.880> starting<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.510> go

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
see now the bubbles are starting to go

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.130 
see now the bubbles are starting to go
down<00:02:11.260> again

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.980 

Hey<00:02:15.770> oh<00:02:16.010> wow<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.670> now<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.030> can<00:02:17.360> see<00:02:17.630> I'm<00:02:17.870> going

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
Hey oh wow and now you can see I'm going

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.630 
Hey oh wow and now you can see I'm going
to<00:02:18.050> turn<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.500> off<00:02:18.710> now<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:19.010> can<00:02:19.310> see<00:02:19.490> now

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
to turn this off now you can see now

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.270 
to turn this off now you can see now
we've<00:02:19.880> got<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> nice<00:02:20.390> clear<00:02:20.980> nice<00:02:21.980> clear

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
we've got a nice clear nice clear

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.830 
we've got a nice clear nice clear
solution<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:22.940> I'm<00:02:23.030> going<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.240> take<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.570> off

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
solution so I'm going to take this off

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.600 
solution so I'm going to take this off
and<00:02:26.740> then<00:02:29.110> hopefully<00:02:30.110> your<00:02:30.590> jar<00:02:30.950> isn't<00:02:31.250> gonna

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
and then hopefully your jar isn't gonna

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.810 
and then hopefully your jar isn't gonna
break<00:02:32.120> I'm<00:02:32.420> using<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:33.220> flask<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:34.550> I'm<00:02:34.640> just

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
break I'm using this flask and I'm just

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.770 
break I'm using this flask and I'm just
going<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.060> pour<00:02:35.330> this<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:35.810> here<00:02:35.870> now<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:40.780> little

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
going to pour this in here now a little

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.930 
going to pour this in here now a little
left<00:02:42.200> over<00:02:42.380> but<00:02:42.770> that's<00:02:42.920> okay<00:02:43.310> looks<00:02:43.850> like

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
left over but that's okay looks like

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.380 
left over but that's okay looks like
urine<00:02:44.600> a<00:02:45.050> little<00:02:45.950> bit<00:02:46.130> Brown<00:02:46.400> because<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.060> you

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
urine a little bit Brown because the you

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.350 
urine a little bit Brown because the you
know<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:47.720> like<00:02:47.870> caramel<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.650> sugar<00:02:49.209> gets<00:02:50.209> a

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
know it's like caramel the sugar gets a

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.960 
know it's like caramel the sugar gets a
little<00:02:50.480> bit<00:02:50.690> Brown<00:02:50.900> okay<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.860> now<00:02:52.220> I'm<00:02:52.760> going

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
little bit Brown okay and now I'm going

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.300 
little bit Brown okay and now I'm going
to<00:02:53.030> let<00:02:53.270> this<00:02:53.480> sit<00:02:53.900> really<00:02:54.350> for<00:02:54.890> about

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
to let this sit really for about

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.460 
to let this sit really for about
probably<00:02:56.270> an<00:02:56.420> hour<00:02:56.570> an<00:02:56.810> hour<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.200> half<00:02:57.440> just

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
probably an hour an hour and a half just

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.510 
probably an hour an hour and a half just
to<00:02:58.209> get<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.360> to<00:03:00.200> cool<00:03:00.770> off<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.310> meantime

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
to get it to cool off in the meantime

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.720 
to get it to cool off in the meantime
I've<00:03:02.000> prepared<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:03.230> string<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.489> weight

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
I've prepared the string and a weight

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.630 
I've prepared the string and a weight
and<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.060> stick<00:03:06.020> that<00:03:06.410> I'm<00:03:06.620> going<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:06.950> be<00:03:07.130> placing

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
and a stick that I'm going to be placing

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.060 
and a stick that I'm going to be placing
into<00:03:07.790> here<00:03:08.120> but<00:03:08.630> what<00:03:08.900> I've<00:03:09.050> done<00:03:09.260> already<00:03:09.709> is

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
into here but what I've done already is

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.190 
into here but what I've done already is
that<00:03:10.130> I've<00:03:10.790> wet<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.360> string<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.870> then<00:03:12.170> I

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
that I've wet the string and then I

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.979 
that I've wet the string and then I
placed<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:13.040> here<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.880> kind<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.420> rolled<00:03:14.780> it

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
placed it in here and kind of rolled it

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.990 
placed it in here and kind of rolled it
around<00:03:15.080> in<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.800> sugar<00:03:16.100> there's<00:03:16.550> some<00:03:16.790> sugar

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
around in the sugar there's some sugar

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.170 
around in the sugar there's some sugar
in<00:03:17.360> here<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.410> let<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.650> dry<00:03:18.770> so<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.730> now

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
in here and I let it dry so that now

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.410 
in here and I let it dry so that now
there<00:03:20.720> are<00:03:20.930> little<00:03:21.730> sugar<00:03:22.730> crystals<00:03:23.269> you

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
there are little sugar crystals you

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.880 
there are little sugar crystals you
probably<00:03:23.690> can't<00:03:23.900> see<00:03:24.080> them<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.560> string

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
probably can't see them on the string

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.820 
probably can't see them on the string
alright<00:03:25.489> now<00:03:25.730> just<00:03:26.120> put<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.780> loose<00:03:27.080> cover<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.799> it

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
alright now just put a loose cover on it

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.030 
alright now just put a loose cover on it
like<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:29.120> still<00:03:29.600> want<00:03:29.810> some<00:03:29.989> airflow<00:03:30.230> but

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
like this I still want some airflow but

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.220 
like this I still want some airflow but
I<00:03:31.100> want<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.310> keep<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.640> dust<00:03:31.910> out<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.600> I<00:03:33.049> also

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
I want to keep the dust out and I also

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.110 
I want to keep the dust out and I also
want<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.680> prevent<00:03:34.070> it<00:03:34.280> from<00:03:34.310> cooling<00:03:34.940> too

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
want to prevent it from cooling too

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.630 
want to prevent it from cooling too
quickly<00:03:35.450> on<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.019> surface<00:03:36.470> because<00:03:37.070> I<00:03:37.220> like<00:03:37.430> it

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
quickly on the surface because I like it

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.960 
quickly on the surface because I like it
to<00:03:37.760> cool<00:03:38.000> more<00:03:38.299> uniformly<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:40.370> I've<00:03:40.549> let<00:03:40.760> this

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
to cool more uniformly so I've let this

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.140 
to cool more uniformly so I've let this
thing<00:03:41.299> cool<00:03:41.570> down<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.840> little<00:03:42.140> bit<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.799> now<00:03:43.519> I'm

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
thing cool down a little bit and now I'm

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.270 
thing cool down a little bit and now I'm
gonna<00:03:44.450> place<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:47.269> string<00:03:47.750> in<00:03:47.930> wait<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:49.160> you

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
gonna place the string in wait and you

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.150 
gonna place the string in wait and you
can<00:03:49.459> see<00:03:49.760> how<00:03:50.060> it's<00:03:50.500> goes<00:03:51.500> down<00:03:51.799> about

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
can see how it's goes down about

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.100 
can see how it's goes down about
two-thirds<00:03:52.940> three-quarters<00:03:53.299> of<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.780> way<00:03:53.900> and

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
two-thirds three-quarters of the way and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.560 
two-thirds three-quarters of the way and
I'm<00:03:54.170> going<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.350> make<00:03:54.500> sure<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:54.680> Center<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.570> and

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
I'm going to make sure I Center it and

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.330 
I'm going to make sure I Center it and
then<00:03:56.900> I'm<00:03:57.049> going<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.290> put<00:03:57.470> that<00:03:57.650> loose<00:03:57.980> cover

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
then I'm going to put that loose cover

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.670 
then I'm going to put that loose cover
back<00:03:58.640> down<00:03:59.200> then<00:04:00.200> we're<00:04:00.320> going<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.500> watch<00:04:00.650> that

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
back down then we're going to watch that

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:30.159 
back down then we're going to watch that
for<00:04:01.190> about<00:04:01.280> two<00:04:01.580> weeks

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.719 

all<00:04:31.169> right<00:04:31.319> it's<00:04:31.409> been<00:04:31.530> about<00:04:31.740> two<00:04:32.039> weeks<00:04:32.340> here

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
all right it's been about two weeks here

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.879 
all right it's been about two weeks here
so<00:04:33.539> I'm<00:04:33.659> going<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:33.870> pull<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:34.199> out<00:04:34.379> why<00:04:34.620> should

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
so I'm going to pull this out why should

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.110 
so I'm going to pull this out why should
come<00:04:35.099> over<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.430> look<00:04:35.520> at<00:04:35.639> this<00:04:35.819> and<00:04:36.000> see

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
come over and look at this and see

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.209 
come over and look at this and see
there's<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.389> crust<00:04:36.719> on<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.110> top<00:04:37.349> that's<00:04:37.740> okay

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
there's a crust on the top that's okay

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.089 
there's a crust on the top that's okay
I'm<00:04:38.849> trying<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.240> pull<00:04:39.449> this<00:04:39.599> out<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.199> I<00:04:40.919> can

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
I'm trying to pull this out and I can

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.969 
I'm trying to pull this out and I can
feel<00:04:41.280> doesn't<00:04:42.000> want<00:04:42.240> whoa<00:04:42.780> there<00:04:43.530> we<00:04:43.650> go

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
feel doesn't want whoa there we go

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.899 
feel doesn't want whoa there we go
and<00:04:44.819> I<00:04:44.879> came<00:04:45.180> out<00:04:45.449> here<00:04:46.099> way<00:04:47.099> is<00:04:47.219> a<00:04:47.250> lot<00:04:47.520> smaller

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
and I came out here way is a lot smaller

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.640 
and I came out here way is a lot smaller
looking<00:04:48.180> than<00:04:48.509> it<00:04:48.659> looked<00:04:49.020> at<00:04:49.229> it<00:04:49.349> when<00:04:49.409> it<00:04:49.530> was

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
looking than it looked at it when it was

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.700 
looking than it looked at it when it was
in<00:04:49.680> there<00:04:49.979> but<00:04:50.159> that's<00:04:50.340> okay<00:04:50.699> so<00:04:51.710> sometimes

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
in there but that's okay so sometimes

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.350 
in there but that's okay so sometimes
you<00:04:52.889> really<00:04:53.069> can't<00:04:53.189> pull<00:04:53.699> it<00:04:53.729> out<00:04:53.969> very<00:04:54.240> well

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
you really can't pull it out very well

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.209 
you really can't pull it out very well
in<00:04:54.629> that<00:04:54.840> case<00:04:55.110> you<00:04:55.319> know<00:04:55.439> just<00:04:55.710> go<00:04:55.860> ahead<00:04:55.949> and

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
in that case you know just go ahead and

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.059 
in that case you know just go ahead and
crush<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.879> top<00:04:57.150> little<00:04:57.479> layer<00:04:58.069> sometimes

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
crush the top little layer sometimes

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.850 
crush the top little layer sometimes
what<00:04:59.219> you<00:04:59.310> can<00:04:59.520> do<00:04:59.729> is<00:05:00.000> pour<00:05:00.990> out<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.319> goop<00:05:01.590> and

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
what you can do is pour out the goop and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.519 
what you can do is pour out the goop and
then<00:05:02.069> and<00:05:02.610> then<00:05:03.150> pour<00:05:03.449> some<00:05:03.719> hot<00:05:03.900> water<00:05:04.259> around

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:04.529 
then and then pour some hot water around

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:06.230 
then and then pour some hot water around
the<00:05:04.770> edges<00:05:05.159> and<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.460> will<00:05:05.610> eventually<00:05:05.759> let

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
the edges and that will eventually let

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.890 
the edges and that will eventually let
it<00:05:06.590> release<00:05:07.590> for<00:05:08.069> now<00:05:08.159> I'm<00:05:08.370> just<00:05:08.430> going<00:05:08.849> to<00:05:08.900> put

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
it release for now I'm just going to put

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.249 
it release for now I'm just going to put
this<00:05:10.050> over<00:05:10.259> here<00:05:10.759> you<00:05:11.759> let<00:05:11.969> it<00:05:12.120> hang<00:05:12.419> and<00:05:12.770> dry

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:15.259 
this over here you let it hang and dry

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.320 
this over here you let it hang and dry
okay<00:05:16.259> so<00:05:16.319> this<00:05:16.560> is<00:05:16.770> now<00:05:16.979> pretty<00:05:17.400> dry<00:05:17.789> looks

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
okay so this is now pretty dry looks

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.850 
okay so this is now pretty dry looks
good<00:05:18.629> but<00:05:18.900> I'd<00:05:18.990> like<00:05:19.080> to<00:05:19.139> get<00:05:19.379> rid<00:05:19.560> of<00:05:19.590> this

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
good but I'd like to get rid of this

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.159 
good but I'd like to get rid of this
stuff<00:05:20.129> up<00:05:20.370> here<00:05:20.759> so<00:05:21.029> the<00:05:21.210> crystal<00:05:21.569> looks<00:05:21.750> nicer

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
stuff up here so the crystal looks nicer

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.929 
stuff up here so the crystal looks nicer
so<00:05:22.500> I'm<00:05:22.620> going<00:05:22.800> to<00:05:22.919> bring<00:05:23.370> it<00:05:23.490> over<00:05:23.729> to<00:05:23.819> the

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 
so I'm going to bring it over to the

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.830 
so I'm going to bring it over to the
sink<00:05:25.340> some<00:05:26.340> of<00:05:26.460> this<00:05:26.580> I<00:05:26.759> can<00:05:26.969> just<00:05:27.000> break<00:05:27.569> off

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
sink some of this I can just break off

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.920 
sink some of this I can just break off
like<00:05:28.139> that<00:05:28.849> but<00:05:29.849> if<00:05:30.029> you<00:05:30.150> want<00:05:30.330> it<00:05:30.479> if<00:05:30.719> you

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
like that but if you want it if you

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.570 
like that but if you want it if you
really<00:05:31.110> want<00:05:31.259> to<00:05:31.560> shape<00:05:31.800> it<00:05:31.979> exactly<00:05:32.400> the<00:05:32.550> way

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
really want to shape it exactly the way

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.969 
really want to shape it exactly the way
one<00:05:32.969> you<00:05:33.240> create<00:05:33.779> a<00:05:33.810> little<00:05:33.990> stream<00:05:34.529> of<00:05:34.710> very

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
one you create a little stream of very

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.860 
one you create a little stream of very
hot<00:05:35.250> water<00:05:35.520> I've<00:05:35.849> already<00:05:36.120> preheated<00:05:36.419> this

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
hot water I've already preheated this

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.820 
hot water I've already preheated this
and<00:05:37.560> just<00:05:37.710> kind<00:05:37.949> of<00:05:37.979> run<00:05:38.219> it<00:05:38.400> over<00:05:39.389> the<00:05:39.830> where

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
and just kind of run it over the where

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.589 
and just kind of run it over the where
you<00:05:40.919> want<00:05:41.129> it<00:05:41.219> to<00:05:41.339> go<00:05:41.490> away<00:05:42.500> kind<00:05:43.500> of<00:05:44.449> sculpt<00:05:45.449> it

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
you want it to go away kind of sculpt it

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.589 
you want it to go away kind of sculpt it
in<00:05:45.839> a<00:05:45.930> way<00:05:46.050> with<00:05:46.199> the<00:05:46.289> hot<00:05:46.440> water<00:05:46.819> and<00:05:47.819> that's

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
in a way with the hot water and that's

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.570 
in a way with the hot water and that's
pretty<00:05:48.870> good<00:05:49.139> like<00:05:49.319> that<00:05:49.349> and<00:05:49.949> then<00:05:50.190> I'm<00:05:50.339> just

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
pretty good like that and then I'm just

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.279 
pretty good like that and then I'm just
going<00:05:50.789> to<00:05:50.819> put<00:05:51.120> it<00:05:51.240> in<00:05:51.389> here<00:05:51.690> and<00:05:51.839> let<00:05:52.020> it<00:05:52.139> do

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
going to put it in here and let it do

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.059 
going to put it in here and let it do
its<00:05:52.319> file<00:05:52.830> drying<00:05:53.400> and<00:05:54.469> we've<00:05:55.469> got<00:05:55.650> a<00:05:55.680> complete

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
its file drying and we've got a complete

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:05.100 
its file drying and we've got a complete
crystal

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.170
