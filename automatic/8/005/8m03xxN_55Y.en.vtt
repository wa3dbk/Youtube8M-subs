custom tires on listed on the wheel
accessories<00:01:48.789> just<00:01:48.939> because<00:01:49.240> this<00:01:49.389> is<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.569> race

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:49.779 
accessories just because this is a race

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:51.779 
accessories just because this is a race
car<00:01:49.810> there's<00:01:50.740> only<00:01:50.829> three<00:01:51.130> options<00:01:51.490> listed

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
car there's only three options listed

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.370 
car there's only three options listed
under<00:01:52.029> the<00:01:52.119> exhaust<00:01:52.420> you've<00:01:52.689> got<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.869> dual<00:01:53.109> and

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
under the exhaust you've got a dual and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.989 
under the exhaust you've got a dual and
a<00:01:53.439> big<00:01:53.619> bore<00:01:53.859> I<00:01:54.069> think<00:01:54.399> the<00:01:54.490> big<00:01:54.670> bore<00:01:54.880> is

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
a big bore I think the big bore is

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.429 
a big bore I think the big bore is
probably<00:01:55.329> more<00:01:55.569> accurate<00:01:55.719> but<00:01:56.200> this<00:01:56.319> is

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
probably more accurate but this is

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.499 
probably more accurate but this is
totally<00:01:56.770> up<00:01:56.859> to<00:01:56.889> you<00:01:57.219> again<00:01:57.849> under<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.329> hood

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
totally up to you again under the hood

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.639 
totally up to you again under the hood
we've<00:01:58.689> only<00:01:58.840> got<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.020> couple<00:01:59.259> of<00:01:59.409> different

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
we've only got a couple of different

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.559 
we've only got a couple of different
options<00:01:59.770> I<00:02:00.189> just<00:02:00.669> let<00:02:00.819> this<00:02:00.939> stock<00:02:01.240> because<00:02:01.509> I

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
options I just let this stock because I

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.029 
options I just let this stock because I
think<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.840> stock<00:02:02.079> hood<00:02:02.289> looks<00:02:02.499> most<00:02:02.740> like<00:02:02.829> the

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
think the stock hood looks most like the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.339 
think the stock hood looks most like the
real-life<00:02:03.340> car<00:02:03.639> under<00:02:04.450> spoilers<00:02:04.899> I<00:02:05.049> think<00:02:05.259> the

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
real-life car under spoilers I think the

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:07.109 
real-life car under spoilers I think the
most<00:02:05.529> accurate<00:02:05.799> wing<00:02:06.279> is<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.579> drift<00:02:06.880> wing

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
most accurate wing is the drift wing

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.969 
most accurate wing is the drift wing
would<00:02:07.419> be<00:02:07.509> nice<00:02:07.689> if<00:02:07.869> it<00:02:07.959> has<00:02:08.110> some<00:02:08.289> side<00:02:08.560> panels

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
would be nice if it has some side panels

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:09.929 
would be nice if it has some side panels
but<00:02:09.160> it's<00:02:09.280> definitely<00:02:09.549> got<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.759> height

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:09.939 
but it's definitely got the height

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:10.320 
but it's definitely got the height
between

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
between

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.210 
between
and<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.230> bumpers<00:02:11.530> there's<00:02:11.680> only<00:02:11.800> one<00:02:12.010> option

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
and a bumpers there's only one option

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.920 
and a bumpers there's only one option
that<00:02:12.460> gives<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.820> front<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.150> car<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.420> carbon

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that gives the front of a car a carbon

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.660 
that gives the front of a car a carbon
look<00:02:14.140> I've<00:02:14.500> just<00:02:14.560> left<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.070> stock<00:02:15.340> because<00:02:15.610> I

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
look I've just left this stock because I

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.160 
look I've just left this stock because I
