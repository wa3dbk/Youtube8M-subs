moderate and strong El Nino years and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.050 
moderate and strong El Nino years and
we're<00:02:04.950> taking<00:02:05.100> all<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.460> those<00:02:05.759> years

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
we're taking all of those years

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
we're taking all of those years
precipitation<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.200> averaging<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.799> together

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.400

and<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.239> see<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.929> more<00:02:10.170> widespread

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
the entire state of Arizona so let's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.590 
the entire state of Arizona so let's
take<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:20.040> step<00:02:20.070> further<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.940> look<00:02:21.480> at

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
take that one step further and look at

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.230 
take that one step further and look at
all<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.170> week<00:02:22.380> El<00:02:22.590> Nino<00:02:22.950> years

all of the week El Nino years

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.390 
all of the week El Nino years
individually<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:25.140> here<00:02:25.470> each<00:02:25.680> map<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.370> showing

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
individually so here each map is showing

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.600 
individually so here each map is showing
an<00:02:26.960> individual<00:02:27.960> weak<00:02:28.230> El<00:02:28.470> Nino<00:02:28.800> year<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.370> it's

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
an individual weak El Nino year and it's

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.410 
an individual weak El Nino year and it's

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.900

can<00:02:33.570> see<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.900> three<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.290> these<00:02:34.560> years<00:02:35.160> were

can see that three of these years were

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.720 
can see that three of these years were

two of these years were wetter than

two of these years were wetter than
