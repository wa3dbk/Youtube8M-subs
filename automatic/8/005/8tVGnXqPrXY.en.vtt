 remember that we are students 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.120
 therefore we must study before 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.820
 to get to the class prepare the topics 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.880

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.810
 the class we can clear with our 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.869

 medical students we have 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.000
 a lot of things to do leave us 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.430
 countless homework assignments 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.429
 exhibitions and many times we have to 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.979
 study for exams it is important that 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.229

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.760
 you have to sleep when you enter the 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.010
 race your resting hours are going to 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.260
 decrease that's why if you have 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.330
 free time if you've finished your homework 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.120
 and you already studied for your exhibitions and 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.070
 your exams and you still have time 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.720
 rest because they will occupy those energies 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.510
 to focus your attention on the 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.120
 following topics 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.550

 fears many times when we enter the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.260
 career most people with the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.690
 that we speak scares us and tells us that 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.510
 it's going to be tremendously difficult, not what 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.510
 you create for that is point number 3 the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.580
 organization as long as everything is 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.710
 is organized and you want out all of 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.840

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.610
 but everything can be organized if 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.090
 correct way 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.610

 once the second year of the race you are 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.600
 the hardest do not give up is a 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.640
 adaptation process that is 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.160
 completely normal, many times 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.160
 we are not used to having 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.190
 so much of our day in the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.100
 study 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.050
 Tip number 7 enjoy what you do 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.870
 do not make something fun and 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.020
 entertained in something tedious if you 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.620
 you press relax, give your break of 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.930
 five minutes rest breathe and follow 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.140
 studying things do not have to be 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.080
 stressful you can 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.300
 advice number 8 study for life and 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.370
 not only to pass the exam remember 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.650
 that we are medical students and in 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.270
 a future we will be doctors and every 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.940
 Patient who comes to our office 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.280
 it's going to be a surprise test in which 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.290
 you will not be able to take a look at the book 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.050
 five minutes before that's how it is 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.600
 get ready from now on that in the future 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.990

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.660
 advice number 9 feed yourself well always 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.690
 before going to school, breakfast 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.640
 Well, you're going to require energy to 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.800
 to be able to concentrate on the topics that 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.780
 they are watching in class otherwise you 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.570
 you will feel tired with sleep and 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.920
 probably with a headache 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.740
 Eating well will help you maintain 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.350
 concentration 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.870

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.820
 number 10 never give up remember that 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.100
 the medical career is a career 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.740
 difficult but more than difficult is a 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.380
 endurance race in which you have 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.320
 your highs and lows can be edited 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.420
 low self-esteem constantly given to 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.220
 test scores in exams 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.680
 or simply from low ratings 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.380
 never give up just devote more 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.720
 time and keep studying 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.520

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.750
