to wear it um there is some welding done

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.099 
to wear it um there is some welding done
like<00:00:58.020> I've<00:00:58.199> done<00:00:58.620> welding<00:00:58.890> um<00:00:59.570> I've<00:01:00.570> done<00:01:00.780> um

tip and anyway so people often ask me

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170 
tip and anyway so people often ask me
metal<00:01:10.619> smithing<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.040> know<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.909> that

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
metal smithing you know what is that

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.140 
metal smithing you know what is that
what<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.260> well<00:01:14.130> primarily<00:01:14.729> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
what what do you do well primarily I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.580 
what what do you do well primarily I
like<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> make<00:01:16.549> functional<00:01:17.549> pieces<00:01:18.590> like

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
like to make functional pieces like

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.469 
like to make functional pieces like
jewelry<00:01:21.740> bracelets<00:01:22.740> I'll<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
jewelry bracelets I'll put up like a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.080 
jewelry bracelets I'll put up like a
slide<00:01:24.840> show<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.229> things<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.130> I've<00:01:26.250> done<00:01:29.090> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
slide show of things that I've done and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.480 
slide show of things that I've done and
so<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.200> be<00:01:31.229> jewelry<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.340> be

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
so it can be jewelry or it can be

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.690 
so it can be jewelry or it can be
sculptural<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.770> pretty

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
sculptural but really it's it can pretty

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.100 
sculptural but really it's it can pretty
much<00:01:35.880> anything<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.689> make<00:01:36.840> out<00:01:36.960> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
much anything that you can make out of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.300 
much anything that you can make out of
paper<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.990> make<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> paper<00:01:40.619> birdhouse

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
paper like if you make a paper birdhouse

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.340 
paper like if you make a paper birdhouse
you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> take<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> same<00:01:42.570> measurements<00:01:43.170> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you can take the same measurements and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.190 
you can take the same measurements and
fabricate<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.460> metal<00:01:45.079> it's<00:01:46.079> not

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
fabricate that out of metal it's not

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.929 
fabricate that out of metal it's not
gonna<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.470> very<00:01:46.500> functional<00:01:47.130> because<00:01:47.310> metal

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
gonna be very functional because metal

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
gonna be very functional because metal
and<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:49.049> out<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> elements<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.890> gonna

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and if it's out the elements it's gonna

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.340 
and if it's out the elements it's gonna
rust<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.490> that's<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> point<00:01:51.329> anyway<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:53.810> do<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
rust but that's a point anyway so I do a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.690 
rust but that's a point anyway so I do a
lot<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.250> jewelry<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.920> lot<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.189> motivation

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
lot of jewelry and a lot of motivation

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.209 
lot of jewelry and a lot of motivation
behind<00:01:59.880> my<00:02:00.119> pieces<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.750> personal<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.940 

I<00:02:05.249> like<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> lot<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.079> my<00:02:07.229> pieces<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.799> have

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I like for a lot of my pieces to have

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.650 
I like for a lot of my pieces to have
open<00:02:08.610> interpretation<00:02:09.590> meaning<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:11.660> each

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
open interpretation meaning that each

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.520 
open interpretation meaning that each
viewer<00:02:13.110> can<00:02:13.440> take<00:02:13.620> something<00:02:13.890> different<00:02:14.430> from

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
viewer can take something different from

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.979 
viewer can take something different from
the<00:02:16.530> piece<00:02:16.769> like<00:02:17.610> one<00:02:18.000> person<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.540> walk<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:18.959> to

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
the piece like one person can walk up to

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.930 
the piece like one person can walk up to
it<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.260> go<00:02:19.440> oh<00:02:19.769> well<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.040> think<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.459> means<00:02:20.610> this

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
it and go oh well I think it means this

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.420 
it and go oh well I think it means this
and<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.989> next<00:02:22.260> person<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.739> walk<00:02:22.860> over<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.400> it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
and the next person can walk over to it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.930 
and the next person can walk over to it
and<00:02:23.670> go<00:02:23.819> really<00:02:24.780> cuz<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:26.280> looks<00:02:26.310> like<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.819> means

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
and go really cuz it looks like it means

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.440 
and go really cuz it looks like it means
this<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.420> me<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:29.660> but<00:02:30.890> metal<00:02:31.890> smithing<00:02:32.519> is<00:02:32.849> what

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
this to me so but metal smithing is what

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.509 
this to me so but metal smithing is what
I<00:02:33.480> do<00:02:33.629> and<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:34.379> I<00:02:34.620> don't<00:02:34.860> do<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.099> whole<00:02:35.190> lot<00:02:35.370> of

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
I do and so I don't do a whole lot of
