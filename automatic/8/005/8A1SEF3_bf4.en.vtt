00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
to start off in combat a bit so since I

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.839 
to start off in combat a bit so since I
see<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.370> 45<00:02:42.129> 45<00:02:43.129> attack<00:02:43.400> is<00:02:43.549> my<00:02:43.700> highest

combat<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.540> I'm<00:02:45.349> probably<00:02:45.590> gonna<00:02:45.799> advance

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
combat that I'm probably gonna advance

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.620 
combat that I'm probably gonna advance
strength<00:02:46.790> 45<00:02:47.299> defense<00:02:48.700> 45-45<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.269> mage

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
strength 45 defense 45-45 and and mage

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.400 
strength 45 defense 45-45 and and mage
45<00:02:52.000> just<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:53.209> it'd<00:02:53.329> probably<00:02:53.569> be<00:02:53.720> even<00:02:54.049> out

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410
