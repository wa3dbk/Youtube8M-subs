00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hi it's brett from LA and i have to pack

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.490 
hi it's brett from LA and i have to pack
some<00:00:03.480> apples<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.859> bring<00:00:05.730> somewhere<00:00:06.470> so<00:00:07.470> i

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
some apples to bring somewhere so i

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.080 
some apples to bring somewhere so i
haven't<00:00:07.710> packed<00:00:07.919> up<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.250> bags<00:00:08.519> had<00:00:08.910> two

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
haven't packed up in bags had two

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.190 
haven't packed up in bags had two
different<00:00:09.210> bags<00:00:09.480> since<00:00:09.690> i'm<00:00:09.840> going<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.019> do<00:00:10.110> an

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
different bags since i'm going to do an

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.259 
different bags since i'm going to do an
experiment<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:11.250> these<00:00:11.370> apples<00:00:11.700> on<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> bag<00:00:12.030> are

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
experiment so these apples on a bag are

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.930 
experiment so these apples on a bag are
part<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.320> peanut<00:00:13.920> butter<00:00:13.950> cookie<00:00:14.340> with

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
part of the peanut butter cookie with

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.279 
part of the peanut butter cookie with
peanut<00:00:14.969> butter<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.480> top<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.080> then<00:00:16.230> you

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
peanut butter on top of it and then you

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.900 
peanut butter on top of it and then you
put<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.529> Apple<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.830> top<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.730> it's

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
put the Apple on top of that it's

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.310 
put the Apple on top of that it's
another<00:00:18.119> video<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.630> did<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.960> may<00:00:19.050> want<00:00:19.260> to

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
another video that I did you may want to

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.500 
another video that I did you may want to
check<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.500> out<00:00:19.680> because<00:00:20.670> they're<00:00:21.000> delicious

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
check that out because they're delicious

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.470 
check that out because they're delicious
and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.380> there's<00:00:22.560> cinnamon<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.980> top<00:00:23.010> too<00:00:23.480> but

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
and then there's cinnamon on top too but

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.089 
and then there's cinnamon on top too but
since<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.019> bring<00:00:25.260> these<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> potluck

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
since I have to bring these to a potluck

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.700 
since I have to bring these to a potluck
tomorrow<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:27.109> it's<00:00:28.109> over<00:00:28.230> night<00:00:28.470> they're

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
tomorrow and it's over night they're

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.050 
tomorrow and it's over night they're
going<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.920> start<00:00:29.130> getting<00:00:29.220> Brown<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.760> fact<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
going to start getting Brown in fact I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.160 
going to start getting Brown in fact I
think<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.630> back<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.810> already

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
think the one in the back is already

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.240 
think the one in the back is already
starting<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.500> get<00:00:31.560> brown<00:00:31.769> but<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.040> I'm<00:00:32.130> going

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
starting to get brown but what I'm going

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.880 
starting to get brown but what I'm going
to<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:33.230> they<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:34.440> brown<00:00:34.770> because<00:00:35.130> of

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
to do is they get brown because of

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.340 
to do is they get brown because of
oxidization<00:00:38.360> oxidization<00:00:39.360> oxidization<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
oxidization oxidization oxidization to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.950 
oxidization oxidization oxidization to
get<00:00:40.469> oxidized<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.700> get<00:00:41.820> brown<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.750> my

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
get oxidized and you get brown so my

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.440 
get oxidized and you get brown so my
thought<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.550> don't<00:00:44.550> let<00:00:44.760> them<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.969> around<00:00:45.180> air

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
thought is don't let them be around air

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.910 
thought is don't let them be around air
which<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.020> kind<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.289> done<00:00:46.379> by<00:00:46.500> put<00:00:46.680> them<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.860> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
which a kind of done by put them in a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.819 
which a kind of done by put them in a
bag<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.670> put<00:00:47.940> carbon<00:00:48.629> dioxide<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.590> bag

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
bag but put carbon dioxide in the bag

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.920 
bag but put carbon dioxide in the bag
the<00:00:50.579> easiest<00:00:50.879> way<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> make<00:00:51.149> carbon<00:00:51.420> dioxide

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the easiest way to make carbon dioxide

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
the easiest way to make carbon dioxide
of<00:00:52.050> course<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.430> baking<00:00:53.430> soda<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.910> vinegar<00:00:56.300> so

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
of course is baking soda and vinegar so

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090 
of course is baking soda and vinegar so
I've<00:00:57.390> got<00:00:57.570> my<00:00:57.600> baking<00:00:58.020> soda<00:00:58.230> we've<00:00:58.859> got<00:00:59.010> my

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
I've got my baking soda we've got my

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.970 
I've got my baking soda we've got my
vinegar<00:00:59.809> at<00:01:00.809> my<00:01:00.930> apples<00:01:01.260> got<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.680> little<00:01:01.770> bowl

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
vinegar at my apples got my little bowl

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.390 
vinegar at my apples got my little bowl
to<00:01:02.100> mix<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.899> haha<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.290> open<00:01:04.589> cut

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
to mix it in haha this is an open cut

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.289 
to mix it in haha this is an open cut
okay<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.490> i<00:01:08.580> got<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.880> open<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:10.130> put<00:01:11.299> some

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
okay so i got this open now put some

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.090 
okay so i got this open now put some
baking<00:01:13.110> soda<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:14.400> sure<00:01:14.580> how<00:01:14.729> much<00:01:16.100> it's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
baking soda in not sure how much it's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.490 
baking soda in not sure how much it's
all<00:01:17.220> mad<00:01:17.520> scientist<00:01:18.090> experiment

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.580 

pour<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.650> vinegar<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.870> put<00:01:25.870> all<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.080> gas<00:01:26.229> in

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
pour the vinegar in put all the gas in

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.170 
pour the vinegar in put all the gas in
here<00:01:26.920> somehow<00:01:27.250> magically<00:01:27.580> because<00:01:28.000> there's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
here somehow magically because there's

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.700 
here somehow magically because there's
air<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.420> there<00:01:28.750> now<00:01:28.930> and<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.170> figure<00:01:29.409> carbon

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
air in there now and a figure carbon

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.020 
air in there now and a figure carbon
dioxide<00:01:30.159> I<00:01:30.400> know<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.820> get<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.060> idea<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.850> have

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
dioxide I know you get the idea we have

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.890 
dioxide I know you get the idea we have
a<00:01:34.060> little<00:01:34.240> Michael<00:01:34.750> Vick<00:01:34.900> action<00:01:35.260> outside<00:01:35.409> ah

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:49.950 

crap<00:01:46.409> shut<00:01:47.409> up<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.880> is<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.060> slim<00:01:49.420> chance<00:01:49.479> that

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
crap shut up there is a slim chance that

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.060 
crap shut up there is a slim chance that
this<00:01:50.170> has<00:01:50.380> some<00:01:50.940> whatever<00:01:51.940> I<00:01:52.030> said<00:01:52.270> in<00:01:52.479> it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
this has some whatever I said in it

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.200 
this has some whatever I said in it
so<00:01:55.070> I'm<00:01:55.159> going<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.370> leave<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.610> bags<00:01:55.790> overnight

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
so I'm going to leave the bags overnight

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.750 
so I'm going to leave the bags overnight
one<00:01:56.420> carbon<00:01:56.780> dioxide<00:01:57.140> one<00:01:57.409> with<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.680> air<00:01:57.950> which

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
one carbon dioxide one with I air which

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.130 
one carbon dioxide one with I air which
as<00:01:58.940> we<00:01:59.090> all<00:01:59.119> know<00:01:59.390> is<00:01:59.420> twenty<00:01:59.750> percent<00:01:59.990> oxygen

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
as we all know is twenty percent oxygen

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.109 
as we all know is twenty percent oxygen
eighty<00:02:00.860> percent<00:02:00.979> nitrogen<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.880> little<00:02:02.060> bit

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
eighty percent nitrogen and a little bit

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.969 
eighty percent nitrogen and a little bit
other<00:02:02.270> stuff<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:03.590> I'll<00:02:03.710> leave<00:02:03.830> them

other stuff and I'll leave them

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:12.580 
other stuff and I'll leave them
overnight<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.490> see<00:02:05.000> what<00:02:05.150> happens<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
overnight and see what happens the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.190 
overnight and see what happens the
