00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:06.920
 the soil is alive it houses 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.380
 billions of micro organisms the most 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.670
 visible are the earthworms 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.590
 architect of the soil they dig 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.710
 galleries that allow water to air 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.140
 to the roots to breathe and develop 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.910
 mino mode like this one is a 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.100
 real house that hosts a 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.640
 underground population is invisible 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.100
 do not put them away 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.869
 grelinette is the ideal tool to ventilate 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.630
 the soil without disturbing this life 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.540
 microscopic and complex the bobbin 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.489
 bears the pretty name of its inventor 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.920
 sir greling she is provided with 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.920
 several very sharp teeth that 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.680
 effectively bite the ground these two 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.870
 sleeves help to leverage the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.469
 grelinette asks me no force 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.590
 physical 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.260
 the tool works smoothly 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.800
 preserving the back of the gardener or the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.530
 planter 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.340
 I plant the tool simply with the 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.670
 body weight 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:07.810
 here the soil is very hard I press the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:11.479
 sleeves folding knees without bc 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.490
 I always work backwards to 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.539
 not trample the land that I come all 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.299
 just a piece of furniture here it is no longer 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:24.740
 matter of raising return wearing the 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.380
 earth the grelinette raises the ground on 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.450
 about thirty centimeters the air 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.619
 penetrates the compact soil and 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.789
 microorganisms on the soil surface 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.649
 are not run away and suffocated the tool is 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.869
 tipped forward and break the 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.609
 more finely modes a movement of 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.810
 h &amp; m rotation of the same line is 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:49.219
 prepare this vegetable board he 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.380
 must of course remove the roots of 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.029
 wheatgrass bindweed and all 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.130
 plants that might compete with 

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:57.609
 the crops it removes very 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.609
 easily 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.030
 a hill is asking a certain 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.070
 financial investment it is possible 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.560
 to use a simple fork spade 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.080
 the same way we escaped without the tool and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.430
 we tilt it forward this 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.050
 method is very practical too 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.410
 when we have a tiny surface of 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.290
 vegetable garden to prepare and that's it 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.840
 remains more than sowing the earthworms 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.620
 can again resume the path of 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.500
 fertility 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.950
 the real tillage for them does not 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.950
 that start
