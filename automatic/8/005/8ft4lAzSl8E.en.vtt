00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.810
 good to the dice we are already here with 

00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:05.970
 another video and this time we will see 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.549
 a two-port racing car that 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.200
 they are quite interesting let's go 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.190
 to give are the two equal one in base 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.730
 white and another in black glass 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.920
 there we have one and only where the brand 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.740
 law puzzles are therefore very 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.349
 economic and very good quality and here 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.930
 we have in another as you see this 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.270
 it is simply a dodecahedron of 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.340
 plastic that have been made cut 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.309
 to get eight corners through here by 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.719
 here and here and so here like this 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.480
 we got eight pieces in a dodecahedron 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:41.170
 one two three and four and below others 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.780
 four therefore if we have eight 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.300
 pieces is purely a two by two is a 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.159
 pure two by two but of course to be such 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.129
 have a dodecahedron shape has twelve 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.269
 faces and therefore has twelve colors 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.940
 As you can see the features are pretty 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.710
 big 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.320
 to a cube that is very well rotated 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.149
 pretty good and good let's do is 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.949
 Of course, the good thing is that this 2 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.259
 by 2 is a modification of the classic 2 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.690
 by 2 to the second of 4 well then it 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.229
 deform let's do 1 ll for example 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.930
 the one of fs if we return it it is not 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.610
 would recover with the same you see what is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 It is therefore clear that 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.870
 so they have two forms of dodecahedron 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.510
 ayala another education is that it does not have 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.409
 form of dodecahedron let's see what 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.289
 we dismantled here 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.909
 but of course this would be a corner 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.219
 then the next corner over here 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.960
 I should have blue the next 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.600
 we have to fix ourselves we are going to dismantle 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.950
 and so we are going to solve one and see 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.569
 how it is resolved because really 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.870
 it's very simple because it's only with 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.850
 a 2 x 2 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.300
 turns quite well has even some 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.300
 cut 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.190
 It does not have an excessive cut and good cut 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.310
 the cut and that's why you do not have here already 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.549
 stride 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.200
 let's see some more and good turnaround 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.729
 there it would be dismantled 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.590
 and well , this would be in its version 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.439
 white declared instead of wearing white 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.840
 took black but good all the rest 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.640
 all other colors are the same 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.170
 she is also very pretty in both 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.879
 good colors let's start let's go 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.069
 solve what should not be very difficult 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.890
 here we take a piece of reference by 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.989
 example is white red blue that are 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.700
 very familiar colors the cubes us and 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.450
 we are looking for another one that has white and blue 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.670
 I guess we're going to see where it is with the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.180
 few pieces there are and I'm not going to 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.600
 find 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.850
 good white and blue I do not lie 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.650
 you can only wear blue over here clear 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.360
 blue because here it does not wear white 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.880
 then you see why it can confuse a 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.630
 little bit 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.750
 to see to see where the blues here 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.360
 but here is this piece that goes here 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.860
 but of course I was a bit like that and it has not 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.840
 seen this to see that I clarify myself as 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.610
 how do we put the piece so that it stays 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.910
 how I want 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.990
 so he saw a little yes 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.990
 we'll see 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:07.300
 so neither the truth that ration 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:11.020
 neither one more and it moves us away 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.490
 nothing I do not get what bad luck now 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.390
 I'm going to try another one, I'm going to put 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.200
 try white because this is not 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.850
 ok I have two now the blue good 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.020
 so it is but I can not put it 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.020
 let's put it like this 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.510
 it's like badly oriented I do not suppose we're going 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.510
 to continue giving until it is oriented 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.069
 and now here it goes to one with yellow and with 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.420
 lilac 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.780
 the last one is the only one we could 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.310
 half inferred that this fence would be if 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.040
 makes a layer 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.980
 and well now another layer to see the l l 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.280
 it should be fixed and it should be fixed 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.680
 in the colors that go through here 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.390
 Let's see if it's clear, we'd have a fast 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.569
 let's try to do this to those who 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.569
 come out 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.120
 it's worth the two grays and now here I suppose 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.120
 that would have to orient the tables 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.120
 I suppose 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.070
 ok I think so 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.549
 clear let's put together here we would have 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.560
 this well see and we would have well almost 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.840
 all done the only thing that would be missing would be 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.130
 change is for this that would be good 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.130
 because in the typical algorithm of changing 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.020
 two as sold under and I return or 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.520
 any pnl the truth that change two 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.520
 Adjacent corners do not back 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.950
 to see if you want and here it's worth it 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.530
 I would be determined 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.450
 just like a 2 for 2 but of course it has 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.510
 12 colors instead of 6 then to the 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.670
 time to make room for a 2 for 2 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.310
 it's a little messy it's already in its version 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.160
 white nothing the truth that they are two cubes 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.350
 very simple very but in all 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.720
 manufacturing aspects of all good 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.900
 that's why they are also cheap as not 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.600
 we have in cooking 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.310
 to be not interested in anything and 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.560
 I already say goodbye with this all 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.610
 of each of the two by two and thanks 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.610
 everyone and greetings
