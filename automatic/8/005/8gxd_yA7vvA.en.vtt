the oven to pick the other side so here

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.010 
the oven to pick the other side so here
we<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.680> flipped<00:03:26.220> over<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:27.030> we're<00:03:27.840> ready

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
we have it flipped over and we're ready

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.650 
we're actually going to separate them
into<00:04:07.620> breadsticks<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:09.030> I'm<00:04:09.180> going<00:04:09.360> to<00:04:09.390> do<00:04:09.510> that

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660

put a little bit more toppings and

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.030 
put a little bit more toppings and
they'll<00:04:12.390> go<00:04:12.480> in<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.660> oven<00:04:12.870> one<00:04:13.290> more<00:04:13.470> time<00:04:13.709> and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
they'll go in the oven one more time and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.770 
they'll go in the oven one more time and
then<00:04:14.459> they'll<00:04:14.610> be<00:04:14.819> done<00:04:15.000> but<00:04:15.330> these<00:04:15.540> are

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
then they'll be done but these are

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.750 
then they'll be done but these are
looking<00:04:16.079> great<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:16.979> I'm<00:04:17.160> looking<00:04:17.430> forward<00:04:17.639> to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
looking great so I'm looking forward to

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.449 
looking great so I'm looking forward to
trying<00:04:18.060> these<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:19.350> now<00:04:19.650> for<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:19.950> last<00:04:20.160> part

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
trying these and now for this last part

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.190 
trying these and now for this last part
right<00:04:20.579> here<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.329> you<00:04:21.419> guys<00:04:21.540> can<00:04:21.750> see<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:21.930> have

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
right here so you guys can see I have

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.620 
right here so you guys can see I have
the<00:04:22.320> breadsticks<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:23.040> cut<00:04:23.250> them<00:04:23.370> out<00:04:23.510> pull<00:04:24.510> them

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
the breadsticks I cut them out pull them

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.420 
the breadsticks I cut them out pull them
off<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.870> sheet<00:04:25.139> and<00:04:25.500> now<00:04:25.830> we're<00:04:25.979> going<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.220> do

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
off the sheet and now we're going to do

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.190 
off the sheet and now we're going to do
two<00:04:26.850> just<00:04:27.180> give<00:04:27.360> it<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.540> little<00:04:27.720> bit<00:04:27.930> more

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
two just give it a little bit more

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.800 
two just give it a little bit more
flavor<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:29.070> I<00:04:29.700> guess<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:30.030> make<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.300> more<00:04:30.510> like

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
flavor and I guess to make it more like

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.409 
flavor and I guess to make it more like
real<00:04:31.380> breadsticks<00:04:32.010> what<00:04:32.760> they<00:04:32.910> do<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:33.300> the

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
real breadsticks what they do in the

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.360 
real breadsticks what they do in the
restaurants<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.080> they'll<00:04:34.860> normally<00:04:35.040> add<00:04:35.340> a

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
restaurants is they'll normally add a

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.820 
restaurants is they'll normally add a
little<00:04:35.639> bit<00:04:35.820> of<00:04:35.850> garlic<00:04:36.600> seasoning<00:04:37.020> on<00:04:37.380> top<00:04:37.410> of

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
little bit of garlic seasoning on top of

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.240 
little bit of garlic seasoning on top of
them<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:40.169> then<00:04:40.380> what<00:04:40.500> we're<00:04:40.680> going<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.830> do<00:04:41.010> is

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
them and then what we're going to do is

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.760 
them and then what we're going to do is
sprinkle<00:04:41.550> just<00:04:41.789> a<00:04:42.300> little<00:04:42.510> bit<00:04:42.630> more<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:43.169> the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
sprinkle just a little bit more of the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.370 
sprinkle just a little bit more of the
fat-free<00:04:44.190> cheese<00:04:44.760> like<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.750> said<00:04:45.960> earlier<00:04:46.289> you

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
fat-free cheese like I said earlier you

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.690 
fat-free cheese like I said earlier you
can<00:04:46.500> use<00:04:46.650> whatever<00:04:46.979> you<00:04:47.250> want<00:04:47.490> really

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
can use whatever you want really

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.860 
can use whatever you want really
whatever<00:04:48.300> kind<00:04:48.510> of<00:04:48.539> cheese

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.779 

so<00:04:54.870> this<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:55.259> it<00:04:55.440> they<00:04:55.979> got<00:04:56.099> the<00:04:56.220> cheese<00:04:56.430> on<00:04:56.580> top

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
so this is it they got the cheese on top

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.279 
so this is it they got the cheese on top
and<00:04:57.000> these<00:04:57.210> are<00:04:57.360> going<00:04:57.509> to<00:04:57.569> go<00:04:57.690> into<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.139> oven

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
and these are going to go into the oven

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.499 
and these are going to go into the oven
for<00:04:58.710> one<00:04:59.190> last<00:04:59.400> time<00:04:59.669> until<00:04:59.940> the<00:05:00.090> cheese<00:05:00.330> is

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
for one last time until the cheese is

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.960 
for one last time until the cheese is
melted<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.139> I'm<00:05:01.680> saying<00:05:01.979> probably<00:05:02.400> around<00:05:02.729> 10

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
melted and I'm saying probably around 10

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.820 
melted and I'm saying probably around 10
minutes<00:05:03.180> for<00:05:03.509> this<00:05:03.659> and<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.259> oven<00:05:04.500> is<00:05:04.560> still

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
minutes for this and the oven is still

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.100 
minutes for this and the oven is still
in<00:05:04.919> 450<00:05:05.520> so<00:05:05.729> you<00:05:06.449> might<00:05:06.599> just<00:05:06.720> want<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:06.990> watch

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
it because this cheese will probably

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.860 
it because this cheese will probably
melt<00:05:08.639> pretty<00:05:08.849> quick<00:05:09.090> so<00:05:09.120> I'll<00:05:09.419> see<00:05:09.629> you<00:05:09.690> guys

melt pretty quick so I'll see you guys
then

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
then

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.129 
then

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
say that these are finally done and with

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.070 
say that these are finally done and with
this<00:05:16.650> part<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:18.030> put<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.330> little<00:05:18.509> cheese<00:05:18.720> on<00:05:18.960> the

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
this part to put a little cheese on the

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.779 
this part to put a little cheese on the
top<00:05:19.289> you<00:05:19.830> can<00:05:19.979> just<00:05:20.159> go<00:05:20.250> ahead<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.639> take<00:05:20.759> a

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
top you can just go ahead and take a

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.640 
top you can just go ahead and take a
fork<00:05:21.210> like<00:05:21.389> this<00:05:21.449> and<00:05:21.870> just<00:05:21.900> kind<00:05:22.050> of<00:05:22.229> separate

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
fork like this and just kind of separate

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.990 
fork like this and just kind of separate
them<00:05:22.800> again<00:05:23.039> because<00:05:23.460> they<00:05:23.639> might<00:05:23.940> have

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
them again because they might have

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.210 
them again because they might have
rejoined<00:05:24.539> and<00:05:24.840> that<00:05:25.470> is<00:05:25.650> going<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.860> do<00:05:25.979> it<00:05:26.099> that

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
rejoined and that is going to do it that

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.189 
rejoined and that is going to do it that
