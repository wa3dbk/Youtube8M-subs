00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.290
 the sixth row I pay attention that I turn 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.849
 on the wrong side and do two connecting 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.190
 column back to even from 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.389
 one will be enough to 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.410
 could be tied 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:25.949
 arch of 7 air loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.800
 and transfer need to transfer so 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.219
 so you stayed central 5 loops and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:41.219
 it will be central 5 loops knit 5 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:43.170
 single crochet 2 3 4 5 here I am 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.539
 did a column back to just 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.489
 it turned out exactly to stay here 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.770
 five loops here that is because 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:57.109
 let's move on there will be five loops on 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:00.780
 7 air loops again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:05.339
 we are thrown on central 5 loops 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:15.360
 previous arch 1 and single crochets 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:17.810
 we knit 2 3 4 5 again 7 air 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.810
 loops 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:36.119
 and throw in the same way 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:36.119
 again five single crochets for 0 1 2 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:53.640
 3 so 3 4 and 5 again 7 air loops and 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.170
 move to the next arch in 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.830
 the result should be such here 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.830
 arches
