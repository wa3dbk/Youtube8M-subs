would like to think or see or envision
going<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.290> way<00:01:55.409> I'm<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:55.920> sure

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
going that way I'm not really sure

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.359 
going that way I'm not really sure
what's<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> other<00:01:56.460> direction<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.090> believe

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
what's on the other direction I believe

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.310 
what's on the other direction I believe
there<00:01:59.369> goes<00:01:59.610> through<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.939> mountain<00:02:00.110> which<00:02:01.110> is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
there goes through a mountain which is

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.440 
there goes through a mountain which is
which<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:01.770> does<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.369> i<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.210> one

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
which this one does but i think this one

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.819 
which this one does but i think this one
you<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.049> go<00:02:04.140> straight<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.680> through

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
you have to go straight to go through

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.230 
you have to go straight to go through
the<00:02:04.920> mountain<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.369> i<00:02:05.579> think<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.939> drop

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the mountain because i think it's a drop

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.930 
the mountain because i think it's a drop
off<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> cliff<00:02:07.069> just<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.489> so

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
off like a cliff just like this one so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.070 
off like a cliff just like this one so
if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.539> me<00:02:09.629> go<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.869> another

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
if you like to see me go in another

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.479 
if you like to see me go in another
direction<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.709> another<00:02:10.950> direction<00:02:11.129> in

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
direction in another direction in

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.070 
direction in another direction in
another<00:02:11.730> direction<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.660> would<00:02:12.750> mean<00:02:12.870> i<00:02:12.900> have

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
another direction that would mean i have

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.580 
another direction that would mean i have
three<00:02:13.410> two

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
three two

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.380

the map this one gets me to a wooded
area<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:18.239> one<00:02:18.420> gets<00:02:18.629> me<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> desert<00:02:19.230> cated

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
area that one gets me to a desert cated

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.220

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
this you would get to the highest area

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.029 
this you would get to the highest area
the<00:07:04.750> highest<00:07:04.990> elevation<00:07:05.620> where<00:07:05.740> you<00:07:05.889> would

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 
the highest elevation where you would

not want to be hurt by everything's and

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:09.899 
not want to be hurt by everything's and
get<00:07:07.810> to<00:07:07.930> the<00:07:07.960> most<00:07:08.349> amount<00:07:08.740> of<00:07:08.919> resources<00:07:09.669> and

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:09.909 
get to the most amount of resources and

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:12.480 
get to the most amount of resources and
the<00:07:10.629> way<00:07:10.810> and<00:07:11.139> the<00:07:11.439> best<00:07:11.620> way<00:07:11.770> to<00:07:11.919> get<00:07:12.189> to<00:07:12.250> those

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
the way and the best way to get to those

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.179 
the way and the best way to get to those
resources<00:07:12.879> is<00:07:13.270> branching<00:07:13.930> branch<00:07:14.439> on<00:07:14.590> there

00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:15.189 
resources is branching branch on there

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:17.490 
resources is branching branch on there
are<00:07:15.250> certain<00:07:15.460> directions<00:07:15.699> this<00:07:16.539> area<00:07:16.870> would

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
are certain directions this area would

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.749 
are certain directions this area would
the<00:07:18.009> other<00:07:18.159> area<00:07:18.479> and<00:07:19.479> cactus<00:07:20.289> and<00:07:20.500> water<00:07:21.460> and

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 
the other area and cactus and water and

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:25.110 
the other area and cactus and water and
stuff<00:07:21.819> like<00:07:22.090> that<00:07:22.150> so<00:07:22.539> I<00:07:22.840> think<00:07:23.490> I'm<00:07:24.490> being

quite<00:07:25.389> literal<00:07:25.930> and<00:07:26.139> I<00:07:26.680> like<00:07:26.889> that<00:07:27.129> and<00:07:27.339> maybe

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
quite literal and I like that and maybe

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.579 
quite literal and I like that and maybe
you<00:07:28.360> don't<00:07:28.539> if<00:07:28.750> you<00:07:28.839> don't<00:07:29.020> let<00:07:29.319> me<00:07:29.440> know
