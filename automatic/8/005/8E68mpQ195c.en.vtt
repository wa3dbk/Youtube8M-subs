00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.350
 not only good 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.460
 They want to Have Fun 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.460
 well he was with me 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.370
 or some laughter that I'm going to take as a 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.370
 yes 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.710
 for the Argentine association , 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:42.270
 worry them either 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:44.230
 well I am 19 years old and a guy of 80 years 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.030
 it was like that I realized that no 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.309
 I have nothing to tell them and grandchildren and not 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.250
 I have grandchildren naturally but something that 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.140
 is that your generation has nothing 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.479
 copado or a war in a revolution 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.100
 the most was like the fight of the girl 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.829
 to prepare particularly gioda not 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.360
 they have occupied no feat as to 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.500
 to be able to tell someone is what it is 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.080
 only one that could serve as a shield is 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.880
 your grandfather 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.780
 won three crowns in a row in the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.390
 question 2 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.390
 that that was the most of my life there 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.820
 little things in everyday life that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.190
 they generate me not knowing what to do small 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.390
 little things because I'm a birthday 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:33.159
 I'm alone and if it's going to be with a small group of 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:35.940
 girls and they come and they tell me that it's the same 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.940
 to a friend of ours 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.860
 I prefer to know when is the birthday 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.330
 of majul before being similar to a 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.710
 shock and good I would like 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.899
 particularly knowing when they are bought 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.119
 it's from majul I do not know I wanted the house 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.440
 happy louis meets will take a job 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.590
 little dignity 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.960
 because of the problem, I still do not eat much 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.200
 people that maybe you're in a barbecue and that 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.870
 people who eat salad dresses because they do not 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.840
 it's so good 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:16.580
 to cut for that logic never ever 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.930
 but in another area to cut is like 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.280
 that you ask me big check the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.490
 would you put in the world cup in the national team 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.490
 I would put month and july fujimori for 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.430
 cut 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.320
 it does not make any kind of sense 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.420
 people here in this country that speaks more 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.010
 excited about what I should talk about 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.170
 there are people very excited about what 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.880
 they are giving that it is not so good 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.400
 speaker of calculation is an example speaker 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.380
 of calculation like that he leaves life 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.530
 counting that the promotion and 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.230
 production is bullshit 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.260
 because the I still say for example edit 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.420
 Monday and Tuesday in jail 12% discount 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.709
 in the fifth unit of all dairy 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.709
 defeated that we have in the candle 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.390
 and all his enthusiasm there in that 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:08.820
 advertising is no longer enthusiastic 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.440
 woman says I'm pregnant 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:18.420
 admired 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.420
 for when we do less for love 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.780
 a little we did not realize but the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.410
 English was getting a lot in this 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.730
 city 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.550
 English is like almost everywhere 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.050
 the roof of a girl walking on the 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.350
 street with the shirt that said wilde love 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.270
 wild 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.700
 get your love the wild 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.860
 means that 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.930
 and the point is that there are many people who 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.120
 He talks strange a lot to me I like the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.300
 television not our television the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.610
 tion is very stupid tradition we are 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.530
 stupid in fact there is a descendant of 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.780
 branch that is writing a stop or 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.519
 He is writing a book about the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.740
 stupid that is the television be 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.810
 add civilization or barbieri 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.530
 with a part of the public that came out 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.480
 other than the branches 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.780
 for them perhaps sarmiento is a train 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:22.560
 that the news comes out nothing more 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:24.750
 but football is a character 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.550
 particularly from the stories of 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.950
 soccer on television that is mariano 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.380
 Closs if we all have various kinds 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.320
 this guy who tells screams a lot 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.800
 change them by the cee I do not know why more or 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.800
 less so 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.470
 there is tribute 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.170
 I do not know why you talk in ways but it's 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.090
 Curious that Mariano Closs does not finish the 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.470
 phrase is left in half way 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.470
 opposite for example 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.490
 ricard 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.850
 with the doubt that we are also going to 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.190
 complain of the type tells football does not change 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.410
 much the world now with you raise the 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.400
 following way could not have been 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.400
 doctor calmly 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.310
 part of a sick patient 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.150
 Doubts 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.650
 they do not assume comment 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:46.240
 the grandmother 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.240
 in the turn 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.660
 thank you very much
