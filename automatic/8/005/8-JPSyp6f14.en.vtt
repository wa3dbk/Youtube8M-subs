 hello my dear friends today 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.619
 a box of China's immense here such 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.740
 here are the sizes here but before her 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.570
 open i want to tell you what created 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.090
 new vidos on the channel of the concept 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.300
 studio Deni tornado yesterday called yesterday 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.640
 I arrived yesterday we all filmed very 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.940
 interesting project in which denis 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.550
 finally reveal the prices that is, he 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.739
 talks about the prices of auto sound and it is very 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.350
 interesting so go look 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.540
 guys vidos really very interesting 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.120
 at the cost of what today mounted only under 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.149
 morning unloaded finished for lunch here 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.520
 published guys see those whom the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.760
 car audio is interesting on my second 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.579
 channel link to vidos I'll leave you in 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.489
 description of this video also those who are not 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.109
 signed up please subscribe because 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.899
 really the channel on it is not so often 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.420
 Vidosa appears but the project is enough 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.220
 interesting I recommend you this well, 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.580
 now let's open it means this 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.580
 box 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.680
 in this box is very powerful 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.619
 magnet so it is so packed a few 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.009
 layers so that he lights me straight in 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.299
 here are some other packages here 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.179
 bumazhechka and here we are with you 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.429
 here is such a magnet more believe 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.560
 I don't have anything in this box 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.869
 that is, I do not want to get it now 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.689
 just show you all believe that 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.679
 there it is safe and the foam is wrapped here 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.140
 such a small magnet like this 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.270
 you can already camera a little lower 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.240
 drop here and so it looks in 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.869
 present to him damn the skalds 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.360
 or dropping to it sent to us still here 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.450
 several small magnets a little thing 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.689
 nice can be useful inscription with us 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.420
 here that he is fragile but very powerful 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.480
 guys are actually a very powerful magnet 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.180
 let's open it and see how it is 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.850
 looking to open it is very difficult 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:24.690
 because the scalpel sticks to the magnet 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.090
 the magnet is packed like this 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.430
 e-my and you want to cut off your hands 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.750
 guys really 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.130
 I didn't unpack the magnets yet 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.950
 magnet can be used for different 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.400
 goals can anything magnetized 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.420
 you can search for some facts from the bottom 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.290
 seas and lakes get in general like 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.959
 just want it that way and use me 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.859
 I'll show you in this video only one 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.480
 an example of using this magnet here 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:02.500
 That is now stuck him on Skype 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.049
 on tear off and if you are between two 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.840
 such magnet with magnets then you them 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.610
 just plain tortures opens 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.530
 apart so here he guys 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.629
 It looks like it is if you put it on 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.849
 palm here is such a cube 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.890
 I will leave a link to this magnet to you 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.470
 description under this vidos 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.470
 well now let's try to apply 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.110
 it somehow m something at magnetic not 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.560
 disconnect well and in my head of course 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.780
 only one way came 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.230
 practical application of this magnet 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.720
 This is with a magnet counter on the water that is 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.299
 nets throw him somewhere in the river into the lake 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.609
 it was easier to find me in scrap and gave 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.519
 turn on the water and try it 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.069
 lean here's how you see the counter 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.239
 Marquis say 15 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:55.269
 faces trouble shorter than be called 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.599
 unrelated why so here let's 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.940
 open some water here see counter 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.549
 spinning in the middle of us wheel 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:08.519
 work and now we will try 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:10.959
 bring him here magnet and magnet 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.329
 he fears even at a distance 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.400
 centimeter counter and the counter is already 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.209
 fading away 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.630
 let's try 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.360
 The second counter of it 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.710
 i don't turn the other way 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.830
 huge yes yes it is clear that here it is now 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.070
 is spinning 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.470
 and 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.080
 also stops that is if you have 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.260
 counters are located side by side 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.770
 then one such magnet can 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:46.040
 stop at once both counters here guys 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.640
 well the fucking magnet is not really 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.940
 regret 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.820
 You bought it, of course, so I donâ€™t 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.520
 I am going but regret that I bought 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.470
 only one magnet here of course two 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.750
 magnets would not do so much 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.560
 cooler on this dear friends with you 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.900
 say goodbye 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.240
 if this video was useful to you 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.760
 I will leave a link to such a magnet in 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.430
 description under this vidos wish you all 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.430
 good luck and good mood
