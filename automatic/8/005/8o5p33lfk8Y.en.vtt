but killing them all the ladders is a

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.039 
but killing them all the ladders is a
great<00:01:35.340> strategy<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.329> helps<00:01:36.810> keep<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
great strategy because it helps keep you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.800 
great strategy because it helps keep you
it<00:01:37.619> helps<00:01:37.890> make<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.390> only<00:01:39.509> fight

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
it helps make it so that you only fight

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:50.600 
it helps make it so that you only fight
them<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.200> at<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.409> time

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610

arrows<00:03:48.549> fire<00:03:48.850> pretty<00:03:49.209> much<00:03:49.420> in<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.630> straight

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
arrows fire pretty much in a straight

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.599 
arrows fire pretty much in a straight
line<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.530> they<00:03:51.160> will<00:03:51.370> miss<00:03:51.790> if<00:03:52.120> it's<00:03:53.049> going<00:03:53.609> if
