the centerboard case will be located
when<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.440> flip<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:56.950> over<00:04:57.100> so<00:04:57.280> we'll<00:04:57.700> do<00:04:57.820> that

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
when I flip it over so we'll do that

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.510 
the holes in the corners of my dagger
case<00:05:04.720> so<00:05:04.990> I'll<00:05:05.110> locate<00:05:05.380> them<00:05:05.830> when<00:05:06.010> I<00:05:06.040> flip<00:05:06.370> it

case so I'll locate them when I flip it

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.190 
case so I'll locate them when I flip it
upside<00:05:06.880> down<00:05:06.910> and<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.420> can<00:05:07.600> cut<00:05:07.780> out<00:05:07.930> the

daggerboard case in the boat lined it up

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.470 
daggerboard case in the boat lined it up
and<00:05:18.220> what<00:05:18.340> I<00:05:18.400> knew<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:18.730> was<00:05:18.910> where<00:05:19.120> I<00:05:19.150> was<00:05:19.270> going

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
and what I knew it was where I was going

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.060 
and what I knew it was where I was going
to<00:05:19.540> be<00:05:19.600> a<00:05:19.630> box<00:05:19.900> i<00:05:20.050> dinna<00:05:20.230> I<00:05:20.350> would<00:05:20.500> draw<00:05:20.740> a<00:05:20.770> line

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
to be a box i dinna I would draw a line

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.910 
to be a box i dinna I would draw a line
around<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.640> and<00:05:21.820> then<00:05:22.420> pull<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:22.810> away<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.680> then

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
around it and then pull it away and then

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.490 
around it and then pull it away and then
draw<00:05:24.130> another<00:05:24.370> line<00:05:24.490> inside<00:05:25.330> of<00:05:25.570> that<00:05:25.750> one<00:05:26.050> by

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
draw another line inside of that one by

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.080 
draw another line inside of that one by
at<00:05:26.710> half<00:05:26.920> an<00:05:27.160> inch<00:05:27.370> that<00:05:27.580> would<00:05:27.760> give<00:05:27.940> me

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
at half an inch that would give me

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.300 
at half an inch that would give me
plenty<00:05:28.360> of<00:05:28.570> clearance<00:05:28.990> in<00:05:29.350> order<00:05:29.920> to<00:05:30.040> cut<00:05:30.280> a

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
plenty of clearance in order to cut a
