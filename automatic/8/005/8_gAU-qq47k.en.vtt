OS 4.1 and above i want to show you now
just<00:00:13.200> exactly<00:00:13.320> how<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> do<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:13.920> on<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.309> ipad

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
just exactly how to do it on the ipad

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.580 
just exactly how to do it on the ipad
it's<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> same<00:00:15.719> principle<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.289> iphone

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
it's the same principle for the iphone

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.220 
it's the same principle for the iphone
so<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:16.980> follow<00:00:17.100> these<00:00:17.369> steps<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.960> first

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
so just follow these steps the first

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.050 
so just follow these steps the first
most<00:00:19.470> important<00:00:19.920> step<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.460> obviously<00:00:20.550> go

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
most important step is to obviously go

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.740 
most important step is to obviously go
ahead<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.859> back<00:00:22.859> your<00:00:23.279> device<00:00:23.640> valve<00:00:23.880> I'm

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
ahead and back your device valve I'm

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.570 
ahead and back your device valve I'm
doing<00:00:25.080> know<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> weird<00:00:25.800> angle<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.550> I

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
doing know this is a weird angle so I

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.410 
doing know this is a weird angle so I
can't<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.539> go<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> there's<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.330> you

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
can't there we go so there's all you

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.020 
can't there we go so there's all you
have<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.840> plug<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.399> let<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.520> sync<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
have to do to plug it in let it sync and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.500 
have to do to plug it in let it sync and
backup<00:00:34.190> okay<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.820> next<00:00:35.850> stage<00:00:36.210> would<00:00:36.390> be

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
backup okay so the next stage would be

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.220 
backup okay so the next stage would be
to<00:00:36.660> go<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.010> ww<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.640> rain<00:00:38.910> calm<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.870> instead<00:00:40.110> of
