before<00:00:00.989> we<00:00:01.110> take<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.620> Sun<00:00:01.860> machine<00:00:02.159> I

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
before we take this to the Sun machine I

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.070 
before we take this to the Sun machine I
just<00:00:02.520> wanted<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.820> draw<00:00:03.120> my<00:00:03.270> dart<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:03.720> there<00:00:03.899> a

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
just wanted to draw my dart in there a

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.710 
just wanted to draw my dart in there a
little<00:00:04.640> better<00:00:05.640> so<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.060> camera<00:00:06.390> could<00:00:06.509> pick

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
little better so the camera could pick

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.930 
little better so the camera could pick
it<00:00:06.870> up<00:00:06.990> Cruden<00:00:07.560> with<00:00:07.740> some<00:00:07.890> chalk<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:08.760> hard

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
it up Cruden with some chalk it's hard

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.790 
it up Cruden with some chalk it's hard
to<00:00:09.090> get<00:00:09.210> nice<00:00:09.510> crisp<00:00:09.960> lines<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.469> spandex

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
to get nice crisp lines on spandex

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.249 
to get nice crisp lines on spandex
because<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.340> moves<00:00:11.750> so<00:00:12.750> there's<00:00:12.929> my<00:00:13.080> little

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
because it moves so there's my little

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.950 
because it moves so there's my little
wedge<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.280> dart<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:15.389> I'm<00:00:15.450> going<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.630> pin<00:00:15.929> it

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
wedge of a dart so I'm going to pin it

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.590 
wedge of a dart so I'm going to pin it
in<00:00:16.859> place<00:00:16.920> first<00:00:17.520> before<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.029> take<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.480> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
in place first before I take it to the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.130 
in place first before I take it to the
sewing<00:00:18.779> machine<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:21.020> get<00:00:22.020> my<00:00:22.170> point<00:00:22.500> out<00:00:22.769> here

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
sewing machine so get my point out here

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.650 
sewing machine so get my point out here
and<00:00:25.140> I'm<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> fold<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.480> along<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and I'm just going to fold it along the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.349 
and I'm just going to fold it along the
center<00:00:28.340> then<00:00:29.340> we'll<00:00:29.550> put<00:00:29.670> some<00:00:29.849> pins<00:00:30.119> at<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
center then we'll put some pins at the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.089 
center then we'll put some pins at the
place<00:00:30.599> again<00:00:30.869> I've<00:00:31.050> got<00:00:31.199> my<00:00:31.349> ballpoint<00:00:31.859> pins

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
place again I've got my ballpoint pins

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.490 
place again I've got my ballpoint pins
so<00:00:32.820> I'm<00:00:32.880> starting<00:00:33.180> at<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.390> edge<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.020> leg<00:00:34.260> of

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
so I'm starting at the edge the leg of

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.310 
so I'm starting at the edge the leg of
the<00:00:34.739> darts<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> push<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> pin

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
the darts so I'm going to push the pin

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.100 
the darts so I'm going to push the pin
in<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:38.550> make<00:00:38.760> sure<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.420> hits<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.870> line<00:00:40.050> on

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
in and make sure that it hits a line on

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.880 
in and make sure that it hits a line on
both<00:00:40.500> sides<00:00:41.629> these<00:00:42.629> may<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> adjust<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
both sides these may have to adjust a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.930 
both sides these may have to adjust a
little<00:00:43.920> bit<00:00:46.280> but<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.629> that<00:00:48.629> hard<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.960> get<00:00:49.230> in

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
little bit but not that hard to get in

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.400 
little bit but not that hard to get in
I'm<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> entire<00:00:51.960> length

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
I'm going to do that the entire length

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:04.840 
I'm going to do that the entire length
of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:56.750> dark

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.640 

sometimes<00:01:05.750> it<00:01:06.520> helps<00:01:07.520> people<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:08.090> draw<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.840> line

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
sometimes it helps people to draw a line

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.230 
sometimes it helps people to draw a line
down<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.920> center<00:01:10.040> of<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.549> dart<00:01:10.759> and<00:01:10.939> to<00:01:11.060> mark

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
down the center of the dart and to mark

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.820 
down the center of the dart and to mark
that<00:01:11.420> on<00:01:11.479> your<00:01:11.659> fabric<00:01:11.869> as<00:01:12.140> well<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.680> have

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
that on your fabric as well so you have

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.120 
that on your fabric as well so you have
your<00:01:12.860> fold<00:01:13.340> line<00:01:14.590> normally<00:01:15.590> I<00:01:15.619> don't<00:01:15.890> bother

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
your fold line normally I don't bother

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.639 
your fold line normally I don't bother
with<00:01:16.369> that<00:01:16.400> but<00:01:16.700> if<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:16.940> helps<00:01:17.180> you<00:01:17.270> then<00:01:17.649> go

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
with that but if that helps you then go

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.730 
with that but if that helps you then go
right<00:01:18.830> ahead<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.840> also<00:01:24.110> working<00:01:24.350> with<00:01:24.500> knit

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
right ahead and also working with knit

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.260 
right ahead and also working with knit
fabrics<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:25.310> can<00:01:25.460> kind<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:25.729> mush<00:01:25.970> things

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
fabrics you can kind of mush things

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.050 
fabrics you can kind of mush things
around<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.869> lot<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:29.390> won't<00:01:30.700> so<00:01:31.700> if<00:01:31.820> it's<00:01:31.970> a

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
around a lot so it won't so if it's a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.450 
around a lot so it won't so if it's a
little<00:01:32.330> bit<00:01:32.450> messy<00:01:32.869> it's<00:01:33.229> not<00:01:33.530> gone<00:01:33.770> going<00:01:34.369> to

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
little bit messy it's not gone going to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.200 
little bit messy it's not gone going to
look<00:01:34.670> as<00:01:34.850> bad<00:01:35.180> as<00:01:35.509> if<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:35.810> was<00:01:35.960> on<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.970> woven<00:01:37.970> that

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
look as bad as if it was on a woven that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.840 
look as bad as if it was on a woven that

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
going to go to the edge and make sure

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.790 
going to go to the edge and make sure
that<00:05:08.660> that's<00:05:08.900> lined<00:05:09.260> up<00:05:09.410> very<00:05:09.590> nicely<00:05:11.800> again
