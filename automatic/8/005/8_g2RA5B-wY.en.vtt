00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.870
 hello girls welcome one more Monday 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.870
 channel today I bring a very video 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.400
 interesting also because good I do not know 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.889
 you but lately it has cost me 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.570
 find many shoes because this 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.699
 season of the year is a bit complicated 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.890
 for me I do not want to use boots so 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.840
 soon because he has not yet arrived 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.670
 winter and I've done here where I live 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.990
 It's still hot but it's not 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.210
 time to wear sandals as in 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.320
 summer so good I wanted one thing 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.340
 intermediate I need dress shoes 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.030
 yes it is true that he also used 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.310
 sneakers data not so button dress 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.000
 but what I use the most for my day to day life is 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.790
 clothing so I use shoes 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.840
 I'm telling you a little more more formal and 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.420
 Well, I'm going to teach the three 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.829
 shoe models that you bought makes a 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.780
 little bit so good if you're interested 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.870
 know what some autumn shoes 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.760
 that I have bought lately and that 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.800
 I think it's good that they are very good for 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.450
 those girls things you would see a lot 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.160
 you have to fix you to go to 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.809
 I invite you to work better 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.700
 video well the first ones I want 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:09.270
 point out are these blazer from here 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.850
 ok your classic shoe to dress up all 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.610
 life is the one that all the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.619
 men wear to wear together with 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.770
 costume is the typical closed shoe the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.800
 costume with drawstring valley in this case is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.110
 brown skin 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.930
 I'm milk here I think it's very 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.060
 nice is a shot that you saw a lot and the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.390
 truth is that it is a brown tone that goes 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.910
 very good with everyone with all the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.500
 suits that you can wear no longer good 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.660
 the black precisely I am not very 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.870
 supporter combine brown and black but 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.300
 with browns with beige with blues good 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.280
 I think with grays it's also a color 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.170
 who sees you very well is a pretty shoe 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.840
 comfortable yes it is quite rigid is 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.630
 true and it 's hard but it's still a 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.720
 shoe you have to dress and you already see a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.960
 heel a little more marked is not not 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.270
 very thin, neither is it a very high heel 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.710
 thick is a challenge that I like a lot 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.410
 when it had been completely is of 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.000
 sanÃ¡ and good is a model that now 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.640
 it also can find both 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.280
 brown as in blue and the price I think 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.590
 it was about 50 euros plus or minus 49 with 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.170
 something like that I liked a lot is a 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.750
 shoe that web is a shoe that is very 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.490
 well that is a lot and not only for 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.480
 dress but whole to put with ones 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.380
 jeans calmly and a shirt and 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.780
 well then 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.690
 It can be more informal but at the same time 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.700
 not very nice green and already arranged 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.100
 I say to me it seems to be a good 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.720
 option for this season of the year that 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.610
 It is not a shoe that will be very hot 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.470
 it's a boot but it's not a sandal either 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.970
 then a middle term well now 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.790
 we go with a second action that are 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.800
 these loafers here these are about 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.320
 loafers that I liked a lot when 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.080
 I saw them are also from Sana'a, I hope that 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.510
 you can see well is a classic shoe 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.920
 all the life that you saw a lot is a little 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.440
 more targeted since this year is 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.980
 taking everything much more targeted and as 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.910
 you can see that classic women's moccasin 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.130
 simply because I tell you a little more 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.970
 stylized more adapted to the trend 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.770
 current as you can see has a little 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.160
 of taconcito but in a little thing is 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.280
 more is what is the sole and good 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.290
 completely is since skin is before 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.140
 super super soft and it's brown 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.690
 similar to the previous one maybe a little more 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.900
 of course it's a little bit lighter 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.730
 this is a basic sara also and I 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.620
 They cost 35 or 40 I do not have more than enough 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.620
 more or less also cost me out there 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.120
 they are shoes that are good and good 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.430
 price you see that the approach is 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.769
 too much to be a shoe that is 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.810
 skin and that is very beautiful 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.269
 true and quite like finally the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.629
 last I bought also from Sara because 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.870
 frankly, it's where I usually find the most 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:57.760
 shoes are these shoes here that I 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.349
 The 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.220
 I put it well for you to see 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.220
 perfectly 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.560
 this is a moccasin and it is also a 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.120
 loafer everything like those of a lifetime 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:15.990
 but it 's the typical shoe more like more 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.120
 thicker safer is thinner no it is not 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.290
 a shoe that you see say u and like the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.690
 previous no that is a little more 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.180
 stylized no this is a shoe that is 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.180
 very rounded the truth has like 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.820
 you can see these little balls here is 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.940
 completely from it and it's patent leather 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.190
 I hope you can see it well 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.980
 why do you prefer exactly what is 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.440
 the model 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.570
 As you can also see, the typical heel is 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.900
 little but good is a little bit 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.640
 that is not completely flat this is 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.740
 a is a shoe model that is 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.540
 taking a lot now you're going to 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.190
 find in many other ways with 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.850
 let's say what is the tip 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.950
 different with different designs but at 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.700
 After all, the shoe is a very 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.980
 rigid a shoe with patent leather normally 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.470
 It is not usually a black matte but with a 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.020
 little shine as well and good to see the 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.300
 details in this case that you have here are 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.900
 in gold is worth so much in 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.250
 gorditas of these that I say and the 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.110
 good the sconces these you have here 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.790
 is and I also think I remember that this one 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.880
 it came out bigger and they were about 30 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.890
 I like euros very much and I already tell you 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.990
 with black and brown wines that are 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.150
 colors that are most useful for me to use 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.860
 in the days that today you are going to fix the 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:35.240
 office then he used these 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.160
 because they are perfect frankly they are very 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.860
 comfortable yes it is true that the 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.380
 first days of using them has made me a 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.340
 little rubbing here in the part 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.530
 it will be because it is a shoe it is hard 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.840
 rigid and the beginning until there is a 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.850
 little of yourself and your foot gets used to it 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.740
 Well, yes it is true that you can touch 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.870
 a little but good for now 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.390
 simply and I say those rubs and the 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.070
 typical when you open a shoe but nothing 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.450
 more and good then nothing mostly 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.400
 I wanted to show you the latest purchases 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.380
 that he had made 13 ducks because 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.000
 frankly I think it's a good 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.150
 options to keep in mind if you're 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.090
 looking for something , and if not 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.560

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.000
