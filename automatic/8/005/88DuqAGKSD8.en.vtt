weather click on the settings and this

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.020 
weather click on the settings and this

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
is where you can change it into Celsius

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.940 
is where you can change it into Celsius
or<00:01:43.120> Fahrenheit<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.780> also<00:01:44.290> how<00:01:44.500> often<00:01:44.860> you

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
or Fahrenheit and also how often you

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.510 
or Fahrenheit and also how often you
want<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.430> auto<00:01:45.760> refresh<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:47.980> that<00:01:48.220> is

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
want it to auto refresh and so that is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.020 
want it to auto refresh and so that is
basically<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.950> know<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.220> end<00:01:51.370> of<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.850> gear

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
basically you know the end of the gear

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.400 
basically you know the end of the gear
manager<00:01:52.240> this<00:01:52.660> is<00:01:52.720> where<00:01:52.960> you'd<00:01:53.140> be<00:01:53.230> able<00:01:53.290> to

this thing the reason why I just tilted
it<00:02:00.010> down<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.340> tilted<00:02:00.580> back<00:02:00.700> up<00:02:00.910> is<00:02:01.060> I'm

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
it down and tilted back up is I'm

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.570 
it down and tilted back up is I'm
mimicking<00:02:01.690> is<00:02:01.930> if<00:02:02.260> I<00:02:02.409> was<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.890> turn<00:02:03.190> my<00:02:03.340> wrist

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
up to look at the time so this thing

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.020 
up to look at the time so this thing
will<00:02:05.590> actually<00:02:05.620> you<00:02:06.430> know<00:02:06.550> turn<00:02:06.760> on<00:02:06.880> by<00:02:07.000> itself

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
will actually you know turn on by itself

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.540 
will actually you know turn on by itself
just<00:02:07.420> by<00:02:07.690> doing<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.409> so<00:02:08.979> here's<00:02:09.340> how<00:02:09.489> the

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
just by doing that and so here's how the

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.030 
just by doing that and so here's how the
UI<00:02:09.729> works<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:11.050> one<00:02:11.290> right<00:02:11.440> here<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.650> has

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
UI works this one right here that has

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.530 
UI works this one right here that has
the<00:02:12.220> time<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.550> actually<00:02:12.700> technically<00:02:13.269> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
the time is actually technically the
