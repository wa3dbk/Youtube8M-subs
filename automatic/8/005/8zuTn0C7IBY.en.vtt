00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
to the theme so it's going to look a

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.240 
to the theme so it's going to look a
little<00:04:34.330> bit<00:04:34.450> different<00:04:34.900> then<00:04:35.620> when<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:36.130> get

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250

little bit different then when you get
it<00:04:36.400> but<00:04:36.640> basically<00:04:40.140> slide<00:04:41.140> down<00:04:41.380> here<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:41.680> you

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
it but basically slide down here and you

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.720

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
weather stuff like that I think the

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.620 
weather stuff like that I think the
animations<00:04:49.930> are<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.200> screen<00:04:50.530> are<00:04:50.770> great
