00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello today we will sew a butterfly like 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.240
 you already know next year blue 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.849
 wooden goat 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.110
 so I chose such a butterfly 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.150
 ink color 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.839
 it will be very festive look and 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.480
 the second side is also elegant but already with 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.720
 warm shades 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.240
 we will need a pattern 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.349
 I chose such a background was what I behave 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.529
 there are also about 45 forms 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.570
 different butterflies he is so cashew for himself 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.440
 so I chose with such big 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.620
 by wings 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.989
 so that she was very solemn and 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.410
 now you can pin the fabric pattern and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.410
 circle around 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.979
 the length of the butterfly depends on the girth of your 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.649
 neck i usually do like this 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.820
 measure neck grip and bite 5-6 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.780
 centimeters to adjust 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.780
 you can do the same 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.009
 we put the second fabric face inward 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.220
 that is, it turns out that we have two fabrics 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.360
 are facing each other, and now you 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.360
 you need to fasten it all 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:02:04.590
 I fastened the fabric now need to cut 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:02:08.310
 backing away from the edge of 5 millimeters here 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.310
 Butterfly cut elements now to us 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.390
 you need to sew it along the line along which 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.390
 the pattern was imported 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.420
 on the edges can be fixed with a machine 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.030
 here 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.280
 so when you sewed now you need 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.250
 turn the tail of a butterfly so let's say 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.410
 for this I use sushi 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.230
 You can also use a brush with 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.269
 how blunt the end to the blunt 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.930
 so as not to break 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.930
 a barrel on this side 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.920
 now we twisted and can give 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.109
 now that you have both parts of a butterfly 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.209
 stitched laid 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.209
 you can sew on taxi 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.760
 penza 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.680
 here 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.430
 from 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.610
 you 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.230
 not 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.020
 Mommy is ready now I'll write it down 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.189
 there is 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.449
 but 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.240
 But in such a wonderful butterfly you can 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.100
 meet the new year blue gases and the whole 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.520
 year you will magically stay 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.520
 overtook
