00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
section we're going to learn how to do

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.950 
section we're going to learn how to do
crossovers<00:00:23.699> by<00:00:24.150> forwards<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.689> backwards

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
crossovers by forwards and backwards

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.349 
crossovers by forwards and backwards
it's<00:00:25.769> also<00:00:25.890> known<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.310> cross<00:00:26.609> cuts<00:00:26.910> depending

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
it's also known as cross cuts depending

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.490 
it's also known as cross cuts depending
where<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.019> world

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
where you are in the world

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.650 
where you are in the world
basically<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.670> idea<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:30.090> doing<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
basically the idea of doing the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.080 
basically the idea of doing the
crossovers<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:32.369> generate<00:00:32.700> more<00:00:32.850> speed

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
crossovers is to generate more speed

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.380 
crossovers is to generate more speed
getting<00:00:33.780> around<00:00:33.960> corners<00:00:34.850> both<00:00:35.850> backwards

the circle pumping the left foot face
direction<00:03:10.819> you're<00:03:10.970> going<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:11.450> at<00:03:12.109> all<00:03:12.290> time<00:03:12.560> so

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
direction you're going in at all time so

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
and from this position here

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.809 
and from this position here
you<00:03:20.640> can<00:03:20.819> then<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:21.180> do<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.420> back<00:03:21.599> crossover

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
you can then just do the back crossover

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.520 
you can then just do the back crossover
okay<00:03:23.819> so<00:03:23.879> that's<00:03:24.180> has<00:03:24.360> two<00:03:24.569> crossovers<00:03:25.379> both

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
okay so that's has two crossovers both

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.140 
okay so that's has two crossovers both
backwards<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.250> forwards<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.910> you're<00:03:27.030> both

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
backwards and forwards and you're both

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.599
