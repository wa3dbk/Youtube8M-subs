I've<00:01:28.170> basically<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.740> been<00:01:28.920> copying<00:01:29.700> World

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

of<00:01:30.270> Warcraft<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.520> think<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.229> for<00:01:34.229> Elder

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
of Warcraft and I think that for Elder

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.499 
of Warcraft and I think that for Elder
Scrolls<00:01:35.280> online<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.820> successful<00:01:36.329> it's

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.149 
Scrolls online to be successful it's
going<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> need<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> who's<00:01:37.770> committing<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
revolutionize MMR's so it needs to steer

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.389 
revolutionize MMR's so it needs to steer
away<00:01:42.630> from<00:01:42.750> what<00:01:43.590> World<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.920> Warcraft<00:01:44.310> has

Legends and dota 2 and maybe that's

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.920 
Legends and dota 2 and maybe that's
because<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:40.640> MMO<00:02:40.970> scenes<00:02:41.300> got<00:02:41.570> a<00:02:41.600> bit<00:02:41.720> boring

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
action you're always in action there's

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.030 
action you're always in action there's
no<00:02:53.120> if<00:02:53.240> never<00:02:53.510> nothing<00:02:53.870> happening<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.860> maybe

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
no if never nothing happening so maybe

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.180 
no if never nothing happening so maybe
it'd<00:02:55.790> be<00:02:55.820> good<00:02:56.240> for<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:57.740> Elder<00:02:57.920> Scrolls

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
it'd be good for the Elder Scrolls

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.120 
it'd be good for the Elder Scrolls
online<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:58.670> implement<00:02:59.390> some<00:02:59.660> kind<00:02:59.900> of<00:03:00.130> like

arena<00:03:01.700> or<00:03:02.090> something<00:03:02.600> where<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.870> can<00:03:03.050> just<00:03:03.170> it

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
arena or something where you can just it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.530 
arena or something where you can just it
can<00:03:03.950> just<00:03:04.160> be<00:03:04.220> RPG<00:03:04.760> for<00:03:04.910> people<00:03:05.210> that<00:03:05.360> want

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
that I'm steering off-topic quite a bit

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.890 
that I'm steering off-topic quite a bit
to<00:03:07.700> be<00:03:07.790> honest<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.150> was<00:03:08.300> supposed<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.600> just<00:03:08.690> be

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
to be honest I was supposed to just be

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.130 
to be honest I was supposed to just be
talking<00:03:09.230> about<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.440> subscription-based<00:03:11.140> like

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
talking about a subscription-based like

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.230 
talking about a subscription-based like
payment<00:03:12.620> models<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.190> free<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.820> play<00:03:14.060> ends

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
payment models and free to play ends

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.000 
payment models and free to play ends
defy<00:03:14.540> that<00:03:14.570> but<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.560> really<00:03:15.860> do<00:03:15.980> feel

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
defy that but I really do feel

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.560 
defy that but I really do feel
passionately<00:03:16.640> about<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:16.970> game<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:17.300> I<00:03:17.360> really

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
passionately about this game so I really

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.660 
passionately about this game so I really
want<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.780> see<00:03:17.960> it<00:03:18.020> see<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:18.650> be<00:03:18.920> successful<00:03:19.490> and

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
want to see it see it be successful and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.970 
want to see it see it be successful and
one<00:03:20.360> way<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.570> can<00:03:20.780> be<00:03:20.870> successful<00:03:21.410> is<00:03:21.680> if<00:03:21.830> they

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
one way it can be successful is if they

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.420 
one way it can be successful is if they
listen<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.670> their<00:03:22.880> fan<00:03:23.090> base<00:03:23.270> and<00:03:23.630> they<00:03:23.720> get

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
listen to their fan base and they get

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.740 
listen to their fan base and they get
but<00:03:25.430> they<00:03:25.550> just<00:03:25.760> changed<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.240> payment<00:03:26.540> model

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
but they just changed the payment model

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.200 
but they just changed the payment model
for<00:03:27.080> what<00:03:27.200> their<00:03:27.320> funds<00:03:27.530> want<00:03:27.830> but<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.910> will<00:03:29.030> be

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
for what their funds want but it will be

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.640 
for what their funds want but it will be
add<00:03:29.300> because<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:30.080> have<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.290> remember<00:03:30.440> that

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
add because you have to remember that

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.780 
add because you have to remember that
they<00:03:30.740> are<00:03:30.770> running<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.160> business<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.700> that

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
they are running a business and that

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.790 
they are running a business and that
they<00:03:31.910> need<00:03:32.120> to<00:03:32.270> earn<00:03:32.540> money<00:03:32.660> so<00:03:33.050> if<00:03:33.410> everybody

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
they need to earn money so if everybody

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.080 
they need to earn money so if everybody
wants<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.160> be<00:03:34.220> free-to-play<00:03:34.490> obviously

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
wants it to be free-to-play obviously

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.730 
wants it to be free-to-play obviously
they<00:03:35.180> can't<00:03:35.390> do<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.170> if<00:03:36.350> they<00:03:36.470> implement

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
they can't do that and if they implement

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.410 
they can't do that and if they implement
like<00:03:37.130> it's<00:03:37.310> free-to-play<00:03:37.550> but<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.090> can<00:03:38.270> buy

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
like it's free-to-play but you can buy

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.010 
like it's free-to-play but you can buy
for<00:03:39.350> example<00:03:39.770> you<00:03:40.550> peer<00:03:40.880> for<00:03:41.090> like<00:03:41.300> money<00:03:41.840> that

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
for example you peer for like money that

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.260 
for example you peer for like money that
you're<00:03:42.140> spending<00:03:42.260> game<00:03:42.830> for<00:03:43.550> items<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.210> you

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
you're spending game for items that you

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.690 
you're spending game for items that you
would<00:03:44.360> not<00:03:44.540> be<00:03:44.630> able<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.810> buy<00:03:44.960> so<00:03:45.230> like<00:03:45.700> for

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
would not be able to buy so like for

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.790 
would not be able to buy so like for
example<00:03:46.730> Liga<00:03:47.270> legends<00:03:47.660> as<00:03:47.840> riot<00:03:48.320> points

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
example Liga legends as riot points

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.200 
example Liga legends as riot points
where<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.130> buy<00:03:49.280> riot<00:03:49.550> points<00:03:49.910> that<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.090> can

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
where you buy riot points that you can

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.470 
where you buy riot points that you can
spend<00:03:50.480> on<00:03:50.570> skins<00:03:51.460> but<00:03:52.460> I<00:03:52.520> do<00:03:52.610> honestly<00:03:53.240> think

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
spend on skins but I do honestly think

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.600 
spend on skins but I do honestly think
that<00:03:53.570> this<00:03:53.840> method<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.470> pretty<00:03:54.800> outdated<00:03:54.980> they

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
that this method is pretty outdated they

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.190 
that this method is pretty outdated they
should<00:03:55.790> not<00:03:55.910> go<00:03:56.090> for<00:03:56.240> this<00:03:56.360> route<00:03:56.510> they<00:03:56.630> should

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
should not go for this route they should

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.690 
should not go for this route they should
do<00:03:57.380> subscription<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.070> think<00:03:58.310> but<00:03:58.490> them<00:03:58.610> maybe

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
do subscription I think but them maybe

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.920 
do subscription I think but them maybe
should<00:03:58.910> lower<00:03:59.150> it<00:04:01.480> that's<00:04:02.480> just<00:04:02.690> my<00:04:02.810> opinion

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
should lower it that's just my opinion

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.600 
should lower it that's just my opinion
now<00:04:03.320> obviously<00:04:03.950> everybody's<00:04:04.370> gonna<00:04:04.520> think

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
now obviously everybody's gonna think

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.830 
now obviously everybody's gonna think
differently<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:06.730> just<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:07.910> can't<00:04:08.600> wait<00:04:08.720> to

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
differently and I just I can't wait to

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.910 
differently and I just I can't wait to
see<00:04:08.930> what<00:04:09.110> they<00:04:09.200> actually<00:04:09.320> do<00:04:09.560> we<00:04:09.680> had<00:04:09.770> to<00:04:09.860> be

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
see what they actually do we had to be

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.070 
see what they actually do we had to be
honest<00:04:10.190> on<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:11.000> brighter<00:04:11.300> note<00:04:11.420> however<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:11.959> was

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
honest on a brighter note however it was

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.960 
honest on a brighter note however it was
said<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.470> pyramid<00:04:12.830> charge<00:04:13.070> of<00:04:13.250> $15<00:04:13.940> a
