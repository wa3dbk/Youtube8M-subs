00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:47.749 
a nice open base by doing it for example

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:49.270 
a nice open base by doing it for example
on<00:00:47.809> this<00:00:47.899> monster<00:00:48.199> run<00:00:48.350> out<00:00:48.469> there<00:00:48.620> you<00:00:48.920> get<00:00:49.039> up

on this monster run out there you get up

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.039 
on this monster run out there you get up
some<00:00:49.460> really<00:00:49.670> open<00:00:49.879> bit<00:00:50.179> nice<00:00:50.539> open<00:00:50.899> bits

you do have indeed a little bit ago in

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.750 
you do have indeed a little bit ago in
Sigma<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:56.600> you'll<00:00:56.780> 10,000<00:00:57.589> and<00:00:57.769> here<00:00:58.639> I'm

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
Sigma so you'll 10,000 and here I'm

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.389 
Sigma so you'll 10,000 and here I'm
gonna<00:00:58.850> go<00:00:58.999> twenty<00:00:59.659> thousand<00:01:00.079> coins<00:01:00.199> like<00:01:00.920> that

and the 20k right there that's probably

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.190 
and the 20k right there that's probably
not<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.609> best<00:02:16.700> one<00:02:17.030> but<00:02:17.480> I'm<00:02:17.749> not<00:02:17.930> sure<00:02:17.959> how

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
not the best one but I'm not sure how

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.869 
not the best one but I'm not sure how
much<00:02:18.349> older<00:02:18.739> O'Shea's<00:02:19.129> going<00:02:19.370> for<00:02:19.519> soup<00:02:19.730> if

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
much older O'Shea's going for soup if

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.789 
much older O'Shea's going for soup if
it's<00:02:20.120> going<00:02:20.299> for<00:02:20.450> about<00:02:20.540> 23<00:02:20.989> k<00:02:21.230> then<00:02:21.650> that

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
it's going for about 23 k then that

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.259 
it's going for about 23 k then that
would<00:02:21.889> be<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.010> good<00:02:22.219> deal<00:02:22.430> right<00:02:22.609> there<00:02:22.639> you<00:02:23.120> may

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
whatever recommend is time for example

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.539 
whatever recommend is time for example
foot<00:02:29.959> focus<00:02:30.349> or<00:02:30.530> foot<00:02:30.769> pin<00:02:30.980> up<00:02:31.129> at<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.370> same

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
foot focus or foot pin up at the same

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.099 
foot focus or foot pin up at the same
time<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.150> i<00:02:32.209> can<00:02:32.239> actually<00:02:32.599> see<00:02:32.870> how<00:02:32.959> much

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
time so i can actually see how much

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.509 
time so i can actually see how much
these<00:02:33.290> aren't<00:02:33.499> going<00:02:33.620> for<00:02:33.920> for<00:02:34.280> some<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.459> us

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
you're going to place the 50k pin you

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.429 
you're going to place the 50k pin you
need<00:02:38.659> to<00:02:38.779> know<00:02:38.900> what<00:02:39.019> they're<00:02:39.139> going<00:02:39.319> for

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
other than that I would not really place

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.720 
other than that I would not really place
a<00:02:41.569> bit<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.170> by<00:02:42.560> checking<00:02:42.889> i<00:02:43.099> would<00:02:43.249> definitely

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
a bit and by checking i would definitely

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.699 
a bit and by checking i would definitely
