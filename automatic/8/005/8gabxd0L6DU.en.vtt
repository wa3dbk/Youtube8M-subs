what we suggest is 512 this will

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.649 
what we suggest is 512 this will
allocate<00:02:26.480> at<00:02:27.480> least<00:02:27.840> 512<00:02:29.299> megabytes<00:02:30.299> of

increased the memory to something around

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:50.000 
increased the memory to something around
512<00:03:44.069> megabytes<00:03:48.139> here<00:03:49.139> you<00:03:49.229> will<00:03:49.409> see<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.799> he
