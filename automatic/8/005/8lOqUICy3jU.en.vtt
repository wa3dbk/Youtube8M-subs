00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:32.819 
like this oh I should tell with them in
like<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:25.790> cut<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:30.230> length<00:03:31.120> can<00:03:32.120> pee<00:03:32.450> I

like that I cut it to length can pee I

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.309 
like that I cut it to length can pee I
think<00:03:33.829> it's<00:03:33.950> equivalent<00:03:34.189> to<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.579> tennis<00:03:36.819> one<00:03:37.819> be

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
think it's equivalent to a tennis one be

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:47.979 
think it's equivalent to a tennis one be
definite<00:03:39.319> and<00:03:39.560> one<00:03:39.769> be<00:03:39.950> all<00:03:45.730> right<00:03:46.810> this<00:03:47.810> is

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
definite and one be all right this is

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.890 
definite and one be all right this is
one<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.409> a<00:03:48.439> half<00:03:48.470> eggs<00:03:48.889> probably<00:03:49.700> about<00:03:50.659> one

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
one and a half eggs probably about one

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.179 
one and a half eggs probably about one
and<00:03:51.019> a<00:03:51.079> half<00:03:51.549> bags<00:03:52.549> in<00:03:53.090> my<00:03:53.150> head<00:03:53.540> are<00:03:54.139> full<00:03:54.889> so

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
and a half bags in my head are full so

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:01.330 
and a half bags in my head are full so
in<00:03:56.889> heading<00:03:57.889> for<00:03:58.129> we<00:03:59.739> don't<00:04:00.739> rip<00:04:00.919> it<00:04:01.010> at<00:04:01.159> night
