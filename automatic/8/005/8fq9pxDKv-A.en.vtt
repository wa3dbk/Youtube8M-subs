 the difference with the children is extraordinary it is very fashionable 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.919
 participatory and we will go further I assume that everyone has 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.149
 Something to say 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:35.199
 for bribery a book that 500 for the period ending July 23 at 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.519
 53 of Tehran and 43 friendly season of luck favor this 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.370
 should take the exploit 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.980
 to circumvent them also maybe to go even further all the sports 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.860
 but the terms are not admissible 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.590
 for me it will be like a gadio finale 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.860
 so a capsule 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.930
 so I emptied my video game focused spaces autolib nc 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.180
 Friday on lci 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.510
 there are still places 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.060
 today they allow to go further behind 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.430
 on the walls of the toy museum 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.890
 and guess who 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.890
 khalfan tamim so be very personal 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.050
 a difficult phase 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.420
 given the lack of electricity I'm happy with electricity they have 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.860
 known around us in a day 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.820
 I was very marked by this well-spoken strike and then we have 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.150
 agreed that coffee sellers blue card reader 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.050
 the club Tarnais 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.930
 I can mention that we can have 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.230
 however more complex of his square meter 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.320
 while agreeing 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.500
 registrations to all 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.560
 his identity is not me who say this system there because for them 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.899
 I missed it as a reader we find a book that happens in a 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.070
 France almost apocalyptic but not completely on the tarmac at the base 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.420
 tax later I did not sleep it I would like that French voted 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.689
 a very difficult situation the draft plan of major works 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.630
 more than 6 percent 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.140
 it is the Montpellier network 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.290
 we have big problems itself 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.239

 overall i know i'm going to do i'm going to work in this scope 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.129
 also by the comments Tuesday night sometimes we let ourselves be overwhelmed by 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.889
 the story 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.949
 and we can say that the woman has chosen to make it pass to a very beautiful 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.709
 woman and by the readers we will see this adventure it happens at the door 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.879
 besides the trouble to close the site if we will see 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:36.560
