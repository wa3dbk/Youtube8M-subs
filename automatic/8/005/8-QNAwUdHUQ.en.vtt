00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
ones the front doesn't fall off well if

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.079 
ones the front doesn't fall off well if
this<00:00:28.050> wasn't<00:00:28.439> safe<00:00:28.710> why<00:00:29.009> did<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.460> 80,000

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
this wasn't safe why did it have 80,000

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.519 
this wasn't safe why did it have 80,000
tons<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.359> war<00:00:30.509> I'm<00:00:30.900> not<00:00:31.080> saying<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.410> wasn't

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
tons of war I'm not saying it wasn't

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.110 
tons of war I'm not saying it wasn't
safe<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.250> preps<00:00:32.430> not<00:00:32.610> quite<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:32.940> safe

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
safe it's just preps not quite as safe

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.670 
safe it's just preps not quite as safe
as<00:00:33.300> some<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.570> other<00:00:33.690> ones<00:00:33.900> why<00:00:34.260> well

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
as some of the other ones why well

salmon<00:00:34.950> ever<00:00:35.100> built<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.610> front<00:00:35.820> doesn't

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
fall off at all wasn't this built so the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.260 
fall off at all wasn't this built so the
front<00:00:38.100> would<00:00:38.220> be<00:00:38.280> fall<00:00:38.460> all<00:00:38.640> obviously<00:00:39.030> not

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
front would be fall all obviously not

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.150 
front would be fall all obviously not
how<00:00:39.630> do<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.810> know<00:00:39.930> because<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.650> front<00:00:40.920> fell
