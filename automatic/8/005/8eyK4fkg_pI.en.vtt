with levers you know our committee said

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.660 
with levers you know our committee said
give<00:00:39.290> me<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.440> lever<00:00:39.650> long<00:00:39.890> enough<00:00:39.949> and<00:00:40.400> I<00:00:40.460> can

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
give me a lever long enough and I can

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.549 
give me a lever long enough and I can
move<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.970> earth<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.839> what<00:00:41.989> we<00:00:42.080> was<00:00:42.170> talking

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
move the earth and what we was talking

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.560 
move the earth and what we was talking
about<00:00:42.620> is<00:00:43.010> this<00:00:43.550> two-by-four<00:00:44.180> it<00:00:44.239> looks<00:00:44.390> like

about is this two-by-four it looks like
an<00:00:44.750> old<00:00:44.900> seesaw<00:00:45.589> when<00:00:45.800> we<00:00:45.949> were<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.070> kid<00:00:46.309> right

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
an old seesaw when we were a kid right

the<00:00:47.239> force<00:00:47.540> down<00:00:47.839> here<00:00:48.140> equals<00:00:48.409> the<00:00:48.500> force<00:00:48.769> up

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
the force down here equals the force up

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.130 
the force down here equals the force up
there<00:00:49.190> but<00:00:49.400> if<00:00:49.489> I<00:00:49.640> change<00:00:49.970> the<00:00:50.390> arm<00:00:50.600> on<00:00:50.989> this

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
there but if I change the arm on this

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.100 
there but if I change the arm on this
lever<00:00:52.059> lengthen<00:00:53.059> this<00:00:53.239> one<00:00:53.480> short<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:53.989> that

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
lever lengthen this one short and that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.500 
lever lengthen this one short and that
one<00:00:54.320> per<00:00:54.470> did<00:00:54.949> a<00:00:54.979> mechanical<00:00:55.670> advantage<00:00:55.790> and

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
one per did a mechanical advantage and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.899 
one per did a mechanical advantage and
the<00:00:57.019> mechanical<00:00:57.589> advantage<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.280> this<00:00:58.549> force

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
the mechanical advantage is this force

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.600 
the mechanical advantage is this force
is<00:00:59.180> multiplied<00:00:59.750> times<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.409> a<00:01:00.710> proportional

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
is multiplied times the a proportional

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.570 
is multiplied times the a proportional
distance<00:01:02.439> compared<00:01:03.439> to<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.860> force<00:01:04.159> that<00:01:04.400> goes

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
distance compared to the force that goes

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.060 
distance compared to the force that goes
down<00:01:04.790> here<00:01:05.150> on<00:01:05.330> this<00:01:05.510> short<00:01:05.810> distance<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:06.920> the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
down here on this short distance so the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.640 
down here on this short distance so the
multiplier<00:01:07.640> then<00:01:08.060> works<00:01:08.720> like<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:08.930> big<00:01:09.080> pro<00:01:09.380> bar

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
multiplier then works like a big pro bar

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.420 
multiplier then works like a big pro bar
and<00:01:09.950> we're<00:01:10.460> able<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.790> huge<00:01:11.030> move<00:01:11.979> big<00:01:12.979> heavy

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
and we're able to huge move big heavy

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.270 
and we're able to huge move big heavy
