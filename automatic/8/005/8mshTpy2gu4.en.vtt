your great art this is I have an a just
an<00:02:30.770> old<00:02:30.920> classic<00:02:31.310> Ferrari<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.000> as<00:02:32.180> Alex<00:02:32.660> said

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
an old classic Ferrari and as Alex said

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.780 
an old classic Ferrari and as Alex said
it<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.020> just<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.890> go-kart<00:02:34.460> with<00:02:34.730> a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
it is a just a go-kart with a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.790 
it is a just a go-kart with a
ridiculously<00:02:35.270> powerful<00:02:35.450> engine<00:02:35.960> is<00:02:36.650> a

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
ridiculously powerful engine is a

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.700 
ridiculously powerful engine is a
handful<00:02:37.340> though<00:02:37.870> because<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.050> weighs<00:02:39.200> like

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
handful though because it weighs like

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.910 
handful though because it weighs like
nothing<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.960> as<00:02:41.960> you<00:02:42.110> can<00:02:42.230> see<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.500> tires<00:02:42.740> are

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
nothing and as you can see the tires are

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.590 
nothing and as you can see the tires are
ridiculously<00:02:43.280> why<00:02:43.640> but<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.000> still<00:02:44.150> has<00:02:44.300> no

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
ridiculously why but it still has no

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.560 
ridiculously why but it still has no
grip<00:02:44.870> at<00:02:44.960> all<00:02:45.640> yeah<00:02:46.640> we'll<00:02:47.120> go<00:02:47.240> back<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.510> the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
grip at all yeah we'll go back to the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.320 
grip at all yeah we'll go back to the
bit<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.780> more<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.170> 458<00:02:48.830> this<00:02:48.980> car<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:50.060> was<00:02:50.210> good

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
bit of more the 458 this car it was good

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.780 
bit of more the 458 this car it was good
fun<00:02:50.480> actually<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.840> was<00:02:51.460> surprisingly<00:02:52.460> easy<00:02:52.550> to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
fun actually it was surprisingly easy to

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.520 
fun actually it was surprisingly easy to
drift<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:53.240> wouldn't<00:02:53.780> want<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.080> race<00:02:54.350> this

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
drift I wouldn't want to race this

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.280 
drift I wouldn't want to race this
crossing<00:02:55.010> how<00:02:55.160> easy<00:02:55.430> this<00:02:55.640> was<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.970> drift<00:02:56.290> in

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
crossing how easy this was to drift in

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.780 
crossing how easy this was to drift in
general<00:02:57.680> if<00:02:57.800> it's<00:02:57.920> easy<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.490> drift<00:02:58.670> is

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
general if it's easy to drift is

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.890 
general if it's easy to drift is
probably<00:02:59.060> not<00:02:59.209> particularly<00:02:59.480> good<00:02:59.630> race<00:02:59.870> car

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
probably not particularly good race car

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.630 
probably not particularly good race car
but<00:03:00.290> there<00:03:00.410> we<00:03:00.500> go<00:03:00.650> we're<00:03:01.130> gonna<00:03:01.250> run<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.490> bit

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
but there we go we're gonna run a bit

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.010 
but there we go we're gonna run a bit
closer<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:01.940> all<00:03:02.180> this<00:03:02.330> time<00:03:02.540> you're<00:03:02.780> just

off<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.180> track<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.390> tad<00:03:50.630> this<00:03:51.290> was

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
off the track a tad this was

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.910 
off the track a tad this was
surprisingly<00:03:52.250> good<00:03:52.489> actually<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:53.800> of<00:03:54.800> course

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
surprisingly good actually I of course

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.680 
surprisingly good actually I of course
have<00:03:55.190> had<00:03:55.550> to<00:03:55.670> bring<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:55.880> pipe<00:03:56.060> at<00:03:56.239> some<00:03:56.420> point

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
have had to bring a pipe at some point

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.259 
have had to bring a pipe at some point
in<00:03:56.810> crash<00:03:57.080> on<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.410> immediately<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:58.760> did<00:03:59.150> some

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
in crash on it immediately I did some

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.850 
in crash on it immediately I did some
testing<00:03:59.630> of<00:03:59.780> this<00:03:59.870> idea<00:04:00.050> ignore<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.620> damage

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
testing of this idea ignore the damage

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.990 
testing of this idea ignore the damage
on<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.040> back<00:04:01.190> by<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.370> way<00:04:01.519> that<00:04:01.760> was<00:04:01.820> me

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
on the back by the way that was me

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.460 
on the back by the way that was me
messing<00:04:02.360> about<00:04:02.510> getting<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:02.930> star<00:04:03.230> point

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
messing about getting to the star point

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.990 
messing about getting to the star point
I<00:04:03.590> did<00:04:03.950> some<00:04:04.070> testing<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.459> was<00:04:04.550> expecting<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
I did some testing I was expecting the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.580 
I did some testing I was expecting the
Viper<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.300> be<00:04:05.360> quite<00:04:05.510> good<00:04:05.690> but<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.019> wasn't

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
Viper to be quite good but it wasn't

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.150 
Viper to be quite good but it wasn't
particularly<00:04:07.420> um<00:04:08.420> surprisingly<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.800> Zonda

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
particularly um surprisingly the Zonda

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.410 
particularly um surprisingly the Zonda
the<00:04:10.580> more<00:04:10.730> you<00:04:10.760> got<00:04:10.910> used<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.180> car<00:04:11.299> the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
the more you got used to the car the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.670 
the more you got used to the car the
more<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.690> was<00:04:11.810> actually<00:04:12.170> good<00:04:12.350> I<00:04:12.470> mean<00:04:12.590> I've

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
more it was actually good I mean I've

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.680 
more it was actually good I mean I've
driven<00:04:12.860> this<00:04:12.980> car<00:04:13.070> around<00:04:13.730> like<00:04:14.060> Nurburgring

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
driven this car around like Nurburgring

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.750 
driven this car around like Nurburgring
it<00:04:14.810> is<00:04:14.930> ridiculously<00:04:15.860> planted<00:04:16.400> but<00:04:16.519> when<00:04:16.640> you

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
it is ridiculously planted but when you

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.300 
it is ridiculously planted but when you
it's<00:04:17.209> surprising<00:04:17.870> how<00:04:18.049> good<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.890> can<00:04:18.919> get<00:04:19.190> it

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
it's surprising how good you can get it

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.800 
it's surprising how good you can get it
sideways<00:04:19.820> how<00:04:20.090> much<00:04:20.450> you<00:04:20.570> can<00:04:20.660> get<00:04:20.720> it

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
sideways how much you can get it

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.070 
sideways how much you can get it
sideways<00:04:21.169> um<00:04:21.610> yeah<00:04:22.610> part<00:04:22.940> from<00:04:23.060> birds<00:04:23.510> nearly

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
sideways um yeah part from birds nearly

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.300 
sideways um yeah part from birds nearly
went<00:04:24.200> on<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.350> grass<00:04:24.500> say<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.860> doesn't<00:04:25.250> look

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
went on the grass say it doesn't look

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.770 
went on the grass say it doesn't look
very<00:04:25.370> sideways<00:04:25.789> but<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.270> was<00:04:26.450> believed<00:04:26.960> me

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
very sideways but it was believed me

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.960 
very sideways but it was believed me
yeah<00:04:28.139> it<00:04:28.530> all<00:04:29.010> of<00:04:29.130> these<00:04:29.220> cards<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.610> feels<00:04:29.850> like

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
yeah it all of these cards it feels like

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.430 
yeah it all of these cards it feels like
you<00:04:30.060> got<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.210> lot<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.389> sideways<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.020> back<00:04:31.290> to

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
you got a lot of sideways and back to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.960 
you got a lot of sideways and back to
the<00:04:31.530> Viper<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.370> was<00:04:32.550> actually<00:04:32.670> kind<00:04:32.940> of

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
the Viper and I was actually kind of

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.150 
the Viper and I was actually kind of
going<00:04:33.150> quite<00:04:33.300> well<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.600> run<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.170> then<00:04:34.440> that's

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
going quite well to run and then that's

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.590 
going quite well to run and then that's
overcooked<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.760> little<00:04:35.970> bit<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.270> we're<00:04:36.419> going

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
overcooked a little bit and we're going

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.450 
overcooked a little bit and we're going
to<00:04:36.630> spin<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.620> was<00:04:37.770> Eddie<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:38.040> wall<00:04:38.220> in

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
to spin and is that was Eddie a wall in

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.210 
to spin and is that was Eddie a wall in
there<00:04:38.610> interesting<00:04:39.600> my<00:04:39.720> wife<00:04:39.930> was<00:04:40.320> wasn't

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
yeah this is gonna work pretty well and

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.970 
yeah this is gonna work pretty well and
then<00:04:48.389> when<00:04:48.540> i<00:04:48.570> go<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:48.960> film<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.440> i<00:04:49.500> just<00:04:49.560> crashed

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
then when i go to film it i just crashed

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.310 
then when i go to film it i just crashed
it<00:04:50.160> up<00:04:50.970> next<00:04:51.270> was<00:04:51.360> my<00:04:51.450> choice<00:04:51.660> from<00:04:51.870> another

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
it up next was my choice from another

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.830 
it up next was my choice from another
choice<00:04:52.470> from<00:04:52.620> r2<00:04:53.010> with<00:04:53.190> is<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:53.310> honda<00:04:53.790> nsx<00:04:54.210> super

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.190 
GT or whatever the hell they race these
in<00:04:56.490> this<00:04:57.150> was<00:04:57.330> actually<00:04:57.480> a<00:04:57.660> very<00:04:57.780> good<00:04:57.900> drift

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
in this was actually a very good drift

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.170 
in this was actually a very good drift
car<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.950> just<00:04:59.370> didn't<00:04:59.610> drive<00:04:59.760> a<00:04:59.790> particularly

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
car I just didn't drive a particularly

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.409 
car I just didn't drive a particularly
well<00:05:00.330> in<00:05:00.480> filming<00:05:00.780> again<00:05:02.000> yeah<00:05:03.000> this<00:05:03.150> has<00:05:03.360> a

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
well in filming again yeah this has a

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.690 
well in filming again yeah this has a
humongous<00:05:04.290> amount<00:05:04.530> of<00:05:04.620> downforce<00:05:04.980> when<00:05:05.520> you

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
humongous amount of downforce when you

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.610 
humongous amount of downforce when you
when<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:05.970> race<00:05:06.240> one<00:05:06.419> of<00:05:06.510> these<00:05:06.660> but<00:05:07.350> it<00:05:07.440> was

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
when you race one of these but it was

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.290 
when you race one of these but it was
surprisingly<00:05:08.160> good<00:05:08.280> if<00:05:08.580> fitting<00:05:08.850> even<00:05:09.090> if<00:05:09.210> I

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
surprisingly good if fitting even if I

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.480 
surprisingly good if fitting even if I
did<00:05:09.480> blood<00:05:10.050> off<00:05:10.260> from<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.500> bit<00:05:10.710> there<00:05:10.860> yeah

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
did blood off from that bit there yeah

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.840 
did blood off from that bit there yeah
ignore<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:12.150> better<00:05:12.390> your<00:05:13.110> radical<00:05:13.530> was<00:05:13.950> this<00:05:14.640> is

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850

ignore a better your radical was this is
what<00:05:15.000> I've<00:05:15.090> got<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.480> have<00:05:15.690> been<00:05:15.840> a<00:05:15.870> bit<00:05:16.140> mental

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
what I've got I have been a bit mental

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.980 
what I've got I have been a bit mental
and<00:05:16.710> bought<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:17.010> radical<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.669> which<00:05:18.390> as<00:05:18.840> you

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
and bought a radical and which as you

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.010 
and bought a radical and which as you
can<00:05:19.050> see<00:05:19.320> I'm<00:05:19.410> just<00:05:19.520> spinning<00:05:20.520> very<00:05:20.820> very<00:05:21.570> much

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
can see I'm just spinning very very much

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.060 
can see I'm just spinning very very much
um<00:05:22.350> yes<00:05:22.830> um<00:05:23.130> this<00:05:23.940> is<00:05:24.210> just<00:05:24.479> insanely<00:05:24.990> hard<00:05:25.380> to

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
um yes um this is just insanely hard to

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.730 
um yes um this is just insanely hard to
drift<00:05:26.720> yeah<00:05:27.720> here<00:05:27.960> we<00:05:28.080> have<00:05:28.200> this<00:05:28.440> is<00:05:28.590> probably

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
drift yeah here we have this is probably

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.950 
drift yeah here we have this is probably
what<00:05:28.919> my<00:05:29.130> proudest<00:05:29.700> drifting<00:05:30.270> bit<00:05:30.479> for<00:05:30.870> this

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
what my proudest drifting bit for this

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.270 
what my proudest drifting bit for this
whole<00:05:31.080> entire<00:05:31.229> video<00:05:31.620> through<00:05:31.919> there<00:05:32.100> with

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
whole entire video through there with

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.460 
whole entire video through there with
the<00:05:32.400> with<00:05:32.669> the<00:05:32.700> NSX<00:05:33.180> it<00:05:33.660> was<00:05:33.840> quite<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.140> was

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
the with the NSX it was quite it was

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.280 
the with the NSX it was quite it was
quite<00:05:34.770> good<00:05:34.800> at<00:05:35.130> going<00:05:35.250> sideways<00:05:36.050> despite<00:05:37.050> all

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
quite good at going sideways despite all

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.020 
quite good at going sideways despite all
the<00:05:37.440> arrow<00:05:37.620> not<00:05:38.340> quite<00:05:38.490> sure<00:05:38.520> how<00:05:38.610> that<00:05:38.880> works

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
the arrow not quite sure how that works

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.469 
the arrow not quite sure how that works
and<00:05:39.440> your<00:05:40.440> radical<00:05:40.740> was<00:05:41.220> I<00:05:41.520> had<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.000> bit<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.240> I

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
and your radical was I had a bit of I

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.420 
and your radical was I had a bit of I
had<00:05:42.690> quite<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.020> sort<00:05:43.680> of<00:05:43.770> got<00:05:43.919> it<00:05:44.039> there<00:05:44.220> and

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
had quite the sort of got it there and

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.500 
had quite the sort of got it there and
then<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.640> sort<00:05:44.880> of<00:05:44.910> fell<00:05:45.090> off<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.240> track<00:05:45.479> and

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
then I sort of fell off the track and

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.050 
then I sort of fell off the track and
just<00:05:45.900> spun<00:05:46.380> it<00:05:46.530> um<00:05:46.680> I<00:05:47.100> will<00:05:47.220> say<00:05:47.550> no<00:05:47.850> time

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
just spun it um I will say no time

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.640 
just spun it um I will say no time
facing<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.539> wrong<00:05:48.720> way<00:05:48.780> with<00:05:49.140> that<00:05:49.260> radical

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
facing the wrong way with that radical

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.070 
facing the wrong way with that radical
yeah<00:05:49.860> I<00:05:50.130> did<00:05:50.310> it<00:05:50.520> was<00:05:50.820> quite<00:05:51.270> a<00:05:51.300> difficult<00:05:51.570> car

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
yeah I did it was quite a difficult car

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.340 
yeah I did it was quite a difficult car
um<00:05:52.320> right<00:05:52.940> this<00:05:53.940> is<00:05:54.180> what<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.479> bought<00:05:54.750> now<00:05:54.960> you

must be thinking people at home watching

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.940 
must be thinking people at home watching
a<00:05:57.210> thinking<00:05:57.570> you're<00:05:57.840> an<00:05:57.960> idiot<00:05:58.169> what<00:05:58.740> have<00:05:58.890> you

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
done um I've got a porsche 962 getting

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.790 
done um I've got a porsche 962 getting
quite<00:06:02.460> close<00:06:02.490> to<00:06:02.910> the<00:06:03.030> wall<00:06:03.210> there<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:03.680> we<00:06:04.680> can

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
quite close to the wall there and we can

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.100 
quite close to the wall there and we can
be<00:06:04.919> small<00:06:05.160> car<00:06:05.430> it<00:06:05.669> has<00:06:06.120> it's<00:06:06.300> got<00:06:06.360> no<00:06:06.600> down<00:06:06.810> for

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
be small car it has it's got no down for

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.050 
be small car it has it's got no down for
so<00:06:07.289> it<00:06:07.350> is<00:06:07.440> sort<00:06:07.919> of<00:06:08.070> good<00:06:08.160> at<00:06:08.220> drifting<00:06:08.669> you

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
so it is sort of good at drifting you

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.450 
so it is sort of good at drifting you
bought<00:06:09.240> a<00:06:09.270> bent<00:06:09.630> it<00:06:09.810> i<00:06:10.020> bought<00:06:10.770> a<00:06:10.800> bentley<00:06:11.280> and

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
bought a bent it i bought a bentley and

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.300 
bought a bent it i bought a bentley and
immediately<00:06:12.270> Spanish<00:06:12.720> as<00:06:12.900> well<00:06:13.130> yeah<00:06:14.130> they

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
immediately Spanish as well yeah they

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.070 
immediately Spanish as well yeah they
ignore<00:06:14.669> that<00:06:14.789> bit<00:06:14.940> I<00:06:15.120> saw<00:06:15.539> basically<00:06:15.930> look

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
ignore that bit I saw basically look

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.240 
ignore that bit I saw basically look
through<00:06:16.260> the<00:06:16.380> list<00:06:16.470> of<00:06:16.650> cars<00:06:16.800> and<00:06:17.039> saw<00:06:17.130> what

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
through the list of cars and saw what

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.830 
through the list of cars and saw what
had<00:06:17.400> the<00:06:17.550> worst<00:06:17.760> handling<00:06:18.210> and<00:06:18.390> it<00:06:18.630> was<00:06:18.750> the

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
had the worst handling and it was the

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.409 
had the worst handling and it was the
Bentley<00:06:19.110> and<00:06:19.289> it<00:06:19.380> didn't<00:06:19.530> work<00:06:19.560> here<00:06:20.180> why<00:06:21.180> that

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
Bentley and it didn't work here why that

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:22.850 
Bentley and it didn't work here why that
was<00:06:21.570> very<00:06:21.810> close<00:06:22.020> thought<00:06:22.289> that<00:06:22.470> was<00:06:22.620> close

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
was very close thought that was close

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.940 
was very close thought that was close
that<00:06:23.310> was<00:06:23.520> close<00:06:23.910> I<00:06:24.840> did<00:06:25.350> actually<00:06:25.500> listen<00:06:25.919> to

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
that was close I did actually listen to

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.620 
that was close I did actually listen to
the<00:06:26.039> replay<00:06:26.280> you<00:06:26.490> did<00:06:26.880> touch<00:06:27.120> the<00:06:27.270> wall<00:06:27.419> but<00:06:27.600> it

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
the replay you did touch the wall but it

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.690 
the replay you did touch the wall but it
was<00:06:27.810> so<00:06:28.050> faint<00:06:28.410> you<00:06:28.560> barely<00:06:28.770> noticed<00:06:29.220> it<00:06:29.370> the

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
was so faint you barely noticed it the

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.090 
was so faint you barely noticed it the
Bentley<00:06:30.060> was<00:06:30.419> kind<00:06:30.930> of<00:06:31.140> not<00:06:31.620> going<00:06:31.800> very<00:06:31.890> well

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
Bentley was kind of not going very well

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.100 
Bentley was kind of not going very well
I

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
I

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.690 
I
going<00:06:33.380> around<00:06:33.440> the<00:06:33.650> loss<00:06:33.770> it<00:06:33.980> kind<00:06:34.220> of<00:06:34.310> sort<00:06:34.580> of

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
going around the loss it kind of sort of

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.520 
going around the loss it kind of sort of
works<00:06:35.000> but<00:06:35.390> minute<00:06:36.170> you<00:06:36.260> start<00:06:36.440> getting

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
works but minute you start getting

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.350 
works but minute you start getting
sideways<00:06:36.890> the<00:06:37.280> way<00:06:37.400> these<00:06:37.550> cars<00:06:37.820> work<00:06:38.000> he<00:06:38.150> just

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
sideways the way these cars work he just

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.910 
sideways the way these cars work he just
sort<00:06:38.660> of<00:06:38.720> flung<00:06:38.960> it<00:06:39.080> around<00:06:39.230> and<00:06:39.410> spun<00:06:39.650> you<00:06:39.770> out

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
sort of flung it around and spun you out

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.250 
sort of flung it around and spun you out
and<00:06:40.100> so<00:06:40.940> you<00:06:41.000> don't<00:06:41.090> try<00:06:41.510> and<00:06:41.570> drift<00:06:41.750> up<00:06:41.930> above

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
and so you don't try and drift up above

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.040 
and so you don't try and drift up above
all<00:06:42.590> one<00:06:42.800> that<00:06:42.920> now<00:06:43.070> 131<00:06:43.760> are<00:06:44.210> one<00:06:44.570> cars<00:06:44.840> now

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
all one that now 131 are one cars now

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.600
