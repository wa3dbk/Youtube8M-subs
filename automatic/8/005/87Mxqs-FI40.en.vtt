00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
in the front leg and then the last step

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.499 
in the front leg and then the last step
is<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:34.740> put<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.670> palm<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.150> hand

on the palm of her hand and a little bit

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.469 
on the palm of her hand and a little bit
of<00:01:40.409> pressure<00:01:40.710> behind<00:01:41.280> her<00:01:41.579> elbow<00:01:41.970> above<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
of pressure behind her elbow above it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.460 
of pressure behind her elbow above it
and<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> little<00:01:43.799> bouncing<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
and you just do a little bouncing and

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.350 
and you just do a little bouncing and
that<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.860> mimics<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.970> know<00:01:48.090> putting

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that kind of mimics you know putting

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.139 
that kind of mimics you know putting
pressure<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.170> walking<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.829> your<00:01:50.040> foot<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
pressure and walking on your foot and it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.469 
pressure and walking on your foot and it
just<00:01:51.390> kind<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.220> teary<00:01:53.220> teaches<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:53.939> leg<00:01:54.180> how

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
just kind of teary teaches there leg how

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.870 
just kind of teary teaches there leg how
to<00:01:54.540> support<00:01:55.110> weight<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.710> respond<00:01:56.610> to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
to support weight and respond to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.399 
to support weight and respond to
pressure<00:01:57.869> still<00:01:58.500> aim<00:01:58.680> down<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.780> maybe

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
pressure still aim down and you do maybe

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.850 
pressure still aim down and you do maybe
30<00:02:01.860> seconds<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.670> bouncing<00:02:03.380> 1<00:02:04.380> 2<00:02:04.619> 3<00:02:04.829> 4<00:02:05.130> 5<00:02:05.399> 6

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
30 seconds of that bouncing 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.590 
30 seconds of that bouncing 1 2 3 4 5 6
keep<00:02:06.070> them<00:02:06.280> she<00:02:06.970> doesn't<00:02:07.390> want<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.570> do<00:02:07.720> it<00:02:07.750> just

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
keep them she doesn't want to do it just

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.450 
keep them she doesn't want to do it just
like<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:11.110> that's<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:12.070> that's<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.370> whole

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
like that and that's it that's the whole

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.730 
like that and that's it that's the whole
front<00:02:13.060> leg<00:02:13.210> on<00:02:13.390> one<00:02:13.540> side<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.410> now<00:02:14.650> we're

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
front leg on one side and now we're

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.550 
front leg on one side and now we're
going<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.920> go<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.160> back<00:02:15.310> leg
