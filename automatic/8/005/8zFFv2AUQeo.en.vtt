00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello to all Spartan parties 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.460
 how are you I am in victory would be my 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.210
 worse gt3 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.210
 and I'm back in the somersault 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.340
 or it looks like garden 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.340
 very one-armed 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.580
 Oh my God 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.860

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.060
 ok to see 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.060
 I really have to go 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.440
 and I fell uncle nothing he says was a 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.250
 little bit of parkour 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.039
 on this server to see if I get to the end 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:54.739
 I'll be 5 minutes like that and I do not know what 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.739
 it seems if we make some series of series 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.810
 some parkour videos this is the 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.810
 easy in theory 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.619
 and then proceed to see what you think 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.619
 this over here 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.550

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.550
 how can that be 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.960
 rather unemployed in terms of the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.190
 jump because good 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.840

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.840

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.030

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:56.020

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.740
