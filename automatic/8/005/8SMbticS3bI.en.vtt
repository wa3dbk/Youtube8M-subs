right<00:03:35.530> now<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:35.860> is<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.850> UM<00:03:37.150> 67<00:03:38.110> it's<00:03:38.890> also<00:03:39.130> I

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
right now this is the UM 67 it's also I

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.000 
right now this is the UM 67 it's also I
believe<00:03:39.459> 34<00:03:40.090> inches<00:03:40.329> in<00:03:40.480> size<00:03:40.690> yes<00:03:41.140> but<00:03:41.950> the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
believe 34 inches in size yes but the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.949 
believe 34 inches in size yes but the
big<00:03:42.160> difference<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.700> resolution<00:03:43.420> drop

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
big difference is the resolution drop

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.130 
big difference is the resolution drop
this<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.290> 2560<00:03:45.220> by<00:03:45.430> 1080<00:03:47.190> so<00:03:48.239> it's<00:03:49.239> only<00:03:49.420> 550

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
this is 2560 by 1080 so it's only 550

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.009 
this is 2560 by 1080 so it's only 550

display<00:03:55.180> with<00:03:55.360> a<00:03:55.390> much<00:03:55.630> higher<00:03:55.870> resolution

display with a much higher resolution

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.319 
display with a much higher resolution
this<00:03:57.310> is<00:03:57.370> slightly<00:03:57.700> better<00:03:57.970> for<00:03:58.180> gaming

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
this is slightly better for gaming

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.060 
this is slightly better for gaming
though<00:03:58.630> because<00:03:58.810> I<00:03:59.079> believe<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> fancy

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
though because I believe the fancy

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.960 
though because I believe the fancy
marketing<00:04:00.430> term<00:04:00.850> is<00:04:02.160> freesync<00:04:03.160> technology<00:04:03.190> so

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
marketing term is freesync technology so

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.880 
marketing term is freesync technology so
it's<00:04:04.090> going<00:04:04.269> to<00:04:04.570> give<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.019> better<00:04:05.230> frame<00:04:05.650> rate

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
it's going to give you better frame rate

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.110 
it's going to give you better frame rate

for<00:04:12.849> gaming<00:04:13.239> so

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
for gaming so

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.560

you're on your PC and so this is an

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.150 
you're on your PC and so this is an
option<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:17.140> kind<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.440> don't<00:04:17.620> recommend<00:04:18.070> it

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
option I kind of don't recommend it

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.800 
option I kind of don't recommend it
especially<00:04:18.280> productivity<00:04:19.269> I<00:04:19.299> do<00:04:19.390> recommend

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
especially productivity I do recommend

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.720 
especially productivity I do recommend
my<00:04:20.650> top<00:04:20.859> pick<00:04:21.100> has<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.459> be<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:22.110> 34<00:04:23.110> um<00:04:23.470> 95<00:04:24.100> just

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
my top pick has to be the 34 um 95 just

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.220 
my top pick has to be the 34 um 95 just
because<00:04:24.940> I<00:04:25.030> think<00:04:25.090> it's<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.330> perfect<00:04:25.630> mix<00:04:25.840> it's

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
because I think it's a perfect mix it's

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.480 
because I think it's a perfect mix it's
a<00:04:26.320> little<00:04:26.530> expensive<00:04:27.010> but<00:04:27.040> it's<00:04:27.220> major

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
a little expensive but it's major

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.490 
a little expensive but it's major
productivity<00:04:28.270> so<00:04:29.110> it's<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.260> pretty<00:04:29.410> good

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
productivity so it's a pretty good

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.740 
productivity so it's a pretty good
investment<00:04:29.770> in<00:04:30.310> my<00:04:30.490> view<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:31.090> also<00:04:31.330> forgot<00:04:31.690> to

mention the decent monitors run at 60

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.960 
mention the decent monitors run at 60
Hertz<00:04:34.290> so<00:04:35.290> that's<00:04:36.040> good<00:04:36.280> for<00:04:36.310> gaming<00:04:36.820> I

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
Hertz so that's good for gaming I

Thunderbolt on there so DisplayPort so
that<00:04:46.690> we<00:04:46.810> can<00:04:46.990> utilize<00:04:47.169> these<00:04:47.740> 60<00:04:48.070> Hertz<00:04:48.280> on

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
that we can utilize these 60 Hertz on

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.210 
that we can utilize these 60 Hertz on
all<00:04:48.820> these<00:04:49.000> monitors<00:04:52.530> so<00:04:53.530> because<00:04:53.860> this<00:04:54.040> is<00:04:54.190> a

can definitely go over these get that

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.570 
can definitely go over these get that
better<00:05:31.840> resolution<00:05:32.169> exactly<00:05:33.130> so<00:05:33.280> it's<00:05:33.430> kind

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
better resolution exactly so it's kind

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.860

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
something else but the ultra wide

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.310 
something else but the ultra wide
monitors<00:05:44.710> have<00:05:45.100> a<00:05:45.370> lot<00:05:45.640> less<00:05:46.120> overall<00:05:46.750> pixels

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
monitors have a lot less overall pixels

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.400 
monitors have a lot less overall pixels
than<00:05:47.530> these<00:05:47.650> 4k<00:05:48.100> monitors<00:05:48.610> so<00:05:49.270> if<00:05:49.450> you<00:05:49.660> have<00:05:50.080> a

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
than these 4k monitors so if you have a

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.860 
than these 4k monitors so if you have a
slightly<00:05:50.800> older<00:05:51.160> PC<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.150> you're<00:05:52.630> kind<00:05:52.840> of

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
slightly older PC and you're kind of

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.540 
slightly older PC and you're kind of
concerned<00:05:53.290> about<00:05:53.410> not<00:05:53.710> having<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:54.100> strength

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
concerned about not having the strength

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.130 
concerned about not having the strength
to<00:05:54.700> push<00:05:54.910> all<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.240> pixels<00:05:55.630> I<00:05:55.720> believe<00:05:55.990> the

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
to push all the pixels I believe the

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.050 
to push all the pixels I believe the
ultrawide<00:05:56.620> monitor<00:05:56.669> even<00:05:57.669> in<00:05:57.760> these<00:05:57.880> first

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
ultrawide monitor even in these first

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.430 
ultrawide monitor even in these first
mice<00:05:58.300> I<00:05:58.479> showed<00:05:58.870> you<00:05:59.020> guys<00:05:59.050> with<00:05:59.380> the

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
mice I showed you guys with the

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.790 
mice I showed you guys with the
resolution<00:05:59.710> of<00:05:59.890> 34<00:06:00.280> 40<00:06:00.669> by<00:06:00.790> 1440p<00:06:01.600> I<00:06:01.960> believe

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
resolution of 34 40 by 1440p I believe

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.950 
resolution of 34 40 by 1440p I believe
it<00:06:02.890> has<00:06:03.040> around<00:06:03.370> 5<00:06:03.729> million<00:06:04.210> in<00:06:04.300> total<00:06:04.419> pixels

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
it has around 5 million in total pixels

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.290 
it has around 5 million in total pixels
and<00:06:05.320> these<00:06:05.890> 4k<00:06:06.280> monitor<00:06:06.640> has<00:06:06.790> a<00:06:06.820> 8<00:06:07.090> and<00:06:07.210> a<00:06:07.270> half

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
and these 4k monitor has a 8 and a half

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.140 
and these 4k monitor has a 8 and a half
million<00:06:07.750> pixels<00:06:08.229> total<00:06:08.790> overall<00:06:09.790> the<00:06:09.940> image

million pixels total overall the image

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.090 
million pixels total overall the image
quality<00:06:10.390> of<00:06:10.600> both<00:06:10.810> these<00:06:11.080> are<00:06:11.229> fantastic<00:06:11.860> but

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
quality of both these are fantastic but

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.550 
quality of both these are fantastic but
keep<00:06:12.820> that<00:06:12.880> in<00:06:13.090> mind<00:06:13.300> if<00:06:13.630> you<00:06:13.900> are<00:06:14.229> thinking
