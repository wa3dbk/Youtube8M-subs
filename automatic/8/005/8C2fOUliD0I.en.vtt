00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:09.070
 Just Kapa Sahiro 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:15.060
 Good point in the form at that time and then I want to imitate it 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:21.030
 The other really overall but I think that I want to open this 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:24.750
 It's such a great thing that you'll get lost in the question of where the very good pitching method goes down 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:27.630
 Pork that I do, but at the time in which the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.700
 I play a role in the pelvis 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.980
 The place of how to use how to 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.440
 I think I want to comment 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.040
 Tanaka's really great part is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.880
 Very high 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.010
 State firmly in front 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:51.090
 It can be obtained by moving , so it's very close from the batter 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:58.180
 It's a straight place called ball comes out 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:01.180
 I think it is a straight point where you can get the sky and get sharper than the ball speed 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.140
 Then how do you do your body firmly 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.530
 Previous 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:13.050
 I would like to explain where it can be moved 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.500
 The point is called power position 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.620
 Not be It is a position yea or body has been cut by all means 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.770
 I have a foot and I hope the students soon 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:28.880
 A butt is located behind it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.880
 At the time of how weight transfer It is this state here 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.799
 After raising your feet 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:42.340
 I 'm in the state with the buttocks behind 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:45.150
 As this is because the ass is behind and the country is in front by this, and it is made to revise the body as it is 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.220
 Firmly 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.750
 in this way 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.000
 You can move the upper body smoothly forward 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.650
 This is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.720
 For example, comments instead of far position 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.720
 After raising the foot 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.730
 Knee in front 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.560
 You're in a state where your ass is backwards 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:10.050
 When the body comes out like this 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.050
 Since the axis of rotation is put away tax to the left 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:20.780
 The weight moves out as it is 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.700
 I think that moving things will be a big point 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.220
 Wild rice fore position ghee 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.500
 With entering 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.560
 Or the ground 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.819
 By coming to the top that figure 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.319
 Of moving before the upper body 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:42.859
 The point is the point 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.370
 It's a feeling of soles here but it's very big 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:46.920
 I think I have both 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.870
 First of all 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.040
 What happens when you take a power position ? 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.280
 It is that Osugi is pulled back 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.690
 You can put your weight firmly on the entire foot sole 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.319
 To because leadership of the night view until now 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.189
 Star of the hill 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:11.800
 Put weight on Atsumasaki person I'm thenar 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:16.780
 It is often said that if you do this 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:22.720
 If you target to the ball of the ball, there will be a knee gas movement 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:25.490
 And this because such wells would Inazu pitching further knee is shifted to the inside 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.020
 And gone to 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.260
 Result of twisted knee Ouchi Gow 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.420
 Like this, the knee comes out front and the body comes back 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.450
 And rank 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.390
 Because it Sukotsu the upper body was left behind to create a state in which facing forward earlier 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.040
 In such an operation 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.069
 It will be easier 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.090
 I think that you say that this is Tanaka 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:53.260
 You say that you are using 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.430
 Firmly taken rather than the thenar the entire foot on the ground 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.090
 Hey since the discarded 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:07.090
 I have a body and my pelvis is a bit 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:08.640
 It is possible to move while keeping the state facing the way of the world for a long time 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.300
 Village check collar 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:22.940
 The end of the last body is firmly chest in the rotation along with the pelvis 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:23.880
 At the release point is close to or stuck on very in some of us kept before Idei was state 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.620
 hey 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.990
 I can speak 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:35.880
 As a matter of fact, the sole of the foot must be the entire sole of the foot 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:40.670
 From the heel to the pinky side instead of the inside and toes 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.790
 And a dark image and press the plate firmly on the pelvis 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.360
 Remain in the state they were directed View 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.950
 I think I will go step by step 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:55.380
 And at that time firmly 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:57.449
 Ass It is a power position is moved to maintain this state behind Iruzo 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.610
 I that I had a say 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:06.360
 It is very possible from weight shift to release when you can 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:10.300
 It's a motion, so this will be smoother 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:13.040
 This point just invest it's 7 sticking out motion 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.100
 Very easy to understand if you look at it 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.970
 Do you think because the UK by all means look 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:26.060
 If you have a year imitate is raising the speed of the ball than the doctor 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:30.130
 And I think that should wearing an operation that close the way released in butter 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.130
 So please try to reference
