00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.889
 hello children how are i am nani and today 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.200
 I'm going to do one of the videos that most 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.849
 we like everyone who is always 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.820
 asking here on social networks in 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.189
 facebook on twitter in us online and 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.470
 also on instagram that they love to see 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.200
 different nail designs and that's why today 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.390
 I bring two of them flowers and the other 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.579
 it's from 'animal print' that fascinates me 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.829
 let's see how they are made are very 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.350
 simple and we do not need any 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.270
 very specialized enamel or anything 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.460
 difficult to achieve only with 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.050
 toothpicks and with a glaze 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.670
 any of the color that you 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.390
 Like we will be able to create a design 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.390
 cool 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.559
 for our flowers we are going to make a 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.960
 design of daisies and for this I 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.969
 I chose a background like green in the background 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.160
 they could also replace it with a 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.559
 black or dark blue the idea is to be 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.989
 a strong color because the daisies 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.790
 they have the white petals and the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.890
 little button of the flower is going to be yellow 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.869
 then we need a color in which 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.659
 the flowers can stand out I'm going to start 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.630
 only putting a layer of color 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.500
 dark in all my dreams' 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.500
 my love 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.470
 to make the petals of our 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.540
 daisy let's take the color white 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.640
 and we put it on some flat surface 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.530
 and with whatever you find 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.630
 that has a round head can be 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.670
 the tip in pencil can be a 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.980
 main pour let's start to take 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.440
 small quantities and we're going to do 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.030
 simple little circles in the shape of a petal 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.030
 about 5 more or less per flower 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.100
 ah 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.340
 Now to give a special touch to 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.709
 the flowers I will take again the same 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.359
 color of the base and I'll make a 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.359
 small hairline to each petal 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.769
 and the final touch is the yellow button of 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.769
 our flower 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.240
 ah 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.660
 that way our margarita wedges will be 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.060
 I love you, you can vary the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.740
 Colors that they like and remember 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.480
 that in the end you can pass a layer of 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.350
 transparent so that it lasts much longer 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.350
 this design 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.870
 I already rewarded my nails to show you 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.610
 the second design to think about because 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.810
 the others were beautiful but this 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.910
 you will also love them 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.860
 is an animal facing in this case as a 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.230
 leopard with a touch of pink 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.390
 I chose for the tone of the base this 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.090
 color like skin that is like a coffee 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.790
 very clear I will do the spots with 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.340
 pink a very powerful pink and I'm going to 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.200
 use black to give details I will do 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.090
 the same with a toothpick and with 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.560
 a utensil or tool that has a 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.560
 little head for circles 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.710
 Y 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.450
 Now I'm going to start making some 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.100
 fuchsia spots of different shapes and 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.640
 sizes do not have to be left at all 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.640
 perfect 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.049
 and the last little detail is to do the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.480
 outline of these pink figurines with 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.710
 black so we can create the skin shape 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.710
 of leopard from our nails 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.990
 l 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.439
 for the little details in black the only thing 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.370
 what we are going to do is two or three 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.830
 dots 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.039
 separated around the speck 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:00.439
 pink in the order you want 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.439
 the more messy and uneven the better 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.500
 and 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.819
 Hello 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.550
 and that's how they ended up I know that when 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.710
 one sees them finished it seems that it was very 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.750
 difficult to do but believe me it is very 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.540
 simple they just need to practice a 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.070
 little bit and suddenly more time with the 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.110
 left hand is surely going to 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.900
 to be very ugly but no matter what 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.030
 important is to try and practice or 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.430
 make the hands of your friends from your mom 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.430
 until they become all experts 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.060
 I hope you have enjoyed much the 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.030
 designs today and tell us here 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.790

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.220
 issue us of the day is the new 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.890

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.600
 feeling of freshness all day because 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.130
 now it comes with mint extract to me 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.650
