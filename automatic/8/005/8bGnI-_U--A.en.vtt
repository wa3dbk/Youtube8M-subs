00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.539
 So thank you again for the 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:25.220
 gracious invitation gracious wife 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:27.380
 the food was excellent ev unfortunately 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.890
 I have to say goodbye soon 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.160
 every day at 7 o'clock in my studio 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.140
 So I really care to introduce myself 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.199
 a real inventor Mr. dr 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.980
 well hobby inventer the pure 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.690
 hobby 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.640
 what have they got off and also 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.219
 Not 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.450
 I am still in the pure stadium 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.550
 of reflection 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.809
 I imagine it wonderful ago 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.460
 to be inventive 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.860
 I can not think like that 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.110
 people used to be without radio and television 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.920
 all were able to live, too 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.920
 died 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.670
 with something in mind so if you have 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.680
 sitting in the chair or in her studio 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.080
 I have a lot to do in the sense of meaning 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.070
 For example, I am currently thinking of one 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.890
 so if that succeeds me then 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.650
 there will be no railway from tomorrow 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.210
 he fights and what would that be me 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.470
 I would like to leave the trains 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.470
 move the station 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.080
 besides, one hovers over there 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.210
 epoch-making machine before 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.110
 oh and how many epochs should this 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.860
 make a machine 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.990
 I mean it was hours again 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.320
 means that I stir up dust 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.750
 what kind of machine will that be? 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.440
 street sweeper the economy 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.840
 stall 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.940
 although I believe that right in the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.850
 smallest things of daily life 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.230
 still the biggest possibilities 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.610
 we are still sleeping in the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.670
 experimental stage of this novel 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.470
 match me with two heads 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.090
 it has been equipped for the first time 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.570
 Let's say we are married 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.110
 to go on fire at the same time 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.390
 Well, unfortunately I'm not here but you 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.530
 also not very mature 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.630
 a simple zipper you think so 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.840
 pay close attention to each other 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.880
 this further named after him 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.290
 zygomatic spine 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.870
 go and what is it good for never to be 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.030
 the cocky toddler us this 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.010
 purposes where we can press into it 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.010
 they do not want to have partout 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.330
 my uncle hanno is also inventive 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.580
 a car brake you can wonder with 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.290
 180 kilometers on the highway 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.090
 stop driving with a jerk 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.030
 interesting in the entrance of her uncle 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.160
 with this thing in the light in the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.530
 public if he has a small one 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.880
 he invented it and prevented it 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.240
 that the driver through the 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.240
 windshield 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:48.010
 competition is not sleeping though mine 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:52.209
 Dream again dream of all great inventors 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:56.140
 that would be the perpetuum mobile too 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:04:00.640
 Wonder was not wonderful 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.400
 petrom mobil what is that? 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.890
 perpetuum mobile is a machine that 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.920
 once set in motion without further 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.560
 energy supply to this work does that 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.680
 We say the same process always always 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.389
 repeated again without a new one 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.370
 to need a push 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.760
 you just have to do that to my wife 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.400
 explain a perpetuum mobile is one 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.400
 Cow turning her own milk 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.250
 I would have that without your alban 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.110
 I understood my explanation 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.330
 sweetheart about Germany one would have to 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.400
 a device if this prevents 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.430
 Married couples start arguing 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.690
 dangerous word you have in the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.669
 small undertone with my wife 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.889
 I belonged and already lit one 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.120
 lamp on or a whistle settled and man 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.180
 just think 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.440
 this equipment would not be for me 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.900
 never shines because I can not help it 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.580
 that was your school why both said 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.289
 that I'm insane I do not have 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.590

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.699
 said you're crazy that's that 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.860
 not the same 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.509
 A crazy can like such jeans 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.639
 you bought them on the street 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.650
 A madman can walk around 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.199
 slain her husband with a hoe 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.270
 what you do not fit succumb to fits 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.129
 Everything about jeans only you do not fit anymore 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.050
 think about it 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.719
 jeans are a thing for teens and 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.430

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:33.240

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.340
 too old for jeans such pants menowin 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.130
 Thus no team fight shows up 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.840
 robinson is me 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.610
 but she does not have to be surprised 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.620
 when in such jeans on the street 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.820
 He walks around the office 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.200
 for a suitable skirt around her 8 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.210
 Do you already have a suitable one ? 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.890
 room not seen yet but if you 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.590
 continue on these hideous jeans 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.460
 then I can walk around for nothing 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:04.940
 guaranteed a bully good i promise 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:08.210

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.910

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.650

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.090

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.640

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.770

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.480
 that was a crazy one can get one 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.940
 ring pull by the nose and a 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.980
 white beer falls one would be one 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.930
 insane at a house in the air 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.880

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.800

 So no more you like me you 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:38.420
 I like in a fur coat in evening dress 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.310
 and bikini in pajamas but not engines 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.320
 Every modern person seemed to like it 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.630
 I like them so well liked in me 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.400
 she no longer wears you so I'm so 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.280
 warm for you is not ugly 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.620
 but you fit in jeans like one like one 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.620
 melon in an apple weighing bowl 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.040
 a melon the word if you tell me that 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.960
 not back 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.060
 he left the house that was only 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.140
 a small comparison so well I take 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.640
 gone back to mum but i have 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.490

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.080
 a reconciliation course 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:23.300
 Now, hopefully, you'll see that I am 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:25.700
 right you will not be back at one 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.920
 trifle such cracking break from the fence 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.310
 I can not help it here 

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:34.760
 it was anyway because you said I am 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:37.430

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:44.290

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:44.290
 that is that it is mobile
