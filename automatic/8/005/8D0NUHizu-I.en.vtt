00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.130
 the teaching of art has undergone a 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.230
 transformation in the history of 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.360
 1996 the discipline of art becomes 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.600
 compulsory in basic education 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.029
 artistic education classes a lesson that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.430
 you can spend a good time but also 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.130
 you can expand your creativity to 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.859
 goes far beyond simply 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.510
 free drawing art education class 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.420
 It's the class where students will learn 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.610
 everything related to art and apple is very 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.670
 important precisely because of this 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.469
 because it brings things from the everyday of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.649
 more related to art for students 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.219
 in the field of education is not from school and 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.620
 of general education this arts discipline 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.010
 it does not have the role of training artists 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.260
 or identify those children who are 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.120
 more endowed with the arts 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.100
 the idea is easy to train are people who 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.989
 have the ability to understand this 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.670
 knowledge in a general way already 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.630
 begins to see everything in a different way 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.630
 everything is nature everything you see that is 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.900
 different the dance I as I started to 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.240
 follow songs and see that everything is art 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.400
 I believe that the teaching of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.439
 art has been important since childhood. 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.900
 how the law governs and how they should be 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.570
 produced art classes with the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.770
 of these teachers is still a way to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.990
 go through 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 then a general art teacher at the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.890
 early childhood education 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.860
 nursery school and the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.780
 elementary school 1 to the sixth year he 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.689
 is the regent teacher so he can be 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.729
 trained in pedagogy then he is not a 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.380
 specialist he gives all disciplines 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.350
 and also arts Friday right in the series 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.140
 after-school average this is already done 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.729
 by experts it is necessary is law 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.040
 and then the teacher has to have 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.990
 bachelor of arts in one of the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.149
 languages ​​he is going to work I am 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.909
 degree in visual arts and we as 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.429
 teachers try to find new 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.190
 content in the training process. 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.360
 teacher must have the knowledge of the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.730
 language 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.830
 tion of the teaching processes of this 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.410
 language would be very important as well. 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.630
 that the art taught at school has the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.460
 to see with children's lives right now 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.590
 I was walking on the street, I was not much 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.200
 attention to things but now lends 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.730
 attention in graphite drawings 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.900
 mainly teacher training 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.400
 of art 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.740
 she's still a little thing resolved 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.590
 point of view of a national policy 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.620
 how do you say it and say what it is 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.180
 necessary for schools 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.340
 In the old days we 'll have to be 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.140
 polyvalent and today is also not very 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.540
 different because we have what it is 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.690
 working within the four languages ​​of 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.310
 art that is theater is the visual art 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.470
 music and dance 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.020
 but the teacher is actually formed with 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.590
 all this he usually formed in 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.810
 visual arts or in dance the theater is 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.760
 impossible for a person to have all this 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.260
 training in all languages 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.780
 artistic 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.390
 then the government has given the text that 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.790
 are technical guidelines for 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.530
 teachers of the state so that they 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.190
 can contemplate this content that they 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.019
 there is not 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.239
 We have many schools that make a 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.630
 good work both private and 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.120
 public this can not be generalized 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.940
 but it has to be criticized for 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.220
 there is an improvement in the teaching of art in the 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.320
 country through the arts classes I 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.970
 I learned graphite and it was a way of 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.700
 express what I feel 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.440
 was a way of expressing what 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.120
 I want for me is rewarding is when 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.730
 you see that the student who was shot from 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.000
 childhood and he did not draw it 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.070
 to draw and to graphite for example 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.280
 For me, art today is part of the 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.280
 my life
