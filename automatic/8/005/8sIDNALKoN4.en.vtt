the<00:00:19.710> assembly<00:00:19.980> which<00:00:20.279> was<00:00:20.460> very<00:00:20.609> easy<00:00:20.939> we<00:00:21.539> have

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
the assembly which was very easy we have

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.220 
the assembly which was very easy we have
this<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.500> channel<00:00:22.920> 2.4<00:00:23.670> g<00:00:23.850> radio<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.539> first

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
this for channel 2.4 g radio so first

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.500 
this for channel 2.4 g radio so first
thing<00:00:25.410> first<00:00:25.640> insert<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.670> battery<00:00:27.830> ok<00:00:29.510> take

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
thing first insert the battery ok take

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.250 
thing first insert the battery ok take
the<00:00:31.130> all<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:32.309> as<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.390> see<00:00:33.660> battery

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the all right as you can see battery

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.479 
the all right as you can see battery
fits<00:00:34.590> perfectly<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.489> there<00:00:36.079> now<00:00:37.489> before

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
fits perfectly in there now before

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.910 
fits perfectly in there now before
connecting<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.390> battery<00:00:39.809> turn<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.800> radio

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
connecting the battery turn on the radio

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.940 
connecting the battery turn on the radio
make<00:00:41.460> sure<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.690> trim<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.379> throttle<00:00:43.770> is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
make sure the trim for the throttle is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.369 
make sure the trim for the throttle is
totally<00:00:44.399> zero<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.000> all<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> other<00:00:45.870> trends

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
totally zero and all the other trends

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.200 
totally zero and all the other trends
are<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.160> send<00:00:47.460> again<00:00:47.960> after<00:00:48.960> turning<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.379> that

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
are to send again after turning on that

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.250 
are to send again after turning on that
just<00:00:51.210> connect<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:56.149> ok<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.660> beeps<00:00:57.870> are<00:00:58.079> good

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
just connect it ok the beeps are good

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.340 
just connect it ok the beeps are good
now<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.559> pre-flight<00:00:59.129> check<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.960> let<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.109> tail

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
now the pre-flight check is let the tail

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.660 
now the pre-flight check is let the tail
face<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.719> check<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> elevator<00:01:04.670> putting

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
face you and check the elevator putting

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.679 
face you and check the elevator putting
down<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.570> should<00:01:06.960> smooth<00:01:07.409> up<00:01:07.710> ok<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.880> they're

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
down it should smooth up ok and they're

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.780 
down it should smooth up ok and they're
up<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.439> should<00:01:10.650> move<00:01:10.799> down<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.250> means<00:01:11.520> our

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
up it should move down this means our

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
up it should move down this means our
elevator<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.630> reverses<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.350> I'll

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
elevator is not reverses right I'll

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.200 
elevator is not reverses right I'll
check<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> ailerons<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.580> channel<00:01:17.580> one<00:01:17.790> if

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
check the ailerons on the channel one if

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.740 
check the ailerons on the channel one if
i<00:01:18.390> press<00:01:18.659> left<00:01:19.369> my<00:01:20.369> left<00:01:20.610> aileron<00:01:20.880> should<00:01:21.540> rise

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
i press left my left aileron should rise

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.130 
i press left my left aileron should rise
up<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.580> i<00:01:23.700> press<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.720> right<00:01:24.900> eller

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
up and if i press right my right eller

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.929 
up and if i press right my right eller
on<00:01:25.320> should<00:01:25.560> rise<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.909> means

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
on should rise up so that means

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.780 
on should rise up so that means
al-ahram's<00:01:27.900> are<00:01:28.110> set<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.470> well<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:29.310> looks
