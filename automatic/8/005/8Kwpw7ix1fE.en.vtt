that fur out the way all I want to see

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.370 
that fur out the way all I want to see
is<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.799> backing<00:02:59.190> fabric<00:02:59.870> now<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.930> can<00:03:01.080> start

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
is the backing fabric now you can start

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.920 
is the backing fabric now you can start
it<00:03:01.560> by<00:03:01.709> hand

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
it by hand

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.280 
it by hand
backwards<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.250> then<00:03:04.700> slowly<00:03:05.239> start<00:03:05.540> making

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
backwards and then slowly start making

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.660 
backwards and then slowly start making
your<00:03:06.439> way<00:03:06.500> along<00:03:08.500> squeezing<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.709> underneath

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
your way along squeezing it underneath

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.289 
your way along squeezing it underneath
that<00:03:11.090> foot<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.340> then<00:03:13.340> eventually<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:14.150> will

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
that foot and then eventually you will

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:21.449 
that foot and then eventually you will
just<00:03:14.510> end<00:03:14.659> up<00:03:15.079> with<00:03:15.230> this<00:03:15.379> sort<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.739> spine

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:29.020 

running<00:03:22.459> down<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:25.069> tail<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.680> look<00:03:28.010> look<00:03:28.879> at

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
running down the tail so look look at

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.649 
running down the tail so look look at
what<00:03:29.180> we<00:03:29.299> end<00:03:29.450> up<00:03:29.659> with<00:03:29.719> and<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.920> seemed<00:03:31.659> kind

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
what we end up with and that seemed kind

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.009 
what we end up with and that seemed kind
of<00:03:32.750> looks<00:03:32.989> like<00:03:33.049> a<00:03:33.200> spine<00:03:33.769> looks<00:03:34.219> like<00:03:34.370> a

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
of looks like a spine looks like a

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.990 
of looks like a spine looks like a
realistic<00:03:36.019> spine<00:03:36.409> in<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.709> fur<00:03:36.950> it's<00:03:37.790> right

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
realistic spine in the fur it's right

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.030 
realistic spine in the fur it's right

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
I'm making a teeny-weeny little hole

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.740 
I'm making a teeny-weeny little hole
hopefully<00:03:40.370> with<00:03:40.849> my<00:03:41.000> normal<00:03:41.389> scissors

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
hopefully with my normal scissors

hopefully with my normal scissors
somewhere<00:03:42.739> in<00:03:42.919> here<00:03:43.840> just<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.019> sort<00:03:45.200> of<00:03:45.319> stop

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
somewhere in here just to sort of stop

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.610 
somewhere in here just to sort of stop
start<00:03:46.459> it<00:03:46.609> off<00:03:46.849> so<00:03:47.599> I<00:03:47.629> think<00:03:47.719> I'm<00:03:48.049> through<00:03:48.379> and

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
start it off so I think I'm through and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.530 
start it off so I think I'm through and
then<00:03:49.129> I'm<00:03:49.250> going<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.459> get<00:03:49.639> the<00:03:49.790> keyring<00:03:50.269> and

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
then I'm going to get the keyring and

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.170 
then I'm going to get the keyring and
I'm<00:03:51.019> going<00:03:51.169> to<00:03:51.230> push<00:03:51.469> it<00:03:51.579> push<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.760> metal<00:03:53.090> of

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
I'm going to push it push the metal of

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.640 
I'm going to push it push the metal of
the<00:03:53.239> keyring<00:03:53.750> through<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.889> first<00:03:56.230> bit<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.260> fur

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
the keyring through the first bit of fur

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.699 
the keyring through the first bit of fur
and<00:03:58.069> then<00:03:58.879> I'll<00:03:59.000> push<00:03:59.209> it<00:03:59.239> through<00:03:59.629> on<00:04:00.079> the

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
and then I'll push it through on the

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.399 
and then I'll push it through on the
other<00:04:00.889> side<00:04:01.219> as<00:04:01.430> well<00:04:01.659> it<00:04:02.659> is<00:04:02.719> a<00:04:02.870> little<00:04:03.109> bit<00:04:03.319> of

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
other side as well it is a little bit of

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.979 
other side as well it is a little bit of
a<00:04:03.469> struggle<00:04:03.709> but<00:04:03.950> look<00:04:04.310> I'm<00:04:04.730> in<00:04:04.969> now<00:04:05.750> what

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
a struggle but look I'm in now what

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.629 
a struggle but look I'm in now what
sometimes<00:04:06.200> happens<00:04:06.469> is<00:04:06.859> that<00:04:06.979> this<00:04:07.129> opens<00:04:07.519> up

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
sometimes happens is that this opens up

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.069 
sometimes happens is that this opens up
too<00:04:07.879> much<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.299> we<00:04:08.359> don't<00:04:08.389> want<00:04:08.629> this<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.930> fall

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
too much and we don't want this to fall

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.860 
too much and we don't want this to fall
off<00:04:09.319> so<00:04:09.889> just<00:04:09.919> really<00:04:10.370> try<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:10.970> squeeze<00:04:11.449> it

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
off so just really try and squeeze it

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.759 
off so just really try and squeeze it
back<00:04:12.739> into<00:04:13.220> shape<00:04:13.459> again<00:04:14.169> so<00:04:15.169> that<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.560> whole

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
back into shape again so that the whole

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.020 
back into shape again so that the whole
thing<00:04:16.659> doesn't<00:04:17.659> come<00:04:17.900> off<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:19.400> look<00:04:19.609> at<00:04:19.789> that

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
thing doesn't come off but look at that

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.589 
thing doesn't come off but look at that
that<00:04:20.840> is<00:04:21.079> just<00:04:21.109> brilliant<00:04:21.849> so<00:04:22.849> rather<00:04:23.120> than

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
that is just brilliant so rather than

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.600 
that is just brilliant so rather than
spending<00:04:24.260> because<00:04:24.500> I've<00:04:24.710> actually<00:04:25.010> seen

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
spending because I've actually seen

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.950 
spending because I've actually seen
these<00:04:26.180> Fox<00:04:26.960> tails<00:04:27.380> for<00:04:28.310> 20<00:04:28.940> pounds<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:29.780> they

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
these Fox tails for 20 pounds and they

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.370 
these Fox tails for 20 pounds and they
are<00:04:30.169> fake<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:31.039> we<00:04:31.490> just<00:04:31.759> made<00:04:31.940> ours<00:04:32.509> just<00:04:33.139> out

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
are fake and we just made ours just out

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.740 
are fake and we just made ours just out
of<00:04:33.409> a<00:04:33.590> load<00:04:33.770> of<00:04:33.919> scraps<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.820> do<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:35.449> know<00:04:35.570> what
