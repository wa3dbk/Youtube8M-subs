and then the rest of this is quite easy

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
and then the rest of this is quite easy
because<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.500> half<00:01:04.739> ounce<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.129> pine<00:01:05.400> like

balance this all out and because this is

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.010 
balance this all out and because this is
being<00:01:28.040> poured<00:01:28.190> on<00:01:28.340> crushed<00:01:28.640> ice<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:29.150> found<00:01:29.840> that

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
being poured on crushed ice I found that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.170 
being poured on crushed ice I found that
you<00:01:30.200> have<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.500> watch<00:01:30.620> your<00:01:30.680> balance<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.520> little

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
you have to watch your balance a little

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.100 
you have to watch your balance a little
it's<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.360> little<00:01:32.390> bit<00:01:32.630> different<00:01:32.870> than<00:01:32.960> when

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
it's a little bit different than when

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.170 
it's a little bit different than when
doing<00:01:33.290> a<00:01:33.350> normal<00:01:33.440> cocktail<00:01:33.950> crushed<00:01:34.250> ice<00:01:34.460> it

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
doing a normal cocktail crushed ice it

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.210 
doing a normal cocktail crushed ice it
tends<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.570> elongate<00:01:35.960> your<00:01:36.230> cocktail<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.100> you

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
tends to elongate your cocktail and you

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.370 
tends to elongate your cocktail and you
tend<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.520> need<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.910> sweeten<00:01:38.810> your<00:01:38.990> cocktail<00:01:39.350> a

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
tend to need to sweeten your cocktail a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.570 
tend to need to sweeten your cocktail a
little<00:01:39.740> bit<00:01:39.830> more<00:01:39.980> than<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:40.220> normally<00:01:40.340> would

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
little bit more than you normally would

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.040 
little bit more than you normally would
so<00:01:40.940> we're<00:01:41.030> going<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.210> add<00:01:41.300> a<00:01:41.330> half<00:01:41.660> ounce<00:01:41.840> of

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
simple syrup here as well if it wasn't

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.020 
simple syrup here as well if it wasn't
on<00:01:48.080> crushed<00:01:48.350> ice<00:01:48.530> it'd<00:01:48.920> be<00:01:49.760> a<00:01:49.790> beautiful

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
on crushed ice it'd be a beautiful

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.790 
on crushed ice it'd be a beautiful
cocktail<00:01:50.330> but<00:01:50.930> because<00:01:51.170> it's<00:01:51.290> on<00:01:51.380> crushed<00:01:51.620> ice

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.230 
cocktail but because it's on crushed ice
it's<00:01:51.950> going<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.130> feel<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.280> little<00:01:52.460> thin<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:53.120> a
