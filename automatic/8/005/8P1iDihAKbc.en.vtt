00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.060
 recording mateo experiments in 321 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.000
 starts 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.600
 today we are going to show the procedure and 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.040
 all about doing experiments at home the 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.380
 first experiment that I bring you is 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.740
 how to make cold fire good the 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.570
 materials are 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.570
 a cotton thread 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.010
 something to be strong 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.770
 and a little alcohol in a jar 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.850
 antiseptic alcohol 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.350
 the first thing is to take the cotton ball and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.350
 roll it with cotton thread 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.580
 ok after we have our 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.320
 cotton ball what we are going to do is 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.680
 wet it in a little alcohol 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.680
 antiseptic 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.190
 we soak it well 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.190
 and we eliminate the excess 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.390
 and now we proceed to learn it 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.729
 the fire is not cold what happens is that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.150
 there are three kinds of yellow green fire 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.460
 and blue the blue is the least cream is 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.290
 the least hot so that's why 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.290
 one can maneuver easily 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.690
 without having without suffering severe burns 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.770
 there they have our first experiment
