the<00:04:28.670> down<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.360> downfall<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:33.100> is<00:04:34.100> going<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.090> be

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
the down the downfall is is going to be

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.800 
the down the downfall is is going to be
like<00:04:35.420> I<00:04:35.660> think<00:04:36.020> whether<00:04:36.260> or<00:04:39.880> maybe<00:04:40.880> not<00:04:41.180> but<00:04:41.750> I

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
like I think whether or maybe not but I

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.180 
like I think whether or maybe not but I
know<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.050> can<00:04:42.140> do<00:04:42.230> like<00:04:42.380> basic<00:04:42.770> stuff<00:04:43.010> like

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
know you can do like basic stuff like

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.950

you<00:04:43.280> can<00:04:43.430> set<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.790> time<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:46.660> some<00:04:47.660> crazy

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
you can set the time to some crazy

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.450 
you can set the time to some crazy
number<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:48.770> oh<00:04:52.180> maybe<00:04:53.180> not<00:04:53.560> okay<00:04:54.560> but<00:04:55.250> as<00:04:55.340> you

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460
