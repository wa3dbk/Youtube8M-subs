with a little tutorial not showing
exactly<00:00:37.020> how<00:00:37.199> I<00:00:37.350> build<00:00:37.680> them<00:00:37.859> just<00:00:38.219> explain

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
exactly how I build them just explain

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.810 
exactly how I build them just explain
how<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:38.940> work<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:40.399> while<00:00:41.399> I'm<00:00:41.489> ringing<00:00:41.760> out

basically<00:00:45.480> showing<00:00:45.750> how<00:00:45.930> they<00:00:46.050> work<00:00:46.199> in<00:00:46.410> dirt

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
basically showing how they work in dirt

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
basically showing how they work in dirt
this<00:00:47.370> one's<00:00:47.579> called<00:00:47.699> the<00:00:47.820> Minecraft<00:00:48.269> eggs

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
this one's called the Minecraft eggs

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.849 
this one's called the Minecraft eggs
mine<00:00:49.019> mine<00:00:49.440> cart<00:00:49.859> accelerator<00:00:53.089> and<00:00:54.739> that<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
mine mine cart accelerator and that is

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
mine mine cart accelerator and that is
how<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.039> works<00:00:58.609> basically<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.510> need<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.899> mine

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
how it works basically you need to mine

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.229 
how it works basically you need to mine
cart<00:01:01.350> tracks<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.920> make<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.280> oh<00:01:02.550> how<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> works

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
cart tracks to make this oh how it works

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.590 
cart tracks to make this oh how it works
the<00:01:03.899> two<00:01:04.080> mine<00:01:04.260> cart<00:01:05.000> tracks<00:01:06.000> clip<00:01:06.390> together

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the two mine cart tracks clip together

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.800 
the two mine cart tracks clip together
so<00:01:07.110> they're<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.740> stuck<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.810> they

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
so they're like stuck and they

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.950 
so they're like stuck and they
constantly<00:01:10.680> push<00:01:10.979> each<00:01:11.189> other<00:01:11.430> forward

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
constantly push each other forward

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.039 
constantly push each other forward
launching<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.020> up<00:01:13.640> dark<00:01:14.640> um<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.810> need<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
launching you up dark um you need to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
launching you up dark um you need to
build<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.409> main<00:01:16.650> track<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.729> right

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
build a main track like this all right

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.090 
build a main track like this all right
okay<00:01:18.899> i'm<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> piece<00:01:19.200> walking<00:01:19.530> keep<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.829> okay

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
okay i'm a piece walking keep going okay

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.050 
okay i'm a piece walking keep going okay
you<00:01:20.579> build<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.970> main<00:01:21.210> track<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
you build a main track like this and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.460 
you build a main track like this and
then<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.210> need<00:01:24.360> build<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.630> secondary<00:01:24.930> track<00:01:25.229> do

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
then you need build a secondary track do

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.249 
then you need build a secondary track do
this<00:01:25.649> one<00:01:25.829> first<00:01:26.040> why<00:01:26.909> because<00:01:27.659> these<00:01:27.930> are

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
this one first why because these are

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289 
this one first why because these are
these<00:01:28.710> parts<00:01:29.130> these<00:01:29.369> tracks<00:01:29.880> right<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
these parts these tracks right here it

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
these parts these tracks right here it
will<00:01:30.360> start<00:01:30.570> turning<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.799> will<00:01:31.950> make<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
will start turning and it will make a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.429 
will start turning and it will make a
big<00:01:32.310> loop<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.299> kind<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.229> don't<00:01:34.560> want<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
big loop and you kind of don't want that

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.209 
big loop and you kind of don't want that
and<00:01:37.939> how<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.149> is<00:01:39.270> useful<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:40.500> quicker<00:01:40.920> than

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
and how this is useful it's quicker than

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.660 
and how this is useful it's quicker than
coal<00:01:42.170> hobbits<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.350> allow<00:01:44.070> us<00:01:44.219> to<00:01:44.310> go<00:01:44.399> uphill

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
coal hobbits it allow us to go uphill

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.679 
coal hobbits it allow us to go uphill
it's<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.570> glitch<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.140> may<00:01:46.320> soon<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.770> fixed

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
it's a glitch so it may soon be fixed

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.080 
it's a glitch so it may soon be fixed
this<00:01:48.689> minecart<00:01:49.289> could<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> chest<00:01:50.610> minecart

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
this minecart could be a chest minecart

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
this minecart could be a chest minecart
so<00:01:51.299> he<00:01:51.390> could<00:01:51.539> carry<00:01:51.780> items<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> kind

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
so he could carry items with you I kind

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.560 
so he could carry items with you I kind
of<00:01:52.950> had<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> kind<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.180> on

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
of had a kind of you know I on

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.240 
of had a kind of you know I on

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
stuff yeah the second time this counter

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.860 
stuff yeah the second time this counter
is<00:02:10.289> perfect<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:10.890> now<00:02:11.090> Mike<00:02:12.090> was<00:02:12.330> recording
