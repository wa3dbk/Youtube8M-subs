00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello everyone with you computer science now 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 I'll tell you one secret way 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.670
 translating numbers to binary system and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.160
 back by the way this way I overlooked 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.039
 my student so that artem hand over your 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.230
 secrets and as we usually translate 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.250
 number binary system we take some 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.730
 number for example is 72 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.869
 and start dividing it by 2 next 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.260
 it turns out that these are nonsense guilt but 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.840
 this is all the last century we do not think so 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.760
 we will if you give up the game and you do not 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:46.410
 clinical idiot then you must pass 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 the next 2 is 2 in 1 4 2 squared 8 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:55.910
 this is 2 in 3 16 this is 2 4 32 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.600
 it's 2 in 5 64 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.699
 this is 2 in the sixth and so on besides 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.909
 for example, this number will be equal to 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:12.659
 binary system units and 6 0 ohms because 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:15.000
 that here we have 6 degree binary the same 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.920
 same thing with the rest of the numbers for example 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.299
 two to the third is one and 30 and now 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.299
 let's take a number well for example 70 and 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:34.350
 try to translate it into binary 70 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:36.329
 it's 64 plus 4 plus 2 that is, i made from 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.869
 this number is the sum of these numbers here 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:44.220
 picked up and so 2 is 2 in 1 that is 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:47.060
 unit and 104 is 2 squared that is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.060
 units and 2 0 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:59.880
 64 is 2 6 that is one and six zeros 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:03.750
 that is, 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 1 it turns out that 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.430
 here we have a plus plus and it turns out we 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.000
 here it is now removed here it is now removed 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:18.530
 1 2 3 4 1 1 remains 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.250
 70 in decimal is 1000 1100 binary 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:29.209
 take another number 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:30.600
 let it be the number 149 149 this is 128 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:38.280
 plus 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:44.459
 16 + 4 + 1 turns out here 1 unit 4 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.430
 this is 2 squared that is 10 116 this is 2 in 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.420
 fourth one ie 10101 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:58.170
 and 128 is 2 in the seventh that is 1 2 3 4 5 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:02.840
 6 7 1 that is, it turns out that 149 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.970
 this is 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 from binary 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.120
 see i spent on translation about not 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.790
 I know 30 seconds now let's try 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.660
 translate binary decimal 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.290
 take what number to him well, for example 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.620
 such a 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:22.530
 and 0 1 0 1 1 0 let it be so 10 this 2 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:28.410
 in 1 that is 2100 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:33.959
 this is 2 squared that is, 410000 this is 2 in 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:37.880
 the fourth, that is, 16 1000000, that is, times 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:42.019
 two three 4 5 six is 64 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:47.209
 that is 64 plus 16 by four plus two 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.209
 It turns out here we have 88 486 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.570
 so here is a simple translation method 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.160
 numbers binary system and back with you 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.690
 was informatics subscribe to the channel 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.900
 put the likes join this group 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.900
 bye everyone
