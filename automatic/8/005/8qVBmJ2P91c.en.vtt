hello subscribers ah both of you hmm the
science<00:00:06.569> fair<00:00:06.779> approaches<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.799> I've<00:00:08.189> got

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
science fair approaches and I've got

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.490 
science fair approaches and I've got
more<00:00:08.460> updates<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.059> just<00:00:09.719> started<00:00:09.960> work<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
more updates I just started work on the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.230 
more updates I just started work on the
third<00:00:10.650> revision<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.160> GT<00:00:11.519> project<00:00:11.730> and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
third revision of the GT project and

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.970 
third revision of the GT project and
while<00:00:12.570> i'm<00:00:12.750> tinkering<00:00:12.960> i<00:00:13.320> sliced<00:00:13.559> my<00:00:13.620> arm<00:00:13.710> us

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
while i'm tinkering i sliced my arm us

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.320 
while i'm tinkering i sliced my arm us
of<00:00:14.070> sheet<00:00:14.250> metal<00:00:14.370> not<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> big<00:00:14.820> cut<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.179> barely

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
of sheet metal not a big cut it barely

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.300 
of sheet metal not a big cut it barely
goes<00:00:15.540> like<00:00:15.750> halfway<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.440> bone<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.800> it

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
goes like halfway to the bone and it

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.010 
goes like halfway to the bone and it
occurs<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.609> me<00:00:17.850> i<00:00:17.970> could<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.330> jet<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> lewd

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
occurs to me i could just jet the lewd

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.300 
occurs to me i could just jet the lewd
with<00:00:19.199> an<00:00:19.289> insta<00:00:19.590> health<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.920> get<00:00:20.010> back<00:00:20.160> to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
with an insta health and get back to

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.470 
with an insta health and get back to

could<00:00:25.949> never<00:00:26.220> figure<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.730> good<00:00:26.910> method<00:00:27.119> to

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
could never figure out a good method to

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.240 
could never figure out a good method to
quick<00:00:27.720> summon<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> dt<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:28.560> as<00:00:28.710> blood<00:00:29.010> began

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
quick summon the dt but as blood began

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.040 
quick summon the dt but as blood began
to<00:00:29.400> spurt<00:00:29.760> from<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.060> gash<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.420> my<00:00:30.480> forearm<00:00:30.810> i

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
to spurt from the gash on my forearm i

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.400 
to spurt from the gash on my forearm i
realized<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.340> cybernetic<00:00:33.239> room<00:00:33.450> i<00:00:33.690> can

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
realized it a cybernetic room i can

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.830 
realized it a cybernetic room i can
program<00:00:35.040> all<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.280> DTS<00:00:35.760> digits<00:00:36.120> trip<00:00:36.270> data<00:00:36.510> into

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
program all of DTS digits trip data into

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.840 
program all of DTS digits trip data into
one<00:00:36.870> robotic<00:00:37.469> arm<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:38.160> use<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.340> to

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
one robotic arm and then use that to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.750 
one robotic arm and then use that to
summon<00:00:39.239> dt<00:00:39.540> at<00:00:39.690> any<00:00:39.870> time<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.410> place<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.730> i

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
summon dt at any time a place so i

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.910 
summon dt at any time a place so i
figure<00:00:42.059> look<00:00:42.690> back<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.200> slice<00:00:43.559> off<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
figure look back and I slice off the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.470 
figure look back and I slice off the
resume<00:00:44.190> armed<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> particle<00:00:45.120> stop<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
resume armed with a particle stop and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.350 
resume armed with a particle stop and
then<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:45.840> dads<00:00:46.020> are<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.200> Bob<00:00:46.530> oh<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.730> bloods

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
then my dads are like Bob oh and bloods

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.819 
then my dads are like Bob oh and bloods
like<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.840> everywhere<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> few<00:00:49.500> hours<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
like going everywhere but a few hours a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.279 
like going everywhere but a few hours a
few<00:00:50.039> pints<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.370> blood<00:00:50.460> later<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.030> built<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.899> metal

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
few pints of blood later I built a metal

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
few pints of blood later I built a metal
arm<00:00:52.530> strong<00:00:52.920> enough<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.309> smash<00:00:53.550> concrete<00:00:54.180> ah

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
arm strong enough to smash concrete ah

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.270 
arm strong enough to smash concrete ah
yes<00:00:56.309> soul<00:00:57.090> mate<00:00:57.360> oh<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.320> i'm<00:00:58.710> trying<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> do

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
yes soul mate oh and i'm trying to do

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.279 
yes soul mate oh and i'm trying to do
double<00:00:59.609> ones<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.940> my<00:01:00.059> robot<00:01:00.329> arm<00:01:00.750> right<00:01:01.140> now

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
double ones with my robot arm right now

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.470 
double ones with my robot arm right now
but<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:02.010> not<00:01:02.129> really<00:01:02.309> working<00:01:02.430> cuz<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
but it's not really working cuz it the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.810 
but it's not really working cuz it the
fingers<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> okay<00:01:04.530> whatever<00:01:04.949> point<00:01:05.580> is
