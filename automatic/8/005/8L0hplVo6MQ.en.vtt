00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.069 
disappointing I thought it was a very
tough<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.630> fight<00:00:33.930> by<00:00:34.170> alfredo<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.840> it's<00:00:36.840> very

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
tough to fight by alfredo and it's very

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.049 
tough to fight by alfredo and it's very
tough<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.320> me<00:00:37.649> also<00:00:39.379> to<00:00:40.379> witness<00:00:41.129> him<00:00:41.790> being

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
tough for me also to witness him being

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
tough for me also to witness him being
in<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> fight<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.469> really

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
in a fight like that because I really

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.270 
in a fight like that because I really
care<00:00:44.399> about<00:00:44.430> him<00:00:44.760> as<00:00:44.910> an<00:00:45.090> individual<00:00:45.980> as<00:00:46.980> far

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
care about him as an individual as far

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580 
care about him as an individual as far
as<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> stoppage<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.090> concerned<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.899> am

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
as the stoppage is concerned I am

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950 
as the stoppage is concerned I am
somewhat<00:00:50.579> disappointed<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> reason<00:00:51.809> why

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
somewhat disappointed and the reason why

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.240 
somewhat disappointed and the reason why
is<00:00:51.989> because<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:53.480> informed<00:00:54.480> Tony<00:00:55.039> after<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
is because I informed Tony after the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.700 
is because I informed Tony after the
ninth<00:00:56.699> round<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.149> believe<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.930> Canelo

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
ninth round I believe that if Canelo

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.279 
ninth round I believe that if Canelo
landed<00:00:59.309> two<00:00:59.820> or<00:01:00.239> three<00:01:00.660> punches<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
landed two or three punches in a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.429 
landed two or three punches in a
combination<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:03.180> personally<00:01:03.719> would<00:01:04.199> stop

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
combination that I personally would stop

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.010 
combination that I personally would stop
the<00:01:04.619> fight<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.939> Florida<00:01:06.360> doctor<00:01:06.810> also

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the fight and I in Florida doctor also

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.740 
the fight and I in Florida doctor also
that<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:07.950> he<00:01:08.070> put<00:01:08.310> two<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.090> three<00:01:09.299> punches

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
that if he put two to three punches

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.390 
that if he put two to three punches
together<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.310> would<00:01:11.580> stop<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.030> fight

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
together on that I would stop the fight

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.219 
together on that I would stop the fight
because<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> felt<00:01:14.820> at<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.000> time<00:01:15.150> even<00:01:15.960> though

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
because I felt at that time even though

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350 
because I felt at that time even though
the<00:01:16.409> young<00:01:16.560> man<00:01:16.830> was<00:01:16.860> showing<00:01:17.580> his<00:01:17.759> skill<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the young man was showing his skill I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.630 
the young man was showing his skill I
felt<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.960> his<00:01:19.710> hands<00:01:20.040> were<00:01:20.189> starting<00:01:20.610> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
felt that his hands were starting to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.320 
felt that his hands were starting to
come<00:01:20.880> down<00:01:21.770> he<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.369> his<00:01:23.430> back<00:01:23.820> foot<00:01:24.090> at<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
come down he was on his back foot at the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.880 
come down he was on his back foot at the
time<00:01:24.619> he<00:01:25.670> he<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.330> know<00:01:27.720> starting<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> put

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
time he he was you know starting to put

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.609 
time he he was you know starting to put
himself<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.520> position<00:01:29.549> where<00:01:30.380> he<00:01:31.380> gave

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
himself in a position where he gave

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.679 
himself in a position where he gave
Alfredo<00:01:32.189> an<00:01:32.340> opportunity<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.270> basically

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
Alfredo an opportunity and basically

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.410 
Alfredo an opportunity and basically
that's

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
that's

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.109 
that's
needed<00:01:34.689> we<00:01:34.810> need<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.020> window<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.500> opportunity

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
needed we need a window of opportunity

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.020 
needed we need a window of opportunity
so<00:01:37.119> we<00:01:37.360> didn't<00:01:37.600> want<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.840> deny<00:01:37.960> him<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.850> it

so we didn't want to deny him that so it

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.840 
so we didn't want to deny him that so it
is<00:01:40.060> somewhat<00:01:40.630> disappointing<00:01:41.409> that<00:01:42.070> he<00:01:42.490> didn't

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
is somewhat disappointing that he didn't

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.780 
is somewhat disappointing that he didn't
get<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.149> opportunity<00:01:43.240> but<00:01:44.140> my<00:01:45.070> hat<00:01:45.310> goes<00:01:45.549> off
