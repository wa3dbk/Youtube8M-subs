looks like you can't actually get on any
of<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.030> pods<00:03:00.239> that's<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.569> bit<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:00.750> a

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
of the pods that's a bit of a

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.449 
of the pods that's a bit of a
disappointment<00:03:01.049> seeing<00:03:01.590> as<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.769> was<00:03:01.919> hyped<00:03:02.250> up

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
disappointment seeing as it was hyped up

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.729 
disappointment seeing as it was hyped up
so<00:03:02.669> much<00:03:02.849> but<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.180> other<00:03:03.299> thing<00:03:03.480> he<00:03:03.599> said<00:03:03.870> as

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
so much but the other thing he said as

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.379 
so much but the other thing he said as
you<00:03:04.980> may<00:03:05.130> see<00:03:05.190> from<00:03:05.639> the<00:03:05.760> gameplay<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.299> I

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
you may see from the gameplay that I

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.050 
you may see from the gameplay that I
will<00:03:06.540> expertly<00:03:06.870> cut<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.440> here<00:03:07.739> is<00:03:08.669> that<00:03:08.940> you

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
will expertly cut in here is that you

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.080 
will expertly cut in here is that you
can<00:03:09.209> jump<00:03:09.450> from<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> pod<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.709> pod<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.970> is

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
can jump from a pod to pod and that is

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.309 
can jump from a pod to pod and that is
one<00:03:12.269> of<00:03:12.299> his<00:03:12.389> favorite<00:03:12.750> things<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.169> we're

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
one of his favorite things so we're

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.629 
one of his favorite things so we're
going<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.500> look<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.680> two<00:03:14.099> pods<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.579> are

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
going to look for two pods that are

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:21.750 
going to look for two pods that are
close<00:03:15.120> enough<00:03:15.150> together<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:17.239> jump<00:03:18.239> between

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.410 

none<00:03:22.760> here<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:24.370> that's<00:03:25.370> pretty<00:03:25.670> big<00:03:25.910> jump<00:03:26.210> from

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
none here I that's pretty big jump from

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.090 
none here I that's pretty big jump from
those<00:03:26.630> two<00:03:27.370> so<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.400> guess<00:03:29.560> well<00:03:30.560> that's<00:03:30.800> that's

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
those two so I guess well that's that's

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.590 
those two so I guess well that's that's
one<00:03:33.340> still<00:03:34.340> gonna<00:03:34.460> be<00:03:34.550> a<00:03:34.610> pretty<00:03:34.820> big<00:03:35.060> jump<00:03:35.360> all

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
one still gonna be a pretty big jump all

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.350 
one still gonna be a pretty big jump all
the<00:03:35.630> way<00:03:35.780> over<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:37.000> this<00:03:38.000> one<00:03:38.300> here<00:03:40.120> see<00:03:41.120> we<00:03:41.270> can

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
the way over to this one here see we can

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.580 
the way over to this one here see we can
make<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.540> jump<00:03:41.870> well<00:03:42.050> go<00:03:42.140> we'll<00:03:42.320> go<00:03:42.410> for<00:03:42.530> the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590
