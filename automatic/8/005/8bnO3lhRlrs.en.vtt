00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:20.890
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:22.570
 not last spring challenge 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.010
 we have a week and be sad 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.110
 then it goes on again 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.000
 girl blabla videos I'm glad 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.100
 but already on it today are 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.439
 go again to healthy recipes and 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.270
 Although I thought it would be now 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.760
 gave ideas, breakfast, and we have 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.809
 but we have had ideas 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.640
 we're somehow about that 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.690
 main reasons I have a little bit 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.460
 I think about what lately 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.109
 I tried what I liked 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.210
 have something that would be interesting for somehow 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.800
 you and have two ideas for today 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.389
 main gangs for you that you on each 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.739
 case should try because I was 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:55.989
 very surprised the food is delicious 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.879
 Let's go with a tomato and salad 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:03.659
 I have tried along with lena 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:06.190
 and for that we need cucumber parsley 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.439
 tomatoes one to two teaspoons 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.869
 Lemon juice and not like us here 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:15.280
 Half a lemon that 's definitely too much 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.259
 then mint or onions and two to 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.789
 three teaspoons of olive oil and so on 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.109
 No big magic happens 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.450
 Just have everything in one bowl 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:25.109
 together and it shows already really 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.109
 good or 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:02:15.880
 ok and now the taste come firmly 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.040
 the second recipe the lighter and 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.790
 I have tried and that to two 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.160
 parcel 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.050
 for that we need to go and do something 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.750
 for the filling we have for today 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.720
 broccoli mince onions and fathers 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.820
 decided and we make the sauce completely 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.800
 unspectacular from a can of tomatoes 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.120
 Let's go with the zucchinis that 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.830
 dashing front and back just a 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.010
 piece and then the snows 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.730
 peeler long thin strips 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.560
 therefore only admitted at the third 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.700
 trial worked but with some pressure 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.700
 is it really good? 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.400
 Meanwhile, hella has been around 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.470
 taken care of and the broccoli 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.450
 cut small and with my holds 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.450
 like the multi very small 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.020
 that's what she did with the onion 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.190
 and we have the zucchini to reste 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.860
 given that you do not steal anymore 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.200
 we could and have seasoned with salt 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.230
 pepper garlic nutmeg and a 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.580
 sly curry 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.050
 we did a few vegetarians and some 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.870
 others also just for the 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.340
 meat at the end of the hack then sets 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.400
 you strip your zucchini like that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.270
 cope and gives a little filling 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.190
 and feather on it and then you should 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.190
 just the ends of the train never so around 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.250
 live on the side with the ends and 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.760
 what you fill is all alone with you 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.900
 let's leave later, for example 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.520
 also thought that maybe 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.850
 also fill well with nuts 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.850
 could 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.560
 as a next station you simply the dose 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.580
 Tomatoes in a pot and will you with 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.740
 salt pepper rosemary thyme and whole 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.300
 many oregano and in the end it comes 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.580
 just over the zucchini bags as 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.610
 sauce and we spent everything for 20 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.140
 minutes at 200 degrees in the oven because we 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.180
 we are slightly greedy at the end 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.140
 cheese is also placed over it and that 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.140
 is then the result 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.960
 and with that we already have them 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.310
 Super league race and something special 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.900
 thanks a lot 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.460
 a bright and lena fans help it has 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.370
 I was very happy if you 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.110
 after one of these glorious main courses 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.090
 you need a dessert here 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.810
 Going for a recipe idea or two concepts 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.800
 with things you can do like that 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.240
 cinema world 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.710
 who to eat a little bit 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.389
 I wanted to stay with you 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.729

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.090
