 Hi, the video of today is part of the plaenge. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.750
 of the brazil service partners in 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.620
 honor of the day of ice cream that to 23 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.450
 September 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.179
 our recipe is ice cream from 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.820
 see wins and in the pan over medium heat 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.850
 put 2 cups of chopped pineapple and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.960
 half a cup of demerara crystal sugar 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.960
 mix and cook until caramelized 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.140
 turn off add a quarter cup of 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.710
 coconut milk and 200 grams of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.710
 soy milk 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.129
 place the mixture in a blender and 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.690
 knock until uniform 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.239
 place the mixture in a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.550
 metal cover with foil and lightweight 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.870
 to freeze that will take about 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
 four hours 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.890
 remove from the freezer cut into pieces 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.960
 and place in an electric mixer. 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.039
 along with fear and Jorge Mussi 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.079
 fictitious 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.160
 beat for 5 minutes at medium speed 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.160
 of getting a fluffy cream 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.330
 place in a bowl counting and light 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.869
 again to the freezer until freezing is 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.869
 ready 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.980
 my first experience in doing 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.530
 ice cream was to create a recipe for 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.000
 To be happy is to choose and pineapple because 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.710
 my favorite authors 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.600
 I got some recipes on the internet 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.160
 textiles reached this result that 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.230
 ice cream is super light and for those who do not 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.880
 Like the soy cream I guarantee 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.680
 Can you still taste him? 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.050
 if you do not have a signifier you 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.920
 You can beat the ice cream without it and return 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.000
 for the freezer 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.680
 but I recommend that you used 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.720
 emulsifier because it will leave your 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.550
 faster and cuddly to ice cream 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.530
 complete recipe you can find in the link 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.270
 which I let in the description and there also 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.610
 leaves some tips and brands of 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.320
 oars that use if you liked 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.160
 this video already in sharing with your 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.900

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.900
 I hope you like it and die
