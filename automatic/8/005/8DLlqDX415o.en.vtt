my<00:01:30.600> tip<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:32.009> why<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.250> promote<00:01:32.549> such<00:01:32.759> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
my tip is that's why we promote such a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.600 
my tip is that's why we promote such a
high<00:01:32.970> carbohydrate<00:01:33.390> intake<00:01:34.070> we<00:01:35.070> love<00:01:35.250> carbs

high carbohydrate intake we love carbs

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.700 
high carbohydrate intake we love carbs
