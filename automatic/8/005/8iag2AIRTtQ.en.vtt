00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
this one we did the first one we did

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.060 
this one we did the first one we did
where<00:02:33.330> we<00:02:33.360> had<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.720> come<00:02:33.870> over<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.230> top<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
where we had to come over to top on the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.759 
where we had to come over to top on the
left<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.820> right<00:02:36.450> went<00:02:36.780> underneath<00:02:37.019> in

left and the right went underneath in

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.890 
left and the right went underneath in
order<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.130> get<00:02:38.250> as<00:02:38.820> proper<00:02:39.330> square<00:02:39.660> knot

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
order to get as proper square knot

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.479 
order to get as proper square knot
though<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.500> have<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.739> reverse<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.280> direction

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
though you have to reverse the direction

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.360 
though you have to reverse the direction
so<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.030> actually<00:02:42.300> have<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.840> take<00:02:43.110> your<00:02:43.830> left

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
right hand goes up and around then

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.350 
right hand goes up and around then
you're<00:02:49.769> gonna<00:02:49.860> go<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.190> grab<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.850> loops<00:02:51.120> again

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
you're gonna go and grab the loops again

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.330 
you're gonna go and grab the loops again
and<00:02:51.690> pull<00:02:51.870> them<00:02:51.989> through<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.620> then<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.160> get<00:02:53.310> a

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
and pull them through and then you get a

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.810 
and pull them through and then you get a
perfect<00:02:53.820> time<00:02:54.380> so<00:02:55.380> let's<00:02:55.560> let's<00:02:56.010> go<00:02:56.190> again<00:02:56.459> so

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
perfect time so let's let's go again so

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.790 
perfect time so let's let's go again so
right<00:02:57.000> from<00:02:57.239> here<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.989> first<00:02:58.290> one<00:02:58.620> you're

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
right from here the first one you're

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.460 
right from here the first one you're
gonna<00:02:58.860> wrap<00:02:59.220> this<00:03:00.000> direction<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.900> pour<00:03:01.380> it

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
gonna wrap this direction and pour it

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.410 
gonna wrap this direction and pour it
through<00:03:01.800> then<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.640> second<00:03:03.060> one<00:03:03.150> you're<00:03:03.300> gonna

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
through then the second one you're gonna

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.080 
through then the second one you're gonna
wrap<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.170> opposite<00:03:04.920> direction<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.670> pull<00:03:06.000> it

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
wrap the opposite direction and pull it

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.310 
wrap the opposite direction and pull it
through<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.120> how<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.480> do<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> super

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
through and this is how you do a super

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.580 
through and this is how you do a super
fast<00:03:13.590> shoot<00:03:14.340> I
