okay<00:00:10.860> what<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> fuse<00:00:11.850> a<00:00:12.680> fuse<00:00:13.680> is<00:00:13.980> placed<00:00:14.340> in

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
okay what is a fuse a fuse is placed in

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.140 
okay what is a fuse a fuse is placed in
all<00:00:14.879> circuits<00:00:15.770> as<00:00:16.770> some<00:00:17.279> sort<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.670> circuit

draw<00:00:28.700> if<00:00:29.700> I<00:00:29.910> did<00:00:30.149> not<00:00:30.360> have<00:00:30.599> fuses<00:00:31.169> in<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.470> line

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
draw if I did not have fuses in the line

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.760 
draw if I did not have fuses in the line
then<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.570> had<00:00:33.870> what's<00:00:34.140> called<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.470> short

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
then if I had what's called a short

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.299 
then if I had what's called a short
which<00:00:35.040> means<00:00:35.340> there's<00:00:36.710> allows<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> lot<00:00:38.160> of

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
which means there's allows a lot of

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.630 
which means there's allows a lot of
power<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.610> go<00:00:38.790> through<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> very<00:00:39.300> short<00:00:39.540> time

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
power to go through in a very short time

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.250 
power to go through in a very short time
then<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.670> would<00:00:42.090> burn<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.330> components<00:00:43.080> and<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
then I would burn up components and I

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.920 
then I would burn up components and I
would<00:00:43.410> burn<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.740> wiring<00:00:44.240> so<00:00:45.240> we<00:00:45.600> put<00:00:45.780> these

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
would burn up wiring so we put these

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.770 
would burn up wiring so we put these
little<00:00:46.200> things<00:00:46.380> in<00:00:46.560> lock<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:47.790> this<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.240> real

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
little things in lock now this is a real

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.000 
little things in lock now this is a real
antique<00:00:48.990> here<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.460> fuse<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:52.230> shows<00:00:52.650> an

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
antique here this fuse it shows an

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.410 
antique here this fuse it shows an
element<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:55.140> element<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.590> right<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.420> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
element the element is right there and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.630 
element the element is right there and
it's<00:00:57.720> a<00:00:57.840> glass<00:00:58.079> view<00:00:58.470> so<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.740> can<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.100> through

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
it's a glass view so you can see through

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.380 
it's a glass view so you can see through
it<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.630> it's<00:01:00.750> blown<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.290> not<00:01:02.390> well

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it to see if it's blown or not well

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.190 
it to see if it's blown or not well
these<00:01:04.400> were<00:01:05.400> kind<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> old-school<00:01:06.720> these

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
these were kind of the old-school these

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.160 
these were kind of the old-school these
were<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:08.369> time<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.000> mean<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.329> blow<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.049> you'd

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
were one time I mean they blow and you'd

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.680 
were one time I mean they blow and you'd
have<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.470> replace<00:01:10.770> them<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.070> another<00:01:11.130> one

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
have to replace them with another one

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.620 
have to replace them with another one
they<00:01:12.690> had<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> screw<00:01:13.380> base<00:01:13.620> on<00:01:13.920> them<00:01:15.140> like<00:01:16.140> this

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
they had a screw base on them like this

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.340 
they had a screw base on them like this
and<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:20.100> 20<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.760> bottom<00:01:20.970> means<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.900> 20

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and the 20 on the bottom means it's a 20

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.370 
and the 20 on the bottom means it's a 20

amp fuse the sockets they turned into

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.700 
amp fuse the sockets they turned into
we're<00:01:28.830> very<00:01:29.040> similar<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.549> light<00:01:29.790> sockets<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
we're very similar to light sockets and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.890 
we're very similar to light sockets and
they<00:01:31.710> were<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.340> early<00:01:32.729> form<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.180> circuit

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
they were the early form of circuit

they were the early form of circuit

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that has these in it you've got a bunch

they are circuit protection and they

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
will blow but I can put any sized fuse

will blow but I can put any sized fuse
inside<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.680> screw<00:02:08.189> slot<00:02:08.750> see<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.929> it's

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
inside that screw slot see that it's

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.220 
inside that screw slot see that it's
very<00:02:10.590> similar<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.810> light<00:02:12.810> bulb<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:15.230> if

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
very similar to of a light bulb and if

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.159 
very similar to of a light bulb and if
you<00:02:16.529> have<00:02:16.769> this<00:02:17.040> type<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.489> fuse<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:17.999> here<00:02:18.169> the

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:19.169 
you have this type of fuse in here the

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:21.650 
you have this type of fuse in here the
circuit<00:02:19.590> may<00:02:19.769> have<00:02:19.919> been<00:02:20.069> setup<00:02:20.370> for<00:02:20.459> 15<00:02:21.120> or

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
circuit may have been setup for 15 or

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.080 
circuit may have been setup for 15 or
awesome<00:02:21.990> leaving<00:02:22.290> 10<00:02:22.620> amps<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.880> put<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
awesome leaving 10 amps and I can put a

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
awesome leaving 10 amps and I can put a
30<00:02:24.360> amp<00:02:24.630> fuse<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.590> they'll<00:02:25.860> all<00:02:26.130> fit<00:02:26.490> and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
30 amp fuse in this they'll all fit and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.740 
30 amp fuse in this they'll all fit and
so<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.500> could<00:02:29.100> end<00:02:29.250> up<00:02:29.370> with<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.580> fire<00:02:29.820> something

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
so I could end up with a fire something

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.830 
so I could end up with a fire something

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
have proper circuit protection for the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.110 
have proper circuit protection for the
wiring<00:02:35.880> sighs<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.390> have<00:02:37.490> so<00:02:38.490> that's<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.000> old
