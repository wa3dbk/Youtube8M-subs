00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.919
 I think her most poetic thus 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.130
 greater beauty is when you 're climbing 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.580
 the catwalk and someone who gets on that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.990
 house opening the door and you arriving in 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.529
 house looks at aa wood texture 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:27.140
 the volumetry of the faÃ§ade 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.140
 jabuticabeira in that in the axis of entry 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.650
 it was not an easy way 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.200
 that we would explore 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.600
 conditions of this terrain and made 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.550
 that we make the main decisions 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.770
 ization of level of the house in relation to 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.260
 this client was very simple to 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.460
 a small cut in front of the ground 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.080
 creating the garage at street level and soon 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.199
 then a one meter meter wall 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.829
 and a half and already basically the social level 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.990
 from house to house face is a cube in 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.880
 balance sheet has a balance of five meters and 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:15.350
 15 and this balance he projects with 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.810
 glass a square view of the 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.060
 goats and the big highlight maybe the house 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.690
 is the panel of wood cumaru on the facade 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.320
 and evidence of the volume increase in 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.320
 swing 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:34.090
 the big challenge of the house was to solve the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.230
 cube and the facade that covers the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.370
 garage 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.020
 then what happened in a volume and 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.300
 and that volume 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.550
 theoretically would have supported a wall in the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.310
 in the perpendicular sense is the volume 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.430
 then the trend this big cube year 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.870
 he is so good forward 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.490
 that's what we can solve 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.860
 with our engineer is to make a 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.970
 inverted as if it were 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.970
 holding and if this end of the balance is 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.700
 tied to the roof then the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.160
 structure is all in traction there 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.840
 tied to the roof structure and the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.630
 quality is very simple, basically the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.880
 house is a white prism with some 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.020
 elements in burnt cement and other 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.150
 materials that were used were were 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.800
 the brises on the side that has a 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.800
 strong language based on aluminum 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:34.239
 are three suites and is in a suite 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.909
 The main house is in the back of the house. 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.280
 and the other two suites that are the 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.379
 videos for children of future children 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.440
 of this couple of clients 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:48.370
 we have a walkway that gives access 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.170
 to the dorms and this walkway is 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.349
 open to home so she has one foot 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:58.030
 right is a connection with the area of 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:00.430
 DedÃª kitchen dining area and the area 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.420
 also when you 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.299
 room 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.139
 you do not see a runner a role 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.659
 closed 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:10.060
 Do you already see the house everyone already sees? 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:13.629
 jabuticabeira is seeing someone who 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.709
 is down there having a meal already 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:22.019
 can see through the 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.019
 facade of the saw up to the saw of the goats 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.769
 every detail we thought of 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.980
 bioclimatic or thinking 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.010
 protect when you have to protect 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.810
 illuminate when it should light the house has 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.000
 in the summer and 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.400
 in winter then in summer the idea is that 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.099
 in this band of the east the brises contain 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.690
 part of the morning radiation a set 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.370
 of solar screens if low also 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.989
 can contain a little 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.659
 this morning sun and you have a 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.540
 both cross-direction inflation is 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.970
 horizontal so call while crossed 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.920
 in the direction of vertical articulation of the air 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.470
 warm up and coming out the chimney effect 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.019
 and it's really cool when you visit the 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.609
 home and you realize that the house is 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.609
 very well lit that house too 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.230
 here the customer relates 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.949
 well with her it's a very satisfying 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.989
 It is great to see that the decisions 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.260
 implied in the quality of life of the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.260
 residents
