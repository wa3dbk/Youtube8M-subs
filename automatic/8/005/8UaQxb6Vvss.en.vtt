00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.890 
first things first I want to say that
this<00:00:14.639> game<00:00:14.849> was<00:00:15.030> actually<00:00:15.150> sent<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> me<00:00:15.780> from

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
this game was actually sent to me from

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.750 
this game was actually sent to me from
the<00:00:16.049> publisher<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.520> know<00:00:17.609> that

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the publisher so just so you know that

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.609 
the publisher so just so you know that
so<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.449> another<00:00:18.779> title<00:00:19.199> from<00:00:19.380> our

so this is another title from our

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.620 
so this is another title from our
cymatics<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.550> can't<00:00:20.910> believe<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.359> but<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> think

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
cymatics I can't believe it but I think

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.540 
cymatics I can't believe it but I think
that<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.380> turning<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.859> corner<00:00:23.100> because

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
that this is turning a corner because

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.529 
that this is turning a corner because
they<00:00:23.730> did<00:00:23.880> something<00:00:24.060> I've<00:00:24.240> been<00:00:24.300> wanting

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.630 
actually made a game you know something
that<00:00:29.760> has<00:00:29.939> more<00:00:30.300> than<00:00:30.359> one<00:00:30.810> screen

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640

random game so you say this is a ripoff

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.069 
random game so you say this is a ripoff
of<00:00:49.230> geometry<00:00:49.890> -<00:00:50.070> no<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.520> say<00:00:50.910> play<00:00:51.180> similar<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
of geometry - no I say play similar to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.770 
of geometry - no I say play similar to
it<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.620> style<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.699> were<00:00:54.000> constantly

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it in the style of you were constantly

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.630 
it in the style of you were constantly
running<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.860> jump<00:00:56.399> over

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
running and you have to jump over

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.569 
running and you have to jump over
difficult<00:00:57.270> levels<00:00:58.230> over<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.039> over<00:00:59.250> until<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
difficult levels over and over until you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.700 
difficult levels over and over until you
beat<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.539> unlimited<00:01:00.840> lives<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
beat it you get unlimited lives but the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.020 
beat it you get unlimited lives but the
whole<00:01:01.859> point<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> game<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.850> past

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
whole point of the game is to get past

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
whole point of the game is to get past
the<00:01:03.180> 40<00:01:03.480> levels<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> least<00:01:04.650> amount<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the 40 levels with the least amount of

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.010 
the 40 levels with the least amount of
lives<00:01:05.250> taken<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> end<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.570> post<00:01:06.840> that

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
lives taken and at the end you post that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
lives taken and at the end you post that
to<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> neighbors<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.040> game<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.400> 40<00:01:08.790> levels

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
to the neighbors the game is 40 levels

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.330 
to the neighbors the game is 40 levels
long<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.960> first<00:01:10.260> 30<00:01:10.590> levels<00:01:11.070> being

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
long with the first 30 levels being

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.760 
long with the first 30 levels being
ridiculously<00:01:12.210> easy<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> last<00:01:13.170> 10<00:01:13.470> being

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
ridiculously easy in the last 10 being

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.789 
ridiculously easy in the last 10 being
no<00:01:14.130> no<00:01:14.610> no<00:01:14.880> no<00:01:15.240> no<00:01:15.600> no<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.140> think<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.590> halfway

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
no no no no no no I think the halfway

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.859 
no no no no no no I think the halfway
point<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.369> work<00:01:17.520> out<00:01:17.729> really<00:01:17.909> hard<00:01:18.090> not<00:01:18.360> even

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
point was work out really hard not even

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.690 
point was work out really hard not even
so<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.350> could<00:01:19.530> say<00:01:19.619> you're<00:01:19.770> constantly<00:01:20.189> running

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
so I could say you're constantly running

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.429 
so I could say you're constantly running
but<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.150> thing<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.049> their<00:01:22.170> goal

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
but the thing is to get to their goal

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.469 
but the thing is to get to their goal
you<00:01:22.590> got<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:22.920> past<00:01:23.100> spikes<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.909> gravity

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
you got to get past spikes and gravity

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.080 
you got to get past spikes and gravity
and<00:01:24.689> shifts<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> universal<00:01:26.520> way<00:01:26.820> of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and shifts in the universal way of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.670 
and shifts in the universal way of
looking<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.630> things<00:01:27.810> what<00:01:28.049> would<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.350> call<00:01:28.500> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
looking at things what would you call it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770 
looking at things what would you call it
I<00:01:28.799> don't<00:01:29.009> know<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.130> camera<00:01:29.970> sometimes<00:01:30.600> you're

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
I don't know the camera sometimes you're

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.630 
I don't know the camera sometimes you're
tilted<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.380> sometimes<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.220> completely

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
tilted up sometimes you completely

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.300

change<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.210> positions<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.770> camera<00:01:35.159> just

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
change your positions as the camera just

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
rotates they try and do everything in

rotates they try and do everything in

kill you from getting to your goal at
the<00:01:40.619> end<00:01:40.650> which<00:01:41.130> was<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.549> annoying

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the end which was really annoying

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.420 
the end which was really annoying
because<00:01:42.360> sometimes<00:01:43.110> those<00:01:43.530> mechanics<00:01:44.220> were

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
because sometimes those mechanics were

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.090 
because sometimes those mechanics were
just<00:01:44.790> either<00:01:45.200> nauseating<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.350> times<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:47.040> just

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
just either nauseating at times or just

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.219 
just either nauseating at times or just
not<00:01:47.759> interesting<00:01:48.450> some<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> level

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
not interesting some of the level

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
not interesting some of the level
designs<00:01:49.470> were<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> little<00:01:49.920> lazy<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.490> when<00:01:50.640> you

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
designs were a little lazy like when you

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.249 
designs were a little lazy like when you
finish<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.180> level<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.750> was<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> exact

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
finish one level and it was the exact

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.080 
finish one level and it was the exact
same<00:01:52.290> thing<00:01:52.680> only<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.159> opposite<00:01:53.700> remember

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
same thing only the opposite remember

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.990 
same thing only the opposite remember
that<00:01:54.240> yes<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:55.259> zoomed-out<00:01:55.890> or<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> cameras

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that yes or zoomed-out or the cameras

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.609 
that yes or zoomed-out or the cameras
flipping<00:01:57.390> now<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.229> instead<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
flipping now it's like if you instead of

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.200 
flipping now it's like if you instead of
coming<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.009> new<00:01:59.159> ideas<00:01:59.310> they<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.060> said

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
coming up with new ideas they just said

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.969 
coming up with new ideas they just said
hey<00:02:00.479> let's<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:00.930> throw<00:02:01.049> more<00:02:01.320> spikes<00:02:01.619> at<00:02:01.829> him

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
hey let's just throw more spikes at him

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.319 
hey let's just throw more spikes at him
which<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> shame<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.210> know

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
which is a shame because you know

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.300 
which is a shame because you know
there's<00:02:03.509> only<00:02:03.630> 40<00:02:04.110> levels<00:02:04.320> if<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:04.979> didn't<00:02:05.219> do

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
there's only 40 levels if you didn't do

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.800 
there's only 40 levels if you didn't do
this<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.640> might<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:05.880> well<00:02:06.000> flush<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.390> out<00:02:06.479> even

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
this you might as well flush it out even

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.290 
this you might as well flush it out even
more<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.590> music<00:02:07.920> was<00:02:08.099> actually<00:02:08.489> okay<00:02:08.970> it

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
more and the music was actually okay it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.360 
more and the music was actually okay it
had<00:02:09.450> problems<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.110> looping<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.979> thing<00:02:11.190> was

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
had problems with looping the thing was

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.210 
had problems with looping the thing was
like<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> minute<00:02:11.879> long<00:02:12.150> at<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.930> then

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
like a minute long at that and then

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.890 
like a minute long at that and then
pauses<00:02:13.580> for<00:02:13.730> 10<00:02:13.880> seconds<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.420> then<00:02:14.540> plays

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
pauses for 10 seconds and then plays

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.290 
pauses for 10 seconds and then plays
again<00:02:15.260> yeah<00:02:15.710> I'm<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.310> saying<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.730> was<00:02:16.910> okay

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
again yeah I'm just saying it was okay

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.450 
again yeah I'm just saying it was okay
it<00:02:17.810> worked<00:02:18.080> once<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.590> beat<00:02:18.710> those<00:02:18.830> 40<00:02:19.130> levels

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
it worked once you beat those 40 levels

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.790 
it worked once you beat those 40 levels
that's<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.240> I<00:02:20.480> mean<00:02:20.870> there's<00:02:21.320> really<00:02:21.560> no

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
that's it I mean there's really no

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.680 
that's it I mean there's really no
replayability<00:02:22.490> other<00:02:22.790> than<00:02:23.000> trying<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.420> do<00:02:23.600> it

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
replayability other than trying to do it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.360 
replayability other than trying to do it
again<00:02:23.780> with<00:02:24.320> less<00:02:24.440> lives<00:02:24.740> lost

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
again with less lives lost

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.130 
again with less lives lost
did<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:25.610> enjoy<00:02:25.760> replaying<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> levels<00:02:26.810> not

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
did you enjoy replaying the levels not

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.230 
did you enjoy replaying the levels not
really<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.460> could<00:02:28.580> play<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.850> entire<00:02:28.970> thing

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
really you could play the entire thing

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.440 
really you could play the entire thing
on<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.750> gamepad<00:02:30.170> which<00:02:30.440> was<00:02:30.620> cool<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.190> guess<00:02:31.730> I

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
on the gamepad which was cool I guess I

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.510 
on the gamepad which was cool I guess I
would<00:02:32.990> say<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.230> had<00:02:33.470> fun<00:02:33.650> with<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.920> game<00:02:34.070> for

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
would say I had fun with the game for

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.460 
would say I had fun with the game for
the<00:02:34.700> hour<00:02:35.180> we<00:02:35.570> get<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.870> play<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.200> wouldn't<00:02:36.440> you

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
the hour we get to play it wouldn't you

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.650
