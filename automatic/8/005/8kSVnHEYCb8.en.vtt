little guy helped to remove the fair

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.050 
little guy helped to remove the fair
majority<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.410> reason<00:02:27.890> being<00:02:28.100> it's<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.790> silent

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
majority of a reason being it's a silent

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.150 
majority of a reason being it's a silent
lure<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.780> doesn't<00:02:30.260> have<00:02:30.440> any<00:02:30.650> body<00:02:30.860> weights

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
lure that doesn't have any body weights

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.450 
lure that doesn't have any body weights
it's<00:02:31.490> just<00:02:31.940> plastic<00:02:32.240> now<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.260> was<00:02:33.530> an

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
it's just plastic now that was an

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.430 
it's just plastic now that was an
absolute<00:02:35.120> nightmare<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.570> get<00:02:35.690> together<00:02:35.840> now

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
absolute nightmare to get together now

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.500 
absolute nightmare to get together now
the<00:02:36.500> reason<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.040> did<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.390> it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
the reason I did that is so that it

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.450 
the reason I did that is so that it
floats<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.990> very<00:02:39.350> particular<00:02:39.650> way<00:02:40.040> now<00:02:40.220> most

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
floats a very particular way now most

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.010 
floats a very particular way now most
hard<00:02:40.700> bodies<00:02:41.000> when<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.180> stop<00:02:41.450> retrieving

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
hard bodies when you stop retrieving

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.050 
hard bodies when you stop retrieving
them<00:02:42.170> they'll<00:02:42.590> float<00:02:42.860> tail-first<00:02:43.220> towards

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
them they'll float tail-first towards

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.210 
them they'll float tail-first towards
the<00:02:44.180> surface<00:02:44.600> but<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.140> puppy<00:02:45.440> dog<00:02:45.650> floats

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
the surface but the puppy dog floats

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.610 
the surface but the puppy dog floats
headfirst<00:02:46.970> towards<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> surface<00:02:47.900> just<00:02:48.050> like

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
headfirst towards the surface just like

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.070 
headfirst towards the surface just like
an<00:02:48.980> injured<00:02:49.460> baitfish<00:02:49.670> would<00:02:50.090> now<00:02:50.270> bake<00:02:50.810> fish

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
an injured baitfish would now bake fish

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.450 
an injured baitfish would now bake fish
when<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.410> injured<00:02:51.770> they<00:02:51.890> tend<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.160> swim

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
when the injured they tend to swim

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.640 
when the injured they tend to swim
towards<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.030> top<00:02:53.240> sometimes<00:02:53.630> upside<00:02:54.230> down<00:02:54.470> or

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
towards the top sometimes upside down or

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.590 
towards the top sometimes upside down or
Valli<00:02:54.830> up<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:55.190> they<00:02:55.310> always<00:02:55.490> will<00:02:56.180> end<00:02:56.390> up

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
Valli up but they always will end up

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.150 
Valli up but they always will end up
around<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.260> surface<00:02:57.470> with<00:02:57.770> their<00:02:57.890> heads

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
around the surface with their heads

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.860 
around the surface with their heads
poking<00:02:58.640> out<00:02:58.790> of<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:59.000> water<00:02:59.210> so<00:02:59.690> that's

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
poking out of the water so that's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.300 
poking out of the water so that's
exactly<00:03:00.350> what<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.530> wanted<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:00.950> do<00:03:01.070> with<00:03:01.220> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
exactly what I wanted to do with the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.700 
exactly what I wanted to do with the
puppy<00:03:01.580> dog<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:01.880> wanted<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.510> dive<00:03:03.110> down<00:03:03.440> like

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
puppy dog I wanted it to dive down like

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.550 
puppy dog I wanted it to dive down like
this<00:03:03.920> then<00:03:04.400> turn<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.000> float<00:03:05.690> up<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.230> the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
this then turn and float up to the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.800 
this then turn and float up to the
surface<00:03:06.800> like<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:08.150> like<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.540> real

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
surface like that just like a real

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.990 
surface like that just like a real
baitfish<00:03:09.050> would<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.590> think<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:10.100> part<00:03:10.790> of

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
baitfish would and I think that part of

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.540 
baitfish would and I think that part of
the<00:03:11.090> reason<00:03:11.270> why<00:03:11.600> this<00:03:12.140> guy<00:03:12.410> catches<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.280> whole

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
the reason why this guy catches a whole

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.930 
the reason why this guy catches a whole
lot<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.790> fish<00:03:14.120> it's<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.930> slow<00:03:15.290> floater<00:03:15.760> but<00:03:16.760> it's

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
lot of fish it's a slow floater but it's

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.150 
lot of fish it's a slow floater but it's
a<00:03:17.030> medium<00:03:17.510> diver<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.320> meet<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:18.890> metre

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
a medium diver and meet it to a metre

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.590 
a medium diver and meet it to a metre
and<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.370> half<00:03:19.400> two<00:03:19.850> meters<00:03:20.180> if<00:03:20.300> you've<00:03:20.420> got

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
and a half two meters if you've got

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.290 
and a half two meters if you've got
skinny<00:03:20.930> skinny<00:03:21.200> line<00:03:21.940> let's<00:03:22.940> get<00:03:23.120> the
