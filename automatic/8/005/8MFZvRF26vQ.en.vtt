that is it can change up so early that

that is it can change up so early that
it<00:01:55.790> drops<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.420> engine<00:01:56.780> out<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.050> its<00:01:57.320> turbo

it drops the engine out of its turbo

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.310 
it drops the engine out of its turbo

range and therefore it lacks any power

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.980 
range and therefore it lacks any power
and<00:02:00.650> secondly<00:02:01.550> is<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.270> opposite<00:02:02.750> problem

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
and secondly is the opposite problem

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.960 
and secondly is the opposite problem
when<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.530> are<00:02:03.770> driving<00:02:04.070> along<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.610> asked<00:02:04.940> for

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
when you are driving along and asked for

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.210 
when you are driving along and asked for
a<00:02:05.090> small<00:02:05.390> burst<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.870> acceleration<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.710> can<00:02:07.040> be

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
a small burst of acceleration it can be

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.609 
a small burst of acceleration it can be
too<00:02:07.490> keen<00:02:07.730> to<00:02:07.790> change<00:02:08.209> down<00:02:08.509> again<00:02:08.959> when<00:02:09.470> in

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
too keen to change down again when in

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.559 
too keen to change down again when in
fact<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.190> gear<00:02:10.399> it's<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.729> would<00:02:11.090> pull<00:02:11.330> along

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
fact the gear it's in would pull along

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.250 
fact the gear it's in would pull along
perfectly<00:02:12.019> fine

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.900
