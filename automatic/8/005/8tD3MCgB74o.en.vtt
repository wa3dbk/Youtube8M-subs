let me give you some variations that
you'll<00:00:03.710> play<00:00:04.160> on<00:00:04.720> the<00:00:05.720> number<00:00:06.290> system<00:00:06.710> all

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:06.830 
you'll play on the number system all

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.209 
you'll play on the number system all
right<00:00:06.859> so<00:00:07.279> on<00:00:07.549> the<00:00:07.850> one<00:00:08.120> we<00:00:08.990> said<00:00:09.349> that<00:00:09.679> the<00:00:09.860> one

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
right so on the one we said that the one

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.749 
right so on the one we said that the one
is<00:00:10.519> typically<00:00:11.059> always<00:00:11.449> major<00:00:12.019> right<00:00:12.759> that's

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
is typically always major right that's

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.939 
is typically always major right that's
what<00:00:13.909> we<00:00:13.999> say<00:00:14.150> so<00:00:14.419> the<00:00:15.049> one<00:00:15.259> will<00:00:15.440> play<00:00:15.559> a<00:00:15.650> major

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
what we say so the one will play a major

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.040 
what we say so the one will play a major
chord<00:00:16.070> well<00:00:17.029> there<00:00:17.210> are<00:00:17.240> times<00:00:17.720> in<00:00:18.019> which

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
chord well there are times in which

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.660 
chord well there are times in which
you'll<00:00:18.380> play<00:00:18.710> this<00:00:20.050> type<00:00:21.050> of<00:00:21.080> four

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670

get you to the floor all right so this

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.250 
get you to the floor all right so this
is<00:00:45.370> this<00:00:45.879> is<00:00:46.089> this<00:00:46.269> is<00:00:46.480> kind<00:00:46.750> of<00:00:46.839> similar<00:00:47.110> to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
is this is this is kind of similar to

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.310 
is this is this is kind of similar to
the<00:00:47.530> 514<00:00:48.309> chord<00:00:48.699> progression<00:00:49.180> or<00:00:49.329> you<00:00:50.170> know

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
the 514 chord progression or you know

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.130 
the 514 chord progression or you know
that<00:00:50.559> you<00:00:50.739> that<00:00:51.100> we<00:00:51.519> talked<00:00:52.360> about<00:00:52.449> it<00:00:52.780> in<00:00:52.900> the

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
that you that we talked about it in the

that you that we talked about it in the
in<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.820> chord<00:00:55.149> progressions<00:00:55.600> part

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
in the in the chord progressions part

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.279 
in the in the chord progressions part
but<00:00:57.270> there<00:00:58.270> are<00:00:58.359> sometimes<00:00:58.570> you'll<00:00:59.050> play<00:00:59.260> this

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.170 
but there are sometimes you'll play this
over<00:00:59.770> the<00:00:59.859> one<00:01:00.070> base<00:01:00.280> i<00:01:00.489> just<00:01:00.699> wanted<00:01:00.940> to<00:01:00.969> show

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
over the one base i just wanted to show

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.259 
over the one base i just wanted to show
this<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.480> you<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.800> when<00:01:03.129> you<00:01:03.190> see<00:01:03.640> it<00:01:03.820> or<00:01:04.089> see

d and now lower is after this e and then

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.770 
d and now lower is after this e and then
they'll<00:01:15.270> go<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.480> their<00:01:15.750> fork<00:01:16.020> or<00:01:17.360> no<00:01:18.360> Howard<00:01:18.570> it

let's<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.900> five

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.730 

we're<00:01:58.340> on<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.490> six<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.440> normally<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.530> song

we're on a six and normally the song
just<00:02:00.980> walks<00:02:01.160> down<00:02:01.340> like<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:02.950> 654

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
let me show you my variation on the one

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.170 
let me show you my variation on the one
that<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:10.000> just<00:02:10.240> play<00:02:10.450> for<00:02:10.509> you

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.580 

all<00:02:22.640> right<00:02:22.820> now<00:02:23.090> let's<00:02:23.750> go<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.110> one<00:02:24.320> to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
all right now let's go to the one to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.610 
all right now let's go to the one to
that<00:02:24.740> core

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.649 

you<00:02:29.250> know<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.510> particular

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
you know and in that particular

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.559 
you know and in that particular
situation<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:32.129> took<00:02:32.519> us<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.120> four<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.540> i

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
situation it took us to the four so i

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.119 
situation it took us to the four so i
just<00:02:33.720> want<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.989> show<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.590> because

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
just want to show that to you because

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.860 
just want to show that to you because
that's<00:02:35.549> a<00:02:35.730> variation<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.510> you'll<00:02:36.690> see

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
that's a variation that you'll see

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.410 
that's a variation that you'll see
people<00:02:37.049> play<00:02:37.409> on<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.680> one<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:39.120> when<00:02:39.330> they

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
people play on the one and when they

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.479 
people play on the one and when they
play<00:02:39.659> that<00:02:39.690> particular<00:02:40.200> core<00:02:40.590> it's<00:02:41.280> usually

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
play that particular core it's usually

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.440 
play that particular core it's usually
always<00:02:42.110> are<00:02:43.129> use<00:02:44.129> pretty<00:02:44.549> much<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.940> take<00:02:45.180> them

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
always are use pretty much to take them

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.770 
always are use pretty much to take them
to<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.319> floor<00:02:46.680> okay<00:02:47.340> that's<00:02:48.090> that's<00:02:48.269> usually

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
to the floor okay that's that's usually

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.720 
to the floor okay that's that's usually
the<00:02:48.810> application<00:02:49.650> all<00:02:49.769> right<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.159> won't<00:02:50.610> say

time that's the application and that

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.839

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
let me go to the two okay now there

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.539 
let me go to the two okay now there
there<00:03:03.569> there<00:03:03.900> are<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.530> couple<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:05.190> variations

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
there there are a couple of variations

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.670 
there there are a couple of variations
that<00:03:05.879> you<00:03:05.970> hear<00:03:06.239> people<00:03:06.390> play<00:03:06.690> on<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
that you hear people play on the to the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.099 
that you hear people play on the to the
one<00:03:07.920> variation<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.480> instead<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.810> playing

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
one variation is that instead of playing

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.830 
one variation is that instead of playing
the<00:03:10.290> two<00:03:10.530> minor<00:03:11.150> sometimes<00:03:12.150> people<00:03:12.390> will<00:03:12.629> play

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
the two minor sometimes people will play

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.449 
the two minor sometimes people will play
the<00:03:13.019> two<00:03:13.290> major<00:03:14.780> all<00:03:15.780> right<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.349> they'll<00:03:17.280> play

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
the two major all right so they'll play

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.500 
the two major all right so they'll play
like<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> G<00:03:17.940> major<00:03:18.209> chord<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:20.359> usually<00:03:21.359> when

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
like a G major chord and usually when

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.240 
like a G major chord and usually when
they're<00:03:21.690> doing<00:03:22.109> that<00:03:22.319> is<00:03:22.560> normally<00:03:23.099> a

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
they're doing that is normally a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.940 
they're doing that is normally a
traditional<00:03:24.209> song<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.260> let's<00:03:25.440> say<00:03:25.590> take

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
traditional song so let's say take

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:40.059 
traditional song so let's say take
something<00:03:26.250> like<00:03:26.310> amazing<00:03:26.849> grace

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.179 

so<00:03:43.370> there<00:03:44.370> goes<00:03:44.609> right<00:03:44.849> there<00:03:45.090> that's<00:03:45.780> a

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
so there goes right there that's a

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.130 
so there goes right there that's a
that's<00:03:47.189> ad<00:03:47.760> major<00:03:48.030> chord<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.689> not<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> minor

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
that's ad major chord and not a minor

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.800 
that's ad major chord and not a minor
we're<00:03:49.409> on<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.680> two<00:03:50.689> normally<00:03:51.689> the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
we're on the two normally the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.949 
we're on the two normally the
application<00:03:52.500> for<00:03:52.709> that<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:53.430> when<00:03:54.420> they<00:03:54.629> want

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
application for that is when they want

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.170 
application for that is when they want
to<00:03:55.079> go<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:57.680> 55<00:03:58.680> but<00:03:59.099> but<00:03:59.310> but<00:03:59.489> they<00:03:59.609> wanted<00:04:00.060> to

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
to go to a 55 but but but they wanted to

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.440 
to go to a 55 but but but they wanted to
sound<00:04:00.420> more<00:04:00.889> traditional<00:04:02.150> that's<00:04:03.150> an

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
sound more traditional that's an

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.959 
sound more traditional that's an
approach<00:04:04.409> people<00:04:04.889> use<00:04:05.099> for<00:04:05.400> traditional

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:05.969 
approach people use for traditional

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:18.050 
approach people use for traditional
gospel<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.510> it'll<00:04:06.689> do<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.900> play<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.230> song

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.899 

and<00:04:19.060> air<00:04:19.209> goes<00:04:19.449> right<00:04:19.659> there<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.169> basically

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
and air goes right there and basically

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:26.129 
and air goes right there and basically
that<00:04:21.909> it<00:04:22.090> is<00:04:22.330> ad<00:04:23.400> all<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:25.960> had<00:04:26.110> a

normally play we normally play 21 / 23
right<00:07:07.949> well<00:07:08.949> a<00:07:08.979> variation<00:07:09.850> that<00:07:09.970> people<00:07:10.270> will

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:10.389

right well a variation that people will
play<00:07:10.600> on<00:07:10.780> the<00:07:10.870> three<00:07:11.110> this<00:07:11.350> is<00:07:11.500> another<00:07:11.830> core

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.460 

now<00:07:17.030> this<00:07:17.240> quarter<00:07:17.690> the<00:07:17.780> quarry<00:07:18.050> definitely

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
now this quarter the quarry definitely

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.629 
now this quarter the quarry definitely
going<00:07:18.590> to<00:07:18.680> have<00:07:18.830> is<00:07:19.069> to<00:07:19.190> see<00:07:19.460> a<00:07:19.729> flat<00:07:20.449> C<00:07:21.169> D<00:07:21.199> G<00:07:21.800> and

going to have is to see a flat C D G and

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:25.990 
going to have is to see a flat C D G and
normally<00:07:23.630> just<00:07:24.560> about<00:07:24.919> every<00:07:25.610> time<00:07:25.849> this

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 
normally just about every time this

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.870 
normally just about every time this
Court<00:07:26.330> is<00:07:26.419> used<00:07:26.720> it's<00:07:27.229> used<00:07:27.680> to<00:07:28.039> lead<00:07:28.340> into<00:07:28.639> the

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 
Court is used it's used to lead into the

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.480 
Court is used it's used to lead into the
six<00:07:29.380> so<00:07:30.380> remember<00:07:30.710> when<00:07:30.830> we<00:07:30.919> talked<00:07:31.130> about<00:07:31.250> the

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:31.490 
six so remember when we talked about the

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.950 
six so remember when we talked about the
seven<00:07:32.300> three<00:07:33.229> six<00:07:33.949> chord<00:07:34.280> progression<00:07:34.960> that's

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:35.960 
seven three six chord progression that's

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.900 
seven three six chord progression that's
not<00:07:36.199> only<00:07:36.319> work<00:07:36.500> that<00:07:36.770> we<00:07:36.830> r<00:07:37.220> de<00:07:37.340> skoura<00:07:37.580> comes

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:37.910 
not only work that we r de skoura comes

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.809 
not only work that we r de skoura comes
in<00:07:38.090> ninety-five<00:07:38.599> percent<00:07:38.780> of<00:07:39.050> the<00:07:39.139> time<00:07:39.819> this

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:40.819 
in ninety-five percent of the time this

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:46.680 
in ninety-five percent of the time this
chord<00:07:41.240> is<00:07:41.389> leading<00:07:41.840> into<00:07:42.080> the<00:07:42.169> six<00:07:43.389> ok<00:07:44.389> our<00:07:45.370> and

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:46.690 
chord is leading into the six ok our and

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.200 
chord is leading into the six ok our and
so<00:07:47.690> we<00:07:47.840> have<00:07:48.020> that<00:07:48.259> on<00:07:49.069> the<00:07:49.340> three<00:07:49.580> thats

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.210 
so we have that on the three thats

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.999 
so we have that on the three thats
pretty<00:07:50.389> much<00:07:50.599> a<00:07:50.630> primary<00:07:51.229> variation<00:07:51.889> on<00:07:52.039> 30

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:54.009 
pretty much a primary variation on 30

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:57.880 
pretty much a primary variation on 30
the<00:07:55.009> other<00:07:55.190> variation
