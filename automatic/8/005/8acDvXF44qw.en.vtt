an<00:01:03.360> hour<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.680> doing<00:01:04.800> it<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.040> ease

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
an hour and it's doing it with ease

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
an hour and it's doing it with ease
really<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.720> impressive<00:01:07.140> because<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.370> an

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
really really impressive because with an

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.180 
really really impressive because with an
electric<00:01:08.910> motor<00:01:09.120> you<00:01:09.510> get<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.080> 280<00:01:10.800> newton

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
electric motor you get that 280 newton

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.160 
electric motor you get that 280 newton
meters<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> torque<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.030> 90<00:01:12.660> kilowatts<00:01:13.080> of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
meters of torque and 90 kilowatts of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
meters of torque and 90 kilowatts of
power<00:01:13.230> from<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> moment<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> cars<00:01:14.880> turned<00:01:15.150> on

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
power from the moment the cars turned on

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.690 
power from the moment the cars turned on
there<00:01:16.140> are<00:01:16.260> no<00:01:16.380> gears<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.860> electric<00:01:17.250> motor<00:01:17.460> so

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
there are no gears in electric motor so

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
there are no gears in electric motor so
you've<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.030> always<00:01:18.180> got<00:01:18.690> power<00:01:19.560> it's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
you've just always got power it's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.820 
you've just always got power it's
fantastic<00:01:20.930> because<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.200> leaf<00:01:22.350> doesn't<00:01:22.710> have

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
fantastic because the leaf doesn't have

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.440 
fantastic because the leaf doesn't have

an engine essence designers and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.200 
an engine essence designers and
engineers<00:01:24.620> had<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:25.770> work<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.250> sound<00:01:26.760> proofing

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
engineers had to work on sound proofing

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
engineers had to work on sound proofing
the<00:01:27.330> car<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.260> what<00:01:28.410> they<00:01:28.530> did<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.740> shake<00:01:29.160> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the car so what they did was shake the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.850 
the car so what they did was shake the
front<00:01:30.180> headlights<00:01:30.660> there<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.170> deflect<00:01:31.590> wind

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
front headlights there to deflect wind

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.730
