00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
put on my lashes and somehow I must have

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.900

I<00:05:54.319> accidentally<00:05:55.280> didn't<00:05:55.580> film<00:05:56.000> and<00:05:56.330> I<00:05:56.840> figure

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
I accidentally didn't film and I figure

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.719 
I accidentally didn't film and I figure
that<00:05:57.139> out<00:05:57.410> just<00:05:57.650> now<00:05:57.800> as<00:05:58.009> I<00:05:58.099> was<00:05:58.190> uploading<00:05:58.460> it

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
that out just now as I was uploading it

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.339 
that out just now as I was uploading it
to<00:05:58.759> my<00:05:58.910> computer<00:05:59.270> so<00:05:59.300> I<00:05:59.509> added<00:05:59.780> this<00:06:00.050> part

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
to my computer so I added this part

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.370 
to my computer so I added this part
basically<00:06:01.250> all<00:06:01.669> I<00:06:01.699> did<00:06:02.090> was<00:06:02.419> I<00:06:02.750> added<00:06:02.900> my<00:06:03.169> fake

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
basically all I did was I added my fake

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.379 
basically all I did was I added my fake
lashes<00:06:03.590> and<00:06:05.979> this<00:06:06.979> is<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.490> finished<00:06:07.819> look<00:06:07.940> I

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
lashes and this is the finished look I

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.360 
lashes and this is the finished look I
think<00:06:08.479> I<00:06:08.599> show<00:06:08.750> this<00:06:08.870> at<00:06:08.990> the<00:06:09.050> beginning<00:06:09.139> votes

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.110 

-<00:06:13.370> the<00:06:13.729> red<00:06:13.970> eyes<00:06:14.210> which<00:06:14.630> you<00:06:14.780> don't<00:06:15.050> want<00:06:16.120> okay

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
- the red eyes which you don't want okay

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.749 
- the red eyes which you don't want okay
so<00:06:17.320> it<00:06:18.320> always<00:06:18.470> gets<00:06:18.710> blue<00:06:19.099> when<00:06:19.340> i<00:06:19.370> zoom<00:06:19.639> out

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 
so it always gets blue when i zoom out

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:21.700 
so it always gets blue when i zoom out
like<00:06:19.940> that<00:06:20.090> I<00:06:20.120> don't<00:06:20.180> get<00:06:20.479> it<00:06:20.630> enough<00:06:21.590> to

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
like that I don't get it enough to

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.640 
like that I don't get it enough to
figure<00:06:22.009> that<00:06:22.130> out<00:06:22.270> and<00:06:23.270> then<00:06:23.630> I<00:06:24.080> added

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
figure that out and then I added

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.219 
figure that out and then I added
angelica<00:06:25.460> blush<00:06:25.729> from<00:06:26.030> NARS<00:06:26.330> on<00:06:26.750> my<00:06:26.900> cheeks
