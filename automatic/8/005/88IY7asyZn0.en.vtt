00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:08.184
 Now I will cook marzipan. 

00:00:08.184 --> 00:00:11.815
 For this, I will need almonds, 

00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:14.364
 fructose and some water. 

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:16.795
 Almond nuts must be peeled. 

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:19.469
 For this, I warmed up the water. 

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:23.868
 We plunge nuts into it. 

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:27.600
 Cook for 3 minutes. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.900
 Turn off the fire. 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.400
 We shift the nuts in a colander. 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.658
 Almond is cold. 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.670
 You can clean it. 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.531
 It is now easy to clean. 

00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:46.271
 Once - and you're done! 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.827
 Nuts cleaned. Now they are poured into a heated frying pan. 

00:00:54.827 --> 00:01:02.700
 Fry 10 minutes, stirring constantly. 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.633
 Nuts acquired golden color. 

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:15.113
 Turn off the fire. Pour almonds on a plate. 

00:01:15.113 --> 00:01:19.500
 Let them cool down a bit. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.367
 Pour almonds in the mill. 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.740
 We are closing. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.638
 Take the blender. 

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:52.415
 Grind to a state of flour. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.940
 Everything, I think enough. 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.240
 Pour into a plate. 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.210
 Neatly. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.200
 It smells so wonderful! 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.380
 Now we will make caramel. 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.900
 Put the pan on the fire. 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.112
 Pour some water. 

00:02:51.112 --> 00:02:57.000
 Add fructose. 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.720
 Now all this is mixing, make caramel. 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.900
 Fructose (or sugar) must be completely dissolved. 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:22.060
 Caramel boiled. Add almond flour. 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.770
 Make the fire smaller and mix. 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.073
 Cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.480
 Everything cooked. 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.860
 Turn off the fire and shift back to the plate. 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.000
 This mass should cool down a bit. 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.140
 Now we shift back to the mill. 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.460
 The mass was thick, so Iâ€™ll add some cold water. 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.500
 Then we'll see. 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.300
 Cover with a lid. 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.398
 Mix at first speed. 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.840
 Now mix at second speed. 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.120
 Enough. 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.200
 It turns out such a sticky mass. 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.643
 Marzipan is cold and, in principle, ready to eat. 

00:04:48.643 --> 00:04:50.470
 But that would be too easy. 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.960
 I decided to make marzipan sweets. 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.480
 For this, I need to melt the chocolate in a water bath. The water is already boiling. 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:08.210
 Break the chocolate here - let it melt itself. 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.180
 And I'll get some candy. 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.091
 For this, I take such a small piece of marzipan. 

00:05:20.091 --> 00:05:23.609
 I put any dried fruit in it. I have dogwood. 

00:05:23.609 --> 00:05:29.420
 Roll the ball. 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.580
 As in childhood we make candy from plasticine. 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.820
 One is ready. 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.880
 We do the following. 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.780
 Remarkably molded. 

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:53.739
 Chocolate has already melted. 

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:58.163
 I added another 1 tablespoon of sour cream to it, so that it was more liquid. 

00:05:58.163 --> 00:06:00.980
 Turn off the fire. 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:06.200
 I take marzipan candy. 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:13.800
 Wooden skewer We pierce. 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:20.297
 Dipping in chocolate. 

00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:23.497
 He spread something well. 

00:06:23.497 --> 00:06:28.107
 Wonderful. 

00:06:28.107 --> 00:06:30.780
 It turns out chocolate candy. 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.758
 We take an orange. 

00:06:34.758 --> 00:06:39.300
 So we pierce so that the chocolate evenly freezes. 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.380
 And last. 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.000
 Marzipan sweets are already frozen. 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.960
 They are ready. You can try. 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.320
 We take for the wand. 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.420
 Let's try. 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.380
 So tasty!..
