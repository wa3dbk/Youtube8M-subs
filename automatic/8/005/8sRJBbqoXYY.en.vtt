00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.270 
pretendo because i think it's just 23
cards<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> whole<00:01:40.049> set<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.619> you're

cards in the whole set and you're

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.260 
cards in the whole set and you're
getting<00:01:41.460> 14<00:01:42.270> /<00:01:42.960> 10<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:44.040> yeah<00:01:44.189> there's<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
getting 14 / 10 so yeah there's not a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.760 
getting 14 / 10 so yeah there's not a
whole<00:01:45.540> lot<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.840> friday<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:46.619> what

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
whole lot of friday but that's what

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.960 
whole lot of friday but that's what
makes<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.009> awesome<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.369> well<00:01:47.549> because<00:01:47.850> if

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
makes it awesome as well because if

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.190 
makes it awesome as well because if
you're<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.299> looking<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.630> master<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you're really looking for master was you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.539 
you're really looking for master was you
have<00:01:49.290> pretty<00:01:49.470> good<00:01:49.619> chance<00:01:49.829> again<00:01:50.159> them<00:01:50.280> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
have pretty good chance again them I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.090 
have pretty good chance again them I
think<00:01:51.450> assets<00:01:51.810> must<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:52.079> kind<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.740> pain<00:01:53.070> to

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
think assets must be kind of a pain to

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.289 
think assets must be kind of a pain to
get<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:55.520> but<00:01:56.520> hopefully<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:56.969> at<00:01:57.030> least<00:01:57.119> get

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
get but but hopefully we at least get

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:09.559 
get but but hopefully we at least get
one<00:02:00.020> see
