00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 So, if our first question is 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.480
 Why are you having such a stupid exchange? 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.429

 I think it's cool things. 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.210
 in the head on a question because it speaks 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.590

 São Paulo is here in my house of the minor 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.930
 But I still moved to São Paulo and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.650
 I came back now to launch the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.260

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.470
 things are very simple yet only 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.000
 got pit houses bahia but the beginning 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.439
 It's like the money to be able to make 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.090
 something a little cooler but I 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.430
 I like the house very rustic about the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.940

 I like a beach so it 's very cool and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.380
 but this is a type of decoration that 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.670
 delay to be ready knows to oblige 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.440

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.110
 I bought a little something to travel to a 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.740
 place to meet another such thing then 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.240

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.800
 What I like is what it is to write and speak 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.430

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.440
