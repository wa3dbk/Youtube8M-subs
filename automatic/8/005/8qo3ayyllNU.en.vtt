00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
few special sounds that you don't

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.400 
few special sounds that you don't
normally<00:00:19.640> find<00:00:20.119> in<00:00:20.360> other<00:00:20.599> orchestral

normally find in other orchestral

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.700 
normally find in other orchestral
collections<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.490> let's<00:00:22.640> talk<00:00:22.790> about<00:00:23.000> those

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
collections so let's talk about those

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.380 
collections so let's talk about those
over<00:00:24.710> here<00:00:24.860> we<00:00:24.980> have<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.430> elements<00:00:26.000> section

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
over here we have the elements section

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.870 
over here we have the elements section
in<00:00:27.290> the<00:00:27.410> elements<00:00:27.800> section<00:00:28.160> you<00:00:28.250> have<00:00:28.279> mainly

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
in the elements section you have mainly

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.260 
in the elements section you have mainly
elements<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:30.200> are<00:00:30.410> individual<00:00:31.270> instruments

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
elements that are individual instruments

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.270 
elements that are individual instruments
and<00:00:32.480> sounds<00:00:32.960> that<00:00:33.350> are<00:00:33.410> designed<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:33.860> be<00:00:34.040> used

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
and sounds that are designed to be used

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.800 
and sounds that are designed to be used
in<00:00:34.550> combat

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
in combat

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.229 
in combat
you<00:00:36.230> have<00:00:36.440> dynamic<00:00:36.829> performance<00:00:37.820> elements

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
you have dynamic performance elements

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.920 
you have dynamic performance elements
and<00:00:38.420> these<00:00:39.410> are<00:00:39.710> full<00:00:40.219> orchestras<00:00:40.910> that<00:00:41.780> are

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
and these are full orchestras that are

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.220 
and these are full orchestras that are
designed<00:00:42.289> to<00:00:42.530> be<00:00:43.120> used<00:00:44.120> for<00:00:44.359> saving<00:00:44.870> pull<00:00:45.079> if

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
designed to be used for saving pull if

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.750 
designed to be used for saving pull if
any<00:00:45.440> if<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:45.649> wanted<00:00:45.890> to<00:00:45.980> build<00:00:46.160> up<00:00:46.429> a<00:00:46.519> full

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
any if you wanted to build up a full

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.509 
any if you wanted to build up a full
orchestra<00:00:46.940> sound<00:00:47.480> with<00:00:48.440> changing<00:00:48.980> dynamics

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
orchestra sound with changing dynamics

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:58.430 
orchestra sound with changing dynamics
so<00:00:50.149> you<00:00:50.210> have<00:00:50.510> for<00:00:51.079> instance

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.520 

that<00:00:59.280> one<00:00:59.430> has<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.760> brass<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.530> especially

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that one has more brass in it especially

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.170 
that one has more brass in it especially
when<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.039> play<00:01:02.309> harder<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.000> are

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
when you play harder because these are

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:12.170 
when you play harder because these are
setup<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.719> dynamic<00:01:04.259> switching

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.370 

so<00:01:13.180> those<00:01:13.330> are<00:01:13.450> dynamic<00:01:13.870> performance

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
so those are dynamic performance

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.070 
so those are dynamic performance

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
give to pull the ear over here we have

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.350 
give to pull the ear over here we have
the<00:01:46.840> percussion<00:01:47.320> elements<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:48.149> these<00:01:49.149> are

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
the percussion elements and these are

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.300 
the percussion elements and these are
designed<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.930> be<00:01:50.020> used<00:01:50.350> within<00:01:50.710> calm<00:01:51.070> bees

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
designed to be used within calm bees

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.609 
designed to be used within calm bees
they<00:01:51.970> are<00:01:52.210> instruments<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:53.110> are<00:01:53.229> mapped<00:01:53.440> to

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
they are instruments that are mapped to

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.260 
they are instruments that are mapped to
create<00:01:53.800> their<00:01:53.920> single<00:01:54.280> instruments<00:01:55.060> mapped

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
create their single instruments mapped

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.620 
create their single instruments mapped
across<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.840> entire<00:01:56.140> keyboard<00:01:56.440> so<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:56.890> have

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
across the entire keyboard so you have

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.219 
across the entire keyboard so you have
individual<00:01:59.220> chimes<00:02:00.220> bells<00:02:01.229> they're

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
individual chimes bells they're

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.520 
individual chimes bells they're
initially<00:02:02.710> mapped<00:02:03.539> with<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.780> same<00:02:05.020> pitch<00:02:05.320> and

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
initially mapped with the same pitch and

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.859 
initially mapped with the same pitch and
this<00:02:05.649> allows<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.250> take<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:07.210> pitch<00:02:07.600> and

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
this allows you to take that pitch and

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.979 
this allows you to take that pitch and
with<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.259> range<00:02:08.679> function<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:10.239> can<00:02:10.450> set<00:02:10.720> up<00:02:10.869> a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
with the range function you can set up a

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.590 
with the range function you can set up a
split<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.530> can<00:02:11.560> have<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.550> same<00:02:12.760> pitch<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.390> a

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
split you can have the same pitch in a

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.810 
split you can have the same pitch in a
certain<00:02:14.200> area<00:02:14.530> but<00:02:14.560> you<00:02:14.769> can<00:02:14.920> also<00:02:15.100> use<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
certain area but you can also use in the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.479 
certain area but you can also use in the
macro<00:02:16.269> section<00:02:16.750> something<00:02:17.560> called<00:02:17.799> P<00:02:18.100> scale

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
macro section something called P scale

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.960 
macro section something called P scale
and<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.930> allows<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.860> actually<00:02:21.489> set

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
and this allows you to actually set

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:32.179 
and this allows you to actually set
pitch<00:02:22.450> scaling<00:02:26.760> across<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.180> keyboard

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.949 

that<00:02:33.189> can<00:02:33.430> be<00:02:33.579> very<00:02:33.819> handy<00:02:34.030> for<00:02:34.420> your<00:02:34.689> coffee

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959
