00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.130
 and here in Brazil the concern is another one made by the 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.800
 national statistics agency released today but has a 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.789
 alarming by 2015 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.559
 Brazilian cities will have serious supply problems. 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.099
 water from every five liters of fresh water from the planet in the state the territory 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.130
 Brazilian study of the national water agency provokes this 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.980
 patrimony 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.740
 does not mean safety of the flap if the cement if the systems of capture and 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.910
 not receive investments of 22 billion reais 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.490
 in the next 4 years 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.740
 by 2025 more than half of the cities can be dry 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.809
 the act both waters indicates 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.949
 In the southern region only 16% of municipalities need to expand 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.780
 and in the Midwest, most of the works would be concentrated in 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.519
 two days 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.120
 and in the federal district its investments in funding 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.769
 the water is in force the collection is the sewage treatment 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.299
 are absolute priorities 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.139
 to lose water points in my house would require investing 50 billion 

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:16.219
 so the contaminated water already has the menu above 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.340
 not be consumed a few miles down the river the federal district has 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.779
 than 100% of sewage treated in 99% of the population as water on tap 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.820
 nonetheless to avoid shortages during periods of drought 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.520
 In the next years 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.570
 the brasiliense will have to resort to lake paranoá 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.979
 inside the city 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.829
 and to the corumbá dam 4 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.110
 more than 100 kilometers from here the applause of the water also revealed that the 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.289
 greater difficulty is in the north and northeast 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.719
 investments or sedans but would be needed to turn 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:57.909
 two regions in cities like Traipú in the interior of Alagoas empty cisterns 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.670
 deactivated wells 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.240
 but from where comes the water that would kill to distract because the barriers that always 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.620
 were considered to be thanks to the northeastern sertaneja region 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.930
 they are large natural reservoirs of water that in the long 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.239
 drought periods 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.599
 if you try to kill 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.659
 the seat of the animals only that here enters and little in the agreste Alagoas the barriers 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:20.429
 go beyond 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.159
 they guarantee the survival of the population 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.699
 muddy water day salu 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:29.699
 the same where the wild animals are appealing to the deadlines what is 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:30.439
 more curious 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.349
 I do not do anything, either. 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.150
 if she is from the senate 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.209
 is one with time and worthy 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.849
 the southeast is the driest region of the country 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.839
 also needs money 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:47.249
 7.5 billion reais to improve water distribution twenty-five 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:51.160
 liters per day this is the minimum for a person to have 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.199
 take a bath 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:57.209
 the problem is that even in water it is not about inequality in Brazil 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:05.419
 those who live in the outskirts of são paulo have only 15 meters of water available 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:06.799
 daily 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.420
 already who lives in the central district has up to 400 liters the numbers are of the institute 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:19.339
 vitae civilis the problem of the metropolis is the coordination too many people and lack 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:20.769
 infrastructure 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.870
 the largest city in Brazil would already have serious supply problems 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.980
 I can is the system that allows to withdraw the water of distant places the city 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.659
 grows because of coffee 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.859
 you need to be aware of getting stronger 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.859
 but we are flying over one of the main supply 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.749
 Metropolitan region of Sao Paulo 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:46.039
 is the major part of the general 'tetonic' water to meet the 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:50.219
 need for those who live in the São Paulo capital the rivers that cut the city already 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:54.409
 were sources of water for the residents but were banned by the 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:01.200
 urban landscape we are the yellow light thomas tuesday we have gian c 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.819
 recovery as 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.600
 with preservation in the final stage 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.450
 with improving the quality of housing for people living in the 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.990
 in São Paulo with the withdrawal of families that are in the area of 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.350
 environmental preservation in rio de janeiro 'the disorderly growth 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.580
 harms even the least developed areas of the 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.400
 we are in rio de janeiro and more 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.770
 in this neighborhood of Tijuca and Jacarepaguá with 800 thousand inhabitants gathered for all 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.229
 the sides but quantity or necessarily means quality 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.160
 you see, even the drinking water that comes home is 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.040
 for borges who suffer from the action the sea when it is one of the signs of aggression 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.330
 to the environment and it is quite visible until the refrigerator is discarded 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.479
 I'm not 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.419
 is redecard some guests of some metals what are 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.360
 opinion that the concentrations are paulo secom 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.639
 the sewer is posted to the invoice 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:06.379
 150 condominiums that refuse to connect with the treatment network of the 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:12.100
 state company have already been notified and can be fined fifty thousand 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:12.900
 real 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.000
 the question 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.370
 the person pays another 30 reais per month a sewage rate 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.589
 to have commanded the event of ipods system 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:25.559
 I've had it unpolluted, it's going to be a campaign with Rio 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:29.050
 more than 40 are another proof of the disregard of nature 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.370
 plants proliferate where there is organic waste 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:37.040
 your interest does not come after 20 hours of work it will take five 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.949
 pounds of tilapia home 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.949
 the fishing was already much better can be already caught 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.349
 already forgot password forty once protest
