00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.720
 new video in which I'm going 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.370
 introduce you to how I realized 1 and 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.139
 the feather on the waves 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.639
 so I realized this is theirs on the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.349
 new collection the life in pink of the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.700
 brand rm cosmetics that I have to matify 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.700
 good I present it to you immediately 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.270
 for those born wide and apply a 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.830
 different color on each nail and 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.020
 I mattify the different pink to 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.489
 using math fixer I start with 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.410
 apply a drop of acrylic paint 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.150
 white on a palette and with a 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 fine brush I'm going to start by pulling 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.300
 acrylic paint 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.739
 yeah I take a dictation that I the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.940
 draws and I work it I turn my 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.920
 brush for who we really are 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.470
 uniform way on the brush and I'm going 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.089
 start by drawing the middle rod 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.039
 from my pen have for this pen I have 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.480
 realized a model so that the 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.879
 rain be a little bit laid on a 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.649
 support so in fact there the taste of the 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.509
 feather and a little bit raised so that's 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.979
 for that I curved the end and 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.750
 Then I will add several 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.090
 lines tight enough the finest possible 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.009
 so for that I say the painting he 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.600
 must one and very little on the brush and 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.160
 so I'm fine I'll make enough 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.160
 bushy this tip that rises 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.330
 once I made my tip 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.970
 now I 'm going to come on the basis of 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.990
 the pen and I wanted the hairs 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.060
 are a little bit in battle 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.620
 so you see I'm starting from the base 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.630
 of the rod and I pull them towards 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.920
 the outside here there for the video for 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.940
 that you see better scheifele inverse 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.430
 but it's true that it's always better 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.540
 from the base and stretch the 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.010
 outward trait because the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.710
 trait be more crazy will be more end on 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.360
 the end so there to make this render 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.220
 a little bit in battle I made some 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.870
 lines so for now that tend 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.030
 towards the tip of the pen and after I 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.930
 did a little bit upside down etc and 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.100
 I did them a little bit 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.060
 intersecting to really give a 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.060
 small side of the hair 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.440
 and then in the middle I drew 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.790
 rather straight lines this time for 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.530
 really give a little more side 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.860
 dense and less stock at the base of my 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.860
 pen years 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.040
 we 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.600
 and so there the little tip for the end 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.910
 it is very important sailboats of 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.650
 add strokes after at the base for 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.540
 to really do as if the equal was coming out 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.670
 of this stem because otherwise if you 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.020
 leave an interstice in the wrong between 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.090
 all the hairs that you did and 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.260
 this island where it's really not going to do 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.660
 realize it's going really we're gonna have 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.400
 the impression that the stoves fly so 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.760
 here is thinking of adding titles 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.760
 and at the end 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.770
 so here as I am on a base 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.300
 match I can not apply top 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.490
 coat all over the surface of my nail 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.380
 otherwise all very bright and we would lose 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.450
 this morning so I'm applying 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.100
 my top coat with a thin brush only 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.920
 on the cure this way I can 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.300
 keep the matt side with the decor so 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.470
 this tutorial is now over I you 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.880

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.680
