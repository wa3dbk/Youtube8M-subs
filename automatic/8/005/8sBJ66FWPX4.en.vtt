00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.440 
with the buffing brush one day I decided
to<00:02:01.020> use<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:01.829> fun<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.969> actually

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to use this just for fun and it actually

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.770 
to use this just for fun and it actually
works<00:02:04.320> pretty<00:02:04.469> well<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:05.369> my<00:02:05.670> opinion<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.360> does

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
works pretty well in my opinion it does

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.570 
works pretty well in my opinion it does
take<00:02:07.049> some<00:02:07.229> time<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:08.069> such<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> small

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
take some time because it's such a small

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.870 
take some time because it's such a small
brush<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.420> do<00:02:09.629> have<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.080> patient<00:02:10.289> with<00:02:10.560> it

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
brush you do have to be patient with it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.120 
brush you do have to be patient with it
you<00:02:11.000> can't<00:02:11.690> just<00:02:11.990> like<00:02:12.170> buff<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.710> in<00:02:12.830> all<00:02:13.100> at

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
you can't just like buff it in all at

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.430 
you can't just like buff it in all at
once<00:02:13.340> but<00:02:13.820> i<00:02:14.210> think<00:02:14.570> this<00:02:14.690> one<00:02:14.930> works<00:02:15.140> pretty

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
once but i think this one works pretty

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.920 
once but i think this one works pretty
well<00:02:15.590> i<00:02:15.980> also<00:02:16.370> use<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.940> elf<00:02:17.150> small<00:02:17.510> stipple

naked<00:03:45.709> foundation<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.820> guess<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.360> has<00:03:47.570> what<00:03:47.930> you

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
naked foundation I guess it has what you

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.960 
naked foundation I guess it has what you
would<00:03:48.470> call<00:03:48.740> a<00:03:49.010> natural<00:03:49.970> finish<00:03:50.450> foundation

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
would call a natural finish foundation

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.660 
would call a natural finish foundation
but<00:03:52.970> overall<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.080> great<00:03:54.380> foundation

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
the market for a drugstore foundation

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.600 
the market for a drugstore foundation
something<00:04:03.200> that's<00:04:03.350> natural<00:04:03.560> look<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.280> blends

something that's natural look and blends
easily<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.480> has<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.750> medium<00:04:06.350> coverage<00:04:06.740> I<00:04:06.920> would

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
easily and has a medium coverage I would

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.710 
easily and has a medium coverage I would
recommend<00:04:07.760> checking<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.360> Revlon<00:04:08.690> nearly

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720

naked foundation out first I used to

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.090 
naked foundation out first I used to
think<00:04:11.660> that<00:04:11.780> Revlon<00:04:12.230> foundation<00:04:12.770> sucked

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
think that Revlon foundation sucked

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.130 
think that Revlon foundation sucked
because<00:04:13.670> I<00:04:14.030> didn't<00:04:14.420> like<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.780> Revlon

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
because I didn't like the Revlon

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
Colorstay and I didn't like the Revlon
