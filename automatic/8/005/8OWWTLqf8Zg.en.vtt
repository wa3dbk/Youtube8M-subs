00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.500
 i 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.809
 Your route is the leading brand in the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.520
 I mean hybrid production 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.020
 those that combine a conventional engine 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.750
 with an electric one 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.170
 the most successful model is the cold that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.500
 sells since 1997 and that in his last 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.940
 generation added the plug-in version 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.440
 pluggable with larger batteries than 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.170
 can be uploaded to the home network 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.360
 in order to have more autonomy in the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 purely electric mode but the brand 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 Japanese today takes a very important step 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.750
 with the release of the mir there is a model 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.420
 totally electric that is capable of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.220
 produce your own electricity from 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.350
 of hydrogen that stores in two 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.390
 tanks and the oxygen that is in the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 atmosphere a fuel cell of 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.800
 last generation located under the floor 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.110
 of the car is where the union of the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.300
 hydrogen and oxygen in a process that 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.550
 produces water but also releases 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.409
 electricity is just that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.049
 electricity that feeds the engine 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.799
 totally electric and with a power 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.060
 of about 155 horsepower that is 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.060
 Applies to the front wheels 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.490
 with this technology he looks and like all 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.920
 cars with fuel cells do not 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.990
 emits pollutants to the environment and 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.000
 difference from electric cars that 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.579
 They need to plug their batteries in 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.090
 recharge has an extensive autonomy of 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.280
 500 kilometers and the recharge of its 122 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.549
 liters of hydrogen demand little time 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.350
 between 3 and 5 minutes at the moment in the 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.929
 there are few hydrogen stations 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.030
 that's why he looks and launched himself alone in japan 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.580
 where it occurs but now it will arrive 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.310
 also california and some countries 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.679
 Europeans like germany denmark and the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.679
 United Kingdom where there are recharging points 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.899
 the miray is a sedan with the width of a 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.020
 corolla but much longer reaching 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.119
 the 4 with 85 meters a measure that will 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.549
 allows to host all the components of the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.410
 propulsion system including a 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.900
 back battery that store the 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.280
 electricity that does not use the motor and 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.190
 that can be recharged too 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.140
 taking advantage of the braking energy 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.300
 its design is very particular and futuristic 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.100
 both on the front of hard lines and 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.410
 huge air intakes like in the area 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.830
 later with a curious format of 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.830
 optical 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.250
 inside the on-board panel has 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.050
 some similarities with the prius with 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.880
 instrumentation hundred percent 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.800
 digital that also allows to see the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.380
 operating system stack 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.720
 fuel in real time and to be a 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.000
 So long car offers a large space 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.700
 interior especially for the two 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.500
 occupants of the rear seats other than 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.690
 the advantages of relocating the battery 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.210
 fuel under the floor is that it 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.670
 gets a low center of gravity by 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.860
 that he looks and is an agile and stable car 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.170
 in driving what they play against 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.050
 the change is the weight that exceeds the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.420
 1,800 kilos that's why it does not have big 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.580
 benefits but the 9 seconds that 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.830
 need to accelerate from 0 to 100 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.830
 kilometers per hour are not bad 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.660
 toyota expects to sell 500 this year 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.320
 Mirage units and that in Europe 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.200
 will cost a high 66 thousand euros in 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.450
 Usa will be cheaper about fifty and 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.760
 six thousand dollars although there is already talk of 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.680
 strong state grants look there 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.560
 is a Japanese word that refers to the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.450
 future and is well assigned to this car 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.540
 which is one of the first to come out 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.180
 market with cold fcb technology 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.520
 servei club ie vehicle with battery 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.350
 of fuel this is undoubtedly a 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.570
 type of alternative propulsion that 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.850
 could successfully replace the 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.950
 fossil fuels such as naphtha and 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.040
 gasoil that are much more 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.050
 pollutants and causes of the unwanted 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.050
 greenhouse effect on our planet 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.800
 yes i think so
