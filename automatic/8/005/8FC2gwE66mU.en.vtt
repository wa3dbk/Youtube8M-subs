soak these however if you're not using a
unit<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.259> you're<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.860> using<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
unit like this if you're not using a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.370 
unit like this if you're not using a
really<00:01:36.329> strong<00:01:37.759> blender<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.119> would<00:01:39.930> recommend

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
really strong blender I would recommend

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.020 
really strong blender I would recommend
you<00:01:40.560> either<00:01:40.680> keep<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.040> dates<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
you either keep the dates out of the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.050 
you either keep the dates out of the
fridge<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.360> about<00:01:43.340> half<00:01:44.340> an<00:01:44.490> hour<00:01:44.610> before<00:01:44.759> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
fridge for about half an hour before you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120 
fridge for about half an hour before you
use<00:01:45.270> them<00:01:45.479> warm<00:01:46.259> them<00:01:46.530> up

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
use them warm them up

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.160 
use them warm them up
with<00:01:47.310> some<00:01:47.520> hot<00:01:47.700> water<00:01:47.969> or<00:01:48.299> zap<00:01:48.840> them<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
with some hot water or zap them in the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.010 
with some hot water or zap them in the
microwave<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.810> quite

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
microwave because it they can be quite

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620 
microwave because it they can be quite
chewy<00:01:52.350> yeah<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.880> difficult<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> mix

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
chewy yeah and can be difficult to mix

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.469 
chewy yeah and can be difficult to mix
up<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.409> makes<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.799> easier<00:01:56.479> when

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
up so that just makes it easier when

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.929 
up so that just makes it easier when
you're<00:01:57.630> blending<00:01:57.840> them<00:01:58.200> yep<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.220> case<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.729> put

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
you're blending them yep the case we put

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.969 
you're blending them yep the case we put
this<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.600> we're<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.619> blend<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
this on and we're going to blend it

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.350 
this on and we're going to blend it
that's<00:02:04.979> happening<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.820> actually<00:02:06.210> look

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that's happening now so we actually look

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.859 
that's happening now so we actually look
at<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:07.399> see<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.519> all<00:02:08.720> coming<00:02:09.720> together

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
at that see it's all coming together

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.990 
at that see it's all coming together
nicely<00:02:10.259> with<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:11.130> digging<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.700> somehow

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
nicely with little digging and somehow

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.640 
nicely with little digging and somehow

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
really nice and summery and then I'm

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.590 
really nice and summery and then I'm
going<00:06:19.330> to<00:06:19.480> add<00:06:19.950> gelatin<00:06:20.950> and<00:06:21.430> then<00:06:22.270> we'll<00:06:22.420> mix

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
going to add gelatin and then we'll mix

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.080 
going to add gelatin and then we'll mix
again<00:06:24.840> I've<00:06:25.840> probably<00:06:26.080> put<00:06:26.500> it<00:06:26.650> in<00:06:26.770> too<00:06:26.980> hot<00:06:27.220> so

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
again I've probably put it in too hot so

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.790 
again I've probably put it in too hot so
putting<00:06:28.420> it<00:06:28.570> in<00:06:28.630> a<00:06:28.720> dry<00:06:28.960> pan<00:06:29.170> I've<00:06:29.320> got<00:06:29.470> just<00:06:29.650> to

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
putting it in a dry pan I've got just to

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.980 
putting it in a dry pan I've got just to
melt<00:06:29.980> it<00:06:30.250> that<00:06:30.580> needs<00:06:30.820> to<00:06:31.060> be<00:06:31.090> yes<00:06:31.450> and<00:06:31.720> it

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
melt it that needs to be yes and it

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.680 
melt it that needs to be yes and it
needs<00:06:32.170> to<00:06:32.320> be<00:06:32.440> a<00:06:32.470> nonstick<00:06:33.010> okay<00:06:33.880> yeah<00:06:34.450> I<00:06:34.480> can

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
needs to be a nonstick okay yeah I can

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.010 
needs to be a nonstick okay yeah I can
see<00:06:34.870> how<00:06:35.020> well<00:06:35.260> that's<00:06:35.410> worked<00:06:36.660> okay<00:06:37.660> so<00:06:37.720> we

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
see how well that's worked okay so we

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:49.840 
see how well that's worked okay so we
just

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:07:08.900 

and<00:06:50.850> then<00:06:50.940> we'll<00:06:51.090> pour<00:06:51.300> it<00:06:51.390> into<00:06:51.540> the<00:06:51.690> crust<00:07:07.910> so

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
and then we'll pour it into the crust so

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.640 
and then we'll pour it into the crust so
you<00:07:09.000> need<00:07:09.210> to<00:07:09.450> process<00:07:09.840> it<00:07:10.110> with<00:07:10.440> whatever

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
you need to process it with whatever

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.590 
you need to process it with whatever
machine<00:07:11.220> that<00:07:11.430> you've<00:07:11.580> got<00:07:11.850> until<00:07:12.150> it's

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:12.600 
machine that you've got until it's

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.120 
machine that you've got until it's
smooth<00:07:12.990> and<00:07:13.320> you<00:07:13.380> don't<00:07:13.590> have<00:07:13.770> the<00:07:13.890> grainy

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
smooth and you don't have the grainy

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.960 
smooth and you don't have the grainy
bits<00:07:14.400> of<00:07:14.520> blueberry<00:07:15.680> try<00:07:16.680> it<00:07:16.820> with<00:07:17.820> the

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
bits of blueberry try it with the
