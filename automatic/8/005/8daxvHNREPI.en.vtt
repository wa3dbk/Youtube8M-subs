00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
about some of the important stuff in

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.240 
about some of the important stuff in
here<00:02:09.330> first<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.929> all<00:02:10.050> quad-core<00:02:10.649> very

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
here first of all quad-core very

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.680 
here first of all quad-core very
important<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.060> four<00:02:12.390> cores

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
important you have four cores

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.940 
important you have four cores

are<00:02:13.980> going<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.160> run<00:02:14.250> very<00:02:14.610> fast<00:02:14.849> so<00:02:15.090> if<00:02:15.150> you

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
are going to run very fast so if you

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.900 
are going to run very fast so if you
have<00:02:15.390> programs<00:02:15.870> they<00:02:16.319> use<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> lot<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.800> CPU<00:02:17.400> this

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
have programs they use a lot of CPU this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.860 
have programs they use a lot of CPU this
is<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.209> be<00:02:18.300> great<00:02:18.510> for<00:02:18.660> them<00:02:18.750> in

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
is going to be great for them in

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.089 
is going to be great for them in
particular<00:02:19.470> especially<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:19.920> they're

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.259 
now and see how much free space you have
and<00:03:18.690> then<00:03:18.870> imagine<00:03:19.079> going<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.609> 640<00:03:20.609> gigabytes

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
put a ton of stuff in there now also

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.699 
put a ton of stuff in there now also
let's<00:03:27.660> talk<00:03:27.780> about<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.079> graphics<00:03:28.410> on<00:03:28.530> here

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
let's talk about the graphics on here

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.990 
let's talk about the graphics on here
again<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> said<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.459> doesn't<00:03:29.579> have<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.790> video

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
again I said it doesn't have a video

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.879 
again I said it doesn't have a video
card<00:03:30.239> but<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.600> does<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> very<00:03:30.810> good<00:03:31.200> onboard

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
card but it does a very good onboard

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.640 
card but it does a very good onboard
graphics<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.430> has<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.700> GMA<00:03:33.150> 3100<00:03:33.959> intel

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
graphics it has the GMA 3100 intel

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.860 
graphics it has the GMA 3100 intel
integrated<00:03:34.980> chipset<00:03:35.639> for<00:03:35.819> graphics<00:03:36.209> that's

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
integrated chipset for graphics that's

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.300 
integrated chipset for graphics that's
an<00:03:36.989> onboard<00:03:37.350> graphics<00:03:37.440> solution<00:03:37.980> but<00:03:38.190> it

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
an onboard graphics solution but it

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.530 
an onboard graphics solution but it
works<00:03:38.459> very<00:03:38.670> well<00:03:38.819> it's<00:03:39.090> actually<00:03:39.329> one<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.480> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
works very well it's actually one of the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.509 
works very well it's actually one of the
higher-end<00:03:39.810> onboard<00:03:40.680> graphics<00:03:40.769> setups<00:03:41.370> and

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
higher-end onboard graphics setups and

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.370 
higher-end onboard graphics setups and
you<00:03:41.910> can<00:03:42.030> actually<00:03:42.120> do<00:03:42.329> just<00:03:42.510> about<00:03:42.569> anyone<00:03:43.139> if

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
you can actually do just about anyone if

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.960 
you can actually do just about anyone if
you<00:03:43.470> wanted<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.769> decode<00:03:44.160> blu-rays<00:03:44.579> on<00:03:44.730> here

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
you wanted to decode blu-rays on here

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.970 
you wanted to decode blu-rays on here
and<00:03:45.030> add<00:03:45.150> an<00:03:45.269> optional<00:03:45.389> DVD<00:03:45.930> burner<00:03:46.200> or

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
and add an optional DVD burner or

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.490 
and add an optional DVD burner or
blu-ray<00:03:47.430> player<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.299> could<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.900> wouldn't<00:03:49.260> be

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
blu-ray player you could it wouldn't be

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.410 
blu-ray player you could it wouldn't be
a<00:03:49.530> problem<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.250> just<00:03:50.489> keep<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:51.000> mind<00:03:51.209> as

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
a problem so just keep that in mind as

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.970 
a problem so just keep that in mind as
you<00:03:52.079> think<00:03:52.290> about<00:03:52.350> stuff<00:03:52.620> like<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.769> you

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
you think about stuff like that you

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.830 
you think about stuff like that you
don't<00:03:53.010> actually<00:03:53.430> need<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.730> do<00:03:54.030> get<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.569> video

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
don't actually need to do get a video

don't actually need to do get a video
card<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.139> do<00:03:55.260> simple<00:03:55.470> stuff<00:03:55.799> like<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:55.980> it

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
card to do simple stuff like that it

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.339 
card to do simple stuff like that it
will<00:03:56.459> work<00:03:56.489> great<00:03:56.880> just<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.420> way<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.780> again

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
will work great just the way it is again

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.720 
will work great just the way it is again
it<00:03:58.470> comes<00:03:58.560> with<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.829> keyboard<00:03:59.069> mouse

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730
