00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
pressure things like that so we made a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:12.969 
pressure things like that so we made a
splash<00:01:08.270> put<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.420> finger<00:01:09.689> underneath<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.290> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
okay - you give it to get seven Mentos

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.780 
okay - you give it to get seven Mentos
this<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.619> an<00:01:25.740> experiment<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.430> seven

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
this is actually an experiment of seven

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.240 
this is actually an experiment of seven
I<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.360> seven<00:01:27.780> Mentos<00:01:28.200> already<00:01:28.680> donate<00:01:29.070> all

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
I have seven Mentos already donate all

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.190 
I have seven Mentos already donate all
right<00:01:29.400> guys<00:01:29.549> no<00:01:29.820> mental<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.570> that's<00:01:31.049> just

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
right guys no mental but that's just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.870 
right guys no mental but that's just
because<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.710> morning<00:01:32.040> breath<00:01:32.280> okay<00:01:32.820> you

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
because in the morning breath okay you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.789 
because in the morning breath okay you
need<00:01:33.119> some<00:01:33.270> more<00:01:33.420> no<00:01:33.540> kidding<00:01:34.439> well<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.650> don't

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
need some more no kidding well I don't

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.920 
need some more no kidding well I don't
think<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:34.979> got<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.450> did<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.540> hear<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
think I got so did you hear that

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.469 
think I got so did you hear that
yes<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.560> didn't<00:01:37.770> laugh<00:01:37.950> though<00:01:38.220> did<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.610> no

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.010 

okay

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
okay

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.960 
okay
I<00:01:46.200> guess<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.560> should<00:01:46.770> say<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.310> Mentos<00:01:47.729> have

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
I guess I should say the Mentos have

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.030 
I guess I should say the Mentos have
little<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.689> pits<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.229> them<00:01:49.350> okay<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
little little pits in them okay and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.920 
little little pits in them okay and
that's<00:01:50.280> why<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.520> works<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.810> get

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that's why this works because they get

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.410 
that's why this works because they get
the<00:01:52.020> carbon<00:01:52.320> dioxide<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.979> there<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:54.240> makes

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
the carbon dioxide in there and it makes
