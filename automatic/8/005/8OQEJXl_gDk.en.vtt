00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.780
 word let's see how the c goes 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.760
 evolution 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.080
 here we are in the dynamic setting 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.930
 hence the most performing of the four 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.690
 the starting point is good but 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.440
 especially with the launch of the area that 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.440
 it follows 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.979
 naturally incredible 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.760
 which showcases as soon as you notice 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.760
 the gas knob 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.259
 the engine brake is also important 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:53.180
 this setting the dynamic one but 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.020
 above all they are amazing 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.020
 performance indeed 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.680
 let's try to change the setting 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.070
 through the button on the control 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.660
 right from dynamic we pass eco pro 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.660
 therefore the least performing 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.750
 couple drops considerably 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.600
 if however the engine brake slightly 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.660
 top of my decline to top up 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.210
 battery 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.090
 the most suitable setting for the 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.060
 energy saving 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.459
 also to maximize that 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.459
 that the autonomy granted by the challenge 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.079
 the disease can really good 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.260
 important pisa own is open in the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.940
 guide 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.760
 I wanted to say as if he were doing well 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.000
 uphill departures 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.460
 the cue is excellent 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.460
 and the couple always amazing 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.230
 the only one signed in total silence 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:00.420
 noise that you hear that 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.420
 obviously the rustling of the area 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.590
 the aerodynamic protection in fact the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.720
 excellent name would take a 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.720
 plexiglass a mouse higher 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.120
 a defect in driving is difficult 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.650
 identify them 1 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.580
 actually the only thing that leaves some 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.290
 perplexed is the action of recovery 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.340
 braking energy that acts for the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.340
 engine brake 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.210
 important engine comes in and from this 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.669
 function that you can travel in the city 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.980
 practically without acting on the brakes 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.080
 the problem, however, is that it does not turn on 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.490
 stop then who follows 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.820
 we are not advised that we are 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.820
 braking
