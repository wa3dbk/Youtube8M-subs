told me it kind of has something to do
with<00:02:50.510> quantum<00:02:50.750> physics<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.440> other<00:02:51.950> person

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
with quantum physics the other person

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.530 
with quantum physics the other person
you<00:02:52.430> know<00:02:52.550> city<00:02:52.880> basically<00:02:53.090> looks<00:02:53.450> like

you know city basically looks like

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.420 
you know city basically looks like
different<00:02:53.810> wavelets<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:54.800> forth<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.220> in

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
different wavelets and so forth to in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.750 
different wavelets and so forth to in
two<00:02:55.580> different<00:02:55.940> dimensions<00:02:57.160> saw<00:02:58.160> me<00:02:58.370> not<00:02:58.519> that

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
two different dimensions saw me not that

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.710 
two different dimensions saw me not that
it's<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.269> really<00:02:59.570> cool<00:02:59.810> either<00:03:00.019> way<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.630> I

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
it's just really cool either way and I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.330 
it's just really cool either way and I
just<00:03:05.750> want<00:03:06.080> to<00:03:06.140> scroll<00:03:06.440> down<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:06.890> you<00:03:06.920> guys<00:03:07.130> can

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
just want to scroll down so you guys can

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.590 
just want to scroll down so you guys can
actually<00:03:07.459> see<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.450> check<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.750> out

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.390 

so<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.630> think<00:03:14.840> it's<00:03:14.960> really<00:03:15.200> cool<00:03:15.380> maybe<00:03:16.160> look
