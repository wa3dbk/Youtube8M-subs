00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.530
 in March 2005 these phones source of all life smiles on him 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.710
 it takes exactly the functions of the k750 but says they add in mode

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.650
 this vote what is it 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.070

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.510
 musical 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.510

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.070

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.630
 sound advanced audio management ie an equalizer on the radio 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.630
 fm 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.640
 has important memory inside the phone 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.290
 His part 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.090
 each phone without producing and it was time to leave 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.520
 you talk about grouchy his own headphones from his own headphones 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.410
 since its inception the walkman range has grown 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.530
 there are now many phones 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.860
 in the w3c w 556 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.630
 and w 800 and 801 here 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 the w8 156 and the double 850 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.650
 the bad mobile users why only allowed these directions to prevail 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:38.720
 on the market 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.390
 it's no less than three million of his niece to blog 800 who surrendered 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.830
 in six months in 89 different countries 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.960
 this success is simply explained 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.860
 first of all the number we are going to start again m 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.840
 then because there was no convergence between an excellent 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.690
 phone 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.760
 and after mp3 player 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.960
 and finally these phones brief 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.410

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.320
 among the very latest models in the sony walkman range an excellent the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.070
 double 810 the perfect phone 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.299
 they all possess 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.439
 even a 2 megapixel autofocus camera and then a hellish look 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.269

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.449
 a gigabyte of memory and which is now able thanks to the new 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:20.309

 already clear ideas 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.129

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.459

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.089
 distance
