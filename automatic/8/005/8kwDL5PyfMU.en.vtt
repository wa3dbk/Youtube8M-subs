have to in the end be able to walk away
from<00:05:26.539> a<00:05:26.750> deal<00:05:26.900> if<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.110> deals<00:05:27.349> not<00:05:27.500> right<00:05:27.560> the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
from a deal if the deals not right the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.350 
from a deal if the deals not right the
deals<00:05:27.889> not<00:05:28.099> right<00:05:28.220> well<00:05:28.729> we<00:05:28.820> checked<00:05:28.970> out<00:05:29.150> one

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
deals not right well we checked out one

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.500 
deals not right well we checked out one
it<00:05:29.539> was<00:05:29.660> really<00:05:29.690> really<00:05:30.530> small<00:05:30.830> compared<00:05:31.220> ours

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
it was really really small compared ours

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.150 
it was really really small compared ours
yeah<00:05:32.510> I<00:05:32.570> think<00:05:33.110> it's<00:05:33.349> a<00:05:33.380> viable<00:05:33.560> business<00:05:33.740> just

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
yeah I think it's a viable business just

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.740 
yeah I think it's a viable business just
has<00:05:34.280> to<00:05:34.370> be<00:05:34.400> different<00:05:34.820> here<00:05:35.000> I<00:05:35.030> mean<00:05:35.240> the

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
has to be different here I mean the

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.180 
has to be different here I mean the
rents<00:05:35.990> are<00:05:36.080> high<00:05:36.260> they<00:05:36.470> don't<00:05:36.620> have<00:05:36.740> room<00:05:37.010> to

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
rents are high they don't have room to

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.940 
rents are high they don't have room to
take<00:05:37.340> cars<00:05:37.639> and<00:05:37.940> things<00:05:38.030> like<00:05:38.210> that<00:05:38.889> so<00:05:39.889> I<00:05:39.919> mean

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
take cars and things like that so I mean

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.710 
take cars and things like that so I mean
if<00:05:40.190> as<00:05:40.280> long<00:05:40.430> as<00:05:40.550> they<00:05:40.639> stick<00:05:40.849> to<00:05:40.940> jewelry<00:05:41.150> and

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
if as long as they stick to jewelry and

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.089 
if as long as they stick to jewelry and
gold<00:05:41.960> and<00:05:42.320> things<00:05:42.440> like<00:05:42.590> that<00:05:42.650> I<00:05:42.800> think<00:05:42.889> it's

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
gold and things like that I think it's

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.400 
gold and things like that I think it's
alright<00:05:43.370> but<00:05:43.550> as<00:05:44.120> far<00:05:44.419> as<00:05:44.450> something<00:05:45.260> like

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
alright but as far as something like

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.930 
alright but as far as something like
mine<00:05:45.650> it<00:05:45.830> would<00:05:45.889> be<00:05:46.010> really<00:05:46.250> difficult<00:05:46.370> here

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
mine it would be really difficult here

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.969 
mine it would be really difficult here
because<00:05:47.150> it<00:05:47.270> would<00:05:47.389> need<00:05:47.690> a<00:05:47.720> lot<00:05:47.810> of<00:05:48.530> storage<00:05:48.800> I

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
because it would need a lot of storage I

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.680 
because it would need a lot of storage I
have<00:05:49.070> ten<00:05:49.760> thousand<00:05:50.150> square<00:05:50.210> feet<00:05:50.419> of<00:05:50.510> storage

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
have ten thousand square feet of storage

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.850 
have ten thousand square feet of storage
in<00:05:50.930> Las<00:05:51.020> Vegas

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860
