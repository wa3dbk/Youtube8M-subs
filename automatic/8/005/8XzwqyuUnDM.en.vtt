00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.020
 Y 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.450
 I started at 4 years old, my mom 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.650
 he got 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.299
 alone but it started only as a store in 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.959
 the afternoon so they were not in my 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.959
 home doing nothing 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.500
 when I decided that I wanted to be a dancer 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.240
 seriously at 7 years old because a 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.530
 Cuban teacher my school to dayz 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.180
 velÃ¡squez 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.010
 and well she was the one that started me 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.660
 press more I climbed to the tips not 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.930
 they started and now with courses that was 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.090
 when I started calling more the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.240
 Attention to the 7 years 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.900
 if I imagined my life as 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.280
 great dancer 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:53.460
 and well I was excited but never 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.470
 I came to think that there could be 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.000
 so many contests and that could reach 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.560
 earn what you earned 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.770
 in my first contest was at 10 years 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:10.150
 eliud america game pri in new york and 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.640
 well we went and obviously when you arrive 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.300
 to a contest everyone expects to win 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.880
 and it's what you want 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.620
 I never imagined I was going to get to win 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.290
 the hope award that is the prize the 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.240
 Promise of dance is like a great pri 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.920
 for the little ones 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.649
 and well there was that also when my 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.220
 Dads seriously realized that 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.909
 If I could go take it seriously what more 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.909
 it has cost me work 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.229
 the ballet obviously requires 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.719
 that they have a physique that you have to 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.469
 have and I 'm super appetizer 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.840
 ice creams love chocolates 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.270
 Well, if you have to diet very 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.229
 balanced 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.380
 and right now I'm preparing for 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.000
 a jackson mississippi contest is 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.030
 known as the Olympics of the law 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.549
 is every four years nothing more and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.780
 they audition more than a thousand dancers of all 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.510
 the world and they only select 109 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.650
 and I am the only Mexican who will go 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.659
 this year 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.850
 so I'm very excited to go 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:22.270
 to represent Mexico again 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.980
 in the ballet the truth that to follow I am 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.580
 the best and re achieved everything does not exist 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.590
 because even though you're first 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.380
 dancer from the best company in the world 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.350
 there is always always going to be something in 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.600
 I have to work then I 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.540
 I am still a student then 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.250
 they do not know make me recognize missing 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.230
 there is still a lot of work to be done and 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.780
 I have to improve still a lot 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.360
 then I am very happy for all 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.830
 the opportunities that they have given me and 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.750
 all the achievements that I have had but 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.880
 I admit that I still need a lot 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.050
 to become the best 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.230
 Well, I want to tell you that 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.200
 ballet is a very very difficult life 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:14.860
 very sacrificed is a lot of work 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.130
 but what good if they want to get to this 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.420
 or whatever, even if they do not use 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.360
 anything that they aspire to get in 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.820
 his career that you throw many weapons 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.090
 and then if there are lives that you feel that you do not 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.560
 you can and it's the end of the world but that 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.230
 work hard and when you do not want that 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.260
 can the cuba contest be a 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.959
 meeting of academies lasts two weeks 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.319
 the first week are many classes and 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.290
 there are functions but they are not part of the 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.740
 contest and or contest against 700 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.320

 in my category of the advanced category 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.670
 win the gold medal 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.190
 but that was between women from 17 to 19 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.580
 years 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.580
 and also with the grand prix that is 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.650

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.960

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.690
 women is between men women all the 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.780
 contest and I'm the first Mexican in 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.930
 bring this mexico prize in the law to 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.930
 my 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.949
 I really can not imagine what it would look like 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.949
 without the ballet 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.000
 everything I want to do all the time 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.580

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.670
 vacation or Sunday I'm going by the 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.360
