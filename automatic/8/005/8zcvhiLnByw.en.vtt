later in the strangest places oh yeah
last<00:03:14.170> time<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.470> installed<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.160> fence<00:03:15.430> all

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
last time I installed the fence all

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.970 
last time I installed the fence all
those<00:03:16.120> screws<00:03:16.510> make<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.200> much<00:03:17.440> more<00:03:17.709> likely

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
those screws make it much more likely

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.949 
those screws make it much more likely
not<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.549> get<00:03:18.700> them<00:03:18.880> all<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.239> there<00:03:19.660> nice<00:03:19.930> and

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
not to get them all in there nice and

you how many times I've had a screw

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.610 
you how many times I've had a screw
loose<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:27.880> see<00:03:28.269> here<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.720> wham-bam<00:03:28.959> fence

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
loose so you see here the wham-bam fence

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.979 
loose so you see here the wham-bam fence
is<00:03:29.890> overall<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.640> much<00:03:30.970> cleaner<00:03:31.330> fit<00:03:31.750> and

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
is overall a much cleaner fit and

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.009 
is overall a much cleaner fit and

just<00:03:35.320> comparing<00:03:35.799> them<00:03:36.040> there<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.400> can<00:03:36.760> see

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
just comparing them there you can see

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.000 
just comparing them there you can see
the<00:03:37.090> Rambam<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> much<00:03:38.170> nicer<00:03:38.470> looking

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
the Rambam is a much nicer looking

the Rambam is a much nicer looking
that's<00:03:39.430> right<00:03:39.730> Joe<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.540> three-dimensional

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
that's right Joe the three-dimensional

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.349 
that's right Joe the three-dimensional
lattice<00:03:41.530> is<00:03:41.889> thicker<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.459> gives<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:43.060> much<00:03:43.090> more

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
lattice is thicker and gives a much more

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.720

rich<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.260> durable<00:03:44.950> look<00:03:45.190> what's<00:03:45.910> even<00:03:46.209> more

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
rich and durable look what's even more

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.940 
rich and durable look what's even more
is<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.360> it's<00:03:47.510> all<00:03:47.720> vinyl<00:03:48.110> versus

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
is that it's all vinyl versus
