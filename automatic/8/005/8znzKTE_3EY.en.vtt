reference like as we saw with the field
guide<00:03:08.730> there<00:03:08.940> are<00:03:08.970> some<00:03:09.330> things<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.840> learn<00:03:10.020> and

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
guide there are some things to learn and

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.610 
guide there are some things to learn and
that<00:03:10.770> dinosaurs<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:12.960> that's<00:03:13.140> pretty<00:03:13.410> cool

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
that dinosaurs and so that's pretty cool

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.360 
that dinosaurs and so that's pretty cool
too<00:03:13.770> it's<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:14.010> good<00:03:14.160> mixture<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.640> both<00:03:14.820> this

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
too it's a good mixture of both this

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.340 
too it's a good mixture of both this
counting<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.820> fish<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.690> try<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.900> not<00:03:19.110> eat

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
counting the fish that to try to not eat

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.990 
counting the fish that to try to not eat
so<00:03:19.560> that's<00:03:19.680> really<00:03:19.950> cool<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.430> involves<00:03:20.820> some

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
so that's really cool it involves some

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
so that's really cool it involves some
math<00:03:21.290> honey<00:03:22.290> hungry<00:03:22.739> herbivore<00:03:24.020> doesn't

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
math honey hungry herbivore doesn't

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.380 
math honey hungry herbivore doesn't
really<00:03:25.170> involve<00:03:25.530> any<00:03:25.940> learning<00:03:26.940> but<00:03:27.150> there's

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
really involve any learning but there's

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.440 
really involve any learning but there's
