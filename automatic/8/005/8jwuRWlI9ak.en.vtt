 [Music] 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.670
 daddy pig just found a place 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:17.739
 ideal for camping and young people and everything 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.989
 the world is seated while dad 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.450
 pig is finishing the 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.900
 past grills 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.909
 they all very very hungry but paypal 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.459
 do not want to eat fish 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:34.719
 she would prefer hamburgers and 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:37.079
 fries and insistently asks dad 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:39.669
 pig to prepare them 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.489
 daddy pig explains him that this is 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:45.000
 not very very good for health and that 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.340
 she should rather eat grilled meat 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.560
 but since the Netherlands insist pope to 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.590
 left we agree to prepare 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.629
 hamburgers and fries for the whole 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.629
 family exceptionally

 hamburgers pepa pigs and george 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.780
 he reminds them once again that 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.680
 it's really because they're in 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.780
 vacation he agreed to prepare them 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.470
 but that's not going to become a 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.509
 habit to pigs and george are 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.660

 [Music] 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.780
 daddy pig decided that after this heavy 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.120

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.800
