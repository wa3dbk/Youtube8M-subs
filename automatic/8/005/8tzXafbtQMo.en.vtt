Industrial Relations Act which is

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.610 
Industrial Relations Act which is
designed<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.550> stop<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.090> sacking<00:03:42.600> people<00:03:43.170> who

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
designed to stop you sacking people who

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.730 
designed to stop you sacking people who
ought<00:03:43.800> to<00:03:43.830> be<00:03:44.040> sacks<00:03:44.600> we

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
ought to be sacks we

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.460 
ought to be sacks we
in<00:03:47.460> Antarctica<00:03:48.300> we<00:03:48.540> have<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.930> much<00:03:49.200> worth

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
in Antarctica we have a much worth

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.620 
in Antarctica we have a much worth
problem<00:03:50.040> which<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.670> can<00:03:50.880> sack<00:03:51.210> them<00:03:51.450> but

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
problem which is you can sack them but

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
problem which is you can sack them but
you<00:03:51.750> cannot<00:03:51.990> get<00:03:52.230> rid<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.470> them<00:03:52.820> so<00:03:54.650> therefore

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
you cannot get rid of them so therefore

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.680 
you cannot get rid of them so therefore
the<00:03:55.860> selection<00:03:56.790> system<00:03:57.030> has<00:03:57.420> got<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.660> be

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
the selection system has got to be

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.870 
the selection system has got to be
pretty<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.140> hundred<00:03:58.500> percent<00:03:58.620> up<00:03:59.040> front<00:03:59.100> all

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
pretty a hundred percent up front all

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.450 
pretty a hundred percent up front all
together<00:04:00.360> we've<00:04:00.660> raised<00:04:01.010> 14.8<00:04:02.010> million

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
together we've raised 14.8 million

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
expedition's are based on charity and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.590 
expedition's are based on charity and
science<00:04:07.380> but<00:04:08.310> from<00:04:08.580> my<00:04:08.790> point<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.210> view<00:04:09.270> that

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
science but from my point of view that

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.990 
science but from my point of view that
is<00:04:09.930> not<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.380> from<00:04:10.650> my<00:04:10.770> point<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.130> view<00:04:11.190> as<00:04:11.490> I

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
is not it from my point of view as I

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.850

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
think I said at the beginning it is just

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.830 
think I said at the beginning it is just
a<00:04:14.070> profession<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.240> one<00:04:15.390> thing<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.660> is

a profession and the one thing that is

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.710 
a profession and the one thing that is
