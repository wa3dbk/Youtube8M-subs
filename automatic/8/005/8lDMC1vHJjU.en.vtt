hi I'm Julia of Staton and welcome to
another<00:00:08.929> video<00:00:09.929> tutorial<00:00:10.580> I've<00:00:11.580> created<00:00:11.849> for

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
another video tutorial I've created for

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.089 
another video tutorial I've created for
you<00:00:12.240> today<00:00:13.019> we're<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.559> be<00:00:13.650> doing<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
you today we're going to be doing a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.939 
you today we're going to be doing a
video<00:00:14.460> tutorial<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.360> new<00:00:16.230> technique<00:00:16.680> I've

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
video tutorial on a new technique I've

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.060 
video tutorial on a new technique I've
developed<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:18.170> folded<00:00:19.170> Chevron<00:00:19.740> and

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
developed and it's folded Chevron and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.700 
developed and it's folded Chevron and
it's<00:00:20.520> really<00:00:20.820> easy<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:22.140> just

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
it's really easy and you just

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.470 
it's really easy and you just
there's<00:00:23.130> no<00:00:23.310> not<00:00:23.730> very<00:00:23.970> much<00:00:24.060> cutting

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
there's no not very much cutting

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.910 
there's no not very much cutting
involved<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.109> little<00:00:25.289> bit<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.470> measuring

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
involved just a little bit of measuring

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
involved just a little bit of measuring
and<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.460> end<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.699> with<00:00:26.760> really<00:00:27.150> nice<00:00:27.300> clean

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
and you end up with really nice clean

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.750 
and you end up with really nice clean
folded<00:00:28.140> edges<00:00:28.260> around<00:00:28.529> your<00:00:28.769> Chevron's

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
folded edges around your Chevron's

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.179 
folded edges around your Chevron's
so<00:00:30.300> these<00:00:30.510> chevron<00:00:30.900> strips<00:00:31.230> we're<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.130> to

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
so these chevron strips we're going to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.720 
so these chevron strips we're going to
start<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.820> two<00:00:33.480> inch<00:00:33.510> by<00:00:34.290> 12<00:00:34.739> inch<00:00:34.920> strip

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
start with a two inch by 12 inch strip

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.360 
start with a two inch by 12 inch strip
of<00:00:35.910> patterned<00:00:36.329> paper<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.870> today<00:00:37.530> I'm<00:00:37.649> using<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
of patterned paper and today I'm using a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.150 
of patterned paper and today I'm using a
piece<00:00:38.850> from<00:00:39.059> my<00:00:39.270> new<00:00:39.450> Victoria<00:00:39.989> Park<00:00:40.170> line<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
piece from my new Victoria Park line and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.970 
piece from my new Victoria Park line and
it's<00:00:41.940> we're<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> end<00:00:42.840> up<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.469> want

it's we're going to end up with I want
to<00:00:44.040> use<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.760> thought<00:00:45.180> it'd<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.360> fun<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.660> see

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
to use the I thought it'd be fun to see

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.270 
to use the I thought it'd be fun to see
what<00:00:45.960> dotted<00:00:46.320> Chevron's<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.160> we're

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
what dotted Chevron's what so we're

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.670 
what dotted Chevron's what so we're
gonna<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:49.500> right

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
gonna this is going to be the the right

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.529 
gonna this is going to be the the right
size<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.940> do<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.210> flip<00:00:51.390> it

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
size so what we want to do is flip it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.209 
size so what we want to do is flip it
over<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:53.300> I'm<00:00:54.300> placing<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.170> basic<00:00:56.010> grey

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
over and I'm placing it on my basic grey

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.910 
over and I'm placing it on my basic grey
magnetic<00:00:57.090> precision<00:00:57.539> mat<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.829> know

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
magnetic precision mat now this you know

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.500 
magnetic precision mat now this you know
it<00:00:59.070> looks<00:00:59.489> kind<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> dirty<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.329> well

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it looks kind of dirty but it's well

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.210 
it looks kind of dirty but it's well
loved<00:01:00.780> well<00:01:01.379> worn<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:04.220> one

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
loved well worn and it's it's just one

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370 
loved well worn and it's it's just one
of<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.369> favorites<00:01:05.880> tools<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.720> can't<00:01:07.229> live

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
of my favorites tools like can't live

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.789 
of my favorites tools like can't live
with<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
with it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.100 
with it
so<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:08.909> easy<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.330> use<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.840> mat

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so it's really easy to use on this mat

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.780 
so it's really easy to use on this mat
if<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.530> line<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> two<00:01:11.400> inches

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
if you line it up with the two inches

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.380 
if you line it up with the two inches
and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.200> you're<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.390> use

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
and then what you're going to do is use

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.660 
and then what you're going to do is use
the<00:01:15.509> magnetic<00:01:15.840> ruler<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.920> just<00:01:19.920> draw<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> line

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the magnetic ruler and just draw a line

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.539 
the magnetic ruler and just draw a line
at<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> 1-inch<00:01:21.570> interval<00:01:22.070> along<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.340> length

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
at the 1-inch interval along the length

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.850 
at the 1-inch interval along the length
of<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:24.060> strips<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:24.960> pencil<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
of your strips so just use pencil and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
of your strips so just use pencil and
you've<00:01:26.549> got<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> line<00:01:26.970> across<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
you've got a line across there and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.620 
you've got a line across there and
that's<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:28.049> midpoint<00:01:28.229> line<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.240> you

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that's your midpoint line then if you

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.270 
that's your midpoint line then if you
notice<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.170> you've<00:01:31.350> got<00:01:31.380> 1-inch<00:01:31.950> grids

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
notice that you've got 1-inch grids

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.640 
notice that you've got 1-inch grids
along<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.030> top<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> bottom<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.380> this

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
along the top and the bottom on this

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.450 
along the top and the bottom on this
mask<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.799> what<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.950> want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.900> is<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.250> one

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
mask so what you want to do is the one

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.300 
mask so what you want to do is the one
inch<00:01:41.670> mark<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:42.840> want<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.140> draw<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.890> line<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:46.310> say

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
inch mark you want to draw a line on say

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.530 
inch mark you want to draw a line on say
the<00:01:47.460> top<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.030> start<00:01:48.299> at<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> bottom

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the top or you can start at the bottom

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.060 
the top or you can start at the bottom
it<00:01:48.780> doesn't<00:01:49.020> really<00:01:49.110> matter<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.740> you're<00:01:49.979> just

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
it doesn't really matter and you're just

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.550 
it doesn't really matter and you're just
going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.250> alternate<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> next<00:01:51.390> line<00:01:51.659> next

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
going to alternate so the next line next

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.310 
going to alternate so the next line next
in<00:01:52.799> you're<00:01:53.040> gonna<00:01:53.159> draw<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.670> line<00:01:53.909> down<00:01:54.450> then

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
in you're gonna draw a line down then

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.940 
in you're gonna draw a line down then
the<00:01:56.250> ruler<00:01:56.549> over<00:01:56.700> an<00:01:56.969> inch<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.680> line<00:01:58.680> from

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the ruler over an inch and a line from

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.100 
the ruler over an inch and a line from
the<00:01:59.070> midpoint<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.759> top<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.840> keep

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the midpoint to the top and just keep

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:25.600 
the midpoint to the top and just keep
doing<00:02:04.439> this

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.400 

these<00:02:26.610> lines<00:02:26.849> were<00:02:27.030> marking<00:02:27.540> are<00:02:27.810> going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.319> be

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
these lines were marking are going to be

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.220 
these lines were marking are going to be
our<00:02:28.530> cut<00:02:28.739> lines<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.980> they<00:02:32.790> were<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:34.050> we

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
our cut lines and they were you so we

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.220 
our cut lines and they were you so we
have<00:02:35.000> alternating<00:02:36.000> lines<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.569> we're<00:02:37.110> going

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
have alternating lines and we're going

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.870 
have alternating lines and we're going
to<00:02:37.260> cut<00:02:37.470> them<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:38.310> our<00:02:39.290> Chevron<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.640> just

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
to cut them for our Chevron so you just

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.040 
to cut them for our Chevron so you just
cut<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.080> midpoint<00:02:43.910> each<00:02:44.910> piece<00:02:45.630> along<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
cut to the midpoint each piece along the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:03:05.630 
cut to the midpoint each piece along the
bottom<00:02:55.130> it's<00:02:56.130> very<00:02:56.340> quick<00:03:03.980> do<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.100> top<00:03:05.370> ones

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
bottom it's very quick do the top ones

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.309 
bottom it's very quick do the top ones
here<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:10.590> there<00:03:10.769> we<00:03:10.860> go<00:03:10.980> they're<00:03:11.160> all<00:03:11.310> covers

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
here and there we go they're all covers

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.600 
here and there we go they're all covers
so<00:03:13.319> then<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.620> want<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.920> start<00:03:14.190> by<00:03:14.370> folding

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
so then you want to start by folding

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.150 
so then you want to start by folding
triangles<00:03:15.450> from<00:03:15.630> your<00:03:15.840> midpoint<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.799> just

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
triangles from your midpoint and just

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.759 
triangles from your midpoint and just
along<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:19.280> line<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.810> pencil<00:03:21.810> line<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.680> you

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
along that line the pencil line and you

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.949 
along that line the pencil line and you
can<00:03:22.950> fold<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.090> press<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.630> well<00:03:24.780> with<00:03:24.930> your

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
can fold it and press it well with your

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.059 
can fold it and press it well with your
nails<00:03:25.260> or<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:26.610> really<00:03:27.500> strong<00:03:28.500> crisp

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
nails or just really strong crisp

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.599 
nails or just really strong crisp
creases<00:03:29.609> are<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:30.420> make<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> really<00:03:30.959> nice

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
creases are going to make a really nice

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:37.819 
creases are going to make a really nice
folded<00:03:32.609> Chevron<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.019> can<00:03:36.109> I'm<00:03:37.109> like<00:03:37.410> using

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
folded Chevron so you can I'm like using

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.680 
folded Chevron so you can I'm like using
a<00:03:38.040> bone<00:03:38.250> folder<00:03:38.549> here<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.269> works<00:03:39.450> really

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
a bone folder here and that works really

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.520 
a bone folder here and that works really
well<00:03:43.160> you<00:03:44.160> can<00:03:44.569> basically<00:03:45.569> just<00:03:45.840> fold<00:03:46.350> up

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
well you can basically just fold up

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:53.090 
well you can basically just fold up
triangles<00:03:47.930> from<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:51.620> little<00:03:52.620> cuts<00:03:52.829> you've

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
triangles from the little cuts you've

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:10.770 
triangles from the little cuts you've
made

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.330 

and<00:04:11.780> I'll<00:04:12.050> just<00:04:12.080> show<00:04:12.470> you<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:13.040> other<00:04:13.220> side

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
and I'll just show you the other side

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:38.379 
and I'll just show you the other side
and<00:04:13.940> how<00:04:14.090> you're<00:04:14.330> gonna<00:04:14.390> get<00:04:14.600> Chevron's

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.860 

see<00:04:39.389> how<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:39.570> chevron<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.259> starting<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.740> take

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
see how the chevron is starting to take

00:04:41.870 --> 00:05:46.759 
see how the chevron is starting to take
form

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:46.769 

00:05:46.769 --> 00:06:02.279 

couple<00:05:47.769> more<00:05:47.889> folds<00:06:00.059> and<00:06:01.059> then<00:06:01.419> we<00:06:01.929> flip<00:06:02.139> it

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
couple more folds and then we flip it

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.249 
couple more folds and then we flip it
over<00:06:02.409> and<00:06:03.279> here<00:06:04.059> we<00:06:04.179> have<00:06:04.389> our<00:06:04.809> perfect

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
over and here we have our perfect

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.879 
over and here we have our perfect
Chevron's<00:06:06.009> and<00:06:06.279> I<00:06:06.399> love<00:06:06.639> how<00:06:06.819> it's<00:06:07.889> perfectly

Chevron's and I love how it's perfectly

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.129 
Chevron's and I love how it's perfectly
