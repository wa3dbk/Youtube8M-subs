00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.400
 all are youtube are from the board e 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:14.040
 would like to present meeting not for sure 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:17.070
 let's start with a telegraph I assume and i 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.680
 three sought-after blues are the basis of the long 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.570
 dark to play a force must 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:29.880
 having these three in mind 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:33.570
 eu card 2 tour cards guerci da 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.520
 a trans silva game and the ac 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.200
 diamole transfer that are very good and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.809
 when it's not magic cards to warm up 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.980
 lore replace and with a year i 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.450
 ostriches 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:50.010
 repeat prove it vanity will tell 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.960
 with the magic three portals or business in the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.309
 game two because when you have your own 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.930
 cards in hand could also be a 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.809
 disadvantage of the player who activates it 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.750
 two lightning and very good pure cost 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.600
 instead with another one dragged drama 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.659
 in the grave less two would be needed 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 one day it is a gate after gate 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 because another did it too 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.470
 of the opponent we could care burden for 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.020
 always from the cemetery a book charm 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.479
 of the moon many special mystical backgrounds 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.689
 and I saw cards now we pass the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.689
 traps 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.060
 let's start with this appropriate trap 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.189
 square is not very known for is 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.140
 the effect is very good because it's enough 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.420
 when where it would be according to more cards 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.040
 grandfather during his by now face 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.259
 for example when activating to do for 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.320
 us the discount you make a click 2 and this 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.659
 I can say with your own cards then one 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:53.090
 very good dark for his 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.090
 insatiable gray effect 22 prisons 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.189
 281 mir 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.630
 a salemme judgment is a dark make up is 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.530
 good because even if it turns out you are there 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.439
 you will be nothing 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.710
 anyway to take another card 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.710
 opponent 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.790
 now let's move on to the raid 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.000
 this is not really a side then i am 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.160
 of the cards you could 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 that you could still play are 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:26.170
 inter to form a landing on 13 a 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:30.010
 form a file of the dark world 1 smoke 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.000
 and a very dark soccer player here 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.000
 instead it is the former the dec 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.740
 my dear photonic that the galactics 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.420
 banks that still opposed in the field 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:50.440
 one could naturally evoke level 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:55.690
 4 utopia 2 number 17 which also prohibit 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:00.370
 the tanque to 3 a number 107 very easy 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.310
 to summon with 2000 was in the field where it was 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:11.770
 32 with those 4 or level 3 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:15.220
 number 20 number 30 and number 20 number 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.590
 30 but you can't even play I don't have 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.760
 also very disadvantageous is not 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.959
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.959
