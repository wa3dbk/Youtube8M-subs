 we are too low for you to understand 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.239

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.939

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.769
 create it for yourself to fill a bag 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.599
 Looking for your friends, will you be going to the movies? 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.430
 buying clothes will make the other 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.920
 The thing you like is that you are. 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.629
 dating the person you like 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.250
 a person you have the right to and will 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.560
 they all things that she likes to 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.749

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.579
 Your boyfriend's wishing to play ball 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.180
 with friends it is too heavy for 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.499
 you 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.299
 My daughter is pushing your 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:35.459
 relationship with the keg and you 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.049
 testicular carrier that is 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.109
 implying in the clothes that his wife 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.030
 It is even necessary that the house be 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.549
 know your son of a bitch so I 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.560
 I think one thing if you face has clicks. 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.209
 in your wife's clothing if you only have 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.519
 right to do this when you arrive 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.480
 with a clothes a shoe to replace 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.920
 what is she wearing 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.769
 still it is not obliged to 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.849
 undo that new clothes 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.340
 We really do have something else. 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.840
 idiot who climbs to want to send 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.620
 woman vest where's 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.810
 Individualism in this damn thing else 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.700
 does a lot and is a great example for 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.590
 show that the person is pushing the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.510
 relationship with the belly is wanting 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.180
 hinder the life of another person 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.600
 The woman who dunks and gets sucked 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.310
 creating a case for these women who are 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.250
 very annoying with anything the guy 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.979
 talk that the team lost and 1 and goes to 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.540
 home and give chilique cries and talks 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.870
 Determining that you do not want anything else 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.490
 lose, I know, it just makes things difficult. 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.770
 what is the great advantage of having a 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.470
 relationship is not for things and light 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.750
 quiet for the two of you just have fun 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.820
 just being well the whole time you need 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.800
 even creating this case requires 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.710
 than to hell with the life of another 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.930
 person does not need unhappy in his 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.169
 own life something else that causes 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.820
 too much discord in a woman's relationship or 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.160
 the guy imply because the girl did not 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.770
 answer a call serious people each 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.360
 There is a life of yours to fight in this life of 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.160
 people are going to do various things 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.889
 I do not know the difference that your girlfriend is 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.110
 a telephone operator for you 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.599
 she has no obligation to keep listening 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.180
 your phones the moment you call me 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.889

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.090
 to hell with boy who is boy or girl 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.760
 who was 11 years ago was the 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.970
 Other you needed the pomegranate I fell 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.970
 rs is with this guy comes out of this paranoia 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.620
 shit this is no longer look at you 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.900
 someone you do not stay with 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.360
 paranoia or stay alone in the rest of the 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.090
 life but the biggest mistake of the people in a 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.650
 relationship that makes everything difficult 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.570
 is a person to enter into a relationship 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.360
 wanting to change agent 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.610
 nobody changes nobody sometimes even changes 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.700
 but the personal world alone you stand 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.440
 asking for hell creating case 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.120
 it's a person to change the other person just goes 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.130
 change when she is aware that 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.020
 She needs to change, so she was in the 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.030
 triangular relationship or person not 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.920
 is an end in the relationship hoping that 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:02.230
 the other person will change because he looks 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.230
 This will never happen.
