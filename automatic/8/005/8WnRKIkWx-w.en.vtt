00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.330
 I've heard the lead color now 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.939
 have one or the other again 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.990
 dÃ¶schen energy drunk and am one 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.210
 little upset little hint on 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.680
 the game 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.730
 wink wink is anything but 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.210
 incited 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.100
 He had moved already run was 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.120
 a few feet and then it's him 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:51.479
 noticed 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:55.460
 I know no no better than dying 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.460
 I always say better than dying 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.650
 not much with the typical for 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.620
 at least as typical as me 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.210
 the game yes dog is easy man 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.010
 simply no sense at all 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.780
 upset because I'm in her place 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:17.160
 when the dog is watching you do it 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:25.550
 simply nothing on dying retirees 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:28.410
 Maybe one through and I have 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:33.860
 said plan or is planned if there 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.860
 a response, he will be correct 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.750
 no idea 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:53.950
 no idea then with alonso 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:02:00.160
 there we are before you 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:03.450
 stupid so heavily upset 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.450
 I love that 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.680
 at the best without teenager 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.940
 without there party the clip kills 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:19.989
 and then you die because you just 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:27.880
 somewhere up here , I suppose 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:31.090
 time is running for me to hurry again 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:37.739
 around back if here is none of 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.739
 we think one died 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:58.150
 no the time for a life i am a lot 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:03:00.730
 Of course, I'm getting hold of Jews 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.580
 In between, I've got it myself 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.580
 I just so intent I think it's a 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.270
 Fair thing and me from now wrong us 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.360
 become to 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:20.780
 stood 1 connected since again 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:20.780
 but the book still totally shitty 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.400
 but we have to get back to everyone 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.400
 do not get stuck 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:44.990
 hello my stuff so 9 30 seconds so 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.860
 I guess that one again somewhere 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:58.730
 Just loitering then finally giving 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:04:03.650
 go small that's not yours 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:09.160
 serious contactor here very well 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.160
 I need another one first 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 ca 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:33.860
 I 've already forgotten it goes on 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:37.840
 really times first round I think so 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.840
 between the end of 600 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:50.640
 ok then it takes a bit up there 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.640
 is up there running around all run 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:05:06.610
 very good here in several par 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:11.770
 started running stronger because of lack of time 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:14.710
 here alone is beautiful again 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.870
 he was so fond of feeling he was there 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:25.660
 I saw someone again but me 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:27.220
 just do not see it either no and it works 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:34.050
 away or divorced water exposes you 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:36.190
 what it was just wonderful as 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.640
 playing upset has spurred on 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:44.890
 is so expected on me again 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:48.550
 to the team player upset again 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.060
 by the way, something like that always does 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.890
 fun again 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.150
 I am grateful to all events for 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.720

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.590

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.320

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.660

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.170
