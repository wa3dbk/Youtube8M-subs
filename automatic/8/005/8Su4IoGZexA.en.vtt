get back stabs I tried rolling out of
the<00:05:41.090> way<00:05:41.240> so<00:05:44.259> it<00:05:45.259> it's<00:05:45.680> kind<00:05:46.009> of<00:05:46.069> hard<00:05:46.219> to<00:05:46.280> tell

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
the way so it it's kind of hard to tell

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.249 
the way so it it's kind of hard to tell
who's<00:05:46.819> winning<00:05:47.270> usually<00:05:47.870> you<00:05:47.960> see<00:05:48.110> like<00:05:48.229> a

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
who's winning usually you see like a

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.770 
who's winning usually you see like a
golden<00:05:48.740> crown<00:05:49.009> that<00:05:49.310> tells<00:05:49.759> you<00:05:50.000> that<00:05:50.270> you're

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
golden crown that tells you that you're

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.330 
golden crown that tells you that you're
in<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:50.960> lead<00:05:51.110> but<00:05:51.349> sometimes<00:05:51.830> it<00:05:52.009> won't<00:05:52.159> show

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
in the lead but sometimes it won't show

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.580 
in the lead but sometimes it won't show
you<00:05:52.370> anything<00:05:52.729> at<00:05:52.940> all<00:05:52.969> so<00:05:53.389> you<00:05:53.629> just<00:05:54.229> have<00:05:54.379> to

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590

keep<00:05:55.310> going<00:05:55.370> and<00:05:55.879> make<00:05:56.060> sure<00:05:56.090> you<00:05:56.990> get<00:05:57.349> as<00:05:57.500> many

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
keep going and make sure you get as many

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.890 
keep going and make sure you get as many
tales<00:05:57.919> as<00:05:58.069> you<00:05:58.159> possibly<00:05:58.580> can<00:05:58.789> and<00:05:59.569> it<00:05:59.779> just
