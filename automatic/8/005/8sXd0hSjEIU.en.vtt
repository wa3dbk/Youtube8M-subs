00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hi to all guys and welcome back up 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.569
 all wrong today we talk about luck 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.580
 intended as symbology more than anything else 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.860
 in fact, you asked why iron 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.900
 of horse is recognized as a symbol 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.089
 of luck and attention is not 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.949
 recognized only by us in Italy as 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.250
 symbol of luck but universally 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.410
 in china it is a lucky charm because they say 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 that you remember the symbol of a serpent sato 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.970
 on the agenda it seems to me that it is called but it is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.269
 also the symbol of isis so why 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.160
 remember the half moon there are already so many 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.860
 legends also already related to 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.809
 symbolism however there are also those that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.690
 stand out more precisely among the legends 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.030
 and the one I liked the most and 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.440
 illustrate of canterbury archbishop of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.260
 canterbury that before doing 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.020
 the archbishop was a blacksmith a blacksmith 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.989
 so good at his services 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.879
 they were in demand all over the world 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.860
 ok people came from all sides to 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.320
 say let me do that rather than let me 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.329
 the other one even the devil 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.949
 arrived they are knocking at the door of 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.719
 right then imagine this 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.890
 devil knocking at the door and the vice 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.630
 I want more more powerful hooves 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 so you have to do some irons to put on 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.909
 under my most resistant hooves e 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.340
 more comfortable they taste that even then it was 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.080
 very religious he decided to make gods 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.290
 horseshoes but to make them 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.920
 so uncomfortable that he was the devil 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.619
 same shortly after inserting them below 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.369
 to the hooves he required immediately 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.100
 of removing them they obviously taste instead 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.170
 to immediately remove the churches 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.790
 I came to terms with the devil indeed it was the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.250
 hell he had to come to terms with 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.740
 doo they are and they told him that 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.500
 any house he had in front of him 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.729
 at the door a horseshoe must have 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.479
 to be quiet, that is, not to have 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.969
 the malignant inside and from here in addition to 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.750
 be a marketing work for the beauty 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.909
 grano gustano made horseshoe 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.280
 a symbol of luck because who 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.090
 he had hung this in front of the door 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.120
 this horseshoe did not have the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.980
 so the evil one was not 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.140
 could enter inside that 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.090
 home so he was lucky 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.069
 this is one of those legends that I do 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.440
 I particularly liked why 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.980
 imagine in the year one thousand more or less 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.980
 it's been a thousand years it's still done 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.269
 still talk about this legend then 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.450
 is a fantastic resistance to the al 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:39.200
 time said this then the legend of 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.910
 giussano has become very well known e 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.470
 also among the most beautiful because then there is 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.110
 there are so many others not seen 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.170
 others to tell and then the symbol 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.780
 of horseshoe has become a 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.910
 bring luck but beware the iron of 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.970
 horse should always be facing towards 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.829
 the top then with the part open to the 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.110
 above why because that way 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.079
 good luck is said instead that if it comes 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.180
 put it down it also brings bad luck because 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.650
 because they say that the evil one remains 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.019
 stuck in this in this that is the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.790
 the hollow of the horseshoe or the 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.590
 luck 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.200
 enter within this iron of 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.010
 horse then also here the things to say ce 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.560
 they would be galore but I'll stop here 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.660
 and therefore I also recommend the iron of 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.120
 horse intended as a lucky charm can 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.180
 have millions of meanings therefore not 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.060
 we stop only at the first go to the bottom 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.620
 to the topic if it seemed right to me that 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.380
 the horseshoe was a 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.989
 good luck and nothing without having 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.730
 legends behind you were wrong 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.130
 and we'll see each other next time 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.560
 I recommend if you like these micro 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.870
 video I make leave me a comment 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.760
 I like an inscription or what 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.440
 want or hubble see you at 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.440
 next video so i will continue to do so
