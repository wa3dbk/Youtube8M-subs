card<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:55.470> know<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.619> guys<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.159> ATM<00:00:56.760> optos<00:00:57.540> do

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
card you know you guys the ATM optos do

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.869 
card you know you guys the ATM optos do
not<00:00:58.080> have<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> built-in<00:00:58.799> VEC<00:00:59.369> so<00:00:59.580> here's<00:00:59.760> how

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
not have a built-in VEC so here's how

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.630 
not have a built-in VEC so here's how
you<00:00:59.939> hook<00:01:00.150> it<00:01:00.299> up<00:01:00.680> on<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.860> programming<00:01:02.430> card

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
you hook it up on your programming card

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.690 
you hook it up on your programming card
zoom<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.720> can<00:01:03.960> zoom<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.439> oops<00:01:07.580> if<00:01:08.580> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
zoom in so you can zoom in oops if you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940 
zoom in so you can zoom in oops if you
can<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> top<00:01:09.509> here<00:01:09.570> you've<00:01:10.560> got<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
can see at the top here you've got the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.460 
can see at the top here you've got the
BC<00:01:11.490> from<00:01:12.210> your<00:01:12.390> EOC<00:01:12.540> goes<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
BC from your EOC goes here and then you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
BC from your EOC goes here and then you
have<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.650> battery<00:01:14.070> pack<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.150> guys<00:01:15.299> don't

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
have a battery pack if you guys don't

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.859 
have a battery pack if you guys don't
have<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.900> BC<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:17.369> your<00:01:17.850> ESC<00:01:18.270> s<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.540> got<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.780> use

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
have a BC on your ESC s you got to use

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.690 
have a BC on your ESC s you got to use
an<00:01:19.020> external<00:01:19.320> battery<00:01:19.560> pack<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.490> first

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
an external battery pack so the first

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.870 
an external battery pack so the first
thing<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.150> you're<00:01:21.900> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> plug<00:01:22.350> in

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
thing you do you're going to plug in

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.560 
thing you do you're going to plug in
we're<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:23.999> to<00:01:24.090> plug<00:01:24.359> in<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.829> ESC<00:01:26.390> plug<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
we're going to plug in the ESC plug that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.300 
we're going to plug in the ESC plug that
in<00:01:27.719> there<00:01:27.749> negative<00:01:28.170> goes<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.039> the<00:01:29.130> bottom

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
in there negative goes on the bottom

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.660 
in there negative goes on the bottom
signal<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:29.969> the<00:01:30.060> top<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.340> plug<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.549> your

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
signal on the top and plug in your

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.789 
signal on the top and plug in your
battery<00:01:33.119> pack<00:01:33.950> rx<00:01:34.950> packs<00:01:35.280> use<00:01:35.609> an<00:01:35.759> Rx<00:01:36.090> pack<00:01:36.799> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
battery pack rx packs use an Rx pack and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.289 
battery pack rx packs use an Rx pack and
it<00:01:37.950> goes<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:39.710> ok<00:01:40.710> now<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.549> didn't<00:01:42.179> put

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
it goes like that ok now I didn't put

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.539 
it goes like that ok now I didn't put
the<00:01:42.420> plugs<00:01:42.749> on<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.319> haven't<00:01:43.649> put<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:43.950> plugs<00:01:44.280> on

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the plugs on I haven't put the plugs on

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.179 
the plugs on I haven't put the plugs on

my yes su-35 spark no big deal this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.910 
my yes su-35 spark no big deal this
should<00:01:58.229> light<00:01:58.409> up<00:01:58.439> there<00:01:58.889> we<00:01:59.009> go<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.759> see

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
should light up there we go see that see

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.879 
should light up there we go see that see
ok<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.130> all<00:02:02.249> lit<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:03.139> ok<00:02:04.139> so<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.560> hookup

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
one people hoping zoom in this is up and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.080 
one people hoping zoom in this is up and
down<00:02:12.510> left<00:02:12.959> right<00:02:13.110> reset<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.130> okay<00:02:14.550> for<00:02:14.580> enter
