oh<00:00:23.939> let's<00:00:24.750> try<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.109> get<00:00:25.230> not<00:00:25.680> work<00:00:25.890> there<00:00:26.460> go<00:00:26.750> I

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
oh let's try and get not work there go I

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.030 
oh let's try and get not work there go I
get<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> menu<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> menu<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
get on a menu so this is the menu and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.360 
get on a menu so this is the menu and
look<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> problem<00:00:34.219> behind<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
look that there's the problem behind the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.389 
look that there's the problem behind the
screen<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.000> kind<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.360> fuzzy<00:00:36.600> greenie

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
screen this is kind of fuzzy greenie

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.330 
screen this is kind of fuzzy greenie
color<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.809> I<00:00:39.809> basically<00:00:40.170> found<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
color and I basically found all it is is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.940 
color and I basically found all it is is
the<00:00:41.520> LVDS<00:00:41.940> cable<00:00:45.230> because<00:00:46.230> when<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> manipulate

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the LVDS cable because when I manipulate

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.299 
the LVDS cable because when I manipulate
this<00:00:47.539> no<00:00:48.539> BDS<00:00:48.870> cable<00:00:49.230> gets<00:00:49.379> worse<00:00:49.680> when<00:00:50.010> push

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
this no BDS cable gets worse when push

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.310 
this no BDS cable gets worse when push
it<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.640> little<00:00:50.789> gets<00:00:51.000> better<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:52.110> not<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it up a little gets better it's not a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.229 
it up a little gets better it's not a
panel<00:00:52.680> board<00:00:52.890> flexing<00:00:53.430> because<00:00:53.699> pound<00:00:53.969> boards

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
panel board flexing because pound boards

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.540 
panel board flexing because pound boards
secured<00:00:54.629> down<00:00:54.809> very<00:00:55.110> well<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
secured down very well and so if it is

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.740 
secured down very well and so if it is
anything<00:00:56.789> flexing<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.660> that

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
anything flexing it's going to be that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.270 
anything flexing it's going to be that
connector<00:00:58.260> area<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> be

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
connector area and it's just going to be

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160 
connector area and it's just going to be
some<00:00:59.460> solid<00:00:59.760> joint<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.660> everything<00:01:00.930> that's

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
some solid joint but everything that's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560 
some solid joint but everything that's
the<00:01:01.320> issue<00:01:01.469> what's<00:01:02.129> actually<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:03.149> problem<00:01:03.300> on

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the issue what's actually the problem on

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.260 
the issue what's actually the problem on
this<00:01:03.690> model<00:01:04.309> as<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.670> lvds<00:01:06.240> cable

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
this model as you see this lvds cable

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.620 
this model as you see this lvds cable
runs<00:01:06.780> down<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.290> well<00:01:07.740> where<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.630> rushed

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
runs down here well where the rushed

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.890 
runs down here well where the rushed
laborers<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.590> guess<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.979> China<00:01:11.360> were<00:01:12.360> forced<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
laborers I guess in China were forced to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.630 
laborers I guess in China were forced to
take<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.590> take<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> cable<00:01:14.430> down

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
take this down they take the cable down

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.370 
take this down they take the cable down
such<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.030> pulling<00:01:15.450> down<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.900> connector

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
such it's pulling down on the connector

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.440 
such it's pulling down on the connector
I<00:01:16.530> think<00:01:16.680> that's<00:01:16.830> causing<00:01:17.189> undue<00:01:17.310> stress<00:01:17.759> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
I think that's causing undue stress so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.330 
I think that's causing undue stress so
I'm<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.720> remove<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.100> move<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.250> across

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
I'm going to remove that move it across

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.039 
I'm going to remove that move it across
a<00:01:20.549> little<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.939> give<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> cable<00:01:21.420> some<00:01:21.540> flex<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
a little to give the cable some flex and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.630 
a little to give the cable some flex and
put<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> little<00:01:22.409> glue<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
put a little glue up there which it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.940 
put a little glue up there which it
really<00:01:23.850> should<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.560> here's<00:01:25.560> not<00:01:25.740> where<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
really should have here's not where the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.440 
really should have here's not where the
problem<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> decent<00:01:26.820> in

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
problem because that's a decent in

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.149 
problem because that's a decent in
excess<00:01:27.750> won't<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.080> any<00:01:28.200> issues<00:01:28.530> it's<00:01:29.009> also

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
excess won't have any issues it's also

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.850 
excess won't have any issues it's also
call<00:01:30.049> incidentally<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.170> main<00:01:31.409> board<00:01:31.650> looks

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
call incidentally this main board looks

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.719 
call incidentally this main board looks
the<00:01:31.950> same<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> cell<00:01:32.610> 0<00:01:32.869> cello<00:01:33.869> main<00:01:34.350> board

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
the same as the cell 0 cello main board

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.410 
the same as the cell 0 cello main board
so<00:01:35.729> those<00:01:36.540> made<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.810> UK<00:01:37.110> cello<00:01:37.619> TVs<00:01:38.420> well

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
so those made in UK cello TVs well

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.960 
so those made in UK cello TVs well
they're<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.810> parts<00:01:40.259> from<00:01:40.409> China<00:01:41.150> with<00:01:43.970> being

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
they're just parts from China with being

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.569 
they're just parts from China with being
assembled<00:01:45.270> right<00:01:45.899> UK<00:01:46.549> people<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.640> guess<00:01:49.579> but

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
assembled right UK people I guess but

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.440 
assembled right UK people I guess but
that's<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:52.320> very<00:01:53.130> quick<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.610> easy<00:01:53.759> diagnosis

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
