00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 we do not have this plane 792 has arrived 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.170
 because it does not serve the reader of the sim 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.170
 card and we can analyze there 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.550
 we can see that they are 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.550
 smashed the tracks 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.539
 the practices of readers are damaged 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.939
 and then what we have to do is 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.599
 look to see what we can give solution 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.270
 and then here we can analyze 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:32.439
 completely split a matica 2 3 4 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.480
 and 5 is the only good one here 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.399
 it was in the middle and these 3 4 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.570
 totally shattered we need 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.250
 To repair it 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.620
 we need a sim card reader 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.570
 most likely these new phones 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 and we do not have another home to take it out 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.710
 but that will not be the problem because 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.960
 any sim card reader since this 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
 is a normal reader is going to be able to 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.760
 serve the only thing that is almost the same 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.329
 thickness so you can cover it from the back 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.460
 over back 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.530
 for example of being the partridge 93 me 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.899
 would serve would simply take it out by the 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.159
 bottom part to pull out completely 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.990
 as best as possible the connector but 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.759
 looking among the things that sometimes 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.180
 removed albor I found one very similar 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.939
 however, if it was not 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.720
 the same was used but this one has 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.720
 the same dimensions 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.040
 and exactly the same and this I'm going to 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.740
 use of gel to be able to give solution 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.900
 now I will explain since if I do not want 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.080
 put me to disarm all this phone to 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.240
 change it you can use a method to 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.120
 lift that connector without giving heat with 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.340
 the extraction of hot air 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.070
 simply with the product 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.470
 try to change what we are going to do 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.240
 is to heat this this part of here 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.240
 let's say lifting very gently 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.000
 here 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.740
 to lift it 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.700
 and there is already lift it for this 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.700
 corner 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.690
 with bad we will not treat for this either 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.380
 another sector 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.160
 for this ready purpose 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.880
 now I'm just going to unplug every 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.880
 one of the contacts 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.010
 on that side 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.060
 this tip of soldering iron is ideal for that 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.580
 if I would not have that one by one does not have 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.870
 a tip is simply go 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.870
 heating up a talk 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.769
 for a while and Soldan here already 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.780
 I have a soldier only missing this other 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.030
 sector 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.980
 and this technique is very good because it does not 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.140
 there's no heat remember that for 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.950
 being able to change this pin would have to give 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.900
 a good amount of heat and all 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.120
 wash up 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.750
 It would have to be heated and below there 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.920
 important circuits like some I did 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.840
 even the processor can be by 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.840
 the bottom part near this connector 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.150
 here as it is a little harder can 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.620
 repeat that year there 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.220
 so that the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.220
 condition 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.300
 helps to give the temperature 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.880
 and letting go 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.600
 and now I have everything ready to 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.730
 can install the connector cautiously 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.050
 and now that we have all then 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:39.410
 the couple tracks apply flush and let it 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.690
 as much as possible that I could as much as possible 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.540
 everything no longer all plan milestone so that the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.760
 brush can weld and what 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.070
 the closest work that will not be left 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.890
 lifted so that when you close the 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.860
 casing place the back over there has not 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.849
 problems I'll start at all solder 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.849
 the pins 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.090
 of the social ping and we just play 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.090
 the tracks 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.050
 and now yes then we melt good 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.300
 the scouts inc is using the same as 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.760
 has the station just change the 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.930
 point by a tip of these flat for 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.440
 what 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.600
 as the point is wider 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.300
 and maintains a much more temperature 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.060
 high that the final tip however in 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.800
 We can also make the fine tip 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.580
 we are going to delay a little bit more because 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.950
 do 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.350
 contact by contact 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:23.920
 but it will also only be achieved 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.920
 it would be necessary to release them by the sides 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.010
 I repeat to nissan 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.330
 allison 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.610
 let's build languages and if you love 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.169
 we see it they are already reading the sim card 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.590
 says clear 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:51.160
 well they left me with a password before 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.260
 I can not 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.030
 is to make calls that to finish 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.390
 try but there you can see that 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.950
 she recognizes then the network says the 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.750
 rock professional technical service in 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.750
