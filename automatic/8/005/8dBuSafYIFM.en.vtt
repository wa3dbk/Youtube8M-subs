doesn't<00:00:55.920> look<00:00:56.010> too<00:00:56.070> bad<00:00:56.300> as<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:58.199> could

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
doesn't look too bad as you could

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.099 
doesn't look too bad as you could
probably<00:00:58.710> tell<00:00:59.160> why<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.730> sounds<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.899> can

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
probably tell why it sounds if you can

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.470 
probably tell why it sounds if you can
even<00:01:01.260> hear<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.579> animation<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.300> it's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
even hear it and the animation is it's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.070 
even hear it and the animation is it's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.560 
using the stakeout wake let's take out
animations<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.070> seems<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.119> work<00:01:12.270> pretty<00:01:12.420> well

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
