00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.019
 The head-ball monster from Betzenberg had struck 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.519
 unfortunately, only 35 thousand spectators to the top match Schlecker Stade 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.279
 played for half an hour 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.480
 you bring 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.689
 - Label 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.689
 Krones a strong game with this goal 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.279
 At the beginning of the season VfB had to take over the Lido from the Balkans for 52 Offenbach 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.279
 The Neckar brought a stroke of luck 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.580
 Gate every quarter of an hour and this goal with triple preparation by Michael 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.280
 Frontzeck 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.300
 the exam results 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.300
 Frontzeck the second 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.120
 and from ZEK the third 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.240
 kassel 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.860
 with the two to one 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.680
 just 20 seconds before the break 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.270
 a good game of VfB 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.400
 but against the harmless master 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.810
 even after the break 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.220
 Michael Frontzeck the preparer to the gate 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.690
 Minute 4 1 to 3 1 2 1 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.260
 interesting statistics 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.660
 Only 23 percent of all vfb-goal Woburn service prepared 56 percent over 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.430
 right 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.430
 the rest through the middle 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.900
 Kaiserslautern already beaten 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.700
 the VfB now with game 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.710
 on a gate 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 Dubai EHC 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.840
 and Maurizio Gaudino 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.900
 with the four to one 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.320
 the victory could have been much higher 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.010
 but the bad chance evaluation of the VfB 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.010
 prevented an even bigger debacle for the red devils 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.399
 Stuttgart after the victory first used lead this season 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.230
 the second classic against Bayern four weeks later, the Munich with 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.730
 her new coach Seoul apn 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.090
 Stuttgart in fourth place Munich 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.900
 only three tenths of the table 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.430
 because also 62 thousand visitors 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.440
 and they saw a racy Bundesliga playing their SV on b 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:11.859
 after four minutes 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.319
 already the lead 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.319
 now the Heinz for 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.649
 Stuttgart played very concentrated variable creative game construction 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.649
 initiated by course Matthias Sammer 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.459
 50 meters fits 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.789
 against Effenberg 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.279
 and Fritz Walter 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.279
 This stupidity distinguishes the top scorer 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.309
 usually one step faster than his opponent 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.309
 the 2 2 0 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:02:59.889
 so far 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.069
 so grew 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.269
 but afterwards incomprehensibly carelessly Stuttgart 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.269
 the Bayern that instead 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.639
 Foul from Buchhorn to the Brazilian 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.479
 Free kick for Bayern 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.249
 Thomas Berthold 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:37.820
 and the only mistake that Eike Immel 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.069
 in the canton of Berne they are playing like this 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.979
 Immelt said afterwards 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.979
 I usually keep such a thing in my sleep 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.109
 Dieter HoeneÃŸ and Christoph Daum visibly angry the reckless 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.299
 Playing style after the guide did not taste the wide at all 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.369
 but then played the second half 25 minutes 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.329
 from six Lanka and both to Dubai Jentzsch 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.329
 Berlino as a benefactor 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.780
 As the slow motion shows on its feet the authorities are slipping the leather 

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:22.499
 Nintendo 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.099
 3 to 1 the lead 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.020
 frivolous ball loss 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.020
 from Samsung 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.199
 also Berthold 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.419
 Double pass and frontzeck with a nap on your doorstep 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.400
 Bearfoot wanted 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.830
 the referee falls for it 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.249
 penalty 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.860
 the 78 liters 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.879
 the bavarian team Stefan Effenberg, who was plagued by Stephen 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:59.560
 play against 3
