00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and you find that most of your right

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.469 
and you find that most of your right
back<00:01:07.770> sore<00:01:08.040> left<00:01:08.220> backs<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.760> concede<00:01:09.210> those

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
back sore left backs will concede those

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.719 
back sore left backs will concede those
goals<00:01:09.840> through<00:01:10.229> missing<00:01:10.680> those<00:01:10.830> headers<00:01:11.130> but

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
goals through missing those headers but

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.940 
goals through missing those headers but
with<00:01:11.880> Tomas<00:01:12.270> Kalas<00:01:12.510> you'll<00:01:13.229> find<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
with Tomas Kalas you'll find that is a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.550 
with Tomas Kalas you'll find that is a
very<00:01:14.369> depth<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.970> different<00:01:15.540> he<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.140> win<00:01:16.290> most

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
very depth of different he will win most

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.530 
very depth of different he will win most
of<00:01:16.770> those<00:01:16.920> headers<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.670> fact<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.210> don't<00:01:18.270> think

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
of those headers in fact I don't think

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.289 
of those headers in fact I don't think
I've<00:01:18.780> conceded<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.500> goal<00:01:19.530> from<00:01:20.040> him<00:01:20.640> missing<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
I've conceded a goal from him missing a

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.830 
I've conceded a goal from him missing a
header<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.170> box<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.100> he's<00:01:23.369> very<00:01:23.580> strong<00:01:23.909> in

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
header in the box so he's very strong in

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
header in the box so he's very strong in
that<00:01:25.080> part<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.560> his<00:01:25.950> game<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:26.880> moving<00:01:27.090> on

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
that part of his game and then moving on

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.270 
that part of his game and then moving on
to<00:01:27.299> his<00:01:27.509> defending<00:01:28.080> he's<00:01:28.799> got<00:01:28.979> very<00:01:29.159> good

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
to his defending he's got very good

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.999 
to his defending he's got very good
stand<00:01:30.210> tackle<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:30.900> silver<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.650> he's<00:01:31.799> pretty

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
stand tackle for silver and he's pretty

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.249 
stand tackle for silver and he's pretty
strong<00:01:32.430> as<00:01:32.610> well<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.329> he<00:01:33.450> wins<00:01:33.659> most<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.170> his

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
strong as well so he wins most of his

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.640 
strong as well so he wins most of his
challenges<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.329> for<00:01:36.329> right<00:01:36.630> back<00:01:36.960> he<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.409> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650

it into your striker or anything like

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.999 
it into your striker or anything like
that<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.899> depends<00:01:58.320> what<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.619> won't<00:01:58.799> really

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that so it depends what you won't really

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.969 
that so it depends what you won't really
do<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.430> attacking<00:01:59.820> fullback<00:02:00.479> or<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.770> want

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
do on attacking fullback or do you want

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.850 
do on attacking fullback or do you want
a<00:02:02.250> more<00:02:02.759> defensive<00:02:03.420> fullback<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.680> want

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
a more defensive fullback so if you want

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.910 
a more defensive fullback so if you want
a<00:02:04.979> more<00:02:05.009> defensive<00:02:05.700> right<00:02:06.390> back<00:02:06.689> Tomas<00:02:07.680> Kalas

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
a more defensive right back Tomas Kalas

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550 
a more defensive right back Tomas Kalas
is<00:02:08.250> at<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.819> perfect<00:02:09.330> buy<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.050> he

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
is at the perfect buy for you he

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.490 
is at the perfect buy for you he
basically<00:02:11.039> plays<00:02:11.400> like<00:02:11.730> Ivanova

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
basically plays like Ivanova

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.760 
basically plays like Ivanova
Ivanovic<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:14.030> bit<00:02:14.450> quicker<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.320> find<00:02:15.650> a

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
Ivanovic but a bit quicker so I find a

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.190 
Ivanovic but a bit quicker so I find a
better<00:02:15.950> than<00:02:16.160> even<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.520> bitch<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:17.660> silver

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
better than even a bitch and for silver

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.370 
better than even a bitch and for silver
is<00:02:18.320> just<00:02:18.530> amazing<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.900> yes<00:02:21.140> he's<00:02:21.320> very

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
is just amazing so so yes he's very

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.520 
is just amazing so so yes he's very
strong<00:02:21.800> in<00:02:21.980> defense<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.580> very<00:02:23.300> strong<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:24.350> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
strong in defense and very strong in the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.920 
strong in defense and very strong in the
air<00:02:24.710> but<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.400> attack<00:02:25.670> he<00:02:26.300> doesn't<00:02:26.750> really

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
air but in attack he doesn't really

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.650 
air but in attack he doesn't really
feature<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:28.400> wouldn't<00:02:28.730> recommend<00:02:29.090> getting

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
feature and I wouldn't recommend getting

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.690 
feature and I wouldn't recommend getting
him<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.260> want<00:02:30.410> an<00:02:30.709> attacking<00:02:31.100> fullback

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
him if you want an attacking fullback

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.300 
him if you want an attacking fullback
but<00:02:32.300> for<00:02:32.600> very<00:02:32.870> defensive<00:02:33.440> fullback<00:02:33.830> or<00:02:34.040> if

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
but for very defensive fullback or if

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.130 
but for very defensive fullback or if
you're<00:02:34.490> conceding<00:02:34.910> those<00:02:35.209> headers<00:02:35.540> quite

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
you're conceding those headers quite

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.610 
you're conceding those headers quite
often<00:02:36.820> with<00:02:37.820> your<00:02:38.060> right<00:02:38.720> back<00:02:38.990> or<00:02:39.200> left-back

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
often with your right back or left-back

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.400 
often with your right back or left-back
