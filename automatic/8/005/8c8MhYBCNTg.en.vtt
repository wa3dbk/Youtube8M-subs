bit of shading that I've put in here I'm

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.589 
bit of shading that I've put in here I'm
going<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.429> continue<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.210> front<00:00:12.480> of

going to continue that in front of
camera<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.200> did<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:13.950> originally<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.639> front<00:00:14.880> a

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
camera I did this originally in front a

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.580 
camera I did this originally in front a
camera<00:00:15.299> but<00:00:15.480> my<00:00:15.599> hand<00:00:15.870> blocked<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.470> I've

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
camera but my hand blocked it so I've

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.029 
camera but my hand blocked it so I've
changed<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.130> angle<00:00:18.230> so<00:00:19.230> now<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.650> see<00:00:19.859> I'm

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
changed the angle so now you can see I'm

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.730 
changed the angle so now you can see I'm
taking<00:00:20.430> my<00:00:20.550> pencil<00:00:21.000> I'm<00:00:21.119> making<00:00:21.449> circles<00:00:21.779> I'm

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
taking my pencil I'm making circles I'm

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.330 
taking my pencil I'm making circles I'm
using<00:00:23.010> black<00:00:23.490> prismacolor<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:25.130> very<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
using black prismacolor I very the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.029 
using black prismacolor I very the
weight<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.820> my<00:00:27.029> hand<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.660> that's<00:00:28.500> how<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.740> make

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
weight of my hand and that's how I make

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.359 
weight of my hand and that's how I make
things<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.240> deeply<00:00:30.720> dark<00:00:31.199> like<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.980> or

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369

things you know deeply dark like here or
I'm<00:00:33.059> kind<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.480> coming<00:00:33.780> off<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> little

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
I'm kind of coming off with a little

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.639 
I'm kind of coming off with a little
less<00:00:34.620> pressure<00:00:35.010> making<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.760> lighter<00:00:36.000> tone<00:00:36.649> and

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
less pressure making a lighter tone and

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.799 
less pressure making a lighter tone and
if<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.399> some<00:00:38.610> textured<00:00:39.120> lines<00:00:39.420> or

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
if I want to have some textured lines or

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.090 
if I want to have some textured lines or
something<00:00:40.079> like<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.920> between

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
something like that I have so between

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.889 
something like that I have so between
this<00:00:41.520> bone<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> bone<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.510> might<00:00:42.690> wanna

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
this bone and that bone I might wanna

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.279 
this bone and that bone I might wanna
shadow<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.579> start<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.059> dark<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.809> edge

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
shadow so I start out dark and edge

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.240 
shadow so I start out dark and edge
where<00:00:47.010> they<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.670> intersect<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.890> then<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.070> can

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
where they to intersect and then you can

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.880 
where they to intersect and then you can
see<00:00:50.489> me<00:00:50.700> pulling<00:00:51.030> off<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.570> black<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.289> little

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
see me pulling off the black a little

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.569 
see me pulling off the black a little
lighter<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.840> I<00:00:54.840> create<00:00:55.289> kind<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.860> curve<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
lighter as I create kind of a curve and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.639 
lighter as I create kind of a curve and
then<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> bump<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:59.719> some<00:01:00.719> texture<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.260> then

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
then a bump here some texture and then

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.090 
then a bump here some texture and then
bring<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> around<00:01:03.500> you<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.589> something

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
bring this around you know something

bring this around you know something
like<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> plan<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> side<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.650> i

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
like so this is a plan on the side so i

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.710 
like so this is a plan on the side so i
may<00:01:07.950> extend<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> little<00:01:08.909> bit<00:01:09.240> i<00:01:09.540> got<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
may extend this out a little bit i got a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.250 
may extend this out a little bit i got a
bump<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.380> that's<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.770> top<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.460> bone<00:01:12.260> so

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
bump here that's on top of this bone so

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.719 
bump here that's on top of this bone so
we<00:01:13.409> show<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> little<00:01:13.950> bit<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.270> shadow<00:01:15.270> down<00:01:15.659> here

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
we show a little bit of shadow down here

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.380 
we show a little bit of shadow down here
can't<00:01:17.729> smooth<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.720> edge<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
can't smooth out this edge this is the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.570 
can't smooth out this edge this is the
way<00:01:21.509> i<00:01:21.540> would<00:01:21.900> build<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.530> tattoo<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.430> you've

the phalanges and we're going to create

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.700 
the phalanges and we're going to create
some<00:01:40.560> shadows<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.400> highlights<00:01:41.540> mid-tones

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
up textures I look for planes this is a

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.150 
up textures I look for planes this is a
rounded<00:02:14.030> surface<00:02:14.569> this<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.959> maybe<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.800> debt

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
rounded surface this is maybe a debt

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.280 
rounded surface this is maybe a debt
coming<00:02:16.610> into<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.330> know<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.810> have<00:02:18.050> that

coming into it you know so have that
like<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:20.800> put<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.830> little<00:02:21.950> drop<00:02:22.220> shadow<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:23.030> here

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.640 

little<00:02:28.730> whistling<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.510> know<00:02:29.540> make<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.349> fun

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
we're going to bring the stem out a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.289 
we're going to bring the stem out a
little<00:02:36.110> bit<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.620> know<00:02:36.650> maybe<00:02:37.010> maybe<00:02:37.819> kind<00:02:38.269> of

little bit you know maybe maybe kind of
a<00:02:38.390> draft<00:02:38.780> shell<00:02:39.140> down<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.920> bone<00:02:40.160> here<00:02:40.489> that

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
a draft shell down on the bone here that

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.759 
a draft shell down on the bone here that
follows<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.329> surface<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.019> bone<00:02:42.230> comes

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
follows the surface of the bone comes

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.720 
follows the surface of the bone comes
around<00:02:43.190> like<00:02:43.519> this<00:02:45.430> gives<00:02:46.430> us<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.700> lift<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:48.730> this

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
around like this gives us a lift so this

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.920 
around like this gives us a lift so this
is<00:02:49.760> going<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.180> be<00:02:50.329> kind<00:02:50.599> of<00:02:50.720> an<00:02:50.870> edge

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.380 

see<00:02:56.530> that's<00:02:56.769> like<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> dirt<00:02:57.370> undercarriage

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
see that's like a dirt undercarriage

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.800 
see that's like a dirt undercarriage
and<00:02:59.720> then<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:01.069> get<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.550> ball<00:03:01.790> in<00:03:02.060> here<00:03:02.480> we

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
and then you get the ball in here we

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.610 
and then you get the ball in here we
have<00:03:03.050> some<00:03:03.200> light<00:03:03.470> coming<00:03:03.890> behind<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.730> bone

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
have some light coming behind that bone

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.540 
have some light coming behind that bone
so<00:03:06.620> I'm<00:03:06.740> going<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.950> take<00:03:07.130> my<00:03:07.370> shadow<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:08.090> kind

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
I'm making this object seem like it's

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.380 
I'm making this object seem like it's
raised<00:03:20.810> away<00:03:21.470> from<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.220> bone<00:03:22.459> itself<00:03:23.060> you

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
raised away from the bone itself you

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.990 
raised away from the bone itself you
know<00:03:23.800> that<00:03:24.800> that's<00:03:25.130> kind<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.700> what<00:03:25.850> we're

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
know that that's kind of what we're

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.199 
know that that's kind of what we're
trying<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.360> do<00:03:26.570> you're<00:03:26.870> watching<00:03:27.320> this<00:03:27.440> alive

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
trying to do you're watching this alive

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:35.800 
trying to do you're watching this alive
on<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.420> video<00:03:29.690> as<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:31.520> man<00:03:31.730> himself<00:03:31.940> draws<00:03:34.810> just

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
on a video as the man himself draws just

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.830 
on a video as the man himself draws just
the<00:03:36.050> speed<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.830> way<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.430> do<00:03:37.670> stuff<00:03:38.209> man<00:03:38.570> it

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
the speed and the way I do stuff man it

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.509 
the speed and the way I do stuff man it
because<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.380> hardest<00:03:39.709> part<00:03:39.890> is<00:03:40.010> created<00:03:40.430> a

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
because the hardest part is created a

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.199 
because the hardest part is created a
line<00:03:40.910> work<00:03:41.209> once<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:41.720> think<00:03:41.989> that<00:03:42.230> out<00:03:43.209> then

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
line work once you think that out then

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.090 
line work once you think that out then
you're<00:03:44.480> going<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.690> go<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.110> do<00:03:45.320> this<00:03:45.350> stuff<00:03:45.920> you
