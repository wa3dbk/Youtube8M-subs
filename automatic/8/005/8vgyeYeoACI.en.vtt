00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.160
 very good to all guys welcome 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.200
 we join the channel in I am flight and 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.300
 welcome to this case after so much 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.530
 time to a new video first of all 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.150
 thanks for the support in the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.889
 last video we surpassed the 500 serious 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.599
 which is what I asked you so thank you 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.090
 for all the love given in the last video 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.859
 and today I bring you a team 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.439
 Turkish league voucher what is 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.359
 I'll try to make it my first team 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.980
 in the next fifa a team that I think 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.480
 that will be very good to start 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.029
 I recommend that at the beginning you start with 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.500
 a team that is from a league no and no 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.730
 go to a hybrid start with the league 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.110
 and when you already have more coins if 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.450
 you think it 's time to form 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.190
 players there you can start doing 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.050
 hybrids or whatever you want this is 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.370
 my choice is worth you I want the 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.170
 comments I also like the one that 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.510
 protect is some will start share and its 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.310
 technique is seen but I think the league 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.720
 Turkish at the beginning is going very well just for 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.190
 the fact that it's a league that people 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.560
 neither are there many, neither are there 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.540
 full of cracks and can be a league 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.340
 very good to start I'll ask you 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.930
 that in this video we reach 500 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.820
 likes again it would be amazing we are 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.530
 in August, well, not everyone is so 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.240
 assets but the few that you are 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.800
 would be great to lead a here 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.540
 what can be if the video so nothing 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.250
 let's go with the team let's start with 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.130
 the training in only four 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.220
 3 in its variant number 4 in the in the 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.780
 previous fifa this 15 is the one that better me 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.670
 has gone then I will continue to trust 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.460
 in the next game to start worth 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.229
 also tell you that in the section of the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.570
 good description you will have the link to 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.280
 football and budget is worth for you to spend 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.869
 and you can see how the equipment is fixed 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.330
 15 in case you want to try and give it 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.770
 I tested all the young people in 515 and 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.470
 that's why I opted for this option 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.170
 in goal we have a goalkeeper 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.820
 that in 515 it was great and see see 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.350
 how are the goalkeepers in the 16 but of 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.390
 this will be my choice 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.850
 right side we would have gönül 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.890
 quickie defensively it was very good and 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.869
 strong in defense from the right 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.670
 we have the Colombian pedro franco a 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.039
 I greet all the people of Colombia 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.300
 stuck by the central one that was gold not 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.710
 weird and here I hope it's 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.780
 bright because they assure you the average 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.240
 surely on your left we would have 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.550
 here already a central who is quite young 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.110
 and it's one of the revelations of football 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.369
 Turkish has been for years and they are very good 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.160
 but this year it seems that it has 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.020
 excel are the other vale and lateral 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.369
 left we would have to elkin a player 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.959
 that had its version all that's why I've 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.220
 pretty much raised the average and that 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.900
 it will surely be 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.790
 pretty good we go now with the center 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.370
 from the field on the left although this 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.470
 it seems felipe melo is not assigned a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.790
 better that I had long hair I do not know 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.830
 has shortened and the truth is that it is a 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.170
 very complete player has defense has 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.430
 a center to the field is for center of the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.560
 field the player is very much 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.090
 balance that is very very good in the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.430
 On the other hand, we had Raúl Meireles 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.290
 already known by almost everyone with the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.400
 chelsea liverpool game and well then 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.830
 right now he 's there in the Turkish league 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.270
 taking out your money and well it will be a 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.400
 midfielder has lost will go 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.290
 completito although not so defensive and without 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.760
 more than long short quality shots and that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.040
 and from three with offensive track 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.050
 we would have opened a player who did 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.360
 we also know it all exjugador del 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.250
 athletic of madrid who did some very 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.690
 good seasons with the cholo and that without 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.730
 doubt can be a very very good player 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.670
 in the future a lot of quality much touch or 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.320
 in phase 4 skill surely a crack without 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.970
 no doubt there is one of the references 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.890
 of the team we are going to find the three of 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.020
 up to the three cracks is worth the 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.850
 left pod we would have samosas just 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.250
 here it is a lot blacker than the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.560
 photo type 15 but it's like that we're going to 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.690
 do the poor little eye fast with good 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.340
 shot but that especially has strength is 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.349
 physical is high and as I have seen 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.750
 in the game to say that the slowest 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.819
 it's more physical not chosen him and I think 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.040
 which will be a very good end option 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.690
 right that we had to dyn is worth a 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.340
 Pretty quickie player or in control 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.800
 good shot ball good pass pretty 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.200
 complete in your statistics is a 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.060
 species of cambre goes worse but seemed 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.519
 ok but the Turk and the truth is that 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.930
 I think it will be a very good choice and 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.760
 in front of the centers we would have there 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.310
 the sea also already known by all a 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.540
 high strong and physical forward which is what 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.849
 that I said that is what surely 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.980
 get carried away or super slow will have more than 80 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.959
 of rhythm surely and so I can 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.700
 could see in videos reactions 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.890
 prints is much slower and 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.989
 I think that in the more than adequate enough 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.060
 to what will be the next fifa 16 and this 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.129
 is my team guys I repeat in the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.870
 description you will have the push links 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.640
 towards football so you can see how 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.769
 Are the equipment worth what are the 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.329
 players so you can see everything and 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.040
 nothing else I hope that the comments I 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.590
 leave your players yours 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.850
 your team as you will start and also 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.220
 let your hope there is that 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.930
 have if we exceed the 500 ballistic and 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.760
 nothing more if I see that this video has 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.130
 very much support soon I would upload a 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:29.200
 premier team so nothing 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.200
 everyone and until the next goodbye
