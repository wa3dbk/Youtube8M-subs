00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
the the gym is just because of the fact

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.450 
the the gym is just because of the fact
that<00:02:48.180> uh<00:02:48.380> game<00:02:49.380> speeds<00:02:49.710> are<00:02:49.800> hundred<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.400> I

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
that uh game speeds are hundred and I

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.040 
that uh game speeds are hundred and I
don't<00:02:50.640> want<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.850> mess<00:02:51.060> with<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.480> because<00:02:51.750> it

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
don't want to mess with that because it

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.320 
don't want to mess with that because it
might<00:02:52.230> mess<00:02:52.290> up<00:02:52.530> my<00:02:52.740> one<00:02:53.100> minute<00:02:53.400> quarters<00:02:53.640> so

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
might mess up my one minute quarters so

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.780 
might mess up my one minute quarters so
that's<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:55.110> know<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.590> reason<00:02:56.400> why<00:02:56.520> I'm<00:02:56.610> not

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
that's you know a reason why I'm not

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.210 
that's you know a reason why I'm not
getting<00:02:57.090> excellent<00:02:57.480> releases<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:58.800> because

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
getting excellent releases it's because

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.640 
getting excellent releases it's because
the<00:02:59.640> game<00:02:59.790> speeds<00:03:00.000> out<00:03:00.240> 100<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.170> kind<00:03:01.560> of

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the game speeds out 100 and that kind of

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.340 
the game speeds out 100 and that kind of
affects<00:03:01.890> my<00:03:02.070> shot<00:03:02.340> at<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.120> moment<00:03:03.600> but<00:03:04.140> yeah

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350
