 monthly volume reliability test 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.620
 maximum that lasts 5 weeks is the

 the client is going to demand we submit 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.170
 the devices to a variable program 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.689
 long test times shorter times 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.700
 a face to two faces to simulate the use 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.650

 Minolta is the image quality the color 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.740

 what really defines konica 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.869
 Minolta is the consistency in all 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.579
 speeds in both monochrome and 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.229
 color some manufacturers excel in 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.090
 black and white and others do it in color 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.190
 but none offers so much quality in 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.989
