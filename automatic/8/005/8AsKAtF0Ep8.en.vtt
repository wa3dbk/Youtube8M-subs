00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.650 

in<00:00:06.130> this<00:00:06.400> video<00:00:06.760> I'll<00:00:07.029> look<00:00:07.180> at<00:00:07.300> putting<00:00:07.510> a

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
in this video I'll look at putting a

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.600 
in this video I'll look at putting a
simple<00:00:08.139> ambient<00:00:08.590> occlusion<00:00:08.740> shader<00:00:09.190> as<00:00:09.490> an

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
simple ambient occlusion shader as an

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.750 
simple ambient occlusion shader as an
override<00:00:10.120> on<00:00:10.420> my<00:00:10.570> office<00:00:10.930> space<00:00:11.170> here<00:00:11.760> ambient

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
override on my office space here ambient

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.720 
override on my office space here ambient
occlusion<00:00:12.940> then<00:00:13.360> is<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.710> grounding<00:00:15.190> darkness

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
occlusion then is the grounding darkness

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.429 
occlusion then is the grounding darkness
in<00:00:15.880> our<00:00:15.940> scene<00:00:16.270> that<00:00:16.540> adds<00:00:16.689> gravity<00:00:17.320> to

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
in our scene that adds gravity to

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.679 
in our scene that adds gravity to
everything<00:00:17.860> basically<00:00:18.340> here's<00:00:18.910> what<00:00:19.090> happens

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
everything basically here's what happens

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.290 
everything basically here's what happens
light<00:00:20.439> bounces<00:00:20.920> around<00:00:21.040> a<00:00:21.340> scene<00:00:21.580> and<00:00:21.760> at<00:00:22.029> some

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
light bounces around a scene and at some

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.390 
light bounces around a scene and at some
point<00:00:22.539> is<00:00:22.779> ambient<00:00:23.289> it's<00:00:23.619> not<00:00:23.770> coming<00:00:24.190> from<00:00:24.250> a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
point is ambient it's not coming from a

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.760 
point is ambient it's not coming from a
particular<00:00:24.730> source<00:00:25.170> when<00:00:26.170> that<00:00:26.320> light<00:00:26.590> is

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
particular source when that light is

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.769 
particular source when that light is
blocked<00:00:27.130> by<00:00:27.400> adjacent<00:00:27.910> objects<00:00:28.330> we<00:00:28.539> get

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
blocked by adjacent objects we get

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.250 
blocked by adjacent objects we get
occlusion<00:00:29.880> darkness<00:00:30.880> so<00:00:31.689> we<00:00:31.779> can<00:00:31.900> think<00:00:32.110> of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.260 
occlusion darkness so we can think of

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.960 
occlusion darkness so we can think of
occlusion<00:00:32.590> or<00:00:32.980> ambient<00:00:33.309> occlusion<00:00:33.519> as

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
occlusion or ambient occlusion as

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.229 
occlusion or ambient occlusion as
proximity<00:00:34.660> shadows<00:00:35.610> local<00:00:36.610> shading<00:00:37.030> caused

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
proximity shadows local shading caused

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.139 
proximity shadows local shading caused
by<00:00:37.600> adjacent<00:00:38.170> objects<00:00:38.860> blocking<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:39.550> ambient

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
by adjacent objects blocking the ambient

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.479 
by adjacent objects blocking the ambient
light<00:00:40.300> in<00:00:40.450> the<00:00:40.540> scene<00:00:40.780> what<00:00:41.739> I'll<00:00:41.860> do<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.190> start

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
light in the scene what I'll do to start

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.580 
light in the scene what I'll do to start
then<00:00:42.730> is<00:00:42.940> get<00:00:43.360> an<00:00:43.450> override<00:00:43.899> material<00:00:44.469> on

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
then is get an override material on

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.190 
then is get an override material on
everything<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.129> see<00:00:45.340> how<00:00:45.489> it<00:00:45.610> looks<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:47.079> make

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
everything and see how it looks to make

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.170 
everything and see how it looks to make
an<00:00:47.350> override<00:00:47.800> then<00:00:48.070> we'll<00:00:48.520> right-click<00:00:49.030> on

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
an override then we'll right-click on

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.910 
an override then we'll right-click on
the<00:00:49.270> master<00:00:49.719> layer<00:00:49.899> and<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.260> render<00:00:50.649> layers

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
the master layer and the render layers

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.729 
the master layer and the render layers
in<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.280> channel<00:00:51.610> box<00:00:52.110> choosing<00:00:53.110> overrides

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
in the channel box choosing overrides

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.939 
in the channel box choosing overrides
and<00:00:54.129> create<00:00:55.090> new<00:00:55.270> material<00:00:55.690> override<00:00:55.960> I'll

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
and create new material override I'll

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.880 
and create new material override I'll
use<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.219> surface<00:00:57.789> shader<00:00:58.059> and<00:00:58.320> I'll<00:00:59.320> go<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.739> the

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
use a surface shader and I'll go to the

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.619 
use a surface shader and I'll go to the
attribute<00:01:00.340> editor<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.820> name<00:01:01.180> this<00:01:01.390> AO

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
attribute editor and name this AO

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.889 
attribute editor and name this AO
general<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:04.030> use<00:01:04.149> surface<00:01:04.420> shaders

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
general I like to use surface shaders

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.660 
general I like to use surface shaders
because<00:01:05.289> they<00:01:05.500> don't<00:01:05.680> affect<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:06.280> ambient

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
because they don't affect the ambient

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.279 
because they don't affect the ambient
occlusion<00:01:06.880> with<00:01:07.330> any<00:01:07.479> additional<00:01:08.050> shading

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
occlusion with any additional shading

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.100 
occlusion with any additional shading
all<00:01:08.950> surface<00:01:09.640> shaders<00:01:09.939> do<00:01:10.150> is<00:01:10.299> return<00:01:10.659> a<00:01:10.720> color

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
all surface shaders do is return a color

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.050 
all surface shaders do is return a color
they<00:01:11.409> don't<00:01:11.560> actually<00:01:11.740> deal<00:01:12.400> with<00:01:12.460> lighting

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
they don't actually deal with lighting

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.719 
they don't actually deal with lighting
and<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:14.020> putting<00:01:14.680> an<00:01:14.830> ambient<00:01:15.189> occlusion<00:01:15.220> in

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
and so putting an ambient occlusion in

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.880 
and so putting an ambient occlusion in
works<00:01:15.939> perfectly<00:01:16.450> because<00:01:16.900> again<00:01:17.470> ambient

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
works perfectly because again ambient

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.490 
works perfectly because again ambient
occlusion<00:01:18.040> is<00:01:18.430> not<00:01:18.610> lit<00:01:19.360> it<00:01:19.810> just<00:01:20.080> depends<00:01:20.439> on

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
occlusion is not lit it just depends on

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.280 
occlusion is not lit it just depends on
cameras<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.250> geometry<00:01:21.720> I'll<00:01:22.720> go<00:01:22.990> into<00:01:23.200> the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
cameras and geometry I'll go into the

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.859 
cameras and geometry I'll go into the
out<00:01:23.439> color<00:01:23.830> texture<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.600> create

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
out color texture and in the create

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.140 
out color texture and in the create
render<00:01:26.140> node<00:01:26.290> dialog<00:01:26.830> go<00:01:27.100> under<00:01:27.369> mental<00:01:27.850> ray

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
render node dialog go under mental ray

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.130 
render node dialog go under mental ray
textures<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:28.900> choose<00:01:29.500> mid<00:01:29.860> Amba<00:01:30.400> clusion

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
textures and choose mid Amba clusion

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.690 
textures and choose mid Amba clusion
I'll<00:01:32.140> go<00:01:32.439> into<00:01:32.680> my<00:01:32.770> render<00:01:33.130> settings<00:01:33.520> and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
I'll go into my render settings and

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.190 
I'll go into my render settings and
tweak<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:34.000> few<00:01:34.030> things<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.689> then<00:01:34.840> I'll<00:01:34.960> run<00:01:35.110> an

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
tweak a few things and then I'll run an

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.300 
tweak a few things and then I'll run an
IPR<00:01:35.619> pass<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:38.619> in<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.799> render<00:01:39.070> settings

when I'm dealing with an override the
first<00:01:41.110> thing<00:01:41.320> I'll<00:01:41.439> do<00:01:41.619> is<00:01:41.799> change<00:01:42.640> that<00:01:42.759> file

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
in the dark is black and so we should be

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.700 
in the dark is black and so we should be

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
image to give me this general gray so

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.070 
image to give me this general gray so
I'm<00:02:29.820> going<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.090> turn<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.510> off<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.900> get<00:02:31.050> a

I'm going to turn it off and get a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.830 
I'm going to turn it off and get a

better read on the ambient occlusion

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.500 
better read on the ambient occlusion
I'll<00:02:33.840> pause<00:02:34.230> my<00:02:34.500> IPR<00:02:35.120> jump<00:02:36.120> back<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.330> the

I'll pause my IPR jump back to the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.750 
I'll pause my IPR jump back to the
render<00:02:36.900> settings<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.680> features<00:02:38.190> turn

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.820 
render settings and in the features turn
off<00:02:38.940> lens<00:02:39.270> shaders<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:40.350> way<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.590> don't<00:02:40.710> have

off lens shaders this way I don't have

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.110 
off lens shaders this way I don't have
to<00:02:41.010> disconnect<00:02:41.460> it<00:02:41.640> from<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:41.910> camera<00:02:42.180> now

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
to disconnect it from my camera now

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.680 
to disconnect it from my camera now
unpause<00:02:45.120> IPR<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.910> looks<00:02:48.180> much<00:02:48.420> better

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
unpause IPR and it looks much better

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.930 
unpause IPR and it looks much better
doesn't<00:02:48.960> it<00:02:49.460> actually<00:02:50.460> it's<00:02:50.580> working

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
doesn't it actually it's working

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.699 
doesn't it actually it's working
perfectly<00:02:51.390> what<00:02:51.780> we're<00:02:51.930> seeing<00:02:52.170> here<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.590> a

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
perfectly what we're seeing here is a

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.740 
perfectly what we're seeing here is a
function<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.459> occlusion<00:02:53.970> distance<00:02:54.510> and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
function of the occlusion distance and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.590 
function of the occlusion distance and
the<00:02:55.200> quality<00:02:55.650> here's<00:02:56.640> how<00:02:56.820> we<00:02:56.880> can<00:02:57.000> tune<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.450> up

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
the quality here's how we can tune it up

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.920 
the quality here's how we can tune it up
then<00:02:58.070> in<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.880> occlusion<00:03:00.390> shader<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.780> have

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
then in that occlusion shader we have

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.650 
then in that occlusion shader we have
samples<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:02.250> higher<00:03:02.490> sample<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.240> quality

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
samples and a higher sample in quality

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.199 
samples and a higher sample in quality
yields<00:03:04.260> well<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> better<00:03:04.709> image<00:03:05.100> at<00:03:05.310> some<00:03:05.910> point

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
yields well a better image at some point

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.640 
yields well a better image at some point
we<00:03:06.390> won't<00:03:06.510> notice<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.959> difference<00:03:07.350> but<00:03:07.530> I'll

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
we won't notice a difference but I'll

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.280 
we won't notice a difference but I'll
put<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.860> up<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.160> 32<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.750> next<00:03:10.050> thing<00:03:10.170> with

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
put it up to 32 the next thing with

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.840 
put it up to 32 the next thing with
occlusion<00:03:10.740> then<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.190> look<00:03:11.340> at<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.610> max

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
occlusion then is to look at the max

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.510 
occlusion then is to look at the max
distance<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:13.320> is<00:03:13.380> why<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.800> size<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.430> the

tight dark occlusion in the the detail

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.710 
tight dark occlusion in the the detail
we'll<00:04:07.230> call<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:08.090> I'm<00:04:09.090> getting<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.510> good

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
we'll call it and I'm getting a good

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.449 
we'll call it and I'm getting a good

spread of occlusion along things like

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.750 
spread of occlusion along things like
the<00:04:11.640> stairs<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.269> can<00:04:12.450> tweak<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.780> further

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
the stairs and I can tweak it further

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.360 
the stairs and I can tweak it further
spread<00:04:15.420> then<00:04:15.629> controls<00:04:16.139> how<00:04:16.979> does<00:04:17.250> that

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
spread then controls how does that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.490 
spread then controls how does that
occlusion<00:04:17.940> cluster<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.840> corners<00:04:19.290> or

spread into that zone we've established

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.560

being<00:04:48.479> a<00:04:48.600> linear<00:04:48.900> fall-off<00:04:49.199> I'll<00:04:50.190> bring<00:04:50.460> that

being a linear fall-off I'll bring that

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.400 
being a linear fall-off I'll bring that
spread<00:04:51.060> back<00:04:51.270> up<00:04:51.479> so<00:04:51.660> we<00:04:51.690> can<00:04:51.870> really<00:04:52.050> see<00:04:52.139> how

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
spread back up so we can really see how

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.860

this<00:04:52.530> looks<00:04:55.280> with<00:04:56.280> a<00:04:56.340> fall-off<00:04:56.820> of<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:57.300> that

this looks with a fall-off of to that
occlusion<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.530> going<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:58.919> take<00:04:59.070> out<00:04:59.250> its<00:04:59.340> time

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
to fall off in that zone giving me a lot

darkness but here in my modernist office
it's<00:05:18.600> a<00:05:18.660> little<00:05:18.900> much<00:05:19.080> I'll<00:05:19.620> pull<00:05:20.340> the

it's a little much I'll pull the

it's a little much I'll pull the
fall-off<00:05:20.700> back<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.330> 0.5<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.229> I'll<00:05:22.800> see<00:05:23.010> a

fall-off back to 0.5 and I'll see a

fall-off back to 0.5 and I'll see a
radical<00:05:23.310> change

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
much tighter darkness in the corners but

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.670 
much tighter darkness in the corners but
then<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.360> occlusion<00:05:36.870> dissipates<00:05:37.470> more

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
then the occlusion dissipates more

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.770 
then the occlusion dissipates more
rapidly<00:05:38.129> so<00:05:38.430> my<00:05:38.789> objects<00:05:39.240> without<00:05:39.389> leaving

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.749 
rapidly so my objects without leaving
odd<00:05:40.229> darkness<00:05:41.009> on<00:05:41.189> the<00:05:41.219> walls

odd darkness on the walls

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.209 
odd darkness on the walls
I'll<00:05:42.330> pull<00:05:42.900> back<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:43.259> spread<00:05:43.590> just<00:05:43.830> a<00:05:43.919> little

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
I'll pull back the spread just a little

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.149 
I'll pull back the spread just a little
bit<00:05:44.370> maybe<00:05:44.729> 2.6<00:05:45.599> and<00:05:45.870> I'm<00:05:46.500> ready<00:05:46.710> to<00:05:46.860> run<00:05:47.039> that

bit maybe 2.6 and I'm ready to run that

bit maybe 2.6 and I'm ready to run that
occlusion<00:05:47.669> I<00:05:47.819> might<00:05:48.810> also<00:05:48.990> take<00:05:49.289> back<00:05:49.530> the<00:05:49.740> max

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949

images into Photoshop and just copied
and<00:06:30.840> pasted<00:06:31.289> them<00:06:31.439> on<00:06:31.560> to<00:06:31.710> each<00:06:31.830> other<00:06:32.009> I've

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
and pasted them on to each other I've

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.610 
and pasted them on to each other I've
set<00:06:33.060> the<00:06:33.180> ambient<00:06:33.539> occlusion<00:06:33.719> to<00:06:34.050> multiply

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
set the ambient occlusion to multiply

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.279 
set the ambient occlusion to multiply
this<00:06:35.550> way<00:06:35.819> the<00:06:36.330> white<00:06:36.599> and<00:06:36.750> the<00:06:36.810> occlusion

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
this way the white and the occlusion

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.279 
this way the white and the occlusion
disappears<00:06:38.419> multiplying<00:06:39.419> by<00:06:39.629> white<00:06:39.900> is<00:06:40.139> like

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
disappears multiplying by white is like

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:42.559 
disappears multiplying by white is like
multiplying<00:06:40.710> by<00:06:40.919> one<00:06:41.340> there's<00:06:41.729> no<00:06:41.940> effect<00:06:42.330> and

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
multiplying by one there's no effect and

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.439 
multiplying by one there's no effect and
then<00:06:42.810> the<00:06:42.930> black<00:06:43.199> or<00:06:43.500> whatever<00:06:43.800> gray<00:06:44.069> it<00:06:44.219> is

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449 
then the black or whatever gray it is

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.059 
then the black or whatever gray it is
multiplies<00:06:45.449> the<00:06:45.750> over<00:06:46.139> by<00:06:46.319> the<00:06:46.379> under<00:06:46.800> color

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:47.069 
multiplies the over by the under color

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.219 
multiplies the over by the under color
and<00:06:47.339> divides<00:06:47.789> by<00:06:47.969> the<00:06:48.029> color<00:06:48.360> space<00:06:48.690> yielding

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
and divides by the color space yielding

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:51.709 
and divides by the color space yielding
a<00:06:49.319> darker<00:06:49.830> place<00:06:50.190> in<00:06:50.370> the<00:06:50.460> image<00:06:50.759> it's

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:51.719 
a darker place in the image it's

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:53.899 
a darker place in the image it's
terrific<00:06:52.050> for<00:06:52.259> ambient<00:06:52.710> occlusion<00:06:52.909> because

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:53.909 
terrific for ambient occlusion because

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:55.369 
terrific for ambient occlusion because
it<00:06:54.029> gives<00:06:54.210> me<00:06:54.270> that<00:06:54.360> grounding<00:06:54.960> darkness

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:55.379 
it gives me that grounding darkness
