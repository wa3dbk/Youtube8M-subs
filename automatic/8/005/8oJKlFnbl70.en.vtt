00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Little is Satanic and a prostitute 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.259
 first I do not want them to come to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.780
 make comments for the simple fact of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.090
 look at something and think that a simple 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.610
 Animated character can not hurt and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.039
 that therefore is not satanic is 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.260
 well you can believe what you want but the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.020
 people who see beyond and see things in 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.970
 a spiritual realm is to those people 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.039
 is what I'm going to direct you to this 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.800
 message if for you the things that are 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.320
 ugly are the bad ones and the pretty ones are the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.739
 good then your perception of the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.070
 reality is limited with respect to what 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.930
 what are we going to talk about here in this video 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 because the reality is quite the opposite 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.270
 what looks nice and innocent 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.649
 hides a great evil clarified the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.469
 previous point 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.199
 let's start unfortunately and I say 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.960
 unfortunate because it is the pure truth all 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.149
 whatever is Japanese Chinese and now Korean 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.850
 is satanic does not want a 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.390
 exaggerated to misinterpret I mean 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 exclusively to the majority of comics 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.960
 animations and comics 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.110
 example dragon ball pokemon sailor moon 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.910
 knights of the zodiac and so on 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.560
 colacce anime the plot of pucca the plot 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.960
 series focuses on a village 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.910
 called rope where little tries 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.660
 love gary and kiss him as much as 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.970
 can while gary tries to escape garu 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.670
 he's a clever ninja for what he does 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.060
 great escapes but then little with 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.700
 his skills always manages to catch him 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.290
 ending each episode with a kiss 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.509
 meanwhile there are problems and 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.910
 extremely large complications that 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.890
 they seem impossible to solve that 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.550
 they develop the story a bit for 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.130
 give you emotion however few always 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.729
 find an extraordinary way to 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.410
 sometimes impossible to resolve the situation 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.650
 through his intelligence and his strength 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.530
 superhuman when Christians 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.869
 we refer to something satanic or diabolical what 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.479
 we do not because the character is ugly and 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.450
 have horns or horns but because the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.220
 most people adopt the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.470
 behavior the dress and even 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.470
 the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.990
 personality of said characters in 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.690
 other words people are influenced 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.260
 for things and that does not seem bad 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.690
 since their minds are blinded perhaps 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.480
 say that one is exaggerated but the 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.000
 problem is what that character leaves in 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.280
 the life of the people is very true 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.800
 how little is pretty tender and simple 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.990
 Vista is a funny character for his 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.890
 occurrences the problem comes when 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.180
 we see even young girls and boys 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.120
 influenced with the attitude of said 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.880
 character we are not talking about the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.700
 appearance but from the inside of your 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.390
 personality of his behavior of that 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.970
 we talk we can even go further if 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.370
 we realize we see 5 year old girls 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.650
 even up to 20 years making the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.530
 little character an obsession the bulk or 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.230
 pucca backpack pucca notebook 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.570
 pucca sheet the pucca pencil the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.880
 pucca keychain the pupa plush and 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.160
 we see how an idol starts to return 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.690
 that only the candles would be missing and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.970
 the prayers because I can even 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.270
 enter the rooms and they look like a 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.730
 temple or an altar of saints accessories 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.640
 of pucca notebooks and backpacks of little 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.800
 age the most tender secularly speaking 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.170
 is the most given to the pleasures of the 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.680
 flesh beyond giving his body for 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.200
 pleasure does it for believing to be tender 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.140
 asterisk equal little to that we 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.660
 we refer to the influence of obsession 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.520
 to the exaggeration and debauchery that 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.650
 leads to becoming an otaku 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.530
 obsession anime a little girl e 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.960
 innocent said to me little is something bad 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.240
 because when you see it you can not stop 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.970
 see him and my mom we saw him and 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.850
 even tab we go as soon as you see it no 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.730
 You can stop seeing it the truth of 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.900
 little time is a Korean prostitute like that 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.210
 of simple because Korean is equal 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.280
 because the character was created in Korea 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:18.170
 south asterisk because she is a prostitute 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.930
 ere equals because it was created based on the 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.790
 figure of the geishas ladies of companies 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.160
 from that country 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.340
 in other words, little is a putica 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.030
 small they wanted hayes to similarity is 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.640
