00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:03.850
 he was the man of the evening 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.080
 here was three of the six Freiburg hits 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.320
 the first prank came up and took until the 19th 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.419
 until the first 15 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.859
 Thomas Greilinger had previously 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.859
 However, this first part will be spared 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.869
 celebrates with numerous chances the best had Thomas Greilinger 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.159
 in the first third would have significantly more Torgefahr 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.350
 especially as he excited Messiaen from a promising position 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 shortly before the siren Schalke 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.690
 in the second third Greilinger grabs the disc and the pool 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.700
 but fails Lukas Smolka 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.130
 Bissendorf continues and then they come are from those and sunk the 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.870
 disc 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.790
 2 c minor for celebrate 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.500
 and now it went fast 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 five minutes later, Tom Coughlin pulls caught 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560
 I actually played 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.410
 and that means to celebrate Benkendorf 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.830
 and exactly fits 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.530
 everything done right after a while, however, and she herself lives his binge 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.540
 lands in the gate 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.030
 the preliminary decision 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.960
 the strings are pulling too 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.290
 Precisely targeted to the millimeter 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.830
 this shot 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.200
 five minutes later it's the third row I'm coming to success 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.510
 Huber had the little one with him 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
 The youngster comes free from criminal charges 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.780
 Halle had some of the best opportunities for scoring here and there 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 Beginning of the last third 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.200
 Rainer Teide but wide awake 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.690
 the outfield players to help 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.750
 parking lots shortly thereafter 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.000
 Greilinger intervenes and can only be stopped at the expense of a foul 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.370
 Penalty the right decision 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.190
 Of course, this is not an inner LIBE 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.670
 accordingly loose the disc sunk 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.430
 6 to zero 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.520
 Of course, the game has long been won 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.450
 accordingly unfocused 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.380
 Sleep Tight 6 places 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.559
 Jan Schertz fits it back as a percentage 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.559
 1 to 6 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:18.769
 then we need to party and there was something in the last home games doctor 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.089
 always was the case 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.089
 Gegentreffer at own overarching sharpest scorer 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.489
 and where earns six to two 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.519
 That was a very important government 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.349
 won in the Arena Idyll on Friday against Rostov but that was nothing 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.859
 if we did not win today and JAL 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.600
 given the first 40 minutes 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.199
 Is there ... here 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.199
 but he wanted 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.959
 Pauli against Red Ahlen knows this at least on the bench are back 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.959
 Michael Winnerl became 7 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.479
 October is a book 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.839
 Leo especially, Mondorf trained and Allure is always there 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:00.249
 Isa felt good 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:01.649
 Moritz 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:03.049
 on you 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.169
 and the last piece about Lorem ipsum dolor for Sibylle Spyker 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.590
 Maybe the second will work against the Black Dragons from Erfurt
