00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
you know I by the way I think this is a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.330

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
because I can't believe I'm saying kids

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.880 
because I can't believe I'm saying kids
today<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.660> they're<00:03:05.660> lazy<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.530> they're

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
today and they're lazy and they're

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.080 
today and they're lazy and they're
apathetic<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.880> here's<00:03:08.239> this<00:03:08.630> election<00:03:09.170> is

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
apathetic and here's this election is

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.220 
apathetic and here's this election is
such<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> chance<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.720> really<00:03:11.959> make<00:03:12.079> a

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
such a chance to really make a

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.319 
such a chance to really make a
difference<00:03:12.680> at<00:03:12.829> any<00:03:13.010> age<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:13.730> think<00:03:14.180> it's

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
difference at any age and I think it's

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.819 
difference at any age and I think it's
kind<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.660> gift<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.049> everybody<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.560> will<00:03:15.709> only
