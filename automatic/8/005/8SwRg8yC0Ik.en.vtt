00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
save my brothers so that implies that

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.360 
save my brothers so that implies that
and<00:03:28.360> if<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.870> look<00:03:29.049> closely<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.709> these<00:03:29.920> these

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
and if you look closely in these these

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.940 
and if you look closely in these these
snow<00:03:31.180> scenes<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.690> don't<00:03:31.840> see<00:03:32.049> Raphael<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:32.860> it

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
snow scenes you don't see Raphael so it

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.199 
snow scenes you don't see Raphael so it
seems<00:03:33.190> like<00:03:33.370> in<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.610> movie<00:03:33.880> he<00:03:34.030> gets

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
seems like in the movie he gets

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.780 
seems like in the movie he gets
separated<00:03:34.920> which<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.160> kind<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.610> running

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
separated which is kind of a running

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.070 
separated which is kind of a running
theme<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.269> Ninja<00:03:37.480> Turtles<00:03:37.510> because<00:03:37.989> if

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
bazookas I mean

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.860 
bazookas I mean
like<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.579> feel<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:56.819> dubstep<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.659> like<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
like I feel like dubstep is like the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.910 
like I feel like dubstep is like the
modern-day<00:03:58.140> version<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.590> what<00:03:58.709> they<00:03:58.799> would

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
modern-day version of what they would

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.699 
modern-day version of what they would
use<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.189> like<00:03:59.340> surf<00:03:59.670> rock<00:03:59.939> yeah<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:01.439> you<00:04:01.590> know

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
use is like surf rock yeah and you know

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.199 
use is like surf rock yeah and you know
what<00:04:01.829> I<00:04:02.069> think<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.430> works<00:04:02.639> if<00:04:02.849> they're<00:04:03.030> going

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
what I think it works if they're going

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.569 
what I think it works if they're going
for<00:04:03.450> an<00:04:03.569> audience<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:04.109> like<00:04:04.349> teenage<00:04:04.769> teenage
