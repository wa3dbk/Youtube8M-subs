 hello friends like mick today we're going to do 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.099
 peach pie first let's make 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.220
 the broken dough the following are 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.610
 pastry flour cold butter in 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.610
 chunks 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.109
 Water 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.120
 a little chemical yeast and a pinch 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.980
 of salt 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.620
 and remember that all recipes with 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.980
 quantities are located in little more 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.980
 dot com 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.750
 we put in the glass all the 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.750
 ingredients 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.520
 and we program 15 seconds of the gases 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.850
 now we put the mass obtained in a 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.769
 bag if it is a bag consider better 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.620
 we press a little so that the dough that 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.620
 define 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.480
 a layer that is not too fat and now 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.719
 we will let stand in the fridge about 15 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.719
 minutes 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.410
 while we prepare a tartera a 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.500
 mold of those used to make 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.810
 kisses but be very high we started with 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.120
 a little butter in the background and 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.850
 by the sides 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.650
 and we reserve 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.600
 we prepare on the surfaces program 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.380
 with a little flour where we are going to 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.380
 take out the dough 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.409
 we throw a little flour tenths to the 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.090
 mass we imagine the roller also for 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.030
 that does not stick we've been waiting for the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.470
 mass also likes it to be very thin 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.530
 so I'll wear everything I can 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.110
 you do it to your liking 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.880
 and when we have it, it only remains 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.040
 you can with a little flour to the dough and 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.790
 also the roller because we are going to 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.409
 Rolling a dough for later 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.100
 place it in the world 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.020
 Slowly and carefully 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.240
 but let's say the mass and we're going 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.670
 placing on top of the world then 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.799
 we adapt the mass by gluing the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.799
 corners and edges of the mold 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.650
 we cut out the excesses of mass 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.650
 there should not be something like that 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.260
 we puncture the surface too 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.810
 by the edges 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.110
 so they do not find out too much in the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.110
 oven 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.519
 and when we have it, we put it 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.900
 rest another fifteen minutes in the 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.909
 fridge and then in the oven 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.830
 pre-heated they change the 15 minutes to 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.110
 180 degrees 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.060
 and while it is done we are going to prepare 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.800
 the peach we will use peach in 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.810
 the city ​​that we will have to discover what 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.160
 we put in a colander and also 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.760
 we observe in it but that we are going 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.760
 to use 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.850
 so we will have the base once dreamed 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.260
 is going to catch some color and goes to 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.260
 get a little crispy 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.850
 let's prepare the pastry cream 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.570
 with milk and yolks 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.570
 eggs 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.580
 to sugar 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.959
 flour or cornstarch can be made with 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.790
 two 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.469
 you can use some normal or flour 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.469
 of pastry or corn 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.650
 and orange zest ibáñez then 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.880
 dehydrated or liquid or extract

 Vanilla whatever you have on hand 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.299
 we put all the toys in the glass 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.120
 that are the milk the yolks the eggs the 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.030

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.950
 the flour the orange zest and the 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.620
 vanilla 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.620
 the 27 minutes 90 degrees in the art 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.880
 when the time is up I will add a 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.730
 little butter that is going to give you a 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.700
 very good taste and it will be a cream 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.380
 silky the program again a 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.990
 minute heras 4 Always go to 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.180
 temperature and after letting it cool 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.850
 the 10 minutes in the glass pour the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.830
 cream on the base they have already cooled 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.960
 also for a while 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.240
 and now we will let cool a while ago 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.240
 until we prepare the peach 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.280
 the peach is already drained and what 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.280
 cut into thin slices 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.319
 We are placing the sheets of 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.319
 peach on top of the custard 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.580
 and now we only have to give it a little more 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.310
 of brightness and fix the peach with a 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.120
 little jelly here I have an envelope of 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.120
 neutral gelatin 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.830
 and here I have the peach syrup 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.800
 mixed with water until getting 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.050
 necessary amount 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.940
 you know that the recipes with streets 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.090
 is on the page then there you go to 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.090
 find 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.050
 we put in a continuation bol 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.860
 we add a little water 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.860
 empty 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.240
 we mix with the rods 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:28.679
 we put the rest of the water to boil 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.679
 when it boils we extinguish the fire 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.760
 and we add the boiling water on top of 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:40.590
 the gelatin that we have dissolved before 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.590
 mixing well with the rods 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.069
 now we will let cool for about 15 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.070
 or 20 minutes until the gelatin 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:52.520
 start to take body 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.770
 I give the souls above the vote 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.370
 maybe I'll give you some jelly 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.080
 use the one you see necessary 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.330
 and if you want you can also help something 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.460
 from sugar to gelatin I did not add it then 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.870
 I've seen it well like that and when I'm fine 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.930
 turn the cake we regret to the area of 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.250
 Posing in the fridge for 5 hours or 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.500
 it can be better until the day 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.930
 next when it has already returned the 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.639
 we can cut 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.400
 I've cut it here a little before 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.020
 time that's why the cream serves a little 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.680
 soft but I tell you that if you leave it 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.419
 rest long enough minimum 5 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.250
 hours in the fridge will look good and 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.070
 the peach cobbler is ready 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.289
 you have seen that it has a base 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.750
 crunchy very rich with broken dough and 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:38.060
 then a silky pastry cream and with 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.860
 a very good taste then over the 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.810
 peach with the gelatin that gives it a 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.320
 very good touch without it being too much 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.510
