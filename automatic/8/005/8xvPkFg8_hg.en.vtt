starting from the bottom we'll talk
about<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.199> now<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:31.980> core<00:00:32.309> will<00:00:32.640> fit<00:00:32.880> both<00:00:33.390> an

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
about that now the core will fit both an

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.260 
about that now the core will fit both an
inch<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> quarter<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.739> well<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> two<00:00:36.059> inch

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
receiver right out of the box now you've

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.190 
receiver right out of the box now you've
noticed<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.120> most<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.540> other<00:00:39.690> racks<00:00:39.989> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
noticed on most of the other racks that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
noticed on most of the other racks that
we<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.649> hand<00:00:40.980> tightened<00:00:41.430> cam<00:00:41.640> system

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
we have that hand tightened cam system

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.049 
we have that hand tightened cam system
into<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> receiver<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.860> core<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.610> uses

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
into the receiver the core actually uses

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.110 
into the receiver the core actually uses
a<00:00:45.390> threaded<00:00:46.200> hitch<00:00:46.440> pin<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.039> lock<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.550> rack

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
a threaded hitch pin to lock the rack

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.840 
a threaded hitch pin to lock the rack
into<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.870> receiver<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.129> does<00:00:50.340> require<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
into the receiver so it does require a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.049 
into the receiver so it does require a
tool<00:00:51.210> which<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.840> included<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> rack<00:00:53.059> so

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
tool which is included with the rack so

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.590 
tool which is included with the rack so
the<00:00:54.570> ease<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.809> installation<00:00:55.620> still<00:00:56.610> there<00:00:56.850> but

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the ease of installation still there but

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.170 
the ease of installation still there but
it's<00:00:57.870> not<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.320> quick<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.640> hand<00:00:59.820> tightened

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it's not as quick as the hand tightened

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.729 
it's not as quick as the hand tightened
cam<00:01:00.329> system<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.140> gives<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.680> great

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
cam system but gives you that great

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.160 
cam system but gives you that great
security<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.000> again<00:01:03.359> when<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.780> tightened

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
security and again when it's tightened

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.230 
security and again when it's tightened
down<00:01:04.229> doesn't<00:01:04.890> allow<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> rack<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.460> move<00:01:05.909> in

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
down doesn't allow the rack to move in

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.940 
down doesn't allow the rack to move in
the<00:01:06.330> receiver<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.930> again<00:01:07.320> give<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.619> bikes<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
that spring-loaded pin again so we're

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.560 
that spring-loaded pin again so we're
pulling<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> lever<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:17.070> allow<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.570> drop
