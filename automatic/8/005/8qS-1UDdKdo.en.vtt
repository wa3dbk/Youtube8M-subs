 The next thing I show you is 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.140
 such a department but here I have a type 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.120
 pencil case substitute because i don't wear 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.580
 pencil case to school when our bag is because 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.320
 that doesn't fit it is huge here 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.210

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.330
 two pencils just in case an eraser 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.710
 scissors is surely a very necessary thing on 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.990
 actually talk what kind of mask 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:04.610

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.830
 call this is a secret my goodness that to me 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.010

 I just didnâ€™t have time for letters after 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.770
 schools get together you go to rehearsal and 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.530
 necessarily brought here but in principle 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:46.100
 all that is in my bag but not here 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:49.160
 there is all such a division as he 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.050
 the base opens and show them what 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.370
 here already there is a little bit just 1 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.750
 leaf cosmetic bag I will not you 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.510
 show what's inside because but this 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.660
 damn, how to know this is not ethical 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.220
 show therefore think that but it 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.970
 just need to carry with everyone 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.280

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.350

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.150
 life is actually very good he is to 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.710
 to fighters and both in forest life and its rare 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.840
 so I use a large bag 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.090
 throw that will use powder 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.490
 here is such a simple 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.080
 Cheap powder that I use to school 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.850
 because i have physical education when i 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.919

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.350
 I'm fat, I'm sweating 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.169
 and you need to somehow remove it all so 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.980
 in principle, now everything is for sure 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.450
