can see to be random when comes the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:38.339 
can see to be random when comes the
checkpoints

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.869 

let's<00:02:39.349> a<00:02:39.470> rhythm<00:02:39.739> with<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.950> HelpOut<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.730> come

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
let's a rhythm with a HelpOut to come

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.140 
let's a rhythm with a HelpOut to come
back<00:02:41.060> then<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:41.620> no<00:02:42.620> such<00:02:42.800> luck<00:02:42.860> what<00:02:43.640> let's<00:02:43.940> do

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
back then but no such luck what let's do

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.479 
back then but no such luck what let's do
this<00:02:44.269> again<00:02:44.540> it's<00:02:44.720> good<00:02:44.950> what<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:46.069> assume<00:02:46.459> is

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
this again it's good what I assume is

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.470 
this again it's good what I assume is
the<00:02:46.670> key<00:02:46.910> down<00:02:47.150> here<00:02:48.879> it<00:02:49.879> turns<00:02:50.120> out<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.269> be<00:02:50.360> a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
the key down here it turns out to be a

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.479 
the key down here it turns out to be a
hunk<00:02:50.780> of<00:02:50.930> meat<00:02:51.140> like<00:02:51.200> earlier<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.010> game<00:02:52.040> or
