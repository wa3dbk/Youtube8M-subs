00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
a bunch of kids and I predict personally

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.319 
a bunch of kids and I predict personally
was<00:00:46.100> very<00:00:46.280> surprised<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.940> consumer

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
was very surprised that the consumer

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.810 
was very surprised that the consumer
base<00:00:47.510> took<00:00:47.750> us<00:00:47.870> this<00:00:47.989> way<00:00:48.219> but<00:00:49.219> what<00:00:49.430> I<00:00:49.489> come<00:00:49.760> to
