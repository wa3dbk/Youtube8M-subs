00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 American football for some women 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.330
 probably one of the best 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.330
 sports that we can 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.490
 but for other women and some 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.710
 men is like opening them in another 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:19.660
 language is that of the first and third and 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.660
 fourth many women are going to tell me 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.040
 but I think that knowing and not hinder 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.290
 that if you like to prepare the 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.780
 snacks because he knows the truth that's how it is 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.270
 that today I have 5 points 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.840
 basic to understand a little more the 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.840
 american football 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.390
 we started talking the superbowl or like 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.450
 it is known in some places 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.970
 the nfl is the national league of 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.920
 American football has two burners the 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.680
 American and the national 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.989
 each of these leagues has 16 teams 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.390
 that give a total of 32 teams that 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.020
 they play in the nba each of these 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.840
 teams play 16 games 8 at home and 8 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.420
 by the 26 American League and the top 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 6 of the national league were those who 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.470
 they recognize as traces that not that they 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.570
 eliminate within their own league the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.880
 champion of the national league and the champion 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.840
 of the American League plays what is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840
 know how 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.329
 in the American each team has 13 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.460
 defensive teams the offensive and the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.079
 special equipment the objective that is the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.000
 core amd that the receivers and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.009
 runners are the ones who attack for 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.929
 write down the introduction to the defensive 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.479
 that linebackers are the corners and 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.299
 The sexy ones are the ones in charge of stopping 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.950
 to the offensive of the opposing team and the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.560
 third team is what is known 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.049
 as the special teams here fly 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.509
 the kicker among others they are 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.939
 responsible for the kicks of clearance of 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.509
 the extra points and return the ball 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.149
 within other special activities 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.299
 now good money the field that is that 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.649
 of the first and ten of third and fourth 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.769
 before we start we have to have the 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.620
 100 yard field nor are marked 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.470
 every 10 targets to each offensive are given 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.630
 four opportunities to advance 10 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.540
 first yard and it is refers to the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.270
 first opportunity to move forward and it's already 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.450
 let's say they advance 3 already 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.210
 now it would be second and 7 second 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.830
 opportunity to advance 7 and high but 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.960
 what happens if within four 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.300
 10 do not advance opportunities and 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.280
 two options the weapon for you to 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.860
 receive the opposite or in a given team 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.500
 case of being close to being able to score and 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.110
 kick to score a field goal more 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.180
 little bit tells us what messed up this 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.370
 kick is only done if so close to 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.080
 scoring will not happen they are at 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.790
 50 no longer because probably not 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.190
 speaking there are several ways to win 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.340
 points in the america is not like all 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.650
 we know the famous artist behind flame 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.770
 of 6 points and that's when the runner 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.780
 reaches the end of the field either and 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.430
 sent a pass or ran away but 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.620
 the ball if the team coming too 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.450
 tachan there are two options the first 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.360
 option is to tie on the ball from 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.180
 the line of two yards for a point 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.330
 or that was a ball from the line of 2 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.090
 yards for two additional points there 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.490
 what is known as firco or violating 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.040
 this is how I told you when 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.780
 special teams enter the field to 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.910
 kick the ball because they failed 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.910
 advance 10 yards on your four 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.850
 opportunities and finally this safety 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.070
 this is when a team is creating 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.709
 opposing team in their own area 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.090
 this is worth 20 if you have seen your pro 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.709
 Americans have realized that a 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.930
 Sometimes a yellow flag is thrown 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.060
 this is because someone made a mistake 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.860
 there are too many types of faults that do not 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.550
 I could cover but I'm going to give you some 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.550
 of the most common 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.069
 if the lack or get the equipment of the 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:05.319
 defensive you are given advance yards to the 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.209
 offensive team if the team the 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.239
 offensive is to say the track noting the 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.310
 goal they say the foul is backed 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.470
 nothing I think that's all that 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.810
 we must know the basics obviously not 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.100
 we got into both detail well because 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.109
 this is going to be enough for 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.600
 understand a little more the American and 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.840
 you always did not understand anything because 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.240
 minus 100 there x 50 code and you know 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.330
 as I always leave here the phrase of 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.330
 day 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.210
 thank you for joining me in another video and 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.539
 I see them here next Wednesday 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.539
 bye 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.840
