 Y 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.310
 Carefully paleontologists of the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.230
 inah and the unam remove the rock 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.270
 sedimentary of the vertebrae of a 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.640
 dinosaur tail 5 meters 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.279
 length that remains buried from 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.390
 72 million years ago in the desert 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.090
 from coahuila 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.710
 this finding is the product of a 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.309
 attention to complaint that was presented to us 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.110
 in June 2012 where a citizen in 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.930
 this case Mr. Jose Lopez or Espinoza 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.430
 We reported the possible finding of a 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.140
 dinosaur we did the 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.820
 corresponding inspection and we saw that 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.040
 it was a matter of at least some 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.570
 articulated vertebrae we begin to see 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.980
 that followed a whole column 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.050
 vertebral and we started doing the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.870
 bibliographic search and we begin to 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.310
 develop the research project 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.470
 the copy is in perfect 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.150
 state of conservation and corresponds to 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.910
 a hadrosaur or duckbill 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.100
 the dinosaurs that are most frequent 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.160
 find in mexico are the peaks of 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.230
 duck with and without crest this copy is 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.360
 concrete run dung 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.860
 articulated is not easy because you have 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.900
 than to give a series of conditions that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.630
 have allowed the body to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.800
 preserve as this example where 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.650
 see the sequence of the vertebrae of 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.590
 what is the sacrum to where it ends and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.260
 it would be the tip of the tail there are not many 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.690
 sites worldwide where 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.030
 they make these kinds of discoveries and what 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.400
 most important to us at the level of 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.940
 Mexico is that it is the first 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.590
 discover with that kind of characteristics 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.550
 as part of the objectives that the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.310
 National Institute of Anthropology 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.750
 story that is to watch over also by the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.750
 paleontological heritage that sometimes 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.550
 we have this as we do not associate the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.410
 word paleontology with the inah good 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.410
 in this case especially in the state of 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.990
 coahuila we are very intertwined with 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.020
 this kind of heritage over all 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.569
 thank civil society 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.430
 the one that we report in this type 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.720
 of findings and we can do the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.720
 corresponding linkage 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.060
 the rescue is done through a 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.250
 joint project between the inah and the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.980
 unam with the support of the municipality of 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.540
 general cepeda the fossil will be transferred 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.939
 to a conditioned space like 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.489
 laboratory that will be open so that 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.989
 the people of the nearby towns 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.569
 know the conservation process 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.760
 research around this dinosaur 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.060
 that inhabited the earth millions of 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.060
 years
