don't know if you can see them but

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:13.019 
don't know if you can see them but
there's<00:00:11.949> a<00:00:12.010> couple<00:00:12.190> groundhogs<00:00:12.760> running

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:13.029 
there's a couple groundhogs running

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:14.459 
there's a couple groundhogs running
around<00:00:13.150> over<00:00:13.510> there<00:00:13.629> in<00:00:13.750> the<00:00:13.809> field<00:00:14.170> that's

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
around over there in the field that's

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:15.000 
around over there in the field that's
great

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
great

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.970 
great
so<00:00:15.910> matter<00:00:16.150> with<00:00:16.359> the<00:00:16.480> outlaw<00:00:17.109> and<00:00:17.410> Wembley

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
so matter with the outlaw and Wembley

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.339 
so matter with the outlaw and Wembley
two<00:00:18.310> demos<00:00:18.970> to<00:00:19.269> test<00:00:19.539> on<00:00:19.720> this<00:00:19.869> one<00:00:20.199> is

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
two demos to test on this one is

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.009 
two demos to test on this one is
recovery<00:00:20.830> speed<00:00:21.099> and<00:00:21.339> the<00:00:22.119> other<00:00:22.269> is<00:00:22.509> super

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 
recovery speed and the other is super

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.929 
recovery speed and the other is super
pinpointing<00:00:23.769> that<00:00:24.160> happens<00:00:24.580> in<00:00:24.759> the

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
pinpointing that happens in the

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.140 
pinpointing that happens in the
all-metal<00:00:25.839> non<00:00:26.380> motion<00:00:26.859> mode<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.339> it<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.640> wild

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
all-metal non motion mode and it is wild

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.849 
all-metal non motion mode and it is wild
that<00:00:28.480> I<00:00:28.509> show<00:00:28.720> it<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:28.839> you<00:00:28.960> but<00:00:29.529> first<00:00:29.740> we're

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
that I show it to you but first we're

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.529 
that I show it to you but first we're
going<00:00:29.949> to<00:00:30.009> go<00:00:30.130> over<00:00:30.159> the<00:00:30.490> recovery<00:00:31.179> speed<00:00:31.390> of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
going to go over the recovery speed of

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.900 
going to go over the recovery speed of
the<00:00:31.599> unit<00:00:31.869> I<00:00:32.050> have<00:00:32.470> it<00:00:32.590> set<00:00:32.829> in<00:00:33.070> discrimination

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
the unit I have it set in discrimination

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.860 
the unit I have it set in discrimination
mode<00:00:34.270> I<00:00:35.010> set<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.190> retune<00:00:36.790> on<00:00:36.970> this<00:00:37.210> threshold

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
mode I set the retune on this threshold

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.110 
mode I set the retune on this threshold
I<00:00:38.320> got<00:00:38.680> two<00:00:38.830> targets<00:00:39.250> here<00:00:39.400> I'm<00:00:39.520> using<00:00:39.640> foil

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
I got two targets here I'm using foil

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.050 
I got two targets here I'm using foil
and<00:00:40.390> in<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.230> center<00:00:41.500> of<00:00:41.560> the<00:00:41.620> board<00:00:41.800> is<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.060> gold

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
and in the center of the board is a gold

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.450 
and in the center of the board is a gold
ring<00:00:43.360> 14<00:00:44.050> karat<00:00:44.350> gold<00:00:44.380> ring<00:00:44.710> little<00:00:44.950> closer<00:00:45.250> on

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
ring 14 karat gold ring little closer on

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.130 
ring 14 karat gold ring little closer on
the<00:00:45.580> discrimination<00:00:45.880> scale<00:00:46.510> so<00:00:46.780> we'll<00:00:47.020> see

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
the discrimination scale so we'll see

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.890 
the discrimination scale so we'll see
what<00:00:47.260> happens<00:00:47.590> here<00:00:48.360> great<00:00:49.360> machine<00:00:49.720> it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
what happens here great machine it

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.900 
what happens here great machine it
should<00:00:50.080> do<00:00:50.200> quite<00:00:50.710> well<00:00:50.740> so<00:00:51.370> first<00:00:51.610> of<00:00:51.760> all<00:00:51.820> we

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
should do quite well so first of all we

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.640 
should do quite well so first of all we
got<00:00:52.060> both<00:00:52.270> targets<00:00:57.210> gold<00:00:58.210> ring<00:00:58.510> double<00:00:59.440> beef

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
got both targets gold ring double beef

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.620 
got both targets gold ring double beef
cuz<00:00:59.920> I'm<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.040> little<00:01:00.250> bit<00:01:00.340> close<00:01:00.610> and<00:01:01.000> we<00:01:01.450> can<00:01:01.540> go

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
cuz I'm a little bit close and we can go

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.130 
cuz I'm a little bit close and we can go
over<00:01:01.780> both<00:01:01.930> of<00:01:01.990> them<00:01:02.290> now<00:01:03.869> both<00:01:04.869> of<00:01:05.049> them

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
over both of them now both of them

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.359 
over both of them now both of them
sounding<00:01:05.530> out<00:01:06.960> alright<00:01:07.960> no<00:01:08.380> problems<00:01:08.859> and<00:01:09.280> it

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
sounding out alright no problems and it

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.029 
sounding out alright no problems and it
turn<00:01:09.549> up<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.880> discrimination<00:01:10.630> now<00:01:11.009> to<00:01:12.009> a

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
turn up the discrimination now to a

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.279 
turn up the discrimination now to a
point<00:01:12.249> where<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.579> foil<00:01:12.909> gets<00:01:13.240> eliminated<00:01:13.600> and

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
point where the foil gets eliminated and

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.830 
point where the foil gets eliminated and
passed<00:01:14.950> back<00:01:15.219> over<00:01:15.490> both<00:01:15.670> targets<00:01:18.569> and<00:01:19.569> only

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
passed back over both targets and only

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.590 
passed back over both targets and only
the<00:01:19.960> ring<00:01:20.200> sings<00:01:20.710> out<00:01:21.039> so<00:01:21.490> let's<00:01:22.329> move<00:01:22.479> the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
the ring sings out so let's move the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.239 
the ring sings out so let's move the
foil<00:01:22.810> a<00:01:22.899> little<00:01:23.109> closer<00:01:23.319> we'll<00:01:23.859> move<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.130> up<00:01:24.219> to

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:24.249 
foil a little closer we'll move it up to

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:25.919 
foil a little closer we'll move it up to
about<00:01:24.429> three<00:01:24.789> inches<00:01:25.119> two<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.539> a<00:01:25.569> half<00:01:25.719> three

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:25.929 
about three inches two and a half three

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.649 
about three inches two and a half three
inches<00:01:28.950> no<00:01:29.950> problem<00:01:30.520> that's<00:01:30.700> really<00:01:31.240> fast

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
inches no problem that's really fast

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.899 
inches no problem that's really fast
recovery<00:01:32.049> speed<00:01:32.499> for<00:01:32.679> this<00:01:32.770> unit<00:01:33.100> move<00:01:33.819> it

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
recovery speed for this unit move it

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.719 
recovery speed for this unit move it
into<00:01:34.030> about<00:01:34.299> an<00:01:34.479> inch<00:01:37.409> again<00:01:38.409> no<00:01:38.770> problem<00:01:39.039> for

into about an inch again no problem for

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.129 
into about an inch again no problem for
the<00:01:39.850> outlaw<00:01:40.179> these<00:01:40.389> two<00:01:40.569> saw<00:01:40.780> rows<00:01:40.929> are

the outlaw these two saw rows are

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:42.779 
the outlaw these two saw rows are
excellent<00:01:41.829> if<00:01:42.249> some<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.579> best

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
excellent if some of the best

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:43.980 
excellent if some of the best
discrimination<00:01:43.420> circuits<00:01:43.840> you're<00:01:43.899> gonna

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
discrimination circuits you're gonna

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.800 
discrimination circuits you're gonna
find<00:01:44.350> on<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.560> detector<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.369> I<00:01:46.240> put<00:01:46.569> the<00:01:46.630> foil

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
find on a detector and I put the foil

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.730 
find on a detector and I put the foil
right<00:01:47.079> on<00:01:47.229> top<00:01:47.439> of<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.709> ring<00:01:48.549> again<00:01:52.590> gonna<00:01:53.590> get

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740

let's<00:01:58.420> take<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.719> foil<00:01:58.959> and<00:01:59.020> put<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.289> back<00:01:59.499> out

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
let's take the foil and put it back out

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.749 
let's take the foil and put it back out
here<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.810> show<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:01.869> we'll<00:02:02.049> go<00:02:02.139> over<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.350> ring

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
here and show you we'll go over the ring

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
in the all-metal non motion mode I'm

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.980 
in the all-metal non motion mode I'm
gonna<00:02:21.650> pause<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.160> camera<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.600> we'll<00:02:23.780> pick<00:02:23.930> it

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
gonna pause the camera and we'll pick it

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.770 
gonna pause the camera and we'll pick it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
three silver back here with the outlaw I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.130 
three silver back here with the outlaw I
got<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> nickel<00:02:29.330> on<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> ground<00:02:29.840> here<00:02:30.050> I'm

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
got a nickel on the ground here I'm

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.700 
got a nickel on the ground here I'm
gonna<00:02:30.260> do<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> quick<00:02:30.890> demo<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:32.320> what<00:02:33.320> destroys

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
gonna do a quick demo of what destroys

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.130 
gonna do a quick demo of what destroys
calling<00:02:34.250> super<00:02:34.850> pinpointing<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.720> rightly<00:02:36.020> so

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
calling super pinpointing and rightly so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.780 
calling super pinpointing and rightly so
you<00:02:36.470> got<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.680> check<00:02:36.830> this<00:02:36.890> out<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:37.580> pretty

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
you got to check this out it's pretty

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.640 
you got to check this out it's pretty
amazing<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.900> I've<00:02:38.960> got<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.140> nickel<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
amazing so I've got a nickel on the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.130 
amazing so I've got a nickel on the
ground<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.310> I'm<00:02:40.490> in<00:02:40.640> all-metal<00:02:41.150> non<00:02:41.660> motion

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
ground and I'm in all-metal non motion

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.110 
ground and I'm in all-metal non motion
which<00:02:42.290> means<00:02:42.400> don't<00:02:43.400> have<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.610> move<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.790> coral

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
which means don't have to move the coral

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.300 
which means don't have to move the coral
to<00:02:44.570> detect<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.260> target<00:02:45.440> right<00:02:48.160> they<00:02:49.160> could

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
to detect the target right they could

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.190 
to detect the target right they could
Vantage<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.760> that<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:50.120> can<00:02:50.270> creep<00:02:50.660> this<00:02:50.870> coil

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
Vantage to that you can creep this coil

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.570 
Vantage to that you can creep this coil
over<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.250> ground<00:02:52.490> very<00:02:52.940> very<00:02:53.270> slowly<00:02:53.720> and

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
over the ground very very slowly and

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.220 
over the ground very very slowly and
when<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.670> come<00:02:55.820> across<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:56.150> target<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.990> just

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
when you come across a target you just

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.750 
when you come across a target you just
you<00:02:57.590> have<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.950> better<00:02:58.130> chance<00:02:58.220> of<00:02:58.580> hearing

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
you have a better chance of hearing

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.840 
you have a better chance of hearing
those<00:02:58.970> subtle<00:02:59.330> changes<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.280> threshold

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
those subtle changes to the threshold

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.420 
those subtle changes to the threshold
level<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:03.470> subtle<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.130> means<00:03:04.310> you've

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
level just subtle and that means you've

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.670 
level just subtle and that means you've
got<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.550> deep<00:03:04.760> target<00:03:05.210> and<00:03:05.360> great<00:03:06.320> for<00:03:06.500> digging

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
got a deep target and great for digging

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.140 
got a deep target and great for digging
I<00:03:06.920> mean<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.400> all-metal<00:03:07.760> modes<00:03:08.000> are

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
I mean that the all-metal modes are

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.020 
I mean that the all-metal modes are
great<00:03:08.330> for<00:03:08.510> relic<00:03:08.750> honors<00:03:09.080> they're<00:03:09.680> smooth<00:03:10.130> as

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
great for relic honors they're smooth as

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.910 
great for relic honors they're smooth as
I<00:03:11.210> said<00:03:11.390> they're<00:03:11.510> not<00:03:11.630> as<00:03:12.230> susceptible<00:03:12.470> to

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
I said they're not as susceptible to

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.430 
I said they're not as susceptible to
false<00:03:13.280> thing<00:03:13.810> they're<00:03:14.810> a<00:03:14.840> little<00:03:15.020> bit<00:03:15.110> deeper

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
false thing they're a little bit deeper

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.960 
false thing they're a little bit deeper
than<00:03:15.560> disk<00:03:15.830> mode<00:03:16.100> we<00:03:16.460> use<00:03:16.610> them<00:03:16.760> all<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.880> time

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
than disk mode we use them all the time

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.570 
than disk mode we use them all the time
right<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:18.380> non<00:03:18.500> motion<00:03:18.890> mode<00:03:19.040> for<00:03:19.220> as<00:03:19.310> good<00:03:19.340> as

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
right the non motion mode for as good as

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.640 
right the non motion mode for as good as
it<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:19.730> has<00:03:20.090> one<00:03:20.540> little<00:03:20.870> drawback<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.440> that's

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
it is has one little drawback and that's

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.890 
it is has one little drawback and that's
the<00:03:21.890> sensing<00:03:22.640> diameter<00:03:23.570> of<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.690> coil

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.559 

probably<00:03:28.010> nine<00:03:29.010> inches<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:30.240> actually

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
probably nine inches it it actually

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.980 
probably nine inches it it actually
started<00:03:30.840> sensing<00:03:31.350> this<00:03:31.530> this<00:03:32.340> nickel

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.160 

and<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:37.130> oil<00:03:38.000> wasn't<00:03:38.240> even<00:03:38.570> over<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.870> nickel

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
and the oil wasn't even over the nickel

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.130 
and the oil wasn't even over the nickel
yet<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:39.740> it's<00:03:40.490> got<00:03:40.610> a<00:03:40.640> pretty<00:03:40.730> broad<00:03:41.360> you<00:03:42.080> know

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
yet so it's got a pretty broad you know

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.230 
yet so it's got a pretty broad you know
sensing<00:03:42.740> field<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.490> damage<00:03:43.820> is<00:03:43.880> about<00:03:44.030> nine

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
sensing field the damage is about nine

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.970 
sensing field the damage is about nine
inches<00:03:44.450> make<00:03:45.080> it<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.200> little<00:03:45.320> difficult<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.830> a

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:17.670 

tone<00:04:08.360> is<00:04:08.510> gone<00:04:08.720> right<00:04:09.020> not<00:04:09.980> really

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.440 

it<00:04:18.680> just<00:04:18.980> shrunk<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.820> diameter<00:04:20.330> of<00:04:20.360> that

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
it just shrunk the diameter of that

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.300 
it just shrunk the diameter of that
sense<00:04:20.810> field<00:04:21.080> down<00:04:21.290> to<00:04:21.500> within<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.800> diameter

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
sense field down to within the diameter

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.580 
sense field down to within the diameter
of<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:23.510> opening<00:04:23.540> in<00:04:23.960> this<00:04:24.020> coil<00:04:24.440> which<00:04:24.560> is

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
of the opening in this coil which is

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.630 
of the opening in this coil which is
three<00:04:25.520> inches<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.630> right<00:04:26.930> now<00:04:27.170> all<00:04:27.470> metal<00:04:28.100> non

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
three inches so right now all metal non

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.440 
three inches so right now all metal non
motion<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.360> can<00:04:29.480> pinpoint<00:04:30.760> super<00:04:31.760> accurately

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
motion I can pinpoint super accurately

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.480 
motion I can pinpoint super accurately
and<00:04:32.720> that's<00:04:33.590> why<00:04:33.710> they<00:04:33.860> call<00:04:34.070> it<00:04:34.100> super

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
and that's why they call it super

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.740 
and that's why they call it super
pinpointing<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.090> guess<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.570> that's

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
pinpointing I guess and that's

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.490 
pinpointing I guess and that's
incredible<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:41.090> is<00:04:41.300> I'm<00:04:41.930> telling<00:04:42.230> you<00:04:42.320> that

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
incredible that is I'm telling you that

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.830 
incredible that is I'm telling you that
is<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.950> diameter<00:04:43.130> of<00:04:43.460> this<00:04:43.640> opening<00:04:44.060> and<00:04:44.270> then

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
is the diameter of this opening and then

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.230 
is the diameter of this opening and then
the<00:04:45.170> opening<00:04:45.470> is<00:04:45.560> about<00:04:45.770> three<00:04:46.070> inches<00:04:46.240> so

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
the opening is about three inches so

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.300 
the opening is about three inches so
again<00:04:48.170> you're<00:04:48.290> gonna<00:04:48.380> be<00:04:48.530> moving<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:49.040> coil

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
again you're gonna be moving this coil

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.830 
again you're gonna be moving this coil
once<00:04:49.610> you<00:04:49.730> do<00:04:49.850> that<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:50.090> can<00:04:50.180> be<00:04:50.270> sliding<00:04:50.780> this

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
once you do that it can be sliding this

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.140 
once you do that it can be sliding this
coil<00:04:51.110> over<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.560> ground<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:52.100> you're<00:04:52.820> gonna<00:04:52.910> be

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
coil over the ground and you're gonna be

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.410 
coil over the ground and you're gonna be
able<00:04:53.210> to<00:04:53.330> zero<00:04:53.720> in<00:04:53.900> on<00:04:54.170> that<00:04:54.200> target<00:04:54.620> no

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
able to zero in on that target no

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.820 
able to zero in on that target no
problem<00:04:56.420> no<00:04:57.290> problem

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830
