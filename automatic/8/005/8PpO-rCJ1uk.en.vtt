00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.929
 is not negligible things 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.340
 sometimes you can change yourself 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.199
 Scientists do not explain and what 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.199
 for heaven's sake there is going on 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:33.010
 71 years in this case that's one 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.040
 Rainy licked and her husband looks 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.200
 cozy TV suddenly something patters 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.930
 on the roof 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 it does not sound off but it's too 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.000
 dark and too wet to look 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:59.659
 the two go to bed next 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:05.210
 tomorrow on the ground in the garden on the 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:06.920
 windowsills and on the way and with 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.880
 The manager we could see that on 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.880
 the roof consuming 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.070
 I thought someone was kidding us 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.720
 wants to play 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.020
 That may be the landlord one 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.020
 sweetheart with 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.960
 but where should the 30 40 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:32.149
 a neighbor then tried the one 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.950
 cats might be infected 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.950
 could have or maybe one 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.729
 then came the time interview 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.399
 The fish landed here in London 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.399
 natural history museum 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.950
 I have been fishing by girl before 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.520
 which fall from the sky but I thought 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.789
 that it is with the tropical climate 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.890
 automatically communicated to me then 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:19.140
 that happened in london too 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.140
 But after more and more calls came 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.140
 the investigation showed that why 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.269
 flickered and quickly agreed that 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.480
 Do not leave the sea ​​cable but out 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:40.739
 London itself is interesting with that 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:43.330
 that just these two most common only 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.239
 direct two kilometers from the border 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.220
 so if you do not get away from them 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.670
 plane or dropped from film images 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.350
 were 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.269
 how did the fish get there explanation 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.300
 could be that a windhose the 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.950
 fish carried out of the water 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.360
 We know that cyclones are heavy 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.910
 can indicate objects 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.910
 why should not a fish like that? 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.150
 storms can occurs anywhere in 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.650
 Florida is 100 meters in the UK 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.989
 but only about 15 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.060
 but can a whole swarm of fish from 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.680
 a storm announced and some 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.530
 miles further down again 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.420
 become 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:33.540
 Ross trails from university reading 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.540
 is the king of the cyclones but that 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.989
 there are reports about the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.480
 different things from the sky 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:48.030
 have fallen 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.030
 money laundering or star wars figures
