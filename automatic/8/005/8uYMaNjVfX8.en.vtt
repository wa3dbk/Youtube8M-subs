turns on these mowers and we recorded

turns on these mowers and we recorded
our<00:02:21.000> impressions<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.720> podcast<00:02:21.959> the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
our impressions in the podcast the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.339 
our impressions in the podcast the
controls<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.090> ZTR<00:02:24.569> mower<00:02:24.810> take<00:02:25.140> some

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
controls on the ZTR mower take some

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.229 
controls on the ZTR mower take some
getting<00:02:25.620> used<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.920> but<00:02:26.220> once<00:02:26.549> learned<00:02:26.849> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
getting used to but once learned the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.360 
getting used to but once learned the
mower<00:02:27.420> really<00:02:27.810> does<00:02:27.989> pivot<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.530> dime<00:02:28.829> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
mower really does pivot on a dime the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.860 
mower really does pivot on a dime the
tractor<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.880> little<00:02:30.150> more<00:02:30.239> lumbering<00:02:30.660> in

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
tractor is a little more lumbering in

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.780 
tractor is a little more lumbering in
its<00:02:30.989> control<00:02:31.319> but<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.799> four<00:02:32.130> turning<00:02:32.579> wheels

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
its control but with four turning wheels

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.059 
its control but with four turning wheels
it<00:02:33.090> epiphysis<00:02:33.569> amazingly<00:02:34.140> well<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:34.769> a

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
it epiphysis amazingly well for a

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.339 
it epiphysis amazingly well for a
tractor<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.150> for<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.420> small<00:02:36.690> areas<00:02:37.170> we

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
tractor so for the small areas we

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.500 
tractor so for the small areas we
discovered<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.010> CTRs<00:02:38.640> configuration

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
discovered that the CTRs configuration

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.140 
discovered that the CTRs configuration
really<00:02:40.260> allows<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.799> navigate<00:02:41.010> well<00:02:41.579> you

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
really allows you to navigate well you

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.030 
really allows you to navigate well you
can<00:02:42.329> pivot<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.290> see<00:02:43.680> what<00:02:43.889> you're

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
can pivot and you can see what you're

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.949 
can pivot and you can see what you're
cutting<00:02:44.250> much<00:02:44.850> easier<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.450> don't<00:02:45.480> have<00:02:45.810> an

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
cutting much easier you don't have an

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.080 
cutting much easier you don't have an
engine<00:02:46.139> out<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.980> front<00:02:47.250> obstructing<00:02:47.970> your

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
engine out in front obstructing your

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.539 
engine out in front obstructing your

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
view both mowers cut well but the ZTR

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.250 
view both mowers cut well but the ZTR
was<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> faster<00:02:51.299> mower<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.780> maneuvered<00:02:52.200> a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
was a faster mower and maneuvered a

both<00:02:53.220> mowers<00:02:53.670> left<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.060> nice<00:02:54.299> even<00:02:54.840> cut

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
both mowers left a nice even cut
