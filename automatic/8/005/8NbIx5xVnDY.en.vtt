00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.470
 Gerhard Weber is a photographer 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.750
 He does his work with great passion and be it for 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.750
 Shopping trips 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.970
 his specialty, however, are photos that go beyond all glossy looks 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.580
 his pictures from everyday life in the east of Germany 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.239
 are appreciated and appreciated today 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.559
 his portraits have a beauty of their own 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.260
 Marco Haller is a painter 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.390
 his innate disability has denied some chance the other 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.710
 maybe have 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.710
 Nevertheless, he has developed his own style 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.070
 In addition to his work in a workshop, luminous pictures are created 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.379
 abstract or very concrete but always very colorful 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.379
 because for Marko, there's something that's optional 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.800
 AFP 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.040
 come on their ride 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.970
 miller 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.970
 Schalke creates 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.920
 For the project the art of Caritas have become the two artists 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.050
 together 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.130
 they want to create a common artwork 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.000
 Photos and painting 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.660
 should merge 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.030
 he plays with the motif 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.380
 anyway, it is always something to play against them 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.250
 while on the table 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.610
 Run tears 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.610
 Directed little sadness 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.800
 it is the same with us 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.890
 about it 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.510
 Dennis Kaupp closed 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.510
 very serious 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.309
 on the HAZ site 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:12.299
 to properly introduce the legal 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.299
 still on site 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:24.829
 till 9 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.829
 better world 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:45.139
 photographically 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.949
 are more important for systemically it comes naturally the exciting 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:49.749
 Time 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.749
 which despite the expected strongest 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:58.719
 Now it's Marko's turn 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.269
 with strong colors he gives the pictures of himself 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.269
 once again its all for little son painting 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:22.929
 the goal of the whole action is high 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.519
 one of the most renowned gallerists for modern art wants their pictures 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.489
 exhibit 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.789
 in the gallery Schuster in Berlin 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:35.139
 Rainer Neske Helmuth Schuster I am the Rector of the gallery 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.349
 Schuster here in Berlin and also in my life Florida 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.919
 So the measure for us is about normalcy so the visitors are here 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.909
 the exhibition can be seen 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.659
 will see a normal exhibition of normal opening hours and we 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.729
 Become a niece of disability speak of husband and wife position 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.040
 have to be measured 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.929
 in the international art context 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:02.879
 the brand and the art even today ten more artist couples throughout 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.349
 Germany in the context of the action the art 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.549
 not only paintings are created 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.480
 Gallery owner Schuster visits some of them 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.919
 to prepare his exhibition 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.489
 when I noticed this 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.569
 the whole trip is that of course he is her 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.699
 partly art therefore does not arise cases 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.449
 Artists working in workshops no studios have no freedom 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.289
 We have to work at once 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.279
 So I would prefer the word disability conventional and am 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.020
 that 's why i just do not have any idea about that at the beginning 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.150
 Exclude works of art and Elba 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.500
 Furthermore, do not tell the market about the exhibition and take it 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.500
 could be unusual because she 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.669
 According to WÃ¤lti in the customer different life pursuits meetings of the 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.960
 Living conditions brought together 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.960
 only a few weeks until the exhibition 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.550
 and the artists and close their work have 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.349
 and then 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.349
 is the big day on it 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.800
 the eleven artists were supposed to travel 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.690
 Opening 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.910
 and face the critical views of the exhibition visitors 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:27.409
 Werdohl 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.409
 the girls will be 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.259
 more serious 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:37.169
 with Dr Dr 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.279
 Bockenheim 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:40.919
 not a few feel 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:43.919
 we enter the lines 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.580
 how many of the 1 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.749
 The robber had moved in a different light 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.639
 it is 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.689
 How can an ice age be reported by other visitors? 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.560
 This is what we have seen here yesterday and today 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.240
 only enthusiasm becomes 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.419
 what more do you want 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.150
 So it is not endangered 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.369
 the first idea with the singers busy Saturday 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:32.240
 so that Danz special 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.509
 that he really does 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.249
 People with disabilities as 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:39.080
 Year artists like everyone else 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.029
 he is considered that 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:43.509
 it will not be like that 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.849
 it was always very much the disability 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:50.919
 as something especially in the foreground and that is something quite here 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.919
 new 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:05.449
 So I think it's something like his handicapped artists they have to 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:06.599
 be promoted differently 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.569
 because I think disabled artists can just as artists of his class but 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:13.749
 Also, exactly the same artist will receive Bienemann Manson 

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:17.839
 I think it is very important it is always art simply because of 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:20.279
 To further integrate life worlds 

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:23.889
 and there is sure to have taken this step that is as the commonplace 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:26.300
 his artist is amplified 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.220
 He can be that in the years in which he always art too 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.220
 do 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:41.009
 the baptism of fire is just so passed 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.270
 as the exhibit exhibit to Brussels and Freiburg 

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:48.449
 It is already clear to the artists 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:50.879
 They really want to continue 

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.559
 the project like art was just a fight on
