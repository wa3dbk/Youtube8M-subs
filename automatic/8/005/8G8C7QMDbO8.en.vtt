know something more complex like an

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.400 
know something more complex like an
actual<00:00:15.710> bunny<00:00:15.950> hop<00:00:16.189> which<00:00:16.910> is<00:00:17.090> where<00:00:17.449> you<00:00:18.230> pick

up you know the entire bike so the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.300 
up you know the entire bike so the
easiest<00:00:22.160> way<00:00:22.520> to<00:00:22.580> figure<00:00:22.789> out<00:00:22.970> how<00:00:23.119> to<00:00:23.180> execute

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
just going to focus on doing it you know

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.570 
just going to focus on doing it you know
in<00:01:03.199> place<00:01:03.409> just<00:01:03.440> pretend<00:01:03.979> I'm<00:01:04.100> rolling<00:01:04.369> at<00:01:04.460> low

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
in place just pretend I'm rolling at low

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.810 
in place just pretend I'm rolling at low
speed<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.180> I<00:01:06.010> just<00:01:07.010> pull<00:01:07.190> up<00:01:07.220> my<00:01:07.460> front<00:01:07.700> wheel

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
speed and I just pull up my front wheel

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.370 
speed and I just pull up my front wheel

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.990 
know the basic concept of how you can
get<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.409> you're<00:01:54.890> really<00:01:55.130> up<00:01:55.250> just<00:01:55.520> just<00:01:55.610> with

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
get a you're really up just just with

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.540 
get a you're really up just just with
gearing<00:01:57.820> so<00:01:58.820> if<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.510> apply<00:02:00.130> both<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.370> weight

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
gearing so if you apply both the weight

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.330 
gearing so if you apply both the weight
shift<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.990> pedal<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.740> wheelie<00:02:04.100> it's

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
shift and the pedal to the wheelie it's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.259 
shift and the pedal to the wheelie it's
you<00:02:05.210> know<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.540> pretty<00:02:05.840> minimal<00:02:06.350> minimally

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:07.269 
you know a pretty minimal minimally

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:10.089 
you know a pretty minimal minimally
taxing<00:02:08.269> way<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:09.229> get<00:02:09.379> your<00:02:09.500> front<00:02:09.739> end<00:02:09.860> off<00:02:09.979> the

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
taxing way to get your front end off the

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.970 
taxing way to get your front end off the
ground<00:02:10.310> which<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.930> central<00:02:12.290> component<00:02:12.469> into

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
ground which is a central component into

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.280 
ground which is a central component into
most<00:02:13.189> advanced<00:02:13.760> technical<00:02:14.180> maneuvers

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
most advanced technical maneuvers

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.850 
most advanced technical maneuvers
so<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.630> allows<00:02:21.840> me<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.200> mess<00:02:22.470> around<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
so so it allows me to mess around a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.950 
so so it allows me to mess around a
little<00:02:23.010> bit<00:02:24.830> go<00:02:25.830> down<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.130> hill<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.520> just

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
little bit go down the hill and just

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.230 
little bit go down the hill and just
have<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.020> good<00:02:28.170> time
