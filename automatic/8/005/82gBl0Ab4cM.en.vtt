roof of the cab here or am i right there
or<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.250> deck<00:00:30.430> I<00:00:30.580> should<00:00:30.789> say<00:00:30.970> roof<00:00:31.390> for<00:00:31.570> the<00:00:31.660> UH

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
or the deck I should say roof for the UH

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.130 
or the deck I should say roof for the UH
yeah<00:00:32.770> need<00:00:33.579> a<00:00:33.610> coffee<00:00:34.030> my<00:00:34.300> words<00:00:34.510> are<00:00:34.719> failing

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
yeah need a coffee my words are failing

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.350 
yeah need a coffee my words are failing
me<00:00:35.350> anyway<00:00:36.070> he's<00:00:36.220> got<00:00:36.340> a<00:00:36.400> couple<00:00:36.640> solar<00:00:36.940> panels

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
me anyway he's got a couple solar panels

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.830 
me anyway he's got a couple solar panels
for<00:00:37.660> panels<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.350> wind<00:00:39.100> turbine<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:40.480> if<00:00:40.690> you

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
for panels and wind turbine and if you

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.920 
for panels and wind turbine and if you
look<00:00:41.020> around<00:00:41.320> through<00:00:41.500> here<00:00:41.590> there's<00:00:42.160> one

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
look around through here there's one

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.670 
look around through here there's one
spinning<00:00:43.930> in<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.200> breeze<00:00:45.570> there<00:00:46.570> are<00:00:46.840> a<00:00:46.870> lot

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
spinning in the breeze there are a lot

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.440 
spinning in the breeze there are a lot
of<00:00:47.710> wind<00:00:48.130> turbines<00:00:48.520> and<00:00:48.640> solar<00:00:48.700> panels<00:00:48.970> out

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
of wind turbines and solar panels out

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.170 
of wind turbines and solar panels out
here<00:00:49.690> on<00:00:49.809> these<00:00:49.960> boats<00:00:50.200> and<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:54.640> find<00:00:54.910> it<00:00:55.030> quite

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
here on these boats and I find it quite

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.139 
here on these boats and I find it quite
interesting<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:56.460> nearly<00:00:57.460> every<00:00:57.880> boat<00:00:58.120> has

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
interesting that nearly every boat has

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.639 
interesting that nearly every boat has
solar<00:00:59.079> panels<00:00:59.590> and<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:01.300> wind<00:01:01.780> turbines

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.590 

there's<00:01:05.649> one<00:01:06.520> on<00:01:06.670> top<00:01:06.880> of<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.119> boat<00:01:07.329> you<00:01:07.479> can

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
there's one on top of that boat you can

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.449 
there's one on top of that boat you can
barely<00:01:07.810> see<00:01:08.200> it<00:01:08.350> but<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.799> think<00:01:11.920> a<00:01:12.130> lot<00:01:12.280> of<00:01:12.369> them

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:12.459 
barely see it but I think a lot of them

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.190 
barely see it but I think a lot of them
have<00:01:12.639> their<00:01:13.030> panels<00:01:13.479> put<00:01:13.659> in<00:01:13.810> today<00:01:14.020> because

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
have their panels put in today because

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.249 
have their panels put in today because
the<00:01:14.319> other<00:01:14.439> day<00:01:14.729> there<00:01:15.729> were<00:01:15.909> a<00:01:16.179> almost<00:01:16.899> every

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
the other day there were a almost every

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.120 
the other day there were a almost every
single<00:01:17.469> boat<00:01:17.740> had<00:01:17.979> a<00:01:18.009> solar<00:01:18.310> panel<00:01:18.549> outside

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
single boat had a solar panel outside

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:29.919 
single boat had a solar panel outside
and<00:01:21.130> now<00:01:21.219> I'm<00:01:21.310> not<00:01:21.429> seeing<00:01:21.670> as<00:01:21.880> many

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.760 

but<00:01:30.929> over<00:01:31.200> here

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
but over here

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:43.060 
but over here
I<00:01:33.109> saw<00:01:34.109> a<00:01:34.140> mess<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.710> wind<00:01:34.920> turbines<00:01:35.399> as<00:01:35.640> well

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.840 

not<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.760> mention<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.180> boats<00:01:44.390> just<00:01:44.600> look<00:01:44.840> nice

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
not to mention the boats just look nice

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.890 
not to mention the boats just look nice
now<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:46.910> said<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.420> there<00:01:47.660> was<00:01:47.810> an

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
now you said that there was an

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.800 
now you said that there was an
icebreaker<00:01:48.260> right<00:01:48.650> that<00:01:49.010> boat

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
icebreaker right that boat

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.660 
icebreaker right that boat
yes<00:01:50.810> that<00:01:51.470> was<00:01:51.620> an<00:01:51.740> icebreaker<00:01:52.070> for<00:01:52.310> what

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
yes that was an icebreaker for what

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.380 
yes that was an icebreaker for what
Alaska<00:01:54.610> and<00:01:55.610> it's<00:01:55.850> super<00:01:56.180> thick<00:01:56.390> hull<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:59.210> it

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
Alaska and it's super thick hull and it

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:09.940 
Alaska and it's super thick hull and it
what<00:01:59.570> was<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.780> deal<00:01:59.930> with<00:01:59.960> that<00:02:00.110> again<00:02:08.950> sigh

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
what was the deal with that again sigh

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.890 
what was the deal with that again sigh
Oh<00:02:09.979> bite<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.520> was<00:02:10.670> being<00:02:10.850> distress<00:02:11.420> and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
Oh bite that was being distress and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.570 
Oh bite that was being distress and
there<00:02:12.020> was<00:02:12.140> at<00:02:12.290> once<00:02:12.470> one-time<00:02:13.010> use<00:02:13.190> you<00:02:13.460> know

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
there was at once one-time use you know

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:23.230 
there was at once one-time use you know
what<00:02:13.730> sold<00:02:14.590> pretty<00:02:15.590> crazy<00:02:21.820> well<00:02:22.820> there's<00:02:23.000> some

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
what sold pretty crazy well there's some

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.620 
what sold pretty crazy well there's some
more<00:02:23.590> wind<00:02:24.590> turbines<00:02:25.010> here<00:02:25.220> other<00:02:26.180> ones<00:02:26.420> just

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
more wind turbines here other ones just

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.880 
more wind turbines here other ones just
started<00:02:26.870> spinning<00:02:27.050> conveniently<00:02:27.650> as<00:02:27.770> I'm

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
started spinning conveniently as I'm

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.760 
started spinning conveniently as I'm
resuming<00:02:28.310> on<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:30.200> these<00:02:30.320> two<00:02:30.530> boats

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
resuming on it and these two boats

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.560 
resuming on it and these two boats
actually<00:02:31.130> they<00:02:31.520> spoke<00:02:31.790> right<00:02:32.000> up<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.270> front<00:02:32.300> of

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
actually they spoke right up in front of

me has a solar panel on a back deck and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.180 
me has a solar panel on a back deck and
right<00:02:38.840> by<00:02:38.989> that<00:02:39.170> one<00:02:39.350> with<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.560> wind<00:02:39.800> turbine

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
right by that one with a wind turbine

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.470 
right by that one with a wind turbine
there's<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.489> solar<00:02:40.730> panel<00:02:40.940> right<00:02:41.239> there

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
there's a solar panel right there

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.500 
there's a solar panel right there
underneath<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.080> wind<00:02:42.260> turbine<00:02:43.330> no<00:02:44.330> we're

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
underneath the wind turbine no we're

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.510 
underneath the wind turbine no we're
here<00:02:44.720> we've<00:02:44.900> got<00:02:45.110> some<00:02:45.410> more<00:02:45.530> solar<00:02:45.830> panels<00:02:46.070> or

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
here we've got some more solar panels or

here we've got some more solar panels or
wind<00:02:46.610> turbines<00:02:47.060> there's<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.510> spinner<00:02:48.320> happily

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
wind turbines there's a spinner happily

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.199 
wind turbines there's a spinner happily
in<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.950> breeze<00:02:51.640> there's<00:02:52.640> another<00:02:52.820> one<00:02:53.000> over

in the breeze there's another one over
here

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
here

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.470 
here
spin<00:02:54.890> enough<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:57.830> these<00:02:58.700> boats<00:02:58.970> up<00:02:59.180> here

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
spin enough so these boats up here

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
spin enough so these boats up here
there's<00:03:00.080> another<00:03:00.290> one<00:03:00.500> over<00:03:02.260> there's<00:03:03.260> another

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
there's another one over there's another

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.670 
there's another one over there's another
wind<00:03:03.769> turbine<00:03:04.660> all<00:03:05.660> these<00:03:05.810> boats<00:03:06.080> have<00:03:06.380> some

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
wind turbine all these boats have some

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.180 
wind turbine all these boats have some

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
sort of free energy either solar or wind

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.270 
sort of free energy either solar or wind
energy<00:03:10.430> on<00:03:10.880> these<00:03:11.060> boats<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:12.769> majority<00:03:13.250> of

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
energy on these boats the majority of

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.890 
energy on these boats the majority of
them<00:03:13.430> I'd<00:03:13.549> say<00:03:13.580> first<00:03:14.239> they're<00:03:14.510> pretty<00:03:14.690> rich

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
them I'd say first they're pretty rich

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.000 
them I'd say first they're pretty rich
boats<00:03:15.170> too<00:03:15.500> by<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.280> way<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:17.620> just<00:03:18.620> figured<00:03:18.890> I'd

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
boats too by the way I just figured I'd

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.949 
boats too by the way I just figured I'd
share<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.430> with<00:03:19.580> you<00:03:19.760> all<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.570> alternate

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
share that with you all the alternate

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.269 
share that with you all the alternate
energy<00:03:21.320> is<00:03:21.380> being<00:03:21.560> used<00:03:21.650> here<00:03:22.160> in<00:03:22.580> Australia
