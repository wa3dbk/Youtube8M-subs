now<00:00:29.099> before<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.609> anything<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:30.420> need<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
now before we do anything we need to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.450 
now before we do anything we need to
sort<00:00:30.810> our<00:00:30.900> class<00:00:31.260> that's<00:00:31.470> best<00:00:31.740> getting<00:00:32.279> kill

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
sort our class that's best getting kill

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.860 
sort our class that's best getting kill
streaks<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.510> need<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> choose<00:00:33.809> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
streaks and for this we need to choose a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.750 
streaks and for this we need to choose a
submachine<00:00:34.380> gun<00:00:34.559> or<00:00:34.710> an<00:00:34.800> assault<00:00:35.100> rifle<00:00:35.130> now

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
submachine gun or an assault rifle now

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.220 
submachine gun or an assault rifle now
the<00:00:35.820> reason<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.660> snipers

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the reason for this is because snipers

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.020 
the reason for this is because snipers
shotguns<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.829> light<00:00:37.950> machineguns<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.790> some

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
shotguns and light machineguns have some

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.190 
shotguns and light machineguns have some
really<00:00:39.360> strong<00:00:39.570> drawbacks

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
really strong drawbacks

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.540 
really strong drawbacks
whereas<00:00:40.620> assault<00:00:40.860> rifles<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.280> submachine

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
whereas assault rifles and submachine

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.850 
whereas assault rifles and submachine
guns<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:42.090> kind<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.570> all-purpose<00:00:42.989> guns<00:00:43.410> so

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
guns are kind of all-purpose guns so

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.110 
guns are kind of all-purpose guns so
choosing<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> these<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.940> make

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
choosing one of these is going to make

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.310 
choosing one of these is going to make
sure<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> best<00:00:45.809> chance<00:00:46.170> of

I<00:00:56.550> recommend<00:00:56.940> toughness<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.510> dexterity

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
I recommend toughness and dexterity

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479

I'm<00:02:06.420> using<00:02:06.630> these<00:02:06.840> streaks<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.740> managed<00:02:08.009> to

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
I'm using these streaks and I managed to

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.559 
I'm using these streaks and I managed to
go<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> nuclear<00:02:08.550> kill<00:02:08.940> streak<00:02:09.149> which<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.390> 30

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
go on a nuclear kill streak which is 30

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.210 
go on a nuclear kill streak which is 30
kills<00:02:09.810> with<00:02:09.929> my<00:02:10.050> gun<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.770> keep<00:02:10.920> an<00:02:11.009> eye<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.099> for

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
kills with my gun so keep an eye out for

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.290 
kills with my gun so keep an eye out for
that<00:02:11.489> but<00:02:11.970> all

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
that but all

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.880 
that but all
so<00:02:12.360> notice<00:02:12.720> how<00:02:12.840> fast<00:02:13.110> my<00:02:13.350> streaks<00:02:13.650> loop

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
so notice how fast my streaks loop

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.770 
so notice how fast my streaks loop
around<00:02:14.040> again<00:02:14.280> now<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.060> reason<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.570> setup

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
around again now the reason this setup

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.630 
around again now the reason this setup
works<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.200> well<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.590> because<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.980> AGR<00:02:17.400> is

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
works so well is because the AGR is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.490 
works so well is because the AGR is
ground<00:02:17.970> support<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.840> stealth<00:02:19.140> chopper<00:02:19.320> is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
ground support the stealth chopper is

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.950 
ground support the stealth chopper is

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
air support and the VSAT is recon

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.600 
air support and the VSAT is recon
support<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:22.830> if<00:02:22.950> we<00:02:23.040> look<00:02:23.160> at<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.340> from<00:02:23.550> an

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
support now if we look at this from an

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.730 
support now if we look at this from an
enemy's<00:02:24.000> point<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.360> view<00:02:24.540> when<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.080> AGR<00:02:25.560> is

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
enemy's point of view when the AGR is

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.530 
enemy's point of view when the AGR is
out<00:02:25.890> they<00:02:26.340> want<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:26.790> away<00:02:27.030> from<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.270> so

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
out they want to be away from that so

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.000 
out they want to be away from that so
they're<00:02:27.660> already<00:02:27.810> moving<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.800> then<00:02:28.890> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
they're already moving but then the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.350 
they're already moving but then the
stealth<00:02:29.250> chopper<00:02:29.460> comes<00:02:29.790> out<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.150> they<00:02:30.240> need

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
stealth chopper comes out and they need

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.270 
stealth chopper comes out and they need
to<00:02:30.450> be<00:02:30.570> inside<00:02:30.990> but<00:02:31.320> once<00:02:31.500> they're<00:02:31.680> inside<00:02:32.070> the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
to be inside but once they're inside the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.190 
to be inside but once they're inside the
AGR<00:02:33.000> will<00:02:33.210> come<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.510> get<00:02:33.600> them<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:33.870> they<00:02:33.990> kind

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
AGR will come and get them so they kind

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.840 
AGR will come and get them so they kind
of<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.500> deal<00:02:34.650> with<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.890> as<00:02:35.040> well<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:35.700> on

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
of have to deal with that as well but on

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.610 
of have to deal with that as well but on
top<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.780> vase<00:02:37.080> set<00:02:37.290> will<00:02:37.440> let<00:02:37.530> you

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
top of that the vase set will let you

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.990 
top of that the vase set will let you
know<00:02:37.650> exactly<00:02:38.040> where<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.430> are<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.790> can

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
know exactly where they are so you can

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.640 
know exactly where they are so you can
find<00:02:39.270> them<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.600> take<00:02:39.780> them<00:02:39.960> out<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.290> once

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
find them and take them out and once

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.990 
find them and take them out and once
you've<00:02:40.770> killed<00:02:41.010> them<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.460> chances<00:02:41.790> are<00:02:41.940> that

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
you've killed them the chances are that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.030 
you've killed them the chances are that
they'll<00:02:42.390> spawn<00:02:42.660> outside<00:02:43.290> which<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:43.800> where

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
they'll spawn outside which is where

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.650 
they'll spawn outside which is where
your<00:02:44.130> stealth<00:02:44.370> chopper<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:45.150> then<00:02:45.270> get<00:02:45.510> them

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
your stealth chopper can then get them

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.720 
your stealth chopper can then get them
and<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.110> cycle<00:02:46.440> continues<00:02:46.980> now<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.550> setup

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and the cycle continues now this setup

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.250 
and the cycle continues now this setup
works<00:02:47.880> brilliantly<00:02:48.240> for<00:02:48.600> everything<00:02:49.140> it

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
works brilliantly for everything it

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.870 
works brilliantly for everything it
ranks<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.680> what<00:02:49.800> really<00:02:49.980> fast<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.730> gets

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
ranks you what really fast and it gets

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.670 
ranks you what really fast and it gets
you<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.030> lot<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.210> kills<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:51.960> importantly<00:02:52.500> by

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
you a lot of kills but importantly by

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.290 
you a lot of kills but importantly by
having<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.040> visa<00:02:53.250> as<00:02:53.520> your<00:02:53.700> final<00:02:53.940> streak

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
having the visa as your final streak

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.940 
having the visa as your final streak
you're<00:02:54.780> able<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.110> get<00:02:55.260> your<00:02:55.320> streaks<00:02:55.650> again

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
you're able to get your streaks again

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.590 
you're able to get your streaks again
really<00:02:56.340> fast<00:02:56.460> because<00:02:57.000> you'll<00:02:57.150> know<00:02:57.330> where<00:02:57.570> to

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
really fast because you'll know where to

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.750 
really fast because you'll know where to
get<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.900> kills<00:02:58.110> where<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.950> avoid<00:02:59.280> going<00:02:59.460> and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
get the kills where to avoid going and

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.850 
get the kills where to avoid going and
how<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.240> get<00:03:00.450> these<00:03:00.630> streaks<00:03:00.870> again<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.740> they

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
how to get these streaks again so they

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.830 
how to get these streaks again so they
loop<00:03:02.070> around<00:03:02.190> again<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.790> again<00:03:03.060> all<00:03:03.210> whilst

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
loop around again and again all whilst

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.360 
loop around again and again all whilst
the<00:03:03.990> enemies<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.470> deal<00:03:04.590> with<00:03:04.740> an<00:03:04.830> AGR<00:03:05.220> on

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
the enemies have to deal with an AGR on

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.890 
the enemies have to deal with an AGR on
the<00:03:05.460> ground<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.240> stealth<00:03:06.510> chopper<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.870> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
the ground and a stealth chopper in the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.690 
the ground and a stealth chopper in the
air<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.920> fact<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.220> you've<00:03:08.430> got<00:03:08.460> an

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
air and the fact that you've got an

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.850 
air and the fact that you've got an
orbital<00:03:09.060> vase<00:03:09.240> art<00:03:09.510> now<00:03:10.140> another<00:03:10.410> really<00:03:10.620> good

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
orbital vase art now another really good

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.080 
orbital vase art now another really good
thing<00:03:11.010> about<00:03:11.040> these<00:03:11.310> streaks<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.000> they

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
thing about these streaks is that they

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.850 
thing about these streaks is that they
are<00:03:12.180> all<00:03:12.420> consecutive<00:03:13.200> which<00:03:13.350> means<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.770> if

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
are all consecutive which means that if

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.800 
are all consecutive which means that if
you<00:03:13.950> can<00:03:13.980> get<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.310> AGR<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:15.120> only<00:03:15.330> need<00:03:15.570> two

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
you can get the AGR you only need two

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.000 
you can get the AGR you only need two
hundred<00:03:16.170> points<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.590> have<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.800> stealth

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
hundred points to have the stealth

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.390 
hundred points to have the stealth
chopper

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
chopper

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.160 
chopper
under<00:03:17.730> they<00:03:17.880> start<00:03:18.180> before<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.840> can<00:03:18.989> begin

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
under they start before you can begin

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.140 
under they start before you can begin
building<00:03:19.500> your<00:03:19.650> streaks<00:03:20.040> back<00:03:20.220> up<00:03:20.340> again<00:03:20.610> this

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
building your streaks back up again this

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.880 
building your streaks back up again this
makes<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:21.600> setup<00:03:21.810> incredibly<00:03:22.500> lethal<00:03:22.650> and

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
makes this setup incredibly lethal and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.500 
makes this setup incredibly lethal and
insane<00:03:23.280> for<00:03:23.489> those<00:03:23.610> games<00:03:23.820> where<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.239> think

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
insane for those games where you think

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.840 
insane for those games where you think
the<00:03:24.600> swarm<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.050> out<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.709> reach<00:03:25.920> now<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.459> highly

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
the swarm is out of reach now I highly

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.340 
the swarm is out of reach now I highly
recommend<00:03:27.209> giving<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.600> go<00:03:27.750> for<00:03:27.959> both<00:03:28.080> new

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
recommend giving it a go for both new

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.530 
recommend giving it a go for both new
and<00:03:28.380> more<00:03:28.950> experienced<00:03:29.459> players<00:03:29.700> because<00:03:30.360> it

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
and more experienced players because it

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.910 
and more experienced players because it
will<00:03:30.810> help<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.170> out<00:03:31.230> with<00:03:31.320> running<00:03:31.680> up<00:03:31.770> as
