00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
flour before in the past well I learned

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.280 
flour before in the past well I learned
it<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.610> few<00:01:11.760> years<00:01:11.790> ago<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:12.630> yeah<00:01:12.930> before<00:01:13.260> I

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
it a few years ago but yeah before I

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.539 
it a few years ago but yeah before I
didn't<00:01:13.619> even<00:01:13.740> know<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> which<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.430> course

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
didn't even know that which is of course

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700 
didn't even know that which is of course
anyhow<00:01:14.970> one<00:01:15.450> minute<00:01:15.720> back<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.439> flame

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
anyhow one minute back on that flame

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.960 
anyhow one minute back on that flame
just<00:01:16.890> obscure<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.340> through<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.729> cook<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
just obscure it through and cook it

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.399 
just obscure it through and cook it
through<00:01:18.090> again<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> want<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.229> sit

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
through again and then you want to sit

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.859 
through again and then you want to sit
it<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.920> bowl<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.790> rest<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.479> after<00:01:21.780> that

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it in a bowl just to rest so after that

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
it in a bowl just to rest so after that
dough<00:01:22.110> has<00:01:22.350> cooked<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:22.830> least<00:01:23.009> five

dough has cooked for at least five

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.950 
dough has cooked for at least five
minutes<00:01:23.580> we're<00:01:23.850> gonna<00:01:23.909> gradually<00:01:24.270> add<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.570> our

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
