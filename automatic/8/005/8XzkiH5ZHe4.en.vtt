00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.410
 the correct measurements of the fall of a vehicle will improve the isolation of the 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.179
 Car on the road and steering stability 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.929
 the incorrect angles of the fall can cause tire wear 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.669
 and problems in driving 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:21.710
 the fall is defined as the inward tilt out of the part 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.989
 top of the wheel when taking as a reference a vertical and proven 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.149
 frontally 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.099
 the fall are measured degrees 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.570
 a wheel that has a fall of 0 degrees is vertical 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.570
 a wheel that tilts out towards a positive fall 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450
 a wheel that tilts inwards towards a negative fall 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.210
 The main functions of advances are to improve the stability of the address 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.150
 and the ability to retract the incorrect advance angles can cause a 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.010
 excessive effort to address 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.890
 and the wear of the cover the advance is defined as the inclination toward 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.409
 front or back 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.010
 from the top of the steering shaft 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.370
 when referring to a vertical and observe it laterally 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.450
 the progress are measured degrees 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.280
 the feed is positive when the upper part of the steering shaft is 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.880
 lean back 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.650
 the advance is negative when the upper part of the steering shaft is 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.650
 leans forward 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.130
 the most critical alignment angle is the total convergence on the axis of 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.140
 address 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.830
 an excessively positive or negative convergence may cause drag 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.350
 shoulder wear of the rims 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.970
 total convergence is defined as the difference in distance measured between the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.580
 front of the wheels and the distance measured between the rear 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.830
 of the gardens 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.830
 this convergence is measured inches or millimeters 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.470
 the total convergence can also be defined as a meditated graduated mule 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.470
 in charged degrees and minutes 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.850
 there is positive convergence also known as convergence 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.940
 when the wheels are slightly closer in their front 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.139
 that in the later 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.969
 the convergence is negative also known as agency tide 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.529
 when the tests are slightly more approximate on the back 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.849
 than in the previous 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.609
 the convergence at zero occurs when you played when things are parallel 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:56.239
 the inclination of the steering axis and the measures of the included angles 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.239
 they are often used as analysis tools 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:05.169
 the inclination of the steering axis is defined as the angle formed by a 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:09.139
 line drawn from the top pivot points to the bottom points 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.869
 a vertical line from the central base of the wheel retained 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.199
 frontally 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.199
 the tilt of the steering shaft are measured degrees 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.969
 the fall is defined as the inward tilt out of the part 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.349
 top of the wheel when taking a vertical reference and observing it 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.689
 frontally 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.689
 the positive fall is specified on the front wheels 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:42.719
 the included angle is the combination of the axis inclination 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.719
 of direction and the fall 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.079
 if you notice large differences from one side to the other that the inclination of the shaft 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.149
 of direction or in the included angle this may indicate that the 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:57.439
 Suspension components are damaged
