00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
winter damn 2012 Vox guitars and

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.220 
winter damn 2012 Vox guitars and
amplifiers<00:00:35.500> yeah<00:00:36.500> what<00:00:36.650> we<00:00:36.739> have<00:00:36.890> here<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:37.489> a

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
amplifiers yeah what we have here is a

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.110 
amplifiers yeah what we have here is a
AC<00:00:39.230> for<00:00:39.739> it's<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.040> hand<00:00:40.309> wired<00:00:40.570> amplifier<00:00:42.010> and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
AC for it's a hand wired amplifier and

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.689 
AC for it's a hand wired amplifier and
continuing<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.239> line<00:00:44.449> down<00:00:44.809> here<00:00:45.520> from<00:00:46.520> the

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
continuing the line down here from the

essentially<00:00:51.019> it's<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.440> top<00:00:51.650> boost<00:00:52.059> portion

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
essentially it's the top boost portion

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.790 
essentially it's the top boost portion
of<00:00:53.360> an<00:00:53.750> AC<00:00:53.900> 15<00:00:54.830> or<00:00:55.010> an<00:00:55.100> AC<00:00:55.220> 30<00:00:56.050> and<00:00:57.050> still

venue<00:01:11.830> for<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.890> gig<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.630> I'll<00:01:14.630> play<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.170> couple<00:01:15.409> of

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
venue for a gig so I'll play a couple of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.719 
venue for a gig so I'll play a couple of
things<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:15.979> I'll<00:01:16.040> show<00:01:16.220> all<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.430> features

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
things and I'll show all the features

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.569 
things and I'll show all the features
that<00:01:16.760> he's<00:01:16.940> talked<00:01:17.180> about<00:01:18.250> also<00:01:19.250> just<00:01:19.490> from

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
that he's talked about also just from

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.330 
that he's talked about also just from
left<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:19.909> right<00:01:20.119> on<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.360> panel<00:01:20.719> here<00:01:21.130> high<00:01:22.130> and

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
left to right on the panel here high and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.630 
left to right on the panel here high and
low<00:01:22.430> input<00:01:22.850> gain<00:01:23.450> treble<00:01:24.079> bass<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.280> hot<00:01:25.460> and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
low input gain treble bass the hot and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.179 
low input gain treble bass the hot and
cool<00:01:25.759> switch<00:01:26.090> which<00:01:26.390> is<00:01:26.439> foot<00:01:27.439> switchable<00:01:27.920> and

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
cool switch which is foot switchable and

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.459 
cool switch which is foot switchable and
then<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.360> master<00:01:29.750> volume<00:01:30.219> so<00:01:31.219> right<00:01:31.490> now<00:01:31.670> I'm

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
then a master volume so right now I'm

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.959 
then a master volume so right now I'm
pretty<00:01:33.469> much<00:01:33.590> around<00:01:33.979> 12<00:01:34.310> o'clock<00:01:34.430> on<00:01:34.880> the

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
pretty much around 12 o'clock on the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.389 
pretty much around 12 o'clock on the
dials<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.710> we'll<00:01:36.710> just<00:01:36.829> play<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:36.979> couple<00:01:37.219> of

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
dials and we'll just play a couple of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:48.819 
dials and we'll just play a couple of
things<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:37.729> check<00:01:37.850> it<00:01:37.969> out

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.160 

and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:49.979> when<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> engage<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.729> hots<00:01:50.939> which

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
and then when I engage the hots which

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.480 
and then when I engage the hots which
accesses<00:01:52.170> another<00:01:52.530> portion<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:53.039> a<00:01:53.130> preamp

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
accesses another portion of a preamp

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:07.080 
accesses another portion of a preamp
tube

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.730 

and<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.479> coolest<00:02:08.810> thing<00:02:08.959> they<00:02:09.080> did<00:02:09.259> here<00:02:09.500> was

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
and the coolest thing they did here was

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.330 
and the coolest thing they did here was
they<00:02:09.979> put<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.250> 12-inch<00:02:11.800> greenback<00:02:12.800> 25

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
they put a 12-inch greenback 25

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.699 
they put a 12-inch greenback 25
Celestion<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.900> it's<00:02:14.990> quite<00:02:15.140> surprising<00:02:15.260> that

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
Celestion so it's quite surprising that

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.260 
Celestion so it's quite surprising that
at<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.280> should<00:02:16.370> benefit<00:02:16.610> in<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.850> cabinet

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
at of it should benefit in that cabinet

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.820 
at of it should benefit in that cabinet
but<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.480> does<00:02:17.600> sound<00:02:17.750> really<00:02:17.900> solid<00:02:18.350> it<00:02:18.620> does

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
but it does sound really solid it does

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.650 
but it does sound really solid it does
it's<00:02:19.160> quite<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.340> wide<00:02:19.940> variety<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.450> tones

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
it's quite a wide variety of tones

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.210 
it's quite a wide variety of tones
therefore<00:02:21.350> recording<00:02:21.740> with<00:02:21.860> as<00:02:22.010> well

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
therefore recording with as well

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.030 
therefore recording with as well
absolutely<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.360> know<00:02:23.709> I'm<00:02:24.709> kind<00:02:24.770> of

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
absolutely and you know I'm kind of

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.470 
absolutely and you know I'm kind of
hitting<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.250> hard<00:02:25.400> right<00:02:25.520> now<00:02:25.700> I<00:02:25.760> have<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> p90

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
hitting it hard right now I have a p90

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.750 
hitting it hard right now I have a p90
setting<00:02:26.840> with<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> single<00:02:27.380> coil<00:02:27.590> maybe<00:02:28.520> roll

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
setting with a single coil maybe roll

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:38.990 
setting with a single coil maybe roll
out<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.940> volume<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.330> little<00:02:29.420> bit

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.330 

it's<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.720> really<00:02:40.020> sweet<00:02:40.200> tone<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.770> creamy<00:02:41.070> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it's a really sweet tone it's creamy and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.420 
it's a really sweet tone it's creamy and
it<00:02:41.970> plays<00:02:42.180> really<00:02:42.480> well

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.830 

so<00:02:48.430> what's<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> cheap<00:02:49.150> compliment<00:02:49.629> on<00:02:49.719> this

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
so what's the cheap compliment on this

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.880 
so what's the cheap compliment on this
amplifier<00:02:50.319> we<00:02:50.859> did<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.640> one<00:02:51.939> L<00:02:52.329> 84<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.079> two

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
amplifier we did a it's one L 84 and two

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.699 
amplifier we did a it's one L 84 and two
12ax7<00:02:54.719> so<00:02:55.719> it's<00:02:55.840> not<00:02:55.930> too<00:02:56.079> much<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.409> reach<00:02:56.560> you

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
12ax7 so it's not too much to reach you

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.229 
12ax7 so it's not too much to reach you
once<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.040> do<00:02:57.159> need<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.489> as<00:02:57.579> well<00:02:57.700> no<00:02:57.909> not<00:02:58.150> at

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
once you do need to as well no not at
