00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Well, now we 'll talk about the Norwegian 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.810
 herring is good fish mean on 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.440
 big fat like my lips 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 but before you do something from it 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.230
 desired section 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.859
 Light always recommend buying all the same 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.260
 whole network what do you see how drunk she is 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.560
 and not some kind of fillet and now I tell you 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.689
 I will show how this network is correct and fast and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.470
 efficiently sections 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.640
 here she is on my boss's head yet 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.920
 need to cut off the head this is 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 special way when chapter 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 diagonally cut that is, I took 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.390
 fin broken hand over hand and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.379
 then there is no knife and under the fin is looking for a knife 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.180
 and obliquely make one movement afterwards 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.160
 I open the knife in this place 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.739
 second movement towards this way 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.629
 clean my goals so i have effectively chosen 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.579
 from the head all the flesh is left here 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.579
 here is the head 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.850
 now it is important herring you 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.920
 I will ask 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.260
 a little tummy is cut off like this 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.320
 it is by the way very tasty and its place 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.450
 you can clear here there is a will 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.659
 the port 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.770
 Here are the insides, well, except with their hand 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.509
 there is nothing else to effectively remove sometimes 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.900
 here is how you understand milk and 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.900
 short 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.390
 when herring need to be cleaned again 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:41.200
 hands because another way 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:42.670
 insulin no women I recommend 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.500
 of course when working with herring 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.390
 wear single- use gloves 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.000
 latex gloves that's because labor 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.670
 hands will be clean but in gloves 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.750
 skin is not very good to pick up therefore 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.179
 all the same here this stage will have hands so 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.950
 or otherwise and lubricants here are usually not 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.630
 forget that usually herring cleans with 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.280
 heads that is not from the tail i will 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.090
 brush off head against vanka beetles 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.030
 as complaining about the village to my grandfather for 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.620
 that he does not correctly numbers herring him 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.360
 his master muzzle and herring too in the muzzle 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.860
 you 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.030
 so here is a herring cleared with one 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.360
 side the herring will now be cleaned and with 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.810
 the other side and further our task 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.569
 cut up into 2 fish fillets eat two 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.430
 fillet 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:41.400
 they go on both sides of the ridge as you 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:46.530
 You see, I removed the second part 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.129
 here I delete the fin right here you need 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.280
 now show bring the dark film 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:57.810
 knife to clean it is not bitter as many 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.379
 consider she just looks ugly here 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.379
 i was cleaning 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:08.129
 these dark places 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.799
 now you can hand and divide by two 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.659
 fillet here I am now on the back do not spend 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.019
 share see already outlined two 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.959
 filler then i can hand 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:22.220
 fingers and hold neatly 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.040
 remove the ridge and it is done like this 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.989
 here you see the bones remain 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.989
 costal on my ridge from here 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.560
 one fillet appeared also i will delete the second 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.560
 fillet 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:51.080
 Here is such a Christmas tree 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:52.580
 we no longer need it now need again 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.980
 same with these fillets a little bit anyway 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.350
 extra work 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.450
 clean them you can see that here 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.700
 here still there look here still there 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.650
 here are rib bones that us 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.080
 delete failed therefore ideally 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.020
 of course you can have pintsetik or just 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.180
 fingers these bones neatly 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.180
 cause here so much here 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.220
 now we have more or less 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.160
 I 'm already cooking on and filip now we 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.770
 check here I see bones here yet 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.890
 stayed tweezers it is very convenient 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.890
 do 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.720
 Well , we have two fillets 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.250
 they can be washed additionally and in 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.010
 hereinafter exactly this fillet 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.580
 used to cook whole
