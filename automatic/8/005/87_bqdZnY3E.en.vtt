there of red pain and whatnot and it was
just<00:04:37.620> bloody<00:04:37.860> annoying<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.550> was<00:04:39.210> lucky<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.450> get

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
just bloody annoying I was lucky to get

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.300 
just bloody annoying I was lucky to get
a<00:04:39.800> pretty<00:04:40.800> decent<00:04:40.890> painted<00:04:41.670> figure<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:43.320> excuse

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
a pretty decent painted figure so excuse

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
a pretty decent painted figure so excuse
me<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:45.060> will<00:04:45.510> probably<00:04:46.050> display<00:04:46.680> this<00:04:46.920> one

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
me I will probably display this one

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.560 
me I will probably display this one
holding<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:50.070> other<00:04:50.220> head<00:04:50.460> which<00:04:50.940> kind<00:04:51.480> of

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
holding the the other head which kind of

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.780 
holding the the other head which kind of
looks<00:04:51.720> like<00:04:51.810> his<00:04:52.200> helmet<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:52.920> mean<00:04:53.160> which<00:04:53.640> I

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
looks like his helmet I mean which I

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.640 
looks like his helmet I mean which I
think<00:04:54.030> I'm<00:04:54.150> double<00:04:54.450> as<00:04:54.570> his<00:04:54.720> helmets<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.320> it's

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
think I'm double as his helmets and it's

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.080 
think I'm double as his helmets and it's
not<00:04:55.860> it's<00:04:56.640> not<00:04:56.880> as<00:04:57.150> bulky<00:04:57.600> as<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:58.280> as<00:04:59.280> some<00:04:59.970> of

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
not it's not as bulky as a as some of

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.570 
not it's not as bulky as a as some of
the<00:05:00.150> pictures<00:05:01.400> some<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.520> pictures

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
the pictures some of the pictures

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.770 
the pictures some of the pictures
actually<00:05:03.150> portray<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.080> be<00:05:04.200> but<00:05:05.600> yeah<00:05:06.600> I'll

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
actually portray it to be but yeah I'll

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.000 
actually portray it to be but yeah I'll
probably<00:05:07.020> got<00:05:07.260> probably<00:05:07.530> just<00:05:07.680> this<00:05:07.800> frame

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
probably got probably just this frame

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.410 
probably got probably just this frame
this<00:05:08.220> way<00:05:08.460> holding<00:05:09.330> his<00:05:09.480> helmet<00:05:10.160> sort<00:05:11.160> of

a<00:05:57.510> tad<00:05:57.540> bit<00:05:58.080> shortened<00:05:58.530> maybe<00:05:59.310> it's<00:05:59.580> just<00:05:59.670> the

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
a tad bit shortened maybe it's just the

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.840 
a tad bit shortened maybe it's just the
an<00:05:59.940> optical<00:06:00.330> illusion<00:06:00.420> because<00:06:00.990> of<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.170> armor

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
an optical illusion because of the armor

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.570 
an optical illusion because of the armor
the<00:06:02.850> entire<00:06:03.120> mold<00:06:03.480> is<00:06:03.890> exactly<00:06:04.890> the<00:06:05.100> same<00:06:05.310> as

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
the entire mold is exactly the same as

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.760 
the entire mold is exactly the same as
this<00:06:05.820> one<00:06:06.060> except<00:06:06.510> for<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:06.810> chest<00:06:07.140> obviously

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
this one except for the chest obviously

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.830 
this one except for the chest obviously
and<00:06:08.010> the<00:06:08.190> head<00:06:08.400> but<00:06:09.090> everything<00:06:09.450> is<00:06:09.510> the<00:06:09.600> same

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
and the head but everything is the same

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.750 
and the head but everything is the same
so<00:06:10.530> they<00:06:10.650> should<00:06:10.860> be<00:06:10.890> exactly<00:06:11.280> the<00:06:11.490> same

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
so they should be exactly the same

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.450 
so they should be exactly the same
height<00:06:11.970> almost<00:06:12.900> the<00:06:13.110> same<00:06:13.260> height<00:06:13.500> it<00:06:14.310> could

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
height almost the same height it could

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.970 
height almost the same height it could
be<00:06:14.550> just<00:06:14.730> an<00:06:14.820> illusion<00:06:15.060> I'm<00:06:15.360> sorry<00:06:15.570> anyway<00:06:16.110> so

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
be just an illusion I'm sorry anyway so

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.220 
be just an illusion I'm sorry anyway so
there<00:06:17.100> you<00:06:17.190> have<00:06:17.250> it<00:06:17.540> it's<00:06:18.540> really<00:06:18.720> a<00:06:18.840> nice

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
there you have it it's really a nice

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.900 
there you have it it's really a nice
figure<00:06:19.650> if<00:06:19.860> you're<00:06:19.950> a<00:06:20.010> big<00:06:20.250> fan<00:06:20.460> of<00:06:20.490> the<00:06:20.670> movie

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
figure if you're a big fan of the movie

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.210

franchise<00:06:21.390> you<00:06:21.660> like<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:22.080> figures<00:06:22.470> you<00:06:22.770> like

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
franchise you like the figures you like

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.860 
franchise you like the figures you like
the<00:06:23.370> toys<00:06:23.580> from<00:06:23.880> the<00:06:23.970> Iron<00:06:24.120> Man<00:06:24.300> movies<00:06:24.690> I

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
the toys from the Iron Man movies I

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.360 
the toys from the Iron Man movies I
think<00:06:25.260> you<00:06:25.320> should<00:06:25.470> go<00:06:25.590> in<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:25.860> pick<00:06:25.980> this<00:06:26.130> up

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
think you should go in and pick this up

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.340 
think you should go in and pick this up
I<00:06:26.610> mean<00:06:26.760> just<00:06:27.120> the<00:06:27.270> head<00:06:27.510> sculpt<00:06:27.930> alone<00:06:28.170> is

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
I mean just the head sculpt alone is

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.519 
I mean just the head sculpt alone is
enough

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:29.529 
enough

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.019 
enough
to<00:06:29.739> warrant<00:06:30.129> the<00:06:30.219> purchase<00:06:30.579> of<00:06:30.609> this<00:06:30.819> figure

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:31.029 
to warrant the purchase of this figure

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:33.149 
to warrant the purchase of this figure
and<00:06:31.329> I<00:06:31.449> certainly<00:06:32.079> would<00:06:32.319> very<00:06:32.829> highly

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:33.159 
and I certainly would very highly

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.939 
and I certainly would very highly
recommend<00:06:33.699> this<00:06:33.819> figure<00:06:34.049> if<00:06:35.049> you're<00:06:35.709> just

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
recommend this figure if you're just

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:37.709 
recommend this figure if you're just
