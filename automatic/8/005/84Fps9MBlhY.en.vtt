someone's gonna have to back up at some
stage<00:00:47.500> I<00:00:47.769> think<00:00:48.730> it's<00:00:48.879> going<00:00:48.969> to<00:00:49.059> be<00:00:49.120> Matisse

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
stage I think it's going to be Matisse

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.979 
stage I think it's going to be Matisse
the<00:00:50.350> ends<00:00:50.649> up<00:00:50.739> backing<00:00:51.129> up<00:00:51.219> in<00:00:51.399> his<00:00:51.519> fight

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the ends up backing up in his fight

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.810 
the ends up backing up in his fight
Matisse<00:00:52.989> has<00:00:53.230> shown<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.769> ability<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:54.489> some

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
Matisse has shown the ability in some

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.759 
Matisse has shown the ability in some
fights<00:00:55.059> to<00:00:55.329> actually<00:00:55.749> move<00:00:56.019> and<00:00:56.350> box<00:00:56.589> a<00:00:56.739> little

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
fights to actually move and box a little

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.099 
fights to actually move and box a little
bit<00:00:56.980> and<00:00:57.309> I<00:00:58.030> think<00:00:58.120> he's<00:00:58.449> going<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.629> be<00:00:58.749> forced

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
bit and I think he's going to be forced

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.739 
bit and I think he's going to be forced
to<00:00:59.379> move<00:00:59.499> on<00:00:59.769> box<00:01:00.039> at<00:01:00.850> some<00:01:01.239> point<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:01.629> this

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
to move on box at some point in this

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.860 
to move on box at some point in this
fight<00:01:02.019> because<00:01:02.850> provodnikov<00:01:03.850> weaved<00:01:04.330> oh<00:01:04.540> sure

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
fight because provodnikov weaved oh sure

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.200 
fight because provodnikov weaved oh sure
or<00:01:05.110> more<00:01:05.530> compact<00:01:05.980> arms<00:01:06.460> in<00:01:06.580> a<00:01:06.640> more<00:01:06.790> compact

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
or more compact arms in a more compact

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.310 
or more compact arms in a more compact
physique<00:01:07.570> even<00:01:07.870> though<00:01:07.960> they're<00:01:08.140> probably

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
physique even though they're probably

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.070 
physique even though they're probably
around<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.710> same<00:01:08.770> height<00:01:09.900> veronica<00:01:10.900> has<00:01:11.020> a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
around the same height veronica has a

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.500 
around the same height veronica has a
more<00:01:11.290> compact<00:01:11.620> physique<00:01:11.980> and<00:01:12.160> I<00:01:12.220> just<00:01:12.370> feel<00:01:12.580> he

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
more compact physique and I just feel he

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.170 
more compact physique and I just feel he
might<00:01:13.720> be<00:01:13.930> naturally<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.710> bit<00:01:15.010> stronger<00:01:15.850> maybe

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
might be naturally a bit stronger maybe

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.690 
might be naturally a bit stronger maybe
a<00:01:16.570> bit<00:01:17.200> more<00:01:17.380> robust<00:01:17.860> maybe<00:01:18.370> a<00:01:18.490> bit<00:01:18.670> more

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
a bit more robust maybe a bit more

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.790 
a bit more robust maybe a bit more
durable<00:01:19.330> than<00:01:19.390> Matisse<00:01:19.840> not<00:01:20.440> saying<00:01:20.680> much

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
durable than Matisse not saying much

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.570 
durable than Matisse not saying much
Matisse's<00:01:21.400> fragile<00:01:21.970> at<00:01:22.540> all<00:01:22.930> but<00:01:23.770> you're

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
Matisse's fragile at all but you're

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.270 
Matisse's fragile at all but you're
talking<00:01:24.760> about<00:01:25.180> in<00:01:25.480> relative<00:01:26.410> terms<00:01:26.440> here<00:01:27.010> so

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
talking about in relative terms here so

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.520 
talking about in relative terms here so
i<00:01:27.520> think<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.300> Matisse<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:29.020> going<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.290> after

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
i think that Matisse is going to after

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.250 
i think that Matisse is going to after
some<00:01:29.890> point<00:01:30.220> start<00:01:30.580> moving<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.210> it's<00:01:32.140> going

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
some point start moving and it's going

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.290 
some point start moving and it's going
to<00:01:32.320> be<00:01:32.440> provodnikov<00:01:33.070> pursuing<00:01:33.670> Matisse<00:01:34.030> and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
to be provodnikov pursuing Matisse and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.190 
to be provodnikov pursuing Matisse and
for<00:01:35.260> that<00:01:35.350> reason<00:01:35.410> i<00:01:36.240> don't<00:01:37.240> know<00:01:37.300> it's<00:01:38.140> a

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
for that reason i don't know it's a

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.930 
for that reason i don't know it's a
difficult<00:01:38.380> fight<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:39.010> pick<00:01:39.190> Matisse's<00:01:39.730> more

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
difficult fight to pick Matisse's more

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.080 
difficult fight to pick Matisse's more
versatile<00:01:41.190> he<00:01:42.190> has<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.340> longer<00:01:42.760> arms

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
versatile he has the longer arms

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.660 
versatile he has the longer arms
definitely<00:01:43.470> he<00:01:44.470> can<00:01:44.680> box<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:45.040> little<00:01:45.070> bit<00:01:45.280> but

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
definitely he can box a little bit but

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.590 
definitely he can box a little bit but
is<00:01:46.480> he<00:01:46.810> slick<00:01:47.170> enough<00:01:47.350> if<00:01:48.540> veronica<00:01:49.540> was

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
is he slick enough if veronica was

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.630 
is he slick enough if veronica was
really<00:01:49.990> putting<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.530> him<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.950> stay<00:01:51.190> away<00:01:51.220> I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
really putting it on him to stay away I

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.430 
really putting it on him to stay away I
suppose<00:01:52.000> Tim<00:01:52.240> Bradley<00:01:52.510> did<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.930> but<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.260> meet

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
suppose Tim Bradley did it but to meet

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.860 
suppose Tim Bradley did it but to meet
him<00:01:53.650> Brad<00:01:53.830> he's<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:54.040> bit<00:01:54.250> our<00:01:54.450> technical<00:01:55.450> boxing

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
him Brad he's a bit our technical boxing

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.780 
him Brad he's a bit our technical boxing
and<00:01:55.990> Lucas<00:01:56.260> motif<00:01:56.620> so<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:57.100> don't<00:01:57.610> know<00:01:57.670> i'll

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
and Lucas motif so I don't know i'll

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.610 
and Lucas motif so I don't know i'll
leave<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:57.970> one<00:01:58.300> up<00:01:58.330> in<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.690> air<00:01:58.840> but<00:01:59.110> it's

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
leave that one up in the air but it's

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.460 
leave that one up in the air but it's
going<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.770> be<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> fascinating<00:02:00.220> fight<00:02:01.320> could<00:02:02.320> go

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
going to be a fascinating fight could go

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.860 
going to be a fascinating fight could go
down<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.890> wire<00:02:03.330> could<00:02:04.330> end<00:02:04.510> up<00:02:04.660> in<00:02:04.780> a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
down to the wire could end up in a

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.420 
down to the wire could end up in a
knockout<00:02:05.200> but<00:02:05.410> like<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:05.620> say<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.100> pattern<00:02:06.280> of

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
knockout but like I say the pattern of

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.240 
knockout but like I say the pattern of
the<00:02:06.550> fight<00:02:06.730> I<00:02:06.760> see<00:02:07.530> both<00:02:08.530> guys<00:02:08.800> coming<00:02:09.160> out

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
has but eventually I see

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.400 
has but eventually I see
it<00:02:14.530> being<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.920> cat<00:02:15.100> and<00:02:15.250> mouse<00:02:15.310> game<00:02:15.460> with
