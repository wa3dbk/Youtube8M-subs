hey guys welcome to this little video on
the<00:00:04.710> mumbo<00:00:04.980> Channel<00:00:05.339> in<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:05.640> one<00:00:05.790> we're

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
the mumbo Channel in this one we're

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.369 
the mumbo Channel in this one we're
going<00:00:06.150> to<00:00:06.240> be<00:00:06.330> taking<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.690> look<00:00:06.810> at<00:00:07.020> how<00:00:07.319> to

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
going to be taking a look at how to

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.410 
going to be taking a look at how to
improve<00:00:07.799> your<00:00:08.010> audio<00:00:08.189> quality<00:00:08.610> now<00:00:09.389> I

improve your audio quality now I

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.270 
improve your audio quality now I
personally<00:00:09.840> like<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.200> think<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.590> this<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:10.980> four

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
personally like to think of this in four

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.530 
personally like to think of this in four

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
different stages you've got your

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.629 
different stages you've got your
microphone<00:00:12.690> your<00:00:13.469> microphone<00:00:13.980> peripherals

covered in today's video so let's crack

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.820 
covered in today's video so let's crack
straight<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.449> take<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> look<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> start

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
straight on and take a look so to start

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.230 
straight on and take a look so to start
things<00:00:22.980> off<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.400> microphone<00:00:24.000> now<00:00:24.180> is

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
things off the microphone now is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.970 
things off the microphone now is
obviously<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.689> very<00:00:25.019> important<00:00:25.529> piece<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.769> kit

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
obviously a very important piece of kit

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.259 
obviously a very important piece of kit
because<00:00:26.250> that's<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.670> directly<00:00:27.180> affect

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
because that's going to directly affect

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.630 
because that's going to directly affect
the<00:00:27.689> audio<00:00:27.990> quality<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.619> get<00:00:28.800> now<00:00:29.490> as

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the audio quality that you get now as

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400 
the audio quality that you get now as
you<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.910> see<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> screen<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.170> blue

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
you can see on the screen I use the blue

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.410 
you can see on the screen I use the blue
Bluebird<00:00:31.920> microphone<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> middle<00:00:33.270> of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
Bluebird microphone which is a middle of

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.760 
Bluebird microphone which is a middle of
the<00:00:33.480> range<00:00:33.719> microphone<00:00:34.260> costing<00:00:34.649> around

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the range microphone costing around

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.330 
the range microphone costing around
about<00:00:35.219> 215<00:00:36.210> pounds<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:37.110> too<00:00:37.290> cheap<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:38.100> not

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
about 215 pounds not too cheap but not

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.040 
about 215 pounds not too cheap but not
too<00:00:38.550> expensive<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.239> perfect<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.020> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
too expensive it is perfect for what I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
too expensive it is perfect for what I
need<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.340> why<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.550> chose<00:00:41.969> to

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
need it for and that is why I chose to

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.670 
need it for and that is why I chose to
buy<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.300> however<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.350> think<00:00:43.379> they're

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
buy it however if you think they're

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.319 
buy it however if you think they're
spending<00:00:43.890> over<00:00:44.190> 200<00:00:44.730> pounds<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> microphone

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
spending over 200 pounds on a microphone

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.910 
spending over 200 pounds on a microphone
is<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.840> little<00:00:46.110> bit<00:00:46.200> too<00:00:46.350> much<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.710> than

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
is a little bit too much for you than

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.680 
is a little bit too much for you than
there<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.039> cheaper<00:00:47.520> alternatives<00:00:48.090> for

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
there are cheaper alternatives for

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.600 
there are cheaper alternatives for
example<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> blue<00:00:49.469> Yeti<00:00:49.739> retails<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.340> around

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
example the blue Yeti retails at around

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.400 
example the blue Yeti retails at around
about<00:00:50.730> ninety<00:00:51.120> pounds<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
about ninety pounds and that really is a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
about ninety pounds and that really is a
very<00:00:52.559> good<00:00:53.129> microphone<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.850> myself<00:00:54.270> used<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
very good microphone I myself used it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.330 
very good microphone I myself used it
for<00:00:55.050> around<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> year<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.160> good

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
for around about a year and the good

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.979 
for around about a year and the good
thing<00:00:56.550> about<00:00:56.579> microphones<00:00:57.360> built<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.840> more

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
thing about microphones built for a more

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.689 
thing about microphones built for a more
general<00:00:58.410> purpose<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.309> fact<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.550> they

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
general purpose is the fact that they

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.639 
general purpose is the fact that they
are<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> little<00:01:00.149> bit<00:01:00.390> more<00:01:00.420> versatile<00:01:01.050> for

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
are a little bit more versatile for

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.950 
are a little bit more versatile for
example<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> blue<00:01:02.340> Yeti<00:01:02.609> has<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> USB<00:01:03.510> output

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
example the blue Yeti has a USB output

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.380 
example the blue Yeti has a USB output
it<00:01:04.290> also<00:01:04.409> has<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> gain<00:01:05.189> monitor<00:01:05.640> inbuilt<00:01:06.150> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
it also has a gain monitor inbuilt and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210 
it also has a gain monitor inbuilt and
different<00:01:07.229> modes<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.799> play<00:01:07.979> with

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
different modes that you can play with

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.649 
different modes that you can play with
the<00:01:08.549> blue<00:01:08.700> bird<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.090> other<00:01:09.270> hand<00:01:09.479> doesn't

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the blue bird on the other hand doesn't

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.570 
the blue bird on the other hand doesn't
have<00:01:09.810> any<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.320> fandangled<00:01:11.040> stuff<00:01:11.310> it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
have any of that fandangled stuff it's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
have any of that fandangled stuff it's
got<00:01:11.670> an<00:01:11.760> XLR<00:01:12.180> output<00:01:12.630> which<00:01:12.960> means<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.260> have

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
got an XLR output which means you have

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.050 
got an XLR output which means you have
to<00:01:13.409> run<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.680> into<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> preamp<00:01:14.340> or<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.790> form<00:01:15.000> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
to run it into a preamp or some form of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.240 
to run it into a preamp or some form of
converter<00:01:15.450> before<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.439> into<00:01:16.680> your<00:01:16.799> PC

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
converter before it can go into your PC

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399 
converter before it can go into your PC
and<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.790> top<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:18.930> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and on top of all of this it is just a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.780 
and on top of all of this it is just a
cardioid<00:01:19.799> microphone<00:01:20.430> there<00:01:20.580> are<00:01:20.670> no

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
cardioid microphone there are no

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.190 
cardioid microphone there are no
alternate<00:01:21.360> modes<00:01:21.600> or<00:01:21.750> anything<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.170> that

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
alternate modes or anything like that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
alternate modes or anything like that
the<00:01:22.710> cardioid<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.159> perfect<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.850> me<00:01:23.939> because

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the cardioid is perfect for me because

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.670 
the cardioid is perfect for me because
it<00:01:24.330> means<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> only<00:01:24.720> picks<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.110> sound<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it means it only picks up sound from the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
it means it only picks up sound from the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
too much hassle and that is absolutely

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
too much hassle and that is absolutely
perfect<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.579> needs<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.600> terms<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
perfect for my needs now in terms of the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.389 
perfect for my needs now in terms of the
big<00:01:55.320> cage<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:55.950> surrounding<00:01:56.340> my

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
big cage that is surrounding my

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.679 
big cage that is surrounding my
microphone<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.149> known<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> shock

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
microphone that is known as a shock

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.899 
microphone that is known as a shock
mount<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.590> stops<00:01:58.890> any<00:01:59.040> vibrations<00:01:59.759> from

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
mount and that stops any vibrations from

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.060 
mount and that stops any vibrations from
the<00:02:00.000> surrounding<00:02:00.479> area<00:02:00.810> traveling<00:02:01.619> into<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the surrounding area traveling into the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.190 
the surrounding area traveling into the
microphone<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.390> example<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.079> are

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
microphone so for example if you are

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.289 
microphone so for example if you are
typing<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.890> recording<00:02:05.640> at<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.850> same<00:02:05.880> time

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
typing and recording at the same time

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.150 
typing and recording at the same time
some<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.960> those<00:02:07.020> vibrations<00:02:07.439> going<00:02:07.920> through

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
some of those vibrations going through

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.529 
some of those vibrations going through
into<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> desk<00:02:08.700> may<00:02:09.000> end<00:02:09.179> up<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.420> your

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
into the desk may end up in your

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.119 
into the desk may end up in your
microphone<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.470> gives<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:10.860> bit<00:02:10.979> of

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
microphone and it gives a little bit of

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.860 
microphone and it gives a little bit of
feedback<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:12.060> not<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.510> particularly

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
feedback and it's not a particularly

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.550 
feedback and it's not a particularly
pleasant<00:02:13.080> no

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
pleasant no

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.290 
pleasant no
so<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> shock<00:02:13.980> mount<00:02:14.220> does<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.670> very<00:02:15.000> good<00:02:15.240> job

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
so the shock mount does a very good job

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.420 
so the shock mount does a very good job
at<00:02:15.750> keeping<00:02:16.050> those<00:02:16.350> away<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.980> blank<00:02:17.220> disk

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
at keeping those away the blank disk

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.410 
at keeping those away the blank disk
that<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:17.850> see<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.060> front<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.330> my

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
that you can see in front of my

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.120

is all very useful now that brings me

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.930 
is all very useful now that brings me
fairly<00:02:49.860> cleanly<00:02:50.130> onto<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.580> next<00:02:50.760> section

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
fairly cleanly onto the next section

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.370 
fairly cleanly onto the next section
which<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:51.450> known<00:02:51.600> as<00:02:51.720> how<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.900> use<00:02:52.080> your

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
which is known as how to use your

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.140 
which is known as how to use your
microphone<00:02:52.680> effectively<00:02:53.370> now<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.910> first

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
microphone effectively now the first

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.400 
microphone effectively now the first
thing<00:02:54.269> I<00:02:54.390> want<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.630> say<00:02:54.750> here<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.230> want<00:02:55.320> to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
thing I want to say here is you want to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.930 
thing I want to say here is you want to
make<00:02:55.500> sure<00:02:55.709> you<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> correct<00:02:56.340> distance<00:02:56.790> away

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
make sure you the correct distance away

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.430 
make sure you the correct distance away
from<00:02:57.060> your<00:02:57.360> microphone<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:58.140> don't<00:02:58.260> want<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
from your microphone you don't want to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.690 
from your microphone you don't want to
be<00:02:58.500> too<00:02:58.650> close<00:02:58.680> because<00:02:59.220> then<00:02:59.370> everyone<00:02:59.640> will

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
be too close because then everyone will

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.280 
be too close because then everyone will
be<00:02:59.760> able<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.060> hear<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.360> sounds<00:03:00.780> from<00:03:00.900> inside

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
be able to hear the sounds from inside

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.590 
be able to hear the sounds from inside
your<00:03:01.440> mouth<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:02.370> your<00:03:02.580> saliva<00:03:02.880> which<00:03:03.300> isn't

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
your mouth like your saliva which isn't

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.540 
your mouth like your saliva which isn't
very<00:03:03.780> nice<00:03:03.989> at<00:03:04.200> all<00:03:04.319> but<00:03:04.950> if<00:03:05.040> you're<00:03:05.190> too<00:03:05.340> far

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
very nice at all but if you're too far

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.710 
very nice at all but if you're too far
away<00:03:05.700> you're<00:03:06.030> gonna<00:03:06.090> sound<00:03:06.330> like<00:03:06.480> you're<00:03:06.660> on

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
away you're gonna sound like you're on

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.120 
away you're gonna sound like you're on
the<00:03:06.810> other<00:03:06.840> side<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.380> room<00:03:07.560> which<00:03:07.950> also

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
the other side of the room which also

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.190 
the other side of the room which also
isn't<00:03:08.700> particularly<00:03:09.000> good<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.510> need<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.959> find

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
isn't particularly good you need to find

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.440 
isn't particularly good you need to find
a<00:03:10.350> happy<00:03:10.560> medium<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.250> for<00:03:11.430> me<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.209> around

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
a happy medium and for me that is around

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.630 
a happy medium and for me that is around
about<00:03:12.720> 20<00:03:13.170> centimeters<00:03:13.739> away<00:03:13.860> however<00:03:14.430> I

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
about 20 centimeters away however I

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.220 
about 20 centimeters away however I
would<00:03:14.910> suggest<00:03:15.060> experimenting<00:03:15.930> with<00:03:16.080> that

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
would suggest experimenting with that

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.830 
would suggest experimenting with that
yourself<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:17.010> try<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.220> get<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.489> best<00:03:17.610> results

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
yourself to try and get the best results

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.060 
yourself to try and get the best results
adjusting<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.959> gain<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.320> your<00:03:19.440> microphone<00:03:19.739> is

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
adjusting the gain of your microphone is

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.130 
adjusting the gain of your microphone is
also<00:03:20.400> extremely<00:03:20.850> important<00:03:21.570> if<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.870> speak

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
also extremely important if you speak

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.140 
also extremely important if you speak
very<00:03:22.380> loudly<00:03:22.739> into<00:03:23.220> your<00:03:23.340> microphone<00:03:23.610> then

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
very loudly into your microphone then

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.370 
very loudly into your microphone then
you're<00:03:24.269> going<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.510> want<00:03:24.630> your<00:03:24.720> gain<00:03:24.959> setting

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
you're going to want your gain setting

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.720 
you're going to want your gain setting
to<00:03:25.470> be<00:03:25.560> fairly<00:03:25.829> low<00:03:26.100> because<00:03:26.340> otherwise

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
to be fairly low because otherwise

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.729 
to be fairly low because otherwise
you're<00:03:27.299> going<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.540> be<00:03:27.630> maxing<00:03:28.140> out<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
you're going to be maxing out to the

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.560 
you're going to be maxing out to the
audio<00:03:29.070> range<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.670> your<00:03:29.940> voice<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.269> going<00:03:30.450> to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
audio range and your voice is going to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.720 
audio range and your voice is going to
become<00:03:30.780> distorted<00:03:31.350> which<00:03:31.829> really<00:03:32.280> does<00:03:32.519> sound

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
become distorted which really does sound

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.819 
become distorted which really does sound
very<00:03:32.940> awful<00:03:33.450> on<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.930> other<00:03:34.110> hand<00:03:34.320> if<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.709> have

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
very awful on the other hand if you have

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.560 
very awful on the other hand if you have
got<00:03:34.980> your<00:03:35.100> gain<00:03:35.310> setting<00:03:35.670> set<00:03:35.910> far<00:03:36.180> too<00:03:36.360> high

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
got your gain setting set far too high

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.120 
got your gain setting set far too high
then<00:03:37.049> no<00:03:37.200> one's<00:03:37.380> going<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.620> be<00:03:37.709> able<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.920> hear

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
then no one's going to be able to hear

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.199 
then no one's going to be able to hear
you<00:03:38.250> because<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.579> microphone<00:03:38.970> won't<00:03:39.090> be

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
you because the microphone won't be

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.539 
you because the microphone won't be
picking<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.540> up<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.260> also<00:03:40.440> isn't<00:03:41.220> going

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
picking you up and that also isn't going

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.190 
picking you up and that also isn't going
to<00:03:41.670> make<00:03:41.820> for<00:03:42.000> very<00:03:42.150> good<00:03:42.359> audio<00:03:42.630> quality<00:03:42.810> is

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
to make for very good audio quality is

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.479 
to make for very good audio quality is
it<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.470> it's<00:03:43.590> all<00:03:43.650> about<00:03:43.799> finding<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.310> happy

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
it so it's all about finding a happy

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.039 
it so it's all about finding a happy
medium<00:03:44.970> once<00:03:45.150> again<00:03:45.420> and<00:03:45.600> you're<00:03:45.870> going<00:03:45.989> to

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
medium once again and you're going to

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.150 
medium once again and you're going to
have<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.290> experiment<00:03:46.799> with<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.010> one

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
have to experiment with that one

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.949 
have to experiment with that one
yourself<00:03:47.250> now<00:03:48.030> we've<00:03:48.209> all<00:03:48.359> seen<00:03:48.570> those<00:03:48.690> very

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
yourself now we've all seen those very

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.990 
yourself now we've all seen those very
expensive<00:03:49.109> foam<00:03:49.799> acoustic<00:03:50.489> tiles<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.910> you

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
expensive foam acoustic tiles that you

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.460 
expensive foam acoustic tiles that you
can<00:03:51.120> stick<00:03:51.329> up<00:03:51.420> on<00:03:51.570> your<00:03:51.690> walls<00:03:51.870> to<00:03:52.290> prevent

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
can stick up on your walls to prevent

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.650 
can stick up on your walls to prevent
any<00:03:52.829> echoing<00:03:53.340> going<00:03:53.609> on<00:03:53.760> you'll<00:03:54.120> look<00:03:54.299> like<00:03:54.480> a

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
any echoing going on you'll look like a

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.420 
any echoing going on you'll look like a
professional<00:03:55.019> recording<00:03:55.590> studio<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.160> it

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
professional recording studio and it

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.190 
professional recording studio and it
really<00:03:56.670> will<00:03:56.850> do<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> decent<00:03:57.299> job<00:03:57.660> at<00:03:57.870> getting

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
really will do a decent job at getting

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.720 
really will do a decent job at getting
rid<00:03:58.320> of<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.530> reverb<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.010> if<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.340> do<00:03:59.459> have<00:03:59.640> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
rid of the reverb and if you do have the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.860 
rid of the reverb and if you do have the
money<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.060> do<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.269> sort<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.540> thing

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
money to do that sort of thing

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.150 
money to do that sort of thing
then<00:04:01.109> I<00:04:01.200> would<00:04:01.350> definitely<00:04:01.470> suggest<00:04:01.829> it

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
then I would definitely suggest it

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.740 
then I would definitely suggest it
because<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.459> will<00:04:02.579> do<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.850> best<00:04:02.970> job<00:04:03.120> however

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
because it will do the best job however

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.330 
because it will do the best job however
if<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.230> are<00:04:04.260> like<00:04:04.470> me<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.980> had<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.160> budget

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
if you are like me and you had a budget

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.310 
if you are like me and you had a budget
of<00:04:05.549> zero<00:04:05.850> pounds<00:04:06.150> I've<00:04:06.420> got<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.900> pretty<00:04:07.170> good

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
of zero pounds I've got a pretty good

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.020 
of zero pounds I've got a pretty good
solution<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.790> use<00:04:08.820> a

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
solution for you and that is to use a

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.599 
solution for you and that is to use a
bunch<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.660> soft<00:04:10.079> objects<00:04:10.709> around<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.190> they're

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
bunch of soft objects around you they're

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.550 
bunch of soft objects around you they're
going<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:11.940> be<00:04:12.060> absorbing<00:04:12.570> any<00:04:12.810> stray<00:04:13.200> sound

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
going to be absorbing any stray sound

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.740 
going to be absorbing any stray sound
waves<00:04:13.859> so<00:04:14.370> for<00:04:14.549> example<00:04:14.940> I've<00:04:15.120> got<00:04:15.299> pillows

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
waves so for example I've got pillows

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.719 
waves so for example I've got pillows
I've<00:04:15.959> got<00:04:16.440> blankets<00:04:16.919> up<00:04:17.070> in<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.400> wall<00:04:17.579> in

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
I've got blankets up in the wall in

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.610 
I've got blankets up in the wall in
front<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:18.060> me<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.390> have<00:04:18.690> blankets<00:04:19.109> all<00:04:19.289> around

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
front of me I have blankets all around

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.949 
front of me I have blankets all around
me<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.950> create<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.280> little<00:04:20.669> booth<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:21.150> audio

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
me to create a little booth of audio

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.690 
me to create a little booth of audio
protection<00:04:22.650> when<00:04:22.890> none<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.280> sound<00:04:23.520> can

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
protection when none of the sound can

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.880 
protection when none of the sound can
actually<00:04:24.030> exit<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:24.690> bounce<00:04:25.140> off<00:04:25.380> my<00:04:25.650> walls

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
actually exit and bounce off my walls

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.250 
actually exit and bounce off my walls
and

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
and

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.870 
and
back<00:04:26.470> into<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.830> microphone<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.580> feel<00:04:27.760> like

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
back into the microphone and I feel like

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.220 
back into the microphone and I feel like
I've<00:04:28.000> done<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.180> pretty<00:04:28.360> decent<00:04:28.720> job<00:04:29.050> at

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
I've done a pretty decent job at

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.350 
I've done a pretty decent job at
canceling<00:04:29.710> out<00:04:29.860> most<00:04:30.250> of<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.520> reverb<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:31.060> fact

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
canceling out most of the reverb in fact

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.450 
canceling out most of the reverb in fact
I'm<00:04:31.570> going<00:04:31.780> to<00:04:31.870> prove<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.230> you<00:04:32.380> how<00:04:32.890> impressive

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
I'm going to prove to you how impressive

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.610 
I'm going to prove to you how impressive
this<00:04:33.760> solution<00:04:34.180> is<00:04:34.360> by<00:04:34.750> removing<00:04:35.050> all<00:04:35.350> of<00:04:35.500> them

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
this solution is by removing all of them

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.290 
this solution is by removing all of them
now<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.070> you'll<00:04:36.640> be<00:04:36.760> able<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.030> hear<00:04:37.180> the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
now and you'll be able to hear the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.090 
now and you'll be able to hear the
difference<00:04:37.420> and<00:04:37.930> there<00:04:38.410> we<00:04:38.530> go<00:04:38.680> all<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:38.980> my

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
difference and there we go all of my

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.410 
difference and there we go all of my
pillows<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.460> blankets<00:04:40.000> have<00:04:40.090> now<00:04:40.210> been

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
pillows and blankets have now been

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.820

removed and straight away you can hear

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.680 
removed and straight away you can hear
all<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.580> echoes<00:04:42.940> going<00:04:43.300> straight<00:04:43.660> through

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
all of the echoes going straight through

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.660 
all of the echoes going straight through
into<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.110> microphone<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.740> can<00:04:45.130> already<00:04:45.400> tell

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
into the microphone I can already tell

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.190 
into the microphone I can already tell
that<00:04:45.730> this<00:04:45.970> isn't<00:04:46.360> going<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.630> be<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.960> good
