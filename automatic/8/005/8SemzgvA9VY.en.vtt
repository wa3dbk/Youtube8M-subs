00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.230 
shape-shifting we're going to be talking
a<00:00:18.940> lot<00:00:19.090> about<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:20.230> shape<00:00:20.620> of<00:00:20.830> cords<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.850> the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
a lot about the shape of cords and the

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.360 
a lot about the shape of cords and the
shape<00:00:22.540> of<00:00:22.780> scales<00:00:23.200> as<00:00:23.740> opposed<00:00:24.070> to<00:00:24.190> worrying

about<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.790> mathematics<00:00:25.510> and<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:26.260> individual

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
about the mathematics and the individual

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.380 
about the mathematics and the individual
notes<00:00:27.300> now<00:00:28.300> I<00:00:28.360> can<00:00:28.600> take<00:00:28.690> a<00:00:28.750> nice<00:00:29.020> shape

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.770 

and<00:00:31.480> my<00:00:32.380> no<00:00:32.440> had<00:00:32.680> a<00:00:32.710> bar<00:00:33.060> that's<00:00:34.060> a<00:00:34.270> cheat<00:00:34.480> Corp

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
and my no had a bar that's a cheat Corp

and my no had a bar that's a cheat Corp
just<00:00:35.110> borrowing<00:00:35.380> it<00:00:35.470> the<00:00:35.620> third<00:00:35.830> fret<00:00:36.130> now

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
just borrowing it the third fret now

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.560 
just borrowing it the third fret now
just<00:00:37.210> using<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.600> one<00:00:37.780> each<00:00:38.020> shape<00:00:38.350> by

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
just using that one each shape by

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.280 
just using that one each shape by
experimenting<00:00:40.570> moving<00:00:40.900> up<00:00:41.020> and<00:00:41.110> down<00:00:41.200> the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
experimenting moving up and down the

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:51.450 
experimenting moving up and down the
neck<00:00:41.410> I<00:00:41.800> can<00:00:42.040> get<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.890> you<00:00:50.920> can<00:00:51.040> look<00:00:51.280> at<00:00:51.370> it

like<00:00:51.610> wow<00:00:51.880> that's<00:00:52.090> 11<00:00:52.540> different<00:00:52.840> chords<00:00:53.260> I'm

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
like wow that's 11 different chords I'm

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.160 
like wow that's 11 different chords I'm
just<00:00:54.220> thinking<00:00:54.520> in<00:00:54.640> terms<00:00:54.670> of<00:00:55.059> note<00:00:55.270> that's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
just thinking in terms of note that's

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.630 
just thinking in terms of note that's
one<00:00:56.710> chord<00:00:57.489> shape<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:59.200> bar<00:00:59.440> let's<00:01:00.400> go<00:01:00.580> to

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
one chord shape and a bar let's go to

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.480 
one chord shape and a bar let's go to
the<00:01:00.940> basic<00:01:01.360> open<00:01:01.870> position<00:01:02.350> chips<00:01:02.830> this<00:01:03.220> is<00:01:03.370> an

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
the basic open position chips this is an

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.410 
the basic open position chips this is an
E<00:01:03.640> chord<00:01:04.259> this<00:01:05.259> is<00:01:05.320> an<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.710> chord<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.390> a

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
E chord this is an a chord this is a

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.700 
E chord this is an a chord this is a
decoy<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.160> a<00:01:09.190> G<00:01:09.460> chord<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.840> is<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:11.080> sequel

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.210 

now<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.979> can<00:01:15.700> play<00:01:15.940> my<00:01:16.119> open<00:01:16.450> e<00:01:16.570> chord

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
now I can play my open e chord

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.640 
now I can play my open e chord
then<00:01:19.220> I<00:01:19.460> can<00:01:19.610> take<00:01:19.729> a<00:01:19.790> da<00:01:20.060> p--<00:01:20.380> move<00:01:21.380> it<00:01:21.500> up<00:01:21.619> to

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
then I can take a da p-- move it up to

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.320 
then I can take a da p-- move it up to
the<00:01:21.830> fourth<00:01:22.100> fret<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.430> here<00:01:22.790> I'm<00:01:22.909> using<00:01:22.939> my

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
the fourth fret and here I'm using my

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.149 
the fourth fret and here I'm using my
pinky<00:01:23.570> on<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:23.960> fourth<00:01:24.920> string<00:01:25.220> as<00:01:25.430> well

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
pinky on the fourth string as well

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.630 
pinky on the fourth string as well
that's<00:01:28.159> an<00:01:28.369> E<00:01:28.490> chord<00:01:28.520> I<00:01:30.040> could<00:01:31.040> bar<00:01:31.280> all<00:01:31.610> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
that's an E chord I could bar all the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.870 
that's an E chord I could bar all the
way<00:01:31.850> across<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.869> fourth<00:01:33.170> fret<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:36.640> that's<00:01:37.640> an

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
way across the fourth fret and that's an

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.800 
way across the fourth fret and that's an
AC<00:01:38.090> shape<00:01:41.380> but<00:01:42.380> it's<00:01:42.530> an<00:01:42.680> E<00:01:42.860> chord<00:01:42.890> I<00:01:43.659> can<00:01:44.659> play

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
AC shape but it's an E chord I can play

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.469 
AC shape but it's an E chord I can play
an<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:45.110> shape<00:01:45.700> at<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.850> seventh<00:01:47.210> fret<00:01:49.210> that's<00:01:50.210> an

twelfth fret so with a little

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.740 
twelfth fret so with a little
experimentation<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:03.610> can<00:02:04.610> find<00:02:07.750> different

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
experimentation I can find different

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.389 
experimentation I can find different
voicings<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.350> different<00:02:09.619> melodies<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.280> I

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
voicings and different melodies and I

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.550 
voicings and different melodies and I
can<00:02:10.519> kind<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.759> lose<00:02:10.970> my<00:02:11.209> phobia<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.930> moving<00:02:12.440> up

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
can kind of lose my phobia of moving up

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.490 
can kind of lose my phobia of moving up
and<00:02:12.680> down<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.980> neck<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:14.049> can<00:02:15.049> do<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.260> same
