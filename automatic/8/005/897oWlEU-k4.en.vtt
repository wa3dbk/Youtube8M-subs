 magic knowledge gaining strength in 1 but on 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:54.119
 Malygos was killed during the war for the nexus 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:57.879
 a colleague should take his place 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.039
 neltarion black dragon was gifted to with

 garro there and became the guardian of the whole earth 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.020
 endowing dragons with enough power 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.310
 to guard Azeroth forever 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.929
 titan forever left the created world 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.090
 these five dragons should have been 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.879
 maintain important parts of the world 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.840
 Azeroth successful than they did in 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.510
 legs melikah 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.489
 everything changed with the arrival in azerot 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.510
 blazing legion because of witchcraft 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.040
 night elves above the source of eternity 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.000
 then came the key moment in history 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.390
 Azeroth 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.890
 and the dragon could not stand aside to 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.739
 same precisely in this temporary 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.739
 span dragons aspects lost two 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.690
 his strongest fellow 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.299
 neltarion was completely enslaved by will 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.920
 ancient gods and began to bear destruction and 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.930
 death he called himself deathlord 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.970
 the first target of the deathwing was blue 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.799
 a pack of dragons that belonged 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.250
 aspect of the malicos magic 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.250
 in the end, these two flocks you were and the battle 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.200
 against the flaming legion 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.299
 after the death of the deathwing rest 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.549
 aspects decided their great power 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.750
 they became just big dragons 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:13.510
 same as others of them worth 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.040
 information galakrond was one of the first 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.660
 dragon brother dragon created by the titans 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.269
 maybe their plans were to make it 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.700
 one aspect but ultimately he 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.319
 they did not 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.959
 literally known that galakrond not 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.670
 belonged to none of the secrets because 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.780
 division by 100 and occurred after 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.060
 appearance of aspects and the holocron was previously 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.819
 it is also likely that the dragon decided 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.980
 die where their ancestor died creating 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.099
 so some holy place 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.099
 dragon dwelling temple instead tips 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.250
 representatives 500 is nearby 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.459
 from the burial place holocron having given 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.349
 lich king 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.569
 known for his love of resurrection 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.459
 dead shortly before his death 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.910
 created a new undead 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.650
 single snakes ice snakes skeletons 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.870
 dead dragons were created 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.030
 not even the ground forces of the alliance and the horde 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.560
 as well as for the battle with air 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.870
 alliance and horde troops 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.720
 who could calmly bombard 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.639
 lash troops from the air 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.919
 when did the lich king recognize holocron de 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.639
 he sent the power of the faithful nekra lord 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.000
 antelope 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.520
 for his resurrection if he were resurrected 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.550
 like the obedient slave of the lich king all 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.919
 attempts of joint forces of the horde and alliance 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.050
 would have suffered a defeat but the king 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.289
 lich could finally get rid of 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.960
 disturbing aspects of him on the queen 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.870
 dragons Alekstrasza in time prevented 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.539
 and he suffered the crown went to the land of 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.600
 rumored bones that had time to open works 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.850
 whip only the tip of the iceberg itself 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.949
 in fact, the whole dragon churchyard covers 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.880
