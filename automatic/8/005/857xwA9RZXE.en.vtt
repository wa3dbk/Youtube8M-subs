can<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:14.480> believe<00:02:14.569> that's<00:02:14.780> all<00:02:15.110> just<00:02:15.319> eight

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
can you believe that's all just eight

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.619 
can you believe that's all just eight
licks<00:02:15.980> just<00:02:16.459> puttin<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.970> different<00:02:17.299> orders

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
licks just puttin in different orders

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.440 
licks just puttin in different orders
that's<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:18.620> whole<00:02:19.400> key<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.909> bag<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.239> licks

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
that's the whole key to the bag of licks

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.369 
that's the whole key to the bag of licks
lesson<00:02:21.280> idea<00:02:22.280> is<00:02:22.549> that<00:02:23.180> we<00:02:23.330> learn<00:02:23.629> some<00:02:24.170> licks

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
lesson idea is that we learn some licks

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.979 
lesson idea is that we learn some licks
and<00:02:24.680> different<00:02:25.069> keys<00:02:25.390> over<00:02:26.390> different<00:02:26.569> chords

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
and different keys over different chords

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.780 
and different keys over different chords
then<00:02:27.440> we<00:02:27.560> learn<00:02:27.799> how<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.010> enter<00:02:28.280> change<00:02:28.580> them

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
then we learn how to enter change them

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.670 
then we learn how to enter change them
and<00:02:28.940> essentially<00:02:29.750> learn<00:02:29.930> how<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.140> improvise

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
and essentially learn how to improvise

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.580 
and essentially learn how to improvise
by<00:02:31.129> grabbing<00:02:31.780> reaching<00:02:32.780> into<00:02:33.079> our<00:02:33.200> bag<00:02:33.440> of

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
by grabbing reaching into our bag of

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.190 
by grabbing reaching into our bag of
licks<00:02:33.799> and<00:02:34.010> putting<00:02:34.400> licks<00:02:34.610> back<00:02:34.879> to<00:02:35.030> back<00:02:35.209> to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
licks and putting licks back to back to

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.839 
licks and putting licks back to back to
fit<00:02:36.680> whatever<00:02:36.890> chord<00:02:37.280> progression<00:02:37.730> we're

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
fit whatever chord progression we're

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.490 
fit whatever chord progression we're
playing<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.599> so<00:02:38.959> what<00:02:39.079> we're<00:02:39.230> going<00:02:39.349> to<00:02:39.379> do

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
playing in and so what we're going to do

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.350 
playing in and so what we're going to do
is<00:02:39.709> learn<00:02:40.069> each<00:02:40.400> one<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.760> these<00:02:40.819> licks<00:02:41.090> and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
is learn each one of these licks and

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.330 
is learn each one of these licks and
play<00:02:41.540> them<00:02:41.690> slowly<00:02:41.959> for<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.349> first<00:02:42.680> then<00:02:43.190> I'll

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
play them slowly for you first then I'll

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.860 
play them slowly for you first then I'll
teach<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.640> exactly<00:02:43.730> how<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.329> play<00:02:44.569> them<00:02:44.750> and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
teach you exactly how to play them and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.300 
teach you exactly how to play them and
then<00:02:45.530> I've<00:02:45.739> got<00:02:45.920> three<00:02:46.190> different

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
then I've got three different

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.339 
then I've got three different
combinations<00:02:47.299> where<00:02:47.780> we'll<00:02:47.989> learn<00:02:48.109> how<00:02:48.170> to

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
combinations where we'll learn how to

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.900 
combinations where we'll learn how to
put<00:02:48.620> these<00:02:48.709> together<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.459> that's<00:02:49.700> really

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
put these together and that's really

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.039 
put these together and that's really
where<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.150> learning<00:02:50.359> takes<00:02:50.660> place<00:02:50.750> because

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
where the learning takes place because

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.479 
where the learning takes place because
we<00:02:51.200> learned<00:02:51.410> how<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.560> apply<00:02:51.769> what<00:02:52.069> we've

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
we learned how to apply what we've

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.910 
we learned how to apply what we've
learned<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:53.120> then<00:02:53.780> also<00:02:54.440> if<00:02:54.530> you're<00:02:54.709> a<00:02:54.739> member

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
learned and then also if you're a member

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.640 
learned and then also if you're a member

to have rhythm tracks up for you on the
guitar<00:03:02.900> where<00:03:03.079> I<00:03:03.109> just<00:03:03.230> play<00:03:05.769> three<00:03:06.769> different

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
guitar where I just play three different

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.410 
guitar where I just play three different
speeds<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:07.640> play<00:03:07.819> through<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.060> like<00:03:08.180> three

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
speeds and I play through it like three

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.839 
speeds and I play through it like three
times<00:03:08.690> at<00:03:08.989> each<00:03:09.019> speed<00:03:09.409> and<00:03:09.739> you're<00:03:10.519> able<00:03:10.819> to

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
times at each speed and you're able to

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.319 
times at each speed and you're able to
take<00:03:11.090> on<00:03:11.329> these<00:03:12.200> licks<00:03:13.129> which<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:13.819> get<00:03:14.030> off

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
take on these licks which you get off

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.099 
take on these licks which you get off

the tab on my website and put them into
practice<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.280> learn<00:03:19.730> how<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:19.940> play<00:03:20.269> those<00:03:20.540> so

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
practice and learn how to play those so

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.780 
practice and learn how to play those so
the<00:03:21.230> next<00:03:21.410> time<00:03:21.590> you're<00:03:21.739> in<00:03:21.769> a<00:03:21.859> jam<00:03:22.099> situation

the next time you're in a jam situation

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.099 
the next time you're in a jam situation
or<00:03:23.000> playing<00:03:23.180> situation<00:03:23.720> you're<00:03:23.810> going<00:03:23.959> to

of C man you've got a wealth of

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.509 
of C man you've got a wealth of
information<00:03:29.720> here<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.530> pull<00:03:30.709> from<00:03:30.919> I<00:03:31.190> want<00:03:31.400> to

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
information here to pull from I want to

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.949 
information here to pull from I want to
play<00:03:31.639> the<00:03:31.760> ceiling<00:03:32.150> number<00:03:32.419> one<00:03:32.599> for<00:03:32.870> you

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
play the ceiling number one for you

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.900 
play the ceiling number one for you
slowly<00:03:33.379> from<00:03:33.859> start<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.280> finish<00:03:34.310> it's<00:03:34.700> two

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
slowly from start to finish it's two

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.420 
slowly from start to finish it's two
measures<00:03:35.239> long<00:03:35.419> and<00:03:35.750> then<00:03:36.500> we'll<00:03:36.739> we'll<00:03:37.220> dive

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
measures long and then we'll we'll dive

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.869 
measures long and then we'll we'll dive
in<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:37.970> learn<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:39.079> note<00:03:39.349> for<00:03:39.379> note<00:03:39.669> first<00:03:40.669> one

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
in and learn it note for note first one

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:53.070 
in and learn it note for note first one
sounds<00:03:41.239> like<00:03:41.389> this<00:03:41.599> their<00:03:41.989> measure<00:03:42.230> one

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.150 

pretty<00:03:54.080> straightforward<00:03:54.680> it's<00:03:54.830> really

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
pretty straightforward it's really

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.730 
pretty straightforward it's really
scaler<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.450> lot<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.630> these<00:03:56.810> licks<00:03:57.140> are<00:03:57.380> very

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
scaler and a lot of these licks are very

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.480 
scaler and a lot of these licks are very
scale<00:03:58.520> based<00:03:58.820> there's<00:03:59.120> not<00:03:59.300> a<00:03:59.330> lot<00:03:59.570> of<00:04:00.490> jumping

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
scale based there's not a lot of jumping

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.280 
scale based there's not a lot of jumping
around<00:04:01.640> like<00:04:02.210> we've<00:04:02.390> done<00:04:02.510> bag<00:04:02.810> of<00:04:02.960> licks<00:04:03.110> in

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
around like we've done bag of licks in

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.190 
around like we've done bag of licks in
the<00:04:03.320> past<00:04:04.240> so<00:04:05.240> we're<00:04:05.660> going<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.840> start<00:04:06.080> down

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
we're going to be bending this string up

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.030 
we're going to be bending this string up
this<00:06:07.330> way<00:06:07.570> okay<00:06:08.080> it's<00:06:08.590> really<00:06:08.740> tough

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
this way okay it's really tough

this way okay it's really tough
especially<00:06:09.250> if<00:06:09.580> you're<00:06:09.729> playing<00:06:09.910> medium

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
especially if you're playing medium

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.719 
especially if you're playing medium

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
gauge strings which I like to do that

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.750 
gauge strings which I like to do that
with<00:06:12.970> one<00:06:13.270> finger<00:06:13.540> okay<00:06:14.350> so<00:06:14.889> what<00:06:15.400> I<00:06:15.430> like<00:06:15.639> to

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
with one finger okay so what I like to

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.790 
with one finger okay so what I like to
do<00:06:15.850> is<00:06:16.030> Paulo<00:06:16.389> on<00:06:16.660> this<00:06:16.870> middle<00:06:17.080> finger<00:06:17.229> behind

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
do is Paulo on this middle finger behind

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.110 
do is Paulo on this middle finger behind
it<00:06:17.979> on<00:06:18.100> the<00:06:18.220> third<00:06:18.400> fret<00:06:18.430> and<00:06:18.699> we're<00:06:18.940> going<00:06:19.060> to

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
it on the third fret and we're going to

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.850 
it on the third fret and we're going to
use<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.360> power<00:06:19.539> of<00:06:19.780> both<00:06:19.990> of<00:06:20.229> those<00:06:20.350> fingers

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
use the power of both of those fingers

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.310 
use the power of both of those fingers
to<00:06:21.039> press<00:06:21.580> up<00:06:21.850> on<00:06:22.060> this<00:06:22.180> band<00:06:22.479> this<00:06:23.020> whole

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
to press up on this band this whole

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:31.120 
to press up on this band this whole
ceiling<00:06:24.160> number<00:06:24.520> two<00:06:24.669> sounds<00:06:25.000> like<00:06:25.120> this

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.730 

-<00:06:31.700> so<00:06:32.420> those<00:06:32.570> are<00:06:32.720> all<00:06:32.870> quarter<00:06:33.290> notes<00:06:33.470> there

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
- so those are all quarter notes there

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.950 
- so those are all quarter notes there
in<00:06:33.950> measure<00:06:34.220> 4<00:06:34.580> meaning<00:06:35.060> they<00:06:35.240> all<00:06:35.390> get<00:06:35.630> one

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
in measure 4 meaning they all get one

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.170 
in measure 4 meaning they all get one
beat<00:06:36.200> apiece<00:06:36.530> okay<00:06:37.250> so<00:06:37.310> they're<00:06:37.610> slower<00:06:37.910> than

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
beat apiece okay so they're slower than

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.280 
beat apiece okay so they're slower than
the<00:06:38.270> rest<00:06:38.420> of<00:06:38.540> these<00:06:38.630> eighth<00:06:38.870> notes<00:06:39.140> and

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
the rest of these eighth notes and

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:45.160 
the rest of these eighth notes and
they're<00:06:39.590> all<00:06:39.740> downstrokes<00:06:40.280> so<00:06:40.970> bend<00:06:41.410> open<00:06:44.170> and

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
they're all downstrokes so bend open and

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.990 
they're all downstrokes so bend open and
you<00:06:45.320> can<00:06:45.440> choose<00:06:45.710> whether<00:06:45.920> to<00:06:46.070> keep<00:06:46.730> that

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
you can choose whether to keep that

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.330 
you can choose whether to keep that
bending<00:06:47.450> note<00:06:47.770> sustaining<00:06:48.770> through<00:06:48.950> the<00:06:49.040> open

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
bending note sustaining through the open

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.190 
bending note sustaining through the open
strings<00:06:49.640> it<00:06:49.880> it<00:06:50.300> creates<00:06:50.690> a<00:06:50.810> little<00:06:50.960> bit<00:06:51.110> of

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
strings it it creates a little bit of

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.570 
strings it it creates a little bit of
dissonance<00:06:51.650> there

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.460 

kind<00:06:54.819> of<00:06:54.909> cool<00:06:55.120> or<00:06:55.419> you<00:06:55.720> can<00:06:55.870> choose<00:06:56.020> to<00:06:56.080> mute

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
kind of cool or you can choose to mute

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.670 
kind of cool or you can choose to mute
it

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680
