bossing as being pushing a paper to a
level<00:00:23.630> it<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.720> different<00:00:25.199> than<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.500> original

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
level it is different than the original

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.509 
level it is different than the original
level<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> actual<00:00:27.090> paper<00:00:28.189> both<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.400> these

level of the actual paper both of these

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.720 
level of the actual paper both of these
terms<00:00:30.090> are<00:00:30.390> used<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:32.040> conjunction<00:00:32.279> with

terms are used in conjunction with

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.229 
terms are used in conjunction with
offset<00:00:33.360> and/or<00:00:34.050> digital<00:00:34.559> printing<00:00:35.239> it's

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
offset and/or digital printing it's

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.030 
offset and/or digital printing it's
basically<00:00:36.899> done<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> die<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
basically done with the die and a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.510 
basically done with the die and a
counter<00:00:38.430> die<00:00:38.600> this<00:00:39.600> would<00:00:39.870> be<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> die<00:00:40.520> this

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
counter die this would be a die this

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.000 
counter die this would be a die this
would<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> counter<00:00:42.390> die<00:00:42.600> these<00:00:43.590> two

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
would be the counter die these two

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.930 
would be the counter die these two
things<00:00:44.399> fit<00:00:44.910> inside<00:00:45.480> each<00:00:45.690> other<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:47.579> paper

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
things fit inside each other the paper

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
things fit inside each other the paper
is<00:00:48.270> actually<00:00:48.690> squeezed<00:00:49.530> between<00:00:50.340> them<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.710> we

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
is actually squeezed between them and we

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.799 
is actually squeezed between them and we
apply<00:00:53.280> heat<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:56.129> die<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.430> mounted<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.360> on

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
apply heat the die is mounted on the on

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.330 
apply heat the die is mounted on the on
the<00:00:58.050> platen<00:00:59.600> counter<00:01:00.600> dies<00:01:01.010> mounted<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the platen counter dies mounted on the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.820 
the platen counter dies mounted on the
opposite<00:01:02.789> platen<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.350> machine

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
opposite platen and this machine

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.200 
opposite platen and this machine
basically<00:01:05.250> sits<00:01:06.000> there<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:07.729> opens<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.970> shuts

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
basically sits there and opens and shuts

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.999 
basically sits there and opens and shuts
it's<00:01:09.830> basically<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.950> clam<00:01:11.340> shell<00:01:11.369> type<00:01:12.060> press

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.590 

embossing<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.280> basically<00:01:18.229> where<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:20.600> push

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
embossing is basically where you push

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.010 
embossing is basically where you push
the<00:01:22.229> level<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.340> image<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:24.119> above<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the level of the image up above the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.880 
the level of the image up above the
original<00:01:25.590> level<00:01:25.920> level<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.939> paper<00:01:27.210> so

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
original level level of the paper so

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.260 
original level level of the paper so
embossing<00:01:28.890> another<00:01:29.460> way<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> look<00:01:29.939> at<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
embossing another way to look at it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300 
embossing another way to look at it
would<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.350> walking<00:01:31.590> along<00:01:32.040> on

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
would be is if you're walking along on

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.679 
would be is if you're walking along on
the<00:01:32.430> ground<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.210> sudden<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.570> have

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the ground and all of a sudden you have

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.490 
the ground and all of a sudden you have
to<00:01:33.750> step<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.380> that's<00:01:35.250> embossing<00:01:36.060> D<00:01:36.930> bossing

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
to step up that's embossing D bossing

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.980 
to step up that's embossing D bossing
would<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.460> where<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> die<00:01:39.360> actually

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
would be is is where the die actually

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.740 
would be is is where the die actually
pushes<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.500> image<00:01:41.009> down<00:01:41.369> below<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.270> original

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
pushes the image down below the original

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.840 
pushes the image down below the original
surface<00:01:43.590> image<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> pie

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
surface image of the pie

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.469 
surface image of the pie
so<00:01:45.180> again<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:46.380> uses<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> terms<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:48.150> you're

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
so again in uses of the terms if you're

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.750 
so again in uses of the terms if you're
walking<00:01:48.840> along<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.800> of<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> sudden<00:01:50.040> fell<00:01:50.580> in

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
walking along all of a sudden fell in

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.200 
walking along all of a sudden fell in
the<00:01:50.850> hole<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.479> Dee<00:01:51.840> bossing<00:01:52.760> we<00:01:53.760> do<00:01:53.970> this

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the hole that's Dee bossing we do this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.890 
the hole that's Dee bossing we do this
by<00:01:54.540> uses<00:01:55.080> of<00:01:55.229> dyes<00:01:56.060> again<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.330> is<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.720> dye

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
by uses of dyes again this is the dye

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.170 
by uses of dyes again this is the dye
and<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> counter<00:01:58.650> dye<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.310> that's<00:01:59.850> what's

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
and the counter dye and that's what's

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.480 
and the counter dye and that's what's
going<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.510> raise<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.260> lower<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.860> image<00:02:02.250> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
going to raise or lower the image that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.040 
going to raise or lower the image that
we're<00:02:02.700> using<00:02:02.970> on<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.479> sheet<00:02:04.040> there<00:02:05.040> are

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
we're using on the sheet there are

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.749 
we're using on the sheet there are
different<00:02:07.050> materials<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.039> use<00:02:08.280> in

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
different materials that we can use in

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.999 
different materials that we can use in
the<00:02:08.850> dyes<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:09.810> actually<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.320> brass<00:02:10.619> dye

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the dyes this is actually a brass dye

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.720 
the dyes this is actually a brass dye
this<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.640> by<00:02:11.820> far<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.209> most<00:02:12.390> durable<00:02:13.550> also<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
this is by far the most durable also the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.630 
this is by far the most durable also the
last<00:02:15.000> longest<00:02:15.840> you're<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.680> use<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.340> if

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
last longest you're going to use this if

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.440 
last longest you're going to use this if
you're<00:02:17.910> doing<00:02:18.090> multi-level<00:02:19.190> if<00:02:20.190> you're<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:21.270> a

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
you're doing multi-level if you're in a

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.970 
you're doing multi-level if you're in a
situation<00:02:21.720> where<00:02:22.350> you're<00:02:22.500> going<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.709> be<00:02:22.800> doing

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
situation where you're going to be doing

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.890 
situation where you're going to be doing
something<00:02:23.400> over<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.000> over<00:02:24.360> or<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.870> know

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
something over and over or you know

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.479 
something over and over or you know
long-run<00:02:27.020> brass<00:02:28.020> would<00:02:28.470> be<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.770> next<00:02:29.100> level

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
long-run brass would be the next level

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.120 
long-run brass would be the next level
and<00:02:29.790> I'm<00:02:29.940> sorry<00:02:30.480> copper<00:02:31.380> would<00:02:31.530> be<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.830> next

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
and I'm sorry copper would be the next

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.960 
and I'm sorry copper would be the next
level<00:02:32.520> down<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.350> less<00:02:34.650> expensive<00:02:34.890> will<00:02:35.790> not

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
level down it is less expensive will not

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.900 
level down it is less expensive will not
stand<00:02:36.420> up<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:37.010> quite<00:02:38.010> as<00:02:38.190> many<00:02:38.430> impressions

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
stand up to quite as many impressions

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.160 
stand up to quite as many impressions
but<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.630> still<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> pretty<00:02:40.170> durable<00:02:40.880> type<00:02:41.880> dye

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
but it's still a pretty durable type dye

but it's still a pretty durable type dye
the<00:02:43.220> dye<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.730> could<00:02:44.880> use<00:02:45.209> first<00:02:45.660> you

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
the dye that you could use first you

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.380 
the dye that you could use first you
know<00:02:46.110> shorter<00:02:46.560> run<00:02:46.769> type<00:02:47.160> things<00:02:47.550> is<00:02:48.330> a

know shorter run type things is a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
magnesium dye you're only going to be

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.160 
magnesium dye you're only going to be
able<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.269> do<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.480> single<00:02:51.870> level<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:54.780> going

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
able to do a single level and it's going

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.530 
able to do a single level and it's going
to<00:02:55.230> be<00:02:55.380> more<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:56.549> use<00:02:56.880> type<00:02:57.269> dye<00:02:59.299> we<00:03:00.299> do

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
to be more of a one use type dye we do

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.199 
to be more of a one use type dye we do
this<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.230> heard<00:03:01.650> me<00:03:01.799> talk<00:03:02.010> about<00:03:02.040> multi<00:03:02.850> level

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
this you heard me talk about multi level

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.900 
this you heard me talk about multi level
and<00:03:03.360> single<00:03:03.840> level<00:03:04.049> multi<00:03:04.650> level<00:03:05.070> would<00:03:05.190> be<00:03:05.250> if

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
and single level multi level would be if

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.360 
and single level multi level would be if
you're<00:03:06.510> actually<00:03:06.930> trying<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.290> do<00:03:07.500> say<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.829> 3d

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you're actually trying to do say a 3d

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.430 
you're actually trying to do say a 3d
image<00:03:08.579> like<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.360> you're<00:03:09.630> trying<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.079> emboss

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
image like if you're trying to emboss

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.880 
image like if you're trying to emboss
somebody's<00:03:11.220> face<00:03:11.660> you<00:03:12.660> want<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.110> nose<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.709> be

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
somebody's face you want the nose to be

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.270 
somebody's face you want the nose to be
one<00:03:14.190> level<00:03:14.489> cheeks<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.420> be<00:03:15.450> another<00:03:15.950> ears<00:03:16.950> to

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
one level cheeks to be another ears to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.460 
one level cheeks to be another ears to
be<00:03:17.400> another<00:03:17.670> level<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.299> that<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.200> see

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
be another level so that you can see

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.490 
be another level so that you can see
that<00:03:19.709> 3d<00:03:20.250> look<00:03:20.280> effect<00:03:21.000> that's<00:03:21.510> multi<00:03:22.140> level

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
that 3d look effect that's multi level

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.490 
that 3d look effect that's multi level
single<00:03:23.400> level<00:03:23.760> would<00:03:24.120> be<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.570> is<00:03:24.780> if<00:03:24.930> we<00:03:25.230> let's

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
single level would be is is if we let's

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.140 
single level would be is is if we let's
say<00:03:25.739> for<00:03:26.010> instance<00:03:26.040> we<00:03:26.430> were<00:03:26.670> trying<00:03:27.000> to

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
say for instance we were trying to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.729 
say for instance we were trying to
enforce<00:03:27.480> just<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:28.049> line<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.500> type<00:03:28.860> or<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.640> logo<00:03:30.299> on

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
enforce just a line of type or a logo on

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.229 
enforce just a line of type or a logo on
and<00:03:31.739> we're<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:31.950> trying<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.549> raise<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:33.060> up<00:03:33.180> to

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
and we're just trying to raise it up to

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.800 
and we're just trying to raise it up to
one<00:03:33.660> level<00:03:34.459> we<00:03:35.459> also<00:03:35.640> use<00:03:36.120> heat<00:03:36.510> in

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
one level we also use heat in

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.310 
one level we also use heat in
conjunction<00:03:37.620> with<00:03:37.860> embossing<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.730> embossing

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
conjunction with embossing and embossing

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.259 
conjunction with embossing and embossing
that's<00:03:40.320> used<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.190> basically<00:03:41.430> we<00:03:42.000> can

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
that's used so that basically we can

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.400 
that's used so that basically we can
iron<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:43.519> texture<00:03:44.519> of<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.880> paper<00:03:45.120> out<00:03:45.690> to

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
iron the texture of the paper out to

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.559 
iron the texture of the paper out to
where<00:03:46.560> we've<00:03:46.769> got<00:03:46.980> more<00:03:47.250> contrast<00:03:48.030> but

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
where we've got more contrast but

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.800 
where we've got more contrast but
the<00:03:49.990> actual<00:03:50.500> original<00:03:51.430> level<00:03:52.270> of<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.540> paper

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
the actual original level of the paper

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.210 
the actual original level of the paper
and<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.530> embossed<00:03:53.860> or<00:03:54.220> de-bossed<00:03:54.730> level

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
and the embossed or de-bossed level

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.860 
and the embossed or de-bossed level
talking<00:03:57.220> about<00:03:57.459> papers<00:03:58.060> there's<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.390> couple<00:03:58.690> of

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
talking about papers there's a couple of

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.300 
talking about papers there's a couple of
types<00:03:59.170> of<00:03:59.470> papers<00:03:59.950> that<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:00.730> we<00:04:00.940> will<00:04:01.120> use

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
types of papers that that we will use

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.340 
types of papers that that we will use
you<00:04:03.310> have<00:04:03.459> coated<00:04:03.819> and<00:04:04.180> uncoated<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:05.200> there

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
you have coated and uncoated and there

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.350 
you have coated and uncoated and there
are<00:04:05.410> some<00:04:05.590> considerations<00:04:06.010> that<00:04:06.670> you<00:04:06.940> need<00:04:07.180> to

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
are some considerations that you need to

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.610 
are some considerations that you need to
use<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:07.959> in<00:04:08.170> both<00:04:08.980> those<00:04:09.280> papers<00:04:09.850> uncoated<00:04:10.620> it

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
use and in both those papers uncoated it

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.100 
use and in both those papers uncoated it
has<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:11.890> clay<00:04:12.370> coating<00:04:12.940> you're<00:04:13.510> not<00:04:13.690> going<00:04:13.990> to

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
has a clay coating you're not going to

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.380 
has a clay coating you're not going to
be<00:04:14.260> able<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:15.010> emboss<00:04:15.430> quite<00:04:16.030> as<00:04:16.209> deeply<00:04:17.040> and

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
be able to emboss quite as deeply and

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.840 
be able to emboss quite as deeply and
basically<00:04:19.390> what<00:04:19.570> it<00:04:19.690> means<00:04:19.720> is<00:04:20.260> is<00:04:20.620> that

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
basically what it means is is that

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.260 
basically what it means is is that
before<00:04:21.850> you<00:04:23.310> actually<00:04:24.310> cut<00:04:24.790> through<00:04:25.120> that

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
before you actually cut through that

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.780 
before you actually cut through that
clay<00:04:25.600> coating<00:04:26.169> you've<00:04:27.010> got<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.370> keep<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.730> a

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
clay coating you've got to keep it a

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.080 
clay coating you've got to keep it a
lower<00:04:28.000> level<00:04:28.390> on<00:04:28.750> uncoated<00:04:29.470> paper<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:30.880> can

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
lower level on uncoated paper you can

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.180 
lower level on uncoated paper you can
emboss<00:04:31.360> much<00:04:31.810> deeper<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.620> can<00:04:32.770> do<00:04:32.950> more

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
emboss much deeper you can do more

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.560 
emboss much deeper you can do more
multi-level<00:04:34.150> type<00:04:34.830> embossing<00:04:36.180> back<00:04:37.180> kind<00:04:37.480> of

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
multi-level type embossing back kind of

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.000 
multi-level type embossing back kind of
things<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:38.260> have<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.530> lot<00:04:38.770> more

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
things so you have a lot more

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.490 
things so you have a lot more
flexibility<00:04:39.730> on<00:04:39.970> an<00:04:40.090> uncoated<00:04:40.540> or<00:04:40.840> a<00:04:40.900> textured

flexibility on an uncoated or a textured

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.790
