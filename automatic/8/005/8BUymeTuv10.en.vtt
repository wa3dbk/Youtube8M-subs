00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
ingredients sure well let's start with

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.330 
ingredients sure well let's start with
the<00:00:57.539> design<00:00:57.870> well<00:00:58.170> first<00:00:58.379> off<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:59.070> phones

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
the design well first off the two phones

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.119 
the design well first off the two phones
are<00:00:59.579> called<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.329> Xperia<00:01:00.840> Z<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> Xperia<00:01:01.890> Z

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
are called the Xperia Z and the Xperia Z

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.179 
are called the Xperia Z and the Xperia Z
L<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> Z<00:01:03.570> Z<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> Z<00:01:05.040> L

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
L so this is the Z Z and this is the Z L

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
L so this is the Z Z and this is the Z L
okay<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:06.150> share<00:01:06.450> much<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.200> common<00:01:07.470> but

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
okay and they share much in common but

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.010 
okay and they share much in common but
the<00:01:08.250> main<00:01:08.460> thing<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.700> separates<00:01:09.540> them<00:01:09.780> is

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the main thing that separates them is

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.469 
the main thing that separates them is
design<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.890> let's<00:01:11.100> first<00:01:11.369> focus<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
design but let's first focus here on the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.760 
design but let's first focus here on the
Xperia<00:01:12.930> Z<00:01:13.200> oK<00:01:13.560> you've<00:01:13.799> got<00:01:14.180> reflective

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
Xperia Z oK you've got reflective

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.100 
Xperia Z oK you've got reflective
surfaces<00:01:16.770> all<00:01:17.070> around<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
surfaces all around it so you have that

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.249 
surfaces all around it so you have that
what<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.380> call<00:01:19.610> Omni<00:01:20.610> balance<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.240> symmetry<00:01:22.049> no

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
what we call Omni balance a symmetry no

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.570 
what we call Omni balance a symmetry no
matter<00:01:22.409> which<00:01:22.619> angle<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.040> look<00:01:23.220> at<00:01:23.369> you're

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
matter which angle you look at you're

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
matter which angle you look at you're
gonna<00:01:23.640> see<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> smooth<00:01:24.360> reflective<00:01:25.020> surface<00:01:25.470> on

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
gonna see a smooth reflective surface on

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
gonna see a smooth reflective surface on
the<00:01:26.100> front<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.549> back<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.030> edges<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.140> it's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the front the back of the edges but it's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.319 
the front the back of the edges but it's
also<00:01:28.650> durable<00:01:29.220> too<00:01:29.460> because<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.119> has

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
also durable too because this has

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.359 
also durable too because this has
strengthened<00:01:30.930> tempered<00:01:31.350> glass<00:01:31.500> okay<00:01:32.100> in

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
strengthened tempered glass okay in

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.270 
strengthened tempered glass okay in
addition<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:33.439> water-resistant<00:01:34.439> too<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
addition it's water-resistant too so you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.160 
addition it's water-resistant too so you
can<00:01:35.579> take<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.970> phone<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.720> dunk<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.079> in

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
can take this phone you can dunk it in

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.410 
can take this phone you can dunk it in
water<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.130> 30<00:01:38.490> minutes<00:01:38.579> at<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> depth<00:01:39.270> of

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
definitely accidentally know it's waters
not<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.500> scuba<00:01:43.740> diving<00:01:44.130> foam<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:44.909> if

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
not your scuba diving foam but but if

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
not your scuba diving foam but but if
you<00:01:45.149> drop<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> water<00:01:46.079> or<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.740> get

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you drop it in the water or you get

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.380 
you drop it in the water or you get
caught<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> rain<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:48.060> gonna<00:01:48.210> perform

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
caught in the rain it's gonna perform

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.569 
caught in the rain it's gonna perform
just<00:01:48.810> fine<00:01:48.930> okay<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.159> what<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
just fine okay and then so what is the

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.819 
just fine okay and then so what is the
difference<00:01:50.820> between<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.149> Z<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> Z<00:01:51.960> well

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
difference between the Z and the Z well

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.770 
difference between the Z and the Z well
the<00:01:53.009> Z<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> Z<00:01:53.820> L<00:01:53.970> both<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> five

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the Z and the Z L both have the five

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.060 
the Z and the Z L both have the five
inch<00:01:55.049> screen<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.439> we'll<00:01:55.560> talk<00:01:55.710> about<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
inch screen and we'll talk about the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.039 
inch screen and we'll talk about the
screen<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.549> second<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> main<00:01:57.329> thing<00:01:57.600> as

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
screen in a second but the main thing as

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.620 
screen in a second but the main thing as
far<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> form<00:01:58.979> factor<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.610> this<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
far as the form factor is this is the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.530 
far as the form factor is this is the
most<00:02:00.750> compact<00:02:01.320> 5<00:02:01.860> inch<00:02:02.070> screen<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
most compact 5 inch screen so it's a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.030 
most compact 5 inch screen so it's a
little<00:02:03.659> smaller<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> dimensions<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
little smaller in the dimensions in the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.860 
little smaller in the dimensions in the
height<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.030> width<00:02:06.210> okay<00:02:07.110> yeah

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
height and the width okay yeah

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.390 
height and the width okay yeah
it's<00:02:08.260> subtle<00:02:08.590> but<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:08.800> can<00:02:08.950> really<00:02:09.100> see<00:02:09.310> it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
it's subtle but you can really see it

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
it's subtle but you can really see it
with<00:02:09.520> they're<00:02:09.640> right<00:02:09.790> next<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.119> each<00:02:10.300> other

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
with they're right next to each other

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.660 
with they're right next to each other
now<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.320> experience<00:02:11.740> Z<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.160> all<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.490> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
now the experience Z is all is the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.880 
now the experience Z is all is the
thinnest<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.420> two<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.380> 7.9

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
thinnest of the two you this is 7.9

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.470 
thinnest of the two you this is 7.9
millimeters<00:02:15.490> here<00:02:15.700> okay<00:02:16.030> so<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.270> was<00:02:16.450> a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
millimeters here okay so this was a

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.150 
millimeters here okay so this was a
little<00:02:16.630> bit<00:02:16.720> thicker<00:02:17.020> but<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.440> also<00:02:17.770> rounded

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
little bit thicker but it's also rounded

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.650 
little bit thicker but it's also rounded
here<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.550> have<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.700> comfortable<00:02:19.180> feel<00:02:19.390> to

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
here so you have a comfortable feel to

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.810 
here so you have a comfortable feel to
so<00:02:20.200> it's<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.350> matter<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.650> preference<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.700> what

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
so it's a matter of preference of what

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.850 
so it's a matter of preference of what
you<00:02:21.940> like<00:02:22.090> design<00:02:22.510> wise<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.410> both<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.620> these

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
you like design wise so both of these

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.640 
you like design wise so both of these
are<00:02:23.920> 5<00:02:24.340> inch<00:02:24.670> 1080p<00:02:25.480> display<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.260> they're<00:02:26.410> full

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
are 5 inch 1080p display so they're full

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.460 
are 5 inch 1080p display so they're full
HD<00:02:27.130> but<00:02:28.000> they<00:02:28.150> also<00:02:28.360> now<00:02:28.780> have<00:02:29.050> with<00:02:29.320> that

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
HD but they also now have with that

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.560 
HD but they also now have with that
extra<00:02:29.770> Sony<00:02:30.160> ingredient<00:02:30.820> is<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.270> Mobile

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
extra Sony ingredient is the Mobile

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.840 
extra Sony ingredient is the Mobile
BRAVIA<00:02:31.750> Engine<00:02:32.140> 2<00:02:32.710> here<00:02:33.340> we're<00:02:33.640> adding

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
BRAVIA Engine 2 here we're adding

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
BRAVIA Engine 2 here we're adding
real-time<00:02:34.980> contrast<00:02:35.980> optimization<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.600> so

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
real-time contrast optimization so so

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.480 
real-time contrast optimization so so
that's<00:02:38.080> important<00:02:38.530> for<00:02:38.620> photos<00:02:39.040> right<00:02:39.280> but

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
that's important for photos right but

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.190 
that's important for photos right but
it's<00:02:39.610> but<00:02:39.820> it's<00:02:39.850> also<00:02:40.300> contributing<00:02:40.990> the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
it's but it's also contributing the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.710 
it's but it's also contributing the
greater<00:02:41.590> benefit<00:02:42.040> here<00:02:42.190> is<00:02:42.220> for<00:02:42.490> video<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.600> at

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
greater benefit here is for video so at

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.420 
greater benefit here is for video so at
30<00:02:43.960> frames<00:02:44.140> per<00:02:44.470> second<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.040> giving<00:02:45.340> you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
30 frames per second it's giving you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.730 
30 frames per second it's giving you
that<00:02:45.580> contrast<00:02:46.180> up<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.570> optimization<00:02:47.350> so

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
that contrast up to optimization so

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.290 
that contrast up to optimization so
giving<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.070> smooth<00:02:48.490> and<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.760> better<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.030> a

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
giving you smooth and a better and a

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.320 
giving you smooth and a better and a
more<00:02:49.690> beautiful<00:02:49.780> image<00:02:50.290> okay<00:02:50.740> in<00:02:51.730> addition<00:02:51.910> to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
more beautiful image okay in addition to

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.270 
more beautiful image okay in addition to
that<00:02:52.540> now<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.440> know<00:02:53.530> it's<00:02:53.770> not<00:02:53.800> just<00:02:53.920> for

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
that now that you know it's not just for

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.160 
that now that you know it's not just for
the<00:02:54.430> video<00:02:54.700> that's<00:02:55.030> inside<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.690> phone<00:02:55.930> but

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
the video that's inside the phone but

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.080 
the video that's inside the phone but
also<00:02:56.320> streaming<00:02:56.980> video<00:02:57.220> because<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.670> analyzes

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
also streaming video because it analyzes

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.390 
also streaming video because it analyzes
the<00:02:58.450> source<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:59.050> streaming<00:02:59.680> video<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.100> that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
the source of streaming video and that

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.940 
the source of streaming video and that
kind<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.700> content<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.360> say<00:03:01.540> say<00:03:02.170> for<00:03:02.410> example

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
kind of content so say say for example

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.820 
kind of content so say say for example
if<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:04.240> get<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.420> video<00:03:04.600> that's<00:03:04.990> lower<00:03:05.470> grade

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
if you get a video that's lower grade

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.860 
if you get a video that's lower grade
coming<00:03:06.070> from<00:03:06.250> YouTube<00:03:06.670> or<00:03:06.910> Facebook<00:03:07.090> it's

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
coming from YouTube or Facebook it's

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.660 
coming from YouTube or Facebook it's
gonna<00:03:07.990> kick<00:03:08.230> in<00:03:08.380> more<00:03:08.560> noise<00:03:08.770> reduction<00:03:09.160> and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
gonna kick in more noise reduction and

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.860 
gonna kick in more noise reduction and
so<00:03:09.940> tell<00:03:10.090> me<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.210> little<00:03:10.270> bit<00:03:10.420> more<00:03:10.630> about<00:03:10.750> the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
so tell me a little bit more about the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.930 
so tell me a little bit more about the
camera<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.320> this<00:03:11.440> guy<00:03:11.620> oh<00:03:11.950> that's<00:03:12.459> really<00:03:12.670> cool

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
camera on this guy oh that's really cool

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.350 
camera on this guy oh that's really cool
too

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
too

too
so<00:03:13.570> now<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:13.780> have<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.290> Exmor<00:03:14.920> RS<00:03:15.220> for<00:03:16.150> mobile

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
so now we have the Exmor RS for mobile

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.199 
so now we have the Exmor RS for mobile
okay<00:03:16.870> okay<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:17.680> now<00:03:17.950> first<00:03:18.280> off<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.970> know<00:03:19.060> it's

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
okay okay so now first off you know it's

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.000 
okay okay so now first off you know it's
the<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.600> BSI<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.110> backside<00:03:20.650> illuminated

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
the the BSI the backside illuminated

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.190 
the the BSI the backside illuminated
technology<00:03:21.700> it's<00:03:22.120> more<00:03:22.420> sensitive<00:03:22.690> than<00:03:23.170> the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
technology it's more sensitive than the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.800 
technology it's more sensitive than the
previous<00:03:23.680> generation<00:03:24.610> but<00:03:24.820> more<00:03:25.180> importantly

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
previous generation but more importantly

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.380 
previous generation but more importantly
what<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.080> kicks<00:03:26.320> in<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.650> HDR<00:03:27.280> high<00:03:27.550> dynamic

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
what it kicks in is HDR high dynamic

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.990 
what it kicks in is HDR high dynamic
range<00:03:29.110> imaging<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:30.400> you're<00:03:30.520> going<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.670> be<00:03:30.940> able

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
range imaging so you're going to be able

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.120 
range imaging so you're going to be able
to<00:03:31.180> take<00:03:31.390> notes<00:03:31.420> for<00:03:32.200> photos<00:03:32.590> but<00:03:32.620> for<00:03:33.010> video

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
to take notes for photos but for video

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.580 
to take notes for photos but for video
too<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.760> it's<00:03:34.209> taken<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.600> couple<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.989> exposures

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
too so it's taken a couple of exposures

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.830 
too so it's taken a couple of exposures
and<00:03:35.800> processing<00:03:36.520> them<00:03:36.610> together<00:03:36.820> so<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.660> get

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
and processing them together so you get

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.540 
and processing them together so you get
a<00:03:37.870> broader<00:03:38.230> contrast<00:03:38.860> range<00:03:39.070> so<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.280> can<00:03:39.430> see

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
a broader contrast range so you can see

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.010 
a broader contrast range so you can see
more<00:03:39.730> details<00:03:40.209> in<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.420> dark<00:03:40.690> in<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:40.989> light

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
more details in the dark in the light

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.310 
more details in the dark in the light
areas<00:03:41.700> video<00:03:42.700> for<00:03:43.390> video<00:03:43.660> well<00:03:43.810> it's<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.170> gets

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
areas video for video well it's it gets

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.260 
areas video for video well it's it gets
a<00:03:44.470> little<00:03:44.590> bit<00:03:44.800> technical<00:03:45.550> to<00:03:45.640> talk<00:03:45.880> about<00:03:46.150> it

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
a little bit technical to talk about it

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.670 
a little bit technical to talk about it
but<00:03:46.390> for<00:03:46.570> video<00:03:46.690> what<00:03:46.959> they're<00:03:47.110> doing<00:03:47.410> because

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
but for video what they're doing because

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.229 
but for video what they're doing because
you<00:03:47.770> have<00:03:47.860> so<00:03:48.010> many<00:03:48.100> megapixels<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:49.030> there

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
you have so many megapixels in there

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.750 
you have so many megapixels in there
with<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:49.900> with<00:03:50.440> with<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:50.800> lens<00:03:51.160> with<00:03:51.730> the

what's more important than that is we

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.670 
what's more important than that is we

happens when the screen is dark but you

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.770 
happens when the screen is dark but you

the other guys are doing both NFC and

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.779 
the other guys are doing both NFC and
you<00:05:22.180> know<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.419> Wi-Fi<00:05:23.020> technologies<00:05:23.830> are<00:05:24.220> open

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
you know the Wi-Fi technologies are open

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.420 
you know the Wi-Fi technologies are open
standards<00:05:25.419> so<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.860> know<00:05:26.949> technically

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
standards so you know technically

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.070 
standards so you know technically
speaking<00:05:27.699> yes<00:05:28.000> another<00:05:28.300> company<00:05:28.780> could<00:05:28.960> out

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
speaking yes another company could out

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.450 
speaking yes another company could out
would<00:05:29.199> come<00:05:29.410> out<00:05:29.740> with<00:05:29.860> products<00:05:30.190> that<00:05:30.340> would

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
would come out with products that would

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.700 
would come out with products that would
be<00:05:30.639> compatible<00:05:31.050> functionality<00:05:32.050> with<00:05:32.500> ours

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
be compatible functionality with ours

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.129 
be compatible functionality with ours
but<00:05:33.490> it<00:05:33.610> just<00:05:33.820> makes<00:05:34.030> sense<00:05:34.360> again<00:05:34.539> again

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
but it just makes sense again again

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.600 
but it just makes sense again again
because<00:05:35.410> of<00:05:35.440> the<00:05:35.620> breadth<00:05:35.949> of<00:05:36.160> products<00:05:36.550> that

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
because of the breadth of products that

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.719 
because of the breadth of products that
we<00:05:36.760> have<00:05:36.789> in<00:05:37.000> Sony's<00:05:37.780> expertise<00:05:38.380> and

we have in Sony's expertise and

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.400 
we have in Sony's expertise and
connectivity<00:05:39.729> between<00:05:39.880> devices<00:05:40.479> that<00:05:41.229> these

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
connectivity between devices that these

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.430 
connectivity between devices that these
are<00:05:42.250> going<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.520> work<00:05:42.669> at<00:05:43.330> their<00:05:43.570> best<00:05:43.870> so<00:05:44.260> need

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
are going to work at their best so need

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.490 
are going to work at their best so need
a<00:05:44.470> sense<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:44.949> you<00:05:45.010> guys<00:05:45.310> are<00:05:45.520> running<00:05:46.500> standard

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
a sense so you guys are running standard

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.040 
a sense so you guys are running standard
implementations<00:05:48.190> of<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.430> protocol<00:05:48.880> yes<00:05:49.360> cool

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
implementations of the protocol yes cool

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.930 
implementations of the protocol yes cool
but<00:05:50.590> with<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.830> emphasis<00:05:50.949> on<00:05:51.400> the<00:05:51.580> One<00:05:51.729> Touch

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
but with the emphasis on the One Touch

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.700 
but with the emphasis on the One Touch
connectivity<00:05:52.270> gotcha<00:05:52.960> so<00:05:53.260> it<00:05:53.320> looks<00:05:53.440> like<00:05:53.590> you

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
connectivity gotcha so it looks like you

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.649 
connectivity gotcha so it looks like you
guys<00:05:53.919> are<00:05:53.979> running<00:05:54.880> a<00:05:55.060> pretty<00:05:56.070> vanilla

as<00:06:25.450> well<00:06:25.659> so<00:06:26.020> it's<00:06:26.500> just<00:06:26.680> like<00:06:26.800> a<00:06:26.830> magic

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
the two NFC sensors they handshake and

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.279 
the two NFC sensors they handshake and
then<00:06:33.009> it<00:06:33.099> hands<00:06:33.370> it<00:06:33.550> off<00:06:33.729> to<00:06:33.759> bluetooth<00:06:34.449> for

then it hands it off to bluetooth for

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.200 
then it hands it off to bluetooth for
