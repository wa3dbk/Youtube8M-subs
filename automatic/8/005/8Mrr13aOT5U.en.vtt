00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.529
 good evening guys in the last sequence 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.599
 photographic 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.940
 we took all the phases of the thermo 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.619
 bonding and we applied it on one 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:21.060
 half of each cuff getting it 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.109
 left outside and the part 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.109
 external right 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.390
 at this point each of them must 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.410
 be paired with another layer of 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.670
 simple fabric and this step yes 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.670
 called dubbing 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.239
 to the right of the piece of fabric held 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.129
 aside after having 33 cuffs and having 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.750
 reinforced 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.879
 we draw a first line to one 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.530
 distance from the cutting edge or from the aci 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.530
 move about 2 centimeters 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.909
 this measure is not fixed but it is the minimum 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.550
 union that will then allow us to 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.960
 make a bend equal to this one 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:22.380
 in a clean and uniform way 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.280
 I'm already traced and I'm going to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.280
 check back with us 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.490
 it does not matter that it is more than 2 cm 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:44.719
 provided it is parallel thereafter 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:47.390
 then we will go to trim it we take the 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:52.119
 first postman does not matter if the right and 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.140
 left and we are going to position it 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:00.429
 right against right along the line 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.429
 just traced 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.429
 obviously this phase of asking the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.690
 maximum precision especially in the case in 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.450
 which we should work with you on 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.310
 fancy lines or paintings that need 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:19.519
 absolutely to be aligned then 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.180
 I care first of all to align 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.180
 a first corner 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:35.890
 then sliding gently I go 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.890
 to pin the second one 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.719
 check that even inside the line 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.239
 is perfectly straight in case 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.920
 the condition I love was not 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.849
 lightly with your fingers making it 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.030
 to escape and / or to return so that you can 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:03.299
 put exactly beating to 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:07.819
 folding of the derived cuff is a 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.819
 this point continues with the tapping 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.770
 and the first cuff is placed in position 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:32.909
 which I have already done but which I repeat 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:37.950
 for you it is to extend the line of 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:41.040
 actual seam as with the turn 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:47.010
 in the fabric during the stylus this 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.810
 little piece I hid not powerful 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:58.049
 then improvise in the car and well 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:04:00.870
 having already drawn attention to it is not 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:09.030
 enough to the traced one goes also 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:11.519
 4 rechecked with the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.150
 same template with the same file with 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:18.930
 which I believe is detrimental and of control that 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.870
 these should be placed exactly on 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.080
 each end of the track is 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.539
 necessary to be the same or even 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.870
 better half a millimeter per part more 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.870
 big but absolutely never smaller 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:50.180
 I proceed in the same way for the 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:53.660
 second cuff and with the script a 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.490
 this the fabric I leave two centimeters 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.009
 also for the second 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.050
 I repeat two is not fixed but it is 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.479
 simply that minimum margin 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:07.479
 indispensable that will then serve to have 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.479
 clean trimming and cutting 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:23.090
 then doing it with the tapping like 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:25.940
 done just that check inside 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:33.710
 the line is perfectly beating with 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:36.370
 the ironing line and position i 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.370
 last two stars 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.290
 at this point we are ready to sew a 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.290
 machine
