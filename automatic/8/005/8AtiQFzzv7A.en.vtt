00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.280
 eh 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.390
 male 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.010
 If you want to have a lecture on the value, be prepared to take the value because you are going to be blessed 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.460
 Well then 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:22.590
 Anime 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.820
 First of all, from greetings, this is Chirno, I've tried to participate in the contest for the first time this time, so today 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:32.070
 I will teach you how to use the perfect sniper rifle of value 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:37.019
 Favorite of sr of sr value of cz 700 is of this time will mainly use 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.480
 But there are various types of sr even though sr says 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:43.260
 Will it come 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.260
 Let 's briefly explain what kind of kind there is . 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:51.100
 First of all, I will teach you the features of cz 700 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:57.160
 This gun has two types of zoom and the first zoom display speed is also fast 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:02.230
 While most of the general of that will be described in the following, which I think in this says awp 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.380
 But the display speed of the first round of the zoom do a little slow but I'm the type of the zoom there are two even in this 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.250
 Because there is a little habit 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.250
 It may take time to get used to 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.870
 Next, I will explain a gun called Dragnoff svd 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:17.650
 This gun has a fast display speed for the first zoom, but there is only one type of zoom. 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.550
 But unlike other guns, you can hit the ball continuously 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.550
 It is such a feeling 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.390
 There are many other sr around, but this time I will explain only these three things 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:34.030
 Another feature is the speed of the foot 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:40.620
 There are several things such as speed ball of penetration performance reload , but if you explain everything, 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.620
 I will not explain it later, so I will explain how to use it next time 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.400
 Well then I will explain how to use First let's try a left click 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.150
 The ball comes out like this 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.350
 Next I will try to right click 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:02.520
 Such a feeling this is to click once it's zoom as described earlier 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.060
 It looks like this for the second time I can see the other party in the distance well 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:11.670
 Use way also to have been found I'll show the value of the perfect shot 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:16.290
 What did it say established body shop the aim and only this value is wearing 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.819
 By the way, no joke aside from hitting you like even if your aim is fixed 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.090
 sphere is a straight was Hana邑If not you from the team as a feature of sr 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:28.910
 But if you have a team, you 're not going to fly straight 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.910
 Try to hit you zoom while For example, this movement 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.290
 It does not hit this way 2 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.290
 Next I will hit while jumping 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.980
 This also won't hit, which means the ball won't fly straight if it's not steady 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.220
 Please be careful from 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:53.380
 But you should just stop and take it even if you are this far 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.680
 How to use 's it's Try to hit from stopped since this street firmly hit 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.659
 I will finish the explanation of this 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.870
 I thought it would be good if it is the end if it is a beginner's course, but I will do some techniques and techniques 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:08.010
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:13.140
 I will introduce the technique part 1 chira saw popular case 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.269
 What kind of thing do you do? Well it is the name of the name but I just put out the body a little bit 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.670
 Confirm the place and return again 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.440
 If you do this quickly 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.790
 It looks like this 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.310
 If you get used to the movement, try selling your soul when you put out your body 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.730
 strong 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.750
 Is it just me 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.750
 This is a so-called chiller look and it is difficult to hit from the other party, so it's convenient 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:44.060
 Yes I will explain the technique called cut next 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.480
 I feel like this if I go to the next time I will try to increase the aim on the verge of hitting 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.480
 Current story 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:55.660
 Fly firmly straight before moving the only aim not move themselves in such a feeling 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:59.819
 Practice driving with long eyes because you need to get used to it 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.959
 For example, in advance to see such a practice Toka it a little different place 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.959
 Quickly match 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.940
 By the way, you can change the mouse sensitivity only when zooming, so it's easy to do 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.960
 Find it 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.960
 So i 'll go next 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.930
 The following is to jump in like this I teach a jump-out house at the same time as the catch jump out Occitan 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.770
 It feels like 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.770
 There one more time 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:37.130
 I try to patiently practice quite aim from blurred during this also requires a familiarity still jump 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.130
 I will teach you the last technique 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.990
 The end is the cancellation of the reload Willow dqn If the enemy comes out 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.710
 You can go on a chain sale as you do now, but the method of cancellation has grown up 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.210
 The 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:57.310
 sr is basically useful because it has a long reload and it can be used well 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:59.460
 Well then I will finish the introduction of the technique I will introduce only two techniques at the end and finish 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.460
 Day 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:08.720
 Well then let's first teach one two two nine 9s 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:13.070
 I 'm not good at English , but I think it's a quick reflection 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:17.240
 I shoot a bullet as soon as I zoom in this way This is qs 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:23.860
 qs is convenient when it comes to short distance with sr 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.860
 This is to introduce the last of the technique 's that I try to use all means because it is simple and split 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.670
 To introduce Yes last Hagaｰｰｰｰｰｰｰ microphone U'change to shochu c 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.670
 The 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.819
 The movement is the so-called qc, but doing this makes the next ball faster than usual. 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:43.210
 It's open 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:43.210
 Let 's try to plan to strike normally and qc to strike once 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:58.690
 There was a lot of difference, so I explain the way , but this is also the name 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:02.140
 It's a quick weapon change that means you're returning early 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:07.210
 In this case, change the knife 21 times and return to sr 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:10.490
 If you do this early you can become the previous weapon with the old button in the same way that it becomes qc 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:16.340
 But do it quickly and twice quickly sweets quickly 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:21.080
 About to expire my recommendation I can be with the mouse roll to other sounds or more of the 9 button the second floor 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:26.180
 I'm careful at the end of the art, but if you do qc you can get the next ball out quickly in any sr 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:30.480
 Since not a reason there is a zoom are two types at the moment Be careful guy is better to 9 c 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:33.320
 I have to remember it too early, so it was quite long 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.320
 I will end it 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:52.840
 4 Pati If you look at this and it helps a little, it's not Padapol but instinct 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:56.169
 Oh cormorant Na come hug from large Chan' bread I was asked because it was much more one person Du 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:01.680
 That Dai-chan got stuck 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:01.680
 If you don't have much, I'm completely sleeping
