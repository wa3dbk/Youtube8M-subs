00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
through other people's perspective for

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.500 
through other people's perspective for
example<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> would<00:00:36.510> look<00:00:36.719> we<00:00:37.290> would<00:00:37.440> all<00:00:37.620> choose

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
example I would look we would all choose

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.700 
example I would look we would all choose
one<00:00:39.510> player<00:00:39.660> from<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> other<00:00:40.050> team<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.559> we

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
one player from the other team that we

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.799 
one player from the other team that we

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
would be playing their role for example

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.900 
would be playing their role for example
we<00:00:43.020> would<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.290> looking<00:00:43.469> at<00:00:43.739> secret<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.760> will

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
we would be looking at secret and I will

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.209 
we would be looking at secret and I will
be<00:00:45.000> playing<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> role<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> puppy<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.039> would

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
from that how do you feel but your

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
chances coming into this international

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.139 
chances coming into this international
with<00:00:58.890> complexity<00:00:59.370> versus<00:00:59.820> past

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
with complexity versus past

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.510 
with complexity versus past
internationals<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:00.899> different<00:01:01.170> teams<00:01:01.430> um<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
internationals with different teams um I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.929 
internationals with different teams um I
feel<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:04.280> complexity<00:01:05.280> we're<00:01:05.489> kind<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.820> an

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
feel like complexity we're kind of an

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.060 
feel like complexity we're kind of an
underdog<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:06.810> all<00:01:07.229> people<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:07.830> we

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
underdog because all people you know we

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.920 
underdog because all people you know we
just<00:01:08.520> were<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> very<00:01:09.119> new<00:01:09.299> team<00:01:09.540> we're<00:01:09.810> only

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
just were a very new team we're only

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.149 
just were a very new team we're only
together<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.320> about<00:01:10.500> three<00:01:10.950> months<00:01:11.130> maybe<00:01:13.159> so

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
together for about three months maybe so

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.499 
together for about three months maybe so
in<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.460> aspect<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.270> pretty

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
in that aspect it will be pretty

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.050 
in that aspect it will be pretty
difficult<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.590> us<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.640> four

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
difficult for us because we have four

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.609 
difficult for us because we have four
players<00:01:18.180> who<00:01:18.479> don't<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.960> much<00:01:19.170> dota

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
players who don't have that much dota

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.660 
players who don't have that much dota
experience<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.250> comparison<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> myself<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
experience in comparison to myself and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.070 
experience in comparison to myself and
it's<00:01:23.670> very<00:01:23.970> difficult<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.659> play<00:01:24.869> against

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
it's very difficult to play against

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.649 
it's very difficult to play against
teams<00:01:25.320> everything<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.070> years<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.420> really

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
teams everything for years and it really

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.240 
teams everything for years and it really
shows<00:01:27.930> online<00:01:28.170> how<00:01:28.560> much<00:01:28.710> experience<00:01:28.829> they

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
shows online how much experience they

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.130 
shows online how much experience they
have<00:01:29.460> how<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:29.880> don't<00:01:30.540> crack<00:01:30.810> under<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
have how they don't crack under the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.200 
have how they don't crack under the
pressure<00:01:31.259> you're<00:01:32.159> pretty<00:01:32.369> good<00:01:32.520> at<00:01:32.579> being<00:01:32.880> it

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
pressure you're pretty good at being it

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.789 
pressure you're pretty good at being it
may<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.540> reflecting<00:01:34.140> after<00:01:34.470> instead<00:01:34.710> of

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
may be reflecting after instead of

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.990 
may be reflecting after instead of
putting<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.070> pressure<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.430> yourself<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
putting the pressure on yourself in the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
putting the pressure on yourself in the
moment<00:01:36.150> or<00:01:36.450> how<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.869> how<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.290> handle

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.050 
moment or how do you how do you handle
that<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:38.009> make<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.280> wrong<00:01:38.369> decision<00:01:38.880> I

that if you do make the wrong decision I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.289 
that if you do make the wrong decision I
mean<00:01:39.630> throughout<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> game<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.119> make

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
your own decision I just have to move

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.840
