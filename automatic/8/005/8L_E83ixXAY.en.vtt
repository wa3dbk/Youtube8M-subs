 We found this position authorized by 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.520
 the municipality of the district in 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.070
 appearance, the seller complies with the 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.100
 health requirements that we think 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.860
 daddy is with egg the specialty well 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.950

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.270
 chifles in the josé gálvez avenue and 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.420

 a bread and cheese sandwich from here in 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.080
 room we're going east for a

 emollient on the market exteriors 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.910
 lobatón all ours as such and 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.910
 we receive them we take them to a 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.459
 laboratory to simple sight delicious and 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.270
 Appetizing sodas and food but 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.850
 we go that there is beyond the obvious 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.390
 Monday 2 in the afternoon the results of 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.110
 the analyzes are already on the table 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.580
 the results poor fecal coliforms in 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.459
 what we are all thinking is 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.980
 clear they are of enteric origin of the tract 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.720
 intestinal that people then in 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.520
 places he will come from I do not know 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.280
 then they did not give their hands 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.340
 they carry between their hands the coliforms 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.430
 fecal poop 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.530
 clear or in Christian is that the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.690
 sodas and the egg with egg are 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.000
 contaminated bacteria like 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.640
 staphylococci that are transmitted from the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.819
 oral cavity towards the food as well as 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.519
 Salmonella and fecal coliforms these two 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.640
 last by the contact of the food with 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.799
 some faecal residue how can they get 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.900
 bacteria of tax types to these 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.760
 drinks to those foods usually 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.790
 by manipulation sometimes people 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.730
 selling hands do not know their 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.430
 organs to the short ones and that therefore 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.590
 Pollutes also sell it in plastics 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.019
 in a plastic bag with the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.810
 results we return to the posts 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.000
 contaminated squares of 28 joules already 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.970
 we have good results we are going to 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.120
 give the news to the sellers where 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.120
 go 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.209
 I do not think 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.099
 and we also returned to the passion fruit stand 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.409
 and chicha morada good block 14 of 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.350
 isabela catholic we are now in the 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:19.320
 victory the chicha sell bottles 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.570
 recycled soda this seller not 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.900
 You can believe that your soda has 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.660
 dangerous bacteria a test for 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.610
 take care with a claw to determine 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.580
 among the bacteria in which we have 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.700
 found the tax-type bacterium and 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.390
 I can tell you what we found 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.390
 tasting 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.729
 our nails are not shown 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.430
 those rains because they are like this 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.130
 and the others 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.199
 if you work with food you can not 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.539
 be so the sodas and food 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.569
 They can be impeccable in their preparation 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:05.150
 but they get contaminated by being manipulated 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.430
 so we come to the junction of the avenues of 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.370
 huánuco and sebastián canyon here 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.880
 we found the seller with his hands on 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.889
 the potato just with a bag is protected 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.529
 one of your hands to find 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.710
 bacteria 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:24.830
 in which the potato with the egg 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.630
 dad are they are all of the day is by the 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.470
 manipulation for example here I see 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:42.500
 is fighting but the other hand does not have 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:46.220
 glove is that no no no no does not leave them 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:49.090
 work mortgages that stick 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.090
 but it's for hygiene 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.730
 I'm watching here, do not show me your 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.730
 hands your nails 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:04.509
 those nails are dirty here they sell 

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:05.560
 chips with egg and they also give you 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.110
 the yapa 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.060
 and go that for Madrid or for pita 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.189
 with eggs this eat very 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.009
 commonly the young at the time of 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:16.330
 who are hungry also has 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.819
 enteric type bacteria 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.069
 come this from chaco les and types 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:24.659
 of the pathogens have 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.659
 found poop 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.520
 repeat somewhere in your hand or by 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.460
 handling 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.720
 suddenly the bathroom counts and it will not be the 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.440
 asphalt 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.810
 the year that for example what I want 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.210
 and to wash your hands this soap 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:48.850
 liquid they say they put on their mouths 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.850
 also where is your mouth lid 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:57.199
 but the saliva 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.870
 usually it will cause diarrhea 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:08.190
 whole diseases, hors d'oeuvres 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.990
 severe pain in the abdomen and then it goes 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:13.050
 to appear with diarrhea and it can be 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:16.949
 diarrhea of 24 48 hours or diarrhea 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:19.979
 profuse that can last 5 or 6 7 days and 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:22.139
 there comes with high fevers the only 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:25.080
 way to protect yourself from these foods 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:27.300
 contaminated is to look at the position 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.370
 who come also if the seller uses 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.190
 gloves at least if you have nails 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:35.280
 sated and especially if you use a 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.979
 tapaboca gastronomy goes through a good 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.560
 moment but urges that sellers like 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:43.530
 they are trained and measured 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.889
 hygienic to prepare and serve 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:49.500
 food the culinary boom not only happens 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:52.710
 for revolutionizing the kitchen but for 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.099
 try to change the mentality of many 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.099
 cooks
