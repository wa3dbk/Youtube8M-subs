00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
roost and he was killing me with it so I

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.200 
roost and he was killing me with it so I

needed to get around him paying back and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.480 
needed to get around him paying back and
we<00:02:07.140> wouldn't<00:02:07.320> run<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> sweeper<00:02:07.829> section<00:02:08.190> headed

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
we wouldn't run a sweeper section headed

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.760 
we wouldn't run a sweeper section headed
into<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.759> switchbacks<00:02:09.420> came<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> big

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
into a switchbacks came up on a big

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.190 
into a switchbacks came up on a big
double<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.280> my<00:02:11.850> plan<00:02:12.120> was<00:02:12.480> after<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.050> big

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
double and my plan was after the big

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.360 
double and my plan was after the big
double<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.590> was<00:02:13.680> going<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> go<00:02:14.010> from<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> right

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
double I was going to go from the right

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.580 
double I was going to go from the right
side<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.820> track<00:02:15.060> cut<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> inside<00:02:15.600> put<00:02:16.560> a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
side the track cut to the inside put a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.840 
side the track cut to the inside put a
block<00:02:16.800> pass<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.250> him<00:02:17.370> maybe<00:02:17.550> give<00:02:17.730> him<00:02:17.790> a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
block pass on him maybe give him a

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.510 
block pass on him maybe give him a
little<00:02:17.970> ruse<00:02:18.210> back

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
little ruse back

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.870 
little ruse back
cut<00:02:20.180> back<00:02:20.360> over<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.930> about<00:02:21.710> mid<00:02:22.010> air<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.460> looked

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
cut back over and about mid air I looked

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.870 
cut back over and about mid air I looked
over<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.300> realized<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.990> we<00:02:24.140> probably

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
over and I realized that we probably

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.220 
over and I realized that we probably
weren't<00:02:25.880> going<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.150> have<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.450> same<00:02:26.690> plan<00:02:26.990> that

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
weren't going to have the same plan that

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.470 
weren't going to have the same plan that
I'd<00:02:27.350> thought<00:02:27.590> out<00:02:27.770> in<00:02:27.800> my<00:02:28.010> head<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.520> we<00:02:29.330> ended

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
I'd thought out in my head and we ended

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.270 
I'd thought out in my head and we ended
up<00:02:29.600> clipping<00:02:29.960> in<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.230> air<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.590> actually<00:02:30.830> landed

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
up clipping in the air I actually landed

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.280 
up clipping in the air I actually landed
on<00:02:31.400> top<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.820> him<00:02:31.910> just<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.180> little<00:02:32.210> bit<00:02:32.420> we<00:02:33.110> both

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
on top of him just a little bit we both

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.890 
on top of him just a little bit we both
went<00:02:33.530> down<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:34.120> didn't<00:02:35.120> really<00:02:35.240> seem<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:35.600> to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
went down and didn't really seem like to

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.530 
went down and didn't really seem like to
bed<00:02:36.080> of<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.230> crash<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:37.060> when<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.090> kind<00:02:38.270> of<00:02:38.360> came

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
bed of a crash and when I kind of came

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.920 
bed of a crash and when I kind of came
to<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:39.110> realized<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:41.000> crash<00:02:41.330> had<00:02:41.600> claps

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
to I realized that the crash had claps

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.710 
to I realized that the crash had claps
both<00:02:42.140> my<00:02:42.320> lungs<00:02:42.530> broke<00:02:42.980> my<00:02:43.010> t5<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:43.790> t6<00:02:44.030> and

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
both my lungs broke my t5 and t6 and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.270 
both my lungs broke my t5 and t6 and
actually<00:02:45.260> paralyzed<00:02:45.620> me<00:02:45.770> from<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.010> chest

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
actually paralyzed me from the chest

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.590 
actually paralyzed me from the chest
down<00:02:46.810> as<00:02:48.280> bad<00:02:49.280> as<00:02:49.520> that<00:02:49.670> may<00:02:49.880> sound<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.420> most

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
down as bad as that may sound to most

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.670 
down as bad as that may sound to most
people<00:02:50.900> it's<00:02:51.080> actually<00:02:51.380> been<00:02:51.500> an<00:02:51.590> awesome
