00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.230
 Hey people today again an announcement Street View 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.529
 even if in an announcement it does not look so happy, check it out 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.780
 Please, until the end, everything is very important information » 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.399
 And although the first information is two new DAX soon to get through 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.829
 namely a battery man 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.980
 and a Mara can in the 8 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.839
 the choice now comes back this one 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.169
 in the resolution, so to speak 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.949
 we are almost finished missing only two cards but they already are 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.569
 That's why they're so good for traveling 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.810
 it will not take long 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.030
 Billa second would be very important and if I the next 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.010
 week 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.130
 or after that the bar so now the NEK the next week or the next 2 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.730
 no more videos 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.800
 now for some 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.970
 maybe a bit weird but I have since I started 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.970
 I did not take a break for a week I have a video every week 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.790
 at the Vorig and currently I'm doing now just one to two weeks 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.700
 pause 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.200
 other reason is also that i drive away i am not quite cheap because i drive in 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.980
 vacation 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.330
 I'm only two to three days away and I just do not know when » 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.270
 that's going to happen in the next two weeks, so I'll be off 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.280
 better no videos than that I told him it comes 1 and then comes 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.300
 no 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.660
 around year 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.790
 werder-keeper many videos come when i'm in the time of bacon i do 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.260
 Percent Videos of 2 2 Percent Videos is shaking everyone 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.870
 See duels and that still wanted 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.230
 namely on and the water Dragon Deck has won a match 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.600
 and save on the duel voting 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.560
 and bed is mortal and Google is 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.730
 Sinha we also get a duel 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.890
 And if I have enough time you have many more duels with many others 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.700
 Percent DAX the Commander not all at once but that I put the times 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.110
 Distribute duels on the longer period 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 so Las Vegas and that would not be so 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.960
 I often got questions like where do you buy, for example 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.010
 namely 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.270
 Lecturer for example what is a favorite book Stuhr exactly 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.119
 for example 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.629
 what is a favorite book the 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.029
 You can all ask me these questions now and that 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.100
 suddenly 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.499
 a question and answer session, so to speak 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:18.629
 You can ask me your questions that you wanted to know straw 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.389
 the data collects around itself 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.969
 I do not know yet until an indefinite time 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.989
 Percent of that is over 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.699
 If I know then it is here now 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.769
 So not now and if you are pretty much standing in this field 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.879
 When I'm up in the above nothing, then I have not considered 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.459
 if he knows what then percent until then you can still write 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:43.439
 around 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.109
 he asks questions about yu-gi-oh 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.239
 please no questions like 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.879
 So no private questions such as where to live or something like that 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.819
 i like to answer it 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.489
 thanks simply questions around the clock cinema 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.439
 I would be very happy 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.499
 also your questions 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:03.769
 percent 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.009
 If you do not want to make any videos I want to say that 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.689
 does not mean that I am gone you can still Bergner sensual 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.879
 Write messages when he asks or something 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.010
 I will answer it if you do not get any videos that does not mean that 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.219
 I'm not present for the two weeks 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.599
 So you can calmly write questions if you have something not in the 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.309
 Question round Rhine should 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:27.129
 for example, in the problem terms to worldwide after I now here too 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.159
 once again 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.789
 then you can wobble 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:32.030
 and then percent 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.409
 So you have to go 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.169
 SOE win the shade 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.889
 the Nemetschek 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:37.849
 he could 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.609
 just click and then you come on it 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.609
 and you think the third turn drops look 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.549
 so far 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.890
 I look forward to your questions I will answer them in a video 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:52.719
