machine and turns there so that
lighthouse<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:10.380> you<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.220> flashing

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
lighthouse if you see that flashing

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.430 
lighthouse if you see that flashing
pointing<00:02:12.060> down<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.450> serving<00:02:12.810> then<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> know

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
pointing down to serving then you know

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.319 
pointing down to serving then you know
the<00:02:13.560> packing<00:02:13.920> punch<00:02:14.310> machine<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.880> there<00:02:15.180> way

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
the packing punch machine is there way

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.720 
the packing punch machine is there way
it<00:02:15.420> pointing<00:02:15.840> down<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:17.250> before<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
it pointing down it's like before the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.430 
it pointing down it's like before the
package<00:02:18.060> punch<00:02:18.540> machine<00:02:18.690> has<00:02:19.110> been<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:21.440> so

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
package punch machine has been here so

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.850 
package punch machine has been here so
that<00:02:23.040> point<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.489> down<00:02:25.459> basically<00:02:27.680> where<00:02:28.680> that

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
that point is down basically where that

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.339 
that point is down basically where that
points<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:30.299> where<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.630> lands<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.170> pack

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
points and where that lands the pack

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.880 
points and where that lands the pack
punch<00:02:31.890> machine<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.489> there<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.319> so<00:02:34.319> basically

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
punch machine is there so so basically

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.220 
punch machine is there so so basically
that's<00:02:35.069> how<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.370> explain<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:36.989> it's<00:02:37.079> like<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
that's how to explain it so it's like a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.600 
that's how to explain it so it's like a
random<00:02:37.620> box<00:02:37.829> it's<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> mission<00:02:38.430> box

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
random box it's like the mission box

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.720 
random box it's like the mission box
switches<00:02:39.030> places<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.459> going<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.639> be<00:02:41.700> a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
switches places so it's going to be a

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.099 
switches places so it's going to be a
lot<00:02:41.819> harder<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.239> upgrade<00:02:42.569> your<00:02:42.690> weapons<00:02:42.959> now

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
lot harder to upgrade your weapons now

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.720 
lot harder to upgrade your weapons now
guys<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> start<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.069> mystery<00:02:44.340> box<00:02:44.489> and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
guys and I start the mystery box and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.940 
guys and I start the mystery box and
switch<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.720> switches<00:02:46.139> places<00:02:46.290> without

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
switch it switches places without

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.809 
switch it switches places without
getting<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:49.560> teddy<00:02:50.400> bear

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
getting the the teddy bear

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.000 
getting the the teddy bear
so<00:02:51.660> it's<00:02:51.989> much<00:02:52.139> gonna<00:02:52.319> be<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> lot<00:02:52.650> harder<00:02:55.010> I'm

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
so it's much gonna be a lot harder I'm

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.360 
so it's much gonna be a lot harder I'm
just<00:02:56.160> going<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> kill<00:02:56.880> this<00:02:58.850> because<00:02:59.850> on<00:03:00.060> this

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
just going to kill this because on this

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.190 
just going to kill this because on this
and<00:03:02.370> kill<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.030> others<00:03:03.239> on<00:03:03.420> there<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.810> want<00:03:03.930> to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
and kill the others on there I want to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
spins around really fast now that points

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.309 
spins around really fast now that points
where<00:03:21.120> where<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.540> going<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.840> go<00:03:21.959> where's

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.870 

see<00:03:29.290> see<00:03:29.650> there's<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.069> pack<00:03:30.310> point<00:03:30.610> machine

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
see see there's a pack point machine

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.940 
see see there's a pack point machine
guys<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.420> goes<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:32.020> like<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.260> mystery<00:03:32.590> box<00:03:32.709> it

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
guys it goes is like a mystery box it

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.220 
guys it goes is like a mystery box it
goes<00:03:33.040> around<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.930> there's<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:35.020> package

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
goes around and there's a package

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.210 
goes around and there's a package
machine<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.420> there<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:37.660> go<00:03:37.780> guys<00:03:38.220> it

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
machine so that there you go guys it

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.120 
machine so that there you go guys it
costs<00:03:39.490> 5000<00:03:40.060> points<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.530> packet<00:03:41.920> plunge

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
costs 5000 points the packet plunge

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.160 
costs 5000 points the packet plunge
machine

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
machine

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.360 
machine
so<00:03:44.170> you'll<00:03:44.319> see<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.620> isolate<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:44.950> power<00:03:45.160> what

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
so you'll see you isolate the power what

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.309 
so you'll see you isolate the power what
it's<00:03:45.520> like<00:03:45.580> a<00:03:45.640> mystery<00:03:45.970> box<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.360> goes<00:03:46.510> around

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
it's like a mystery box it goes around

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.530 
it's like a mystery box it goes around
anywhere<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.370> can<00:03:48.489> go<00:03:48.670> around<00:03:48.880> anywhere

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
anywhere that it can go around anywhere

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.930 
anywhere that it can go around anywhere
and<00:03:50.380> don't<00:03:50.800> stay<00:03:51.069> in<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.190> water<00:03:51.370> too<00:03:51.459> long<00:03:51.610> you

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
and don't stay in the water too long you

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.580 
and don't stay in the water too long you
free<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.300> death<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:52.989> there's<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.200> pack<00:03:53.350> of<00:03:53.380> punch

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
free to death so there's a pack of punch

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.920 
free to death so there's a pack of punch
