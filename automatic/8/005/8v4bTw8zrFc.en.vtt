00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello I present you the new ipad 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.000
 the new apple tablet that 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.379
 so is called new ipad so like 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.650
 you know it's the breakdown we do not know 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:16.500
 ipad 3 or ipad 2 is drunk ipad hd 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.310
 it's the new ipad so we always have 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.200
 a 10-inch tablet 9.8 more 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.030
 exactly but it's like you 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.460
 probably know the resolution of 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:31.500
 the screen that changes so we go from 1024 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.170
 by 768 to 2048 by 1536 so that's it 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.370
 simply doubled in the sense of the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.570
 height and doubled in the direction of the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.829
 width so I reassure you when you 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.449
 buy the ipad the screen is a lot more 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.739
 clean than that but it's just for 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.850
 show that after a few hours 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.730
 of course use these rooms 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.649
 like most touch screens 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.730
 we'll do a quick tour even if the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.589
 tablet you know it's the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.339
 same thing as an ipad 2 it just does 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:55.370
 some 0.5 mm thick more so 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.260
 here we have the classic charger 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.870
 apple buttons are here 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.780
 settings between the vibrator or or the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.229
 ring here we have the power button 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.579
 here the audio output jack here so no 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.719
 mention to a possible ipad 2 or 3 as 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.820
 I told you we just have the 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.820
 mention 16 gigabyte so here it's a model 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.649
 wifi only it is wi-fi + 4g but 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.060
 in France and all over Europe in fact 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.930
 kadji will not work it will be 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.619
 only the 3g and 3g more than you 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.590
 can enjoy 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.509
 so I thought to compare 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.729
 nothing like an ipad 2 like you 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.109
 see it's really very tablets 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.079
 very close in terms of thickness on 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:42.000
 is really almost on the verge of 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.670
 same thing ipad 3 is hardly more 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.429
 thick but it's really we see it 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.689
 hardly see what it's really 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.100
 light there we see it when we look 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.780
 like that we do not really see it 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.240
 the thickness of the other whereas here we 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.219
 see it a little bit more but it's 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.439
 it's really very very light then 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:07.320
 ipad 3 so the new ipad 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.069
 right here actually it is faster 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.349
 than the ipad 2 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.519
 the processor is almost the same 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.290
 is hardly more optimized but it's 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.909
 especially the graphic chip so I'm going 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.859
 immediately show you that at the level 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.540
 loading time what does it give 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.540
 so here I turn on both at the same 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.540
 time 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.540
 here 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.940
 and here we see that ipad 2 has finished 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.520
 start while the ipad 3 ends 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.780
 after it's pretty surprising especially that 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.770
 as you see each one has the same 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.580
 number of applications it's not 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.400
 necessarily the same 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.470
 but hey that's it's still 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.910
 pretty close but the ipad May 3 more than 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.920
 teeth finally the new ipad but more than 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.600
 time to start that the 2 here is so 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.600
 for further comparisons and 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.370
 comparisons also with the ipad 1 that 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.780
 here is 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.110
 I invite you to look at another 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.060
 video that will be linked right there at the bottom 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.010
 for a comparison between the three ipad 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.960
 at the level of internet surfing 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.400
 heavy applications of the photo etc 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.960
 Thank you for following us for 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.270
 this short video and see you soon for 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.170
 other comparative videos on the ipad 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.170
 3 and the others
