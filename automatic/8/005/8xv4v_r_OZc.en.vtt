00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
button rotate see is there so I can

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.330 
button rotate see is there so I can
rotate<00:03:12.420> this<00:03:12.629> backwards<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:13.349> forwards<00:03:13.799> or

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
rotate this backwards and forwards or

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.300 
rotate this backwards and forwards or
you<00:03:15.090> know<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.239> can<00:03:15.480> use<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:15.780> bit<00:03:15.989> there<00:03:16.310> you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
you know you can use that bit there you

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.330 
you know you can use that bit there you
go<00:03:17.549> from<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.790> front<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.989> top<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:20.099> get<00:03:20.250> any

go from the front the top to get any

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.860 
go from the front the top to get any
rotation<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.879> want<00:03:21.560> middle<00:03:22.560> button<00:03:23.540> will<00:03:24.540> see

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
rotation you want middle button will see

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
a little layer move it up and down so we

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.809 
a little layer move it up and down so we
have<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.819> very<00:03:27.540> big<00:03:27.690> long<00:03:27.900> neck<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.349> that<00:03:28.819> but

what<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.090> also<00:03:30.209> do<00:03:30.660> is<00:03:31.639> scale<00:03:32.840> if<00:03:33.840> you

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
what you can also do is scale if you

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.900 
what you can also do is scale if you
hover<00:03:34.139> over<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.949> actual<00:03:35.040> join<00:03:35.459> us<00:03:35.609> here<00:03:35.699> goes

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.069 
hover over the actual join us here goes
a<00:03:36.030> circle<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.680> can<00:03:37.799> scale<00:03:38.160> up<00:03:38.190> by<00:03:38.699> this

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
a circle and you can scale up by this

but<00:06:21.790> let's<00:06:22.000> go<00:06:22.150> back<00:06:22.180> to<00:06:22.690> a<00:06:23.080> basic<00:06:23.590> mudbox

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
but let's go back to a basic mudbox

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.550 
but let's go back to a basic mudbox
material<00:06:24.840> so<00:06:25.840> if<00:06:26.020> we<00:06:26.200> turn<00:06:26.470> off<00:06:26.650> these<00:06:26.860> layers

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
material so if we turn off these layers

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.080 
material so if we turn off these layers
you<00:06:29.560> can<00:06:29.590> see<00:06:29.890> we've<00:06:30.100> drastically<00:06:30.670> changed

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
you can see we've drastically changed

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.830 
you can see we've drastically changed
with<00:06:31.270> this<00:06:31.480> standard<00:06:32.200> mesh<00:06:33.540> so<00:06:34.540> we<00:06:34.720> can

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
with this standard mesh so we can

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.390 
with this standard mesh so we can
actually<00:06:34.930> fear<00:06:35.260> this<00:06:35.410> in<00:06:35.650> alright<00:06:36.100> so<00:06:36.310> we've

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
actually fear this in alright so we've

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.560 
actually fear this in alright so we've
got<00:06:36.580> this<00:06:36.700> here<00:06:37.000> and<00:06:37.600> we'll<00:06:37.810> just<00:06:38.020> um

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
got this here and we'll just um

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.470 
got this here and we'll just um
something<00:06:40.570> that<00:06:40.690> looks<00:06:40.890> not<00:06:41.890> to<00:06:42.130> free

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
something that looks not to free

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:52.350 
something that looks not to free
then<00:06:43.780> this<00:06:43.960> one<00:06:44.170> here<00:06:44.440> will<00:06:50.790> this<00:06:51.790> one<00:06:52.000> here<00:06:52.240> we

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
then this one here will this one here we

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.420
