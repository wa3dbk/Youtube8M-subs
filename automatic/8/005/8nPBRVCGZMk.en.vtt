00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
use and along the weight of that

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.839 
use and along the weight of that
decision<00:00:07.529> lies<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> whole<00:00:08.429> lot<00:00:08.700> of

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
decision lies a whole lot of

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.549 
decision lies a whole lot of
demystification<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:10.019> has<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.349> take<00:00:10.380> place

demystification that has to take place
so<00:00:11.490> let's<00:00:11.610> do<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.420> get<00:00:12.570> some

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
so let's do that and get some

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:21.310 
so let's do that and get some
perspective<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.469> 3d

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320

eyes they use polarizing lenses like on

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.330 
eyes they use polarizing lenses like on
a<00:01:33.299> pair<00:01:33.539> of<00:01:33.630> sunglasses<00:01:33.899> to<00:01:34.679> discriminate

so it sounds like a no-brainer to go
passive<00:01:40.439> right<00:01:40.649> but<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.399> that<00:01:41.429> simple

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
passive right but it's not that simple

passive right but it's not that simple
active<00:01:42.659> glasses<00:01:42.869> still<00:01:43.319> offer<00:01:43.469> the<00:01:43.649> best

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
