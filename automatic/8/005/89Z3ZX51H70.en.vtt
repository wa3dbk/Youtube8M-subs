00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.489
 almost unique models already 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:11.759
 it's the hoop

 and adjustable according to the dimensions 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.370
 and position 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.849
 from each user's ear 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.060
 as we see 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.870
 the shoulder moves 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.360
 it fits 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.639
 and it is positioned according to 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.479
 the need 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.610
 from each person 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.979
 as to the best location of the atrial atc 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.899
 it is clear not only allows you to adjust the headset in the way 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.999
 of the possible way 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:51.249
 yes no that at the same time avoid the annoying inconveniences due to the prolonged use of 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.389
 device 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.139
 since to love to be perfectly finished gone does not press the cartilages 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.349
 external 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.169
 it bothers me 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.169
 by the weight or the shape of it 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.370
 I've been also presents one of the exclusive functions of villar 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.159
 which is your change of location from right to left 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:14.860
 with a simple turn 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.860
 of love here we raise slightly 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.120
 logic moss 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.999
 and again we put it in its position 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:28.489
 this way we have changed from the left position to the position 

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:31.289
 straight 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.289
 let's compare it common moment 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.789
 competitor 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.789
 these designs are usually more rigid 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.029
 subaru is not flexible has a specific position 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.430
 plus 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.379
 to be able to change 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.379
 by ear you have to disarm it 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.479
 turn the device 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.319
 and reposition 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:57.900
 which it's 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.439
 It can generate 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:00.889
 that the device 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.639
 it eventually breaks 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.419
 this is an inconvenience 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.779
 this is not going to have 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:09.279
 with her there will be 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.249
 dt 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:11.639
