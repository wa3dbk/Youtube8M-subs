00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Today I am going to show you how to return to the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.589
 Telcel's original course in our 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.050
 galaxy s3 good first of all let's go to 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.820
 verify that we have a different light 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.750
 installed in my case I have the android 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.370
 4.3.1 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.310
 let's hope that start 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:26.650
 this blue dummy tells us it's a 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.650
 error of sianoja mod 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.080
 is entering 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.110
 my phone is gathered faster 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.320
 which I like a lot 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.840
 I did not think to take it off but not to 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.490
 everyone is going to like it so we're going to 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.490
 show how to return in latex 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.079
 we check what version we have in a new 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.109
 typhoon 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:06.309
 we have version 4.3.1 of living 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.309
 we will proceed to turn off the phone 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.159
 while I show you what the version is and 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.159
 they believe him 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.500
 once the phone is turned off 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.420
 we proceed to enter 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.880
 modo tone loading this is pressing 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.880
 volume down home and power 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.229
 volume water to continue 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.050
 we proceed to connect our cable 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.610
 and the next steps will be in our 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 computer 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.950
 since we are in the computer 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.420
 unzip the odin and our rumba 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.420
 original from close 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.850
 we write the key that is 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.310
 www.linkedin.com 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.940
 we believe that they end 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.850
 it's broken is about a gigabyte 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.790
 we open the odin 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.790
 we execute the administrator 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.590
 this tells us that we have our 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.210
 phone connected the message that 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.900
 It is added 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.110
 we click on up and look for the romina and 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.110
 telcel 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.640
 have we have we think arrives so 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.030
 It will take a little while to adhere to the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.030
 teeth 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.760
 well here we see that it is already added 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.410
 and we only click on start 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.880
 maybe the connection 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.630
 that we will collect 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.920
 and we only hope that the 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.920
 process 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.210
 since it is a long process we see them 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.030
 a few minutes 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.040
 finally the process is over 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.170
 we will continue now on our phone 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.030
 so we can see that we already have the rom of 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.770
 all chill 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.770
 they arrive home and power 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.400
 we have entered recovery mode 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:22.390
 and we will select 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.390
 with cleaning factory 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.500
 yes 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.460
 now we will give a cache cleanup 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.010
 we can restart our system 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.580
 although we have to be 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.910
 I just removed and I'm designing my 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.910
 room 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:29.610
 then he is very slow and apart we do not 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:35.000
 allows to update freely 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.000
 Well, whatever you expect God to go
