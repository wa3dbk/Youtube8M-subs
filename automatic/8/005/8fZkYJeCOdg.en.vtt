00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.680 
the fight versus on the park box youtube
channel<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.610> i<00:00:47.640> recommend<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.149> checking<00:00:48.450> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
channel so i recommend you checking that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.170 
channel so i recommend you checking that
out<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.020> only<00:00:49.289> last<00:00:49.500> sort<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:50.550> rounds<00:00:50.789> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
out the only last sort of two rounds so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.869 
out the only last sort of two rounds so
it's<00:00:51.379> certainly<00:00:52.379> worth<00:00:52.590> watching<00:00:52.890> but

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
it's certainly worth watching but

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.360 
it's certainly worth watching but
essentially<00:00:54.390> Parker<00:00:55.140> cuts<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.860> opponent

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
essentially Parker cuts as the opponent

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
essentially Parker cuts as the opponent
with<00:00:56.520> her<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:57.360> hand<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> second<00:00:58.289> round

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
with her right hand in the second round

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.130 
with her right hand in the second round
he<00:00:59.039> does<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.699> his<00:00:59.820> feet<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.989> all

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
he does get to his feet but it's all

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.439 
he does get to his feet but it's all
over<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.399> Nicole<00:01:02.670> actually<00:01:02.940> comes

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
over and I think Nicole actually comes

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.080 
over and I think Nicole actually comes
in<00:01:03.660> from<00:01:03.840> his<00:01:03.960> corner<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.100> good<00:01:05.519> performance

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
in from his corner so a good performance

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.219

to<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.270> him<00:01:21.360> out<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.930> two<00:01:22.259> bounds<00:01:22.680> is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
to get him out there in two bounds is

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.490 
to get him out there in two bounds is
very<00:01:23.070> impressive<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.170> 23<00:01:25.170> year<00:01:25.350> old

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
very impressive for a 23 year old

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.060 
very impressive for a 23 year old
fighter<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.070> he<00:01:26.130> did<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> pretty<00:01:26.880> good<00:01:27.119> job<00:01:28.070> now

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
fighter and he did a pretty good job now

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.590 
fighter and he did a pretty good job now
in<00:01:29.579> terms<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.750> areas<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.890> improvement<00:01:32.600> when

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
in terms of areas for improvement when

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 
in terms of areas for improvement when
they<00:01:33.720> were<00:01:33.810> free<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:35.070> was<00:01:35.189> only<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
they were free and it was only a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
they were free and it was only a
four-minute<00:01:36.000> fight<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.509> I'm<00:01:36.630> being<00:01:36.869> overly

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
four-minute fight so I'm being overly

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.929 
four-minute fight so I'm being overly
critical<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> reason<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.759> being

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
critical here but the reason for being

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.710 
critical here but the reason for being
critical<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> kind<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.369> yeah<00:01:41.720> consistently

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
critical is to kind of yeah consistently

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
critical is to kind of yeah consistently

fight with solid to mention so the first

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.539

that<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> favorite<00:02:25.620> punch<00:02:25.890> from

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
that this is a favorite punch from

that this is a favorite punch from
Segura<00:02:26.450> now<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.810> was<00:02:28.020> kind<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.530> worrying<00:02:28.830> for

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
Segura now it was kind of worrying for

Segura now it was kind of worrying for
me<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.610> Parker<00:02:30.060> didn't<00:02:30.269> keep<00:02:30.420> his<00:02:30.599> hand<00:02:30.840> high

the<00:02:31.709> Parker<00:02:32.220> was<00:02:32.370> hittable<00:02:32.730> by<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.180> punch<00:02:33.480> I

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
the Parker was hittable by that punch I

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.050 
the Parker was hittable by that punch I
think<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.920> opponent<00:02:35.370> catches<00:02:35.700> him<00:02:35.819> twice

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060

with<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.599> only<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> first<00:02:37.140> round<00:02:37.380> now

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319

end of the visit it becomes more
dangerous<00:03:26.730> territory<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.290> that's<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.560> first

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
dangerous territory so that's the first

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.270 
dangerous territory so that's the first
thing<00:03:28.920> that<00:03:29.069> I<00:03:29.220> was<00:03:29.400> mindful<00:03:29.730> on<00:03:29.910> for<00:03:30.120> poker

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
thing that I was mindful on for poker

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.039 
thing that I was mindful on for poker
related<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.430> was<00:03:32.940> head<00:03:33.150> movement<00:03:33.660> and

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
related to that was head movement and

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.569 
related to that was head movement and
this<00:03:34.170> was<00:03:34.319> another<00:03:34.350> thing<00:03:34.769> he<00:03:34.950> could<00:03:35.100> hear<00:03:35.340> his

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
this was another thing he could hear his

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.849 
this was another thing he could hear his
corner<00:03:36.090> telling<00:03:36.900> him<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.769> know

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
corner telling him to you know

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.250 
corner telling him to you know
consistently<00:03:38.609> he<00:03:38.850> park<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.780> it's<00:03:39.959> clear<00:03:40.230> that

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
consistently he park and it's clear that

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.420 
consistently he park and it's clear that
this<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.590> something<00:03:40.920> that<00:03:41.040> they've<00:03:41.250> been

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
this is something that they've been

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.800 
this is something that they've been
working<00:03:41.880> on<00:03:42.030> something<00:03:42.389> that<00:03:42.600> they<00:03:42.690> have

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
working on something that they have

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.390 
working on something that they have
highlighted<00:03:43.380> potentially<00:03:43.980> as<00:03:44.069> a<00:03:44.130> weakness

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
highlighted potentially as a weakness

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.520 
highlighted potentially as a weakness
with<00:03:44.700> Parker<00:03:45.209> something<00:03:46.049> that<00:03:46.139> they're<00:03:46.290> keen

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
with Parker something that they're keen

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.729 
with Parker something that they're keen
to<00:03:46.799> bring<00:03:47.220> into<00:03:47.340> his<00:03:47.549> game<00:03:47.760> more<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.180> more<00:03:48.359> and

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
to bring into his game more and more and

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.440 
to bring into his game more and more and
yeah<00:03:49.739> likewise<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.489> mean<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.730> close<00:03:51.120> into<00:03:51.420> the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
yeah likewise I mean it close into the

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.120 
yeah likewise I mean it close into the
first<00:03:51.750> point<00:03:52.049> regarding<00:03:52.590> defense<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:55.470> yeah<00:03:56.100> I

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
first point regarding defense so yeah I

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.940 
first point regarding defense so yeah I
think<00:03:56.250> us<00:03:56.579> another<00:03:57.269> carrier<00:03:57.930> development<00:03:58.739> for

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
think us another carrier development for

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.150 
think us another carrier development for
him<00:03:59.120> essentially<00:04:00.120> if<00:04:00.209> he<00:04:00.299> can<00:04:00.769> invoke<00:04:01.769> a<00:04:01.829> bit

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
him essentially if he can invoke a bit

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.220 
him essentially if he can invoke a bit
more<00:04:02.340> lateral<00:04:02.970> movement<00:04:03.480> keep<00:04:03.870> his<00:04:04.019> hands

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
more lateral movement keep his hands

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.759 
more lateral movement keep his hands
high<00:04:04.500> get<00:04:04.889> the<00:04:04.980> head<00:04:05.160> moving<00:04:05.519> behind<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.910> god

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
high get the head moving behind the god

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.020 
high get the head moving behind the god
yeah<00:04:07.769> he's<00:04:07.920> going<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.190> be<00:04:08.280> a<00:04:08.310> lot<00:04:08.519> more<00:04:08.579> elusive

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
yeah he's going to be a lot more elusive

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.819 
yeah he's going to be a lot more elusive
he's<00:04:09.569> going<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.810> take<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.989> lot<00:04:10.230> more<00:04:10.290> punishment

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
he's going to take a lot more punishment

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.039 
he's going to take a lot more punishment
for<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.370> course<00:04:11.730> of<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.970> potentially<00:04:12.569> very<00:04:12.750> long

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
for a course of a potentially very long

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.129 
for a course of a potentially very long
career<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:13.680> guess<00:04:14.609> finally<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.389> know<00:04:15.510> Park<00:04:15.870> has

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
career I guess finally you know Park has

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.199 
career I guess finally you know Park has
got<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.380> very<00:04:16.620> good<00:04:16.889> job<00:04:17.130> when<00:04:17.489> he<00:04:17.579> uses<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.090> in

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
got a very good job when he uses it in

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.960 
got a very good job when he uses it in
the<00:04:18.389> right<00:04:18.479> way<00:04:18.739> he's<00:04:19.739> got<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.950> snappy<00:04:20.459> vast

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
the right way he's got a snappy vast

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.959 
the right way he's got a snappy vast
powerful<00:04:21.840> job<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.409> it's<00:04:22.530> better

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:22.969 
powerful job and it's better

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.070 
powerful job and it's better
sometimes<00:04:23.969> he<00:04:24.060> gets<00:04:24.150> slightly<00:04:24.419> lazy<00:04:24.719> with<00:04:25.020> it

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
sometimes he gets slightly lazy with it

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.929 
sometimes he gets slightly lazy with it
I<00:04:25.349> don't<00:04:25.860> think<00:04:25.949> it's<00:04:26.400> his<00:04:26.550> natural

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:26.939 
I don't think it's his natural

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.179 
I don't think it's his natural
information<00:04:27.539> for<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.900> job<00:04:28.229> he<00:04:28.710> seems<00:04:28.919> to<00:04:29.069> me<00:04:29.129> a

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
information for a job he seems to me a

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.730 
information for a job he seems to me a
guy<00:04:29.340> who<00:04:29.370> prefers<00:04:30.270> varying<00:04:30.689> combinations<00:04:31.169> of

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
guy who prefers varying combinations of

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.770 
guy who prefers varying combinations of
power<00:04:31.979> punches<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.729> he<00:04:33.060> prefers<00:04:33.479> to<00:04:33.629> get

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
power punches and he prefers to get

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.350 
power punches and he prefers to get
inside<00:04:34.280> but<00:04:35.280> his<00:04:35.370> job<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.759> a<00:04:35.819> really<00:04:35.909> effective

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
inside but his job is a really effective

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.429 
inside but his job is a really effective
weapon<00:04:36.990> when<00:04:37.319> used<00:04:37.530> correctly<00:04:38.810> now<00:04:39.810> what<00:04:40.409> I

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
weapon when used correctly now what I

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.640 
weapon when used correctly now what I
notice<00:04:40.889> is<00:04:41.389> what's<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.599> climbs<00:04:42.900> his<00:04:43.259> job<00:04:43.469> is

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
notice is what's the climbs his job is

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.649 
notice is what's the climbs his job is
good<00:04:43.860> there's<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.370> tendency<00:04:44.789> for<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.509> be

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
good there's a tendency for it to be

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.040 
good there's a tendency for it to be
lazier<00:04:46.650> there's<00:04:46.949> a<00:04:47.009> penalty<00:04:47.250> for<00:04:47.729> it

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
lazier there's a penalty for it

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.869 
lazier there's a penalty for it
sometimes<00:04:49.050> lack<00:04:49.259> of<00:04:49.439> speed<00:04:49.680> like<00:04:50.189> a<00:04:50.219> snap<00:04:50.669> of

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
sometimes lack of speed like a snap of

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.209 
sometimes lack of speed like a snap of
the<00:04:51.120> peak<00:04:51.360> Parker<00:04:51.870> job<00:04:52.139> and<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:52.830> think<00:04:53.099> it's

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
the peak Parker job and I think it's

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:54.499 
the peak Parker job and I think it's
something<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:53.580> he<00:04:53.699> really<00:04:53.729> needs<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.330> work

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
something that he really needs to work

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.589 
something that he really needs to work
behind<00:04:54.750> more<00:04:55.460> you<00:04:56.460> know<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.759> know<00:04:57.120> he's<00:04:57.360> always

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
behind more you know I know he's always

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:58.790 
behind more you know I know he's always
going<00:04:57.689> to<00:04:57.779> be<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.870> guy<00:04:58.050> who<00:04:58.110> likes<00:04:58.349> throwing

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
going to be a guy who likes throwing

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.920 
going to be a guy who likes throwing
hooks<00:04:59.129> he<00:04:59.460> likes<00:04:59.639> getting<00:05:00.029> inside<00:05:00.389> who<00:05:00.719> likes
