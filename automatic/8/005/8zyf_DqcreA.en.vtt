the idea what the spray skirt is that
there's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.330> seal<00:00:33.630> between<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.080> the<00:00:34.680> skirt

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
there's a seal between the the skirt

that she can use so now she's putting
the<00:00:57.150> spray<00:00:57.750> skirt<00:00:58.140> over<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> cockpit<00:00:59.760> so

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
the spray skirt over the cockpit so

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.240 
the spray skirt over the cockpit so
she's<00:01:00.269> first<00:01:00.510> leaning<00:01:01.500> back<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> little<00:01:02.010> bit

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
she's first leaning back a little bit

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.650 
she's first leaning back a little bit
and<00:01:03.290> putting<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> back<00:01:04.770> and<00:01:05.190> then

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
and putting that on the back and then

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.090 
and putting that on the back and then
stretching<00:01:06.660> it<00:01:06.780> forward

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
stretching it forward

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.139 
stretching it forward
to<00:01:08.399> make<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.880> seal<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.610> water<00:01:11.610> whether

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
to make a seal so that water whether

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.980 
to make a seal so that water whether
it's<00:01:12.240> waves<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:13.940> or<00:01:14.940> were<00:01:15.210> she<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.630> upside

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it's waves or or were she to go upside

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
it's waves or or were she to go upside
down<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.530> water<00:01:16.560> won't<00:01:17.009> go<00:01:17.160> inside<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.910> boat

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
down the water won't go inside the boat

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.330 
down the water won't go inside the boat
and<00:01:18.390> then

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.220 

she's<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.180> roll<00:01:24.420> upside-down

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
she's going to roll upside-down

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.110 
she's going to roll upside-down
half<00:01:25.410> roll<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> easy<00:01:26.070> part<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:26.940> then

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
half roll that's the easy part and then

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.490 
half roll that's the easy part and then
we're<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> pretend<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.840> she<00:01:27.930> couldn't

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
we're going to pretend that she couldn't

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.460 
we're going to pretend that she couldn't
get<00:01:28.590> herself<00:01:28.740> right-side<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.670> again<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
get herself right-side up again and

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.860 
get herself right-side up again and
she'll<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:31.560> use<00:01:31.620> her<00:01:31.890> grab<00:01:32.130> loop<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:33.060> pull

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
she'll then use her grab loop to pull

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.680 
she'll then use her grab loop to pull
the<00:01:33.990> spray<00:01:34.230> skirt<00:01:34.500> off<00:01:34.830> of<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.340> kayak<00:01:36.240> off<00:01:36.540> the

cockpit she floats out of the boat and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.040 
cockpit she floats out of the boat and
presto<00:01:38.700> change-o<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.180> she<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.390> floating<00:01:39.930> in

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
presto change-o there she is floating in

the lowly Spokane River on this warm day
and<00:01:43.410> 40<00:01:43.740> degree<00:01:43.920> water<00:01:44.150> but<00:01:45.150> I<00:01:45.180> would<00:01:45.360> say<00:01:45.450> the

and 40 degree water but I would say the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.420 
and 40 degree water but I would say the
most<00:01:45.750> common<00:01:46.140> thing<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.980> know

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
most common thing is just you know

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.460 
most common thing is just you know
overestimating<00:01:48.390> one's<00:01:48.540> ability<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.200> getting

overestimating one's ability and getting

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.370 
overestimating one's ability and getting
into<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> situation<00:01:50.600> where<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.750> shouldn't<00:01:52.080> be

into a situation where you shouldn't be

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.650 
into a situation where you shouldn't be
in<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.650> first<00:01:52.860> place<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.520> often<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.450> might

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
in the first place and often that might

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.490 
in the first place and often that might
be<00:01:54.810> caused<00:01:55.050> by<00:01:55.350> super<00:01:56.160> high<00:01:56.280> water<00:01:56.550> conditions

extremely cold water where hypothermia

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.320 
extremely cold water where hypothermia
becomes<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.540> an<00:02:01.020> issue<00:02:01.730> and<00:02:02.730> those<00:02:02.940> sorts<00:02:03.270> of

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
becomes a an issue and those sorts of

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.970 
becomes a an issue and those sorts of
things<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:04.080> just<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.410> three<00:02:04.620> may<00:02:04.740> become

things we just have a three may become

things we just have a three may become
an<00:02:05.070> issue<00:02:05.540> well<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.500> become<00:02:07.710> an<00:02:07.800> issue

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.880 
an issue in either case no matter how
hot<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.080> you're<00:02:25.230> submerged<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
hot it is if you're submerged in the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.910 
hot it is if you're submerged in the
water<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:27.030> its<00:02:27.360> cold<00:02:27.570> water<00:02:27.900> for<00:02:28.590> too<00:02:28.710> long

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
water and in its cold water for too long

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.770 
water and in its cold water for too long
so<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.670> can<00:02:29.820> see<00:02:30.030> she's<00:02:30.209> got<00:02:30.360> actually<00:02:30.750> a

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
so you can see she's got actually a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.090 
so you can see she's got actually a
pretty<00:02:30.990> strong<00:02:31.290> eddy<00:02:31.560> current<00:02:31.920> that's

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
pretty strong eddy current that's

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.240 
pretty strong eddy current that's
actually<00:02:32.400> moving<00:02:32.550> up<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.150> river<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:34.250> notice

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
actually moving up the river you notice

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.110 
actually moving up the river you notice
how<00:02:35.370> hard<00:02:35.610> she's<00:02:35.730> having<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.060> work<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.300> paddle

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
how hard she's having to work to paddle

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.190 
how hard she's having to work to paddle
downstream<00:02:39.530> so<00:02:40.580> so<00:02:41.580> she<00:02:41.670> puts<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.120> paddle<00:02:42.989> and

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
downstream so so she puts the paddle and

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.380 
downstream so so she puts the paddle and
sets<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.830> up<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.040> position<00:02:44.550> now<00:02:44.880> she's<00:02:45.090> upside

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
sets it up in position now she's upside

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.199 
sets it up in position now she's upside
down<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:47.190> saw<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.580> there<00:02:47.970> was<00:02:48.090> very

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
down and you saw that there was very

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.479 
down and you saw that there was very
little<00:02:48.450> paddle<00:02:48.900> motion<00:02:49.260> but<00:02:49.980> there<00:02:50.130> was<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> big

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
little paddle motion but there was a big

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.580 
little paddle motion but there was a big
snap<00:02:51.120> there<00:02:51.420> when<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.690> boat<00:02:51.840> just<00:02:52.050> came<00:02:52.440> right

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
snap there when the boat just came right

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.970 
snap there when the boat just came right
back<00:02:52.950> up<00:02:53.100> again<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.610> was

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
back up again that was

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.500 
back up again that was
paddles<00:02:56.030> acting<00:02:56.720> board<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:57.050> embracing
