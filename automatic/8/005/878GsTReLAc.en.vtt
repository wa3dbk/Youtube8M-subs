liquor skin yeah in general so the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.279 
liquor skin yeah in general so the
reason<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.509> check<00:01:06.690> this<00:01:06.869> out<00:01:07.050> is

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
reason you want to check this out is

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:08.660 
reason you want to check this out is
because<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:08.190> know<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.399> can<00:01:08.520> be<00:01:08.550> very

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
because you know it can be very

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
because you know it can be very
expensive<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.390> buy<00:01:09.539> organic<00:01:09.720> food<00:01:10.110> since<00:01:10.590> it's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
expensive to buy organic food since it's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.260 
expensive to buy organic food since it's
not<00:01:10.830> widely<00:01:11.039> available<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:12.119> you're

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
not widely available so if you're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
not widely available so if you're
prioritizing<00:01:12.990> things<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.380> should<00:01:13.530> check<00:01:13.710> out

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
prioritizing things you should check out

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.230 
prioritizing things you should check out

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
both of them in general it's a little

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.830 
both of them in general it's a little
bit<00:01:29.459> better<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.849> seem<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.240> retain<00:01:30.569> more<00:01:30.780> of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
bit better to seem you retain more of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.419 
bit better to seem you retain more of
the<00:01:30.959> nutrients<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:31.800> we're<00:01:31.920> gonna<00:01:32.039> check<00:01:32.250> out

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.339 
the nutrients but we're gonna check out
both<00:01:32.610> ways<00:01:32.849> so<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.119> gonna<00:01:33.209> get<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.780> heat<00:01:34.229> on

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:34.349 
both ways so I'm gonna get the heat on

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:35.419 
both ways so I'm gonna get the heat on
on<00:01:34.530> both<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.920> my<00:01:35.009> pots

and you can tell that they're getting
soft<00:02:48.300> which<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.900> goal<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.290> now<00:02:49.500> I'm<00:02:49.650> just

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
soft which is the goal so now I'm just

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.520 
soft which is the goal so now I'm just
gonna<00:02:49.920> put<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.250> spinach<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.120> I'm<00:02:52.019> really

just looking for the spinach too wet so

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.360

oh yeah I think I can't believe

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.830 
oh yeah I think I can't believe
that<00:05:48.099> this<00:05:48.159> has<00:05:48.340> no<00:05:48.520> added<00:05:48.789> spice<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.539> we<00:05:49.690> made

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
that this has no added spice and we made

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.689 
that this has no added spice and we made
quite<00:05:50.110> a<00:05:50.169> bit<00:05:50.440> just<00:05:50.470> from<00:05:50.919> that<00:05:51.070> that<00:05:51.340> recipe

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
quite a bit just from that that recipe

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:52.860 
quite a bit just from that that recipe
so<00:05:51.849> we<00:05:51.880> didn't<00:05:52.150> go<00:05:52.240> ahead<00:05:52.330> and<00:05:52.539> store<00:05:52.720> it

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
so we didn't go ahead and store it

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.420 
so we didn't go ahead and store it
research<00:05:53.380> which<00:05:53.770> brings<00:05:54.039> me<00:05:54.190> to<00:05:54.340> a<00:05:54.370> question

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
research which brings me to a question

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.460 
research which brings me to a question
what<00:05:55.150> do<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:55.449> do<00:05:55.659> and<00:05:55.870> we<00:05:55.990> haven't<00:05:56.229> had<00:05:56.320> this

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
what do you do and we haven't had this

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.110 
what do you do and we haven't had this
problem<00:05:56.800> too<00:05:56.949> much<00:05:57.130> but<00:05:57.310> a<00:05:57.340> couple<00:05:57.669> times<00:05:57.880> if

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
problem too much but a couple times if

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.270 
problem too much but a couple times if
you<00:05:58.509> make<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.719> bunch<00:05:59.020> and<00:05:59.320> they<00:05:59.860> don't<00:06:00.039> like<00:06:00.250> it

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
you make a bunch and they don't like it

would buy the actual packaged version
first<00:06:17.050> introduce<00:06:17.620> my<00:06:17.740> things<00:06:18.009> to<00:06:18.159> taste<00:06:18.430> oh
