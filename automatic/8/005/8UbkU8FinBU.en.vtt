peace making especially for our school I

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.120 
peace making especially for our school I
think<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.360> kind<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.630> brings<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:17.019> energy<00:02:17.980> into

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
think it kind of brings this energy into
