this is a deal 8200 dimension dimension
8200<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:26.000> got<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.270> long<00:00:27.540> time<00:00:28.050> ago<00:00:28.610> from

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
8200 I got a long time ago from

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.709 
8200 I got a long time ago from
somewhere<00:00:31.489> but<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:34.879> upgraded<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:36.030> computer<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
somewhere but I upgraded the computer a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.239 
somewhere but I upgraded the computer a
lot<00:00:37.850> it<00:00:38.850> has<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> pentium<00:00:39.539> 4<00:00:39.839> 2.8<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.739> think<00:00:41.129> it

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:41.249 
lot it has a pentium 4 2.8 I think it

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.009 
lot it has a pentium 4 2.8 I think it
should<00:00:41.399> put<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.609> two<00:00:41.820> point<00:00:42.120> six<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.690> i'll<00:00:42.780> put<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
should put a two point six so i'll put a

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.549 
should put a two point six so i'll put a
2.8<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.629> found<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.899> many<00:00:46.199> of<00:00:46.440> these

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
2.8 in it I found so many of these

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.520 
2.8 in it I found so many of these
Rambis<00:00:47.309> machines<00:00:47.839> that<00:00:48.839> I've<00:00:49.050> got<00:00:49.350> the
