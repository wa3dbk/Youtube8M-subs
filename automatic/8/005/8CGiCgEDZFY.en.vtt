paint we use it to seal paint after it's
been<00:00:26.640> primed<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.330> really<00:00:27.570> really

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
been primed so it's really really

Ripley kind of roughed in but this isn't

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.780 
Ripley kind of roughed in but this isn't
this<00:01:49.770> isn't<00:01:50.009> good<00:01:50.159> enough<00:01:50.189> rest

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
this isn't good enough rest

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.219 
this isn't good enough rest
we<00:01:51.030> need<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.299> smooth<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.780> Louise<00:01:52.140> the

we need to smooth it out Louise the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.160 
we need to smooth it out Louise the
planting<00:01:52.560> hammer<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.670> a

planting hammer and get this to a
virtually<00:01:55.170> primer<00:01:55.500> ready<00:01:55.860> condition<00:01:56.219> we're

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
virtually primer ready condition we're

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.819 
virtually primer ready condition we're
gonna<00:01:57.030> use<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:57.960> body<00:01:58.409> filler<00:01:58.680> as

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
gonna use as little body filler as

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.270 
gonna use as little body filler as
possible

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
inside of the cab here so we'll just

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.140 
inside of the cab here so we'll just
start<00:02:09.200> taking<00:02:09.410> pieces<00:02:09.920> out<00:02:10.100> now<00:02:10.880> here's<00:02:11.060> a

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
start taking pieces out now here's a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.930 
start taking pieces out now here's a
good<00:02:11.300> example<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:12.860> little<00:02:13.400> piece<00:02:13.550> here<00:02:13.760> that's

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
good example a little piece here that's

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.620 
good example a little piece here that's
been<00:02:14.830> beat<00:02:15.830> up<00:02:15.860> it's<00:02:16.640> got<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.880> crack<00:02:17.120> here<00:02:17.450> this

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
been beat up it's got a crack here this

been beat up it's got a crack here this
goes<00:02:17.810> underneath<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.290> radiator<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:20.560> like

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
goes underneath the radiator and like

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.140 
goes underneath the radiator and like
those<00:02:21.830> other<00:02:22.070> pieces<00:02:22.280> we'll<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.790> fix<00:02:22.970> as

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
those other pieces we'll just fix as

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.520 
those other pieces we'll just fix as
much<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.540> as<00:02:23.600> we<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:24.020> with<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> hammer<00:02:24.440> and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
much of this as we can with a hammer and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.240 
much of this as we can with a hammer and
dolly<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:25.060> weld<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.590> people<00:02:27.590> call<00:02:27.800> it<00:02:27.920> hammer

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
dolly and weld it people call it hammer

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.250 
dolly and weld it people call it hammer
welding<00:02:28.760> that's<00:02:29.330> actually<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.750> blacksmith

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
welding that's actually a blacksmith

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.020 
welding that's actually a blacksmith
term<00:02:30.770> where<00:02:31.010> you<00:02:31.100> take<00:02:31.280> two<00:02:31.460> separate<00:02:31.820> pieces

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
term where you take two separate pieces

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.720 
term where you take two separate pieces
of<00:02:32.240> metal<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:33.040> melt<00:02:34.040> them<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.340> Hammer<00:02:34.580> them

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
of metal and melt them and Hammer them

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.330 
of metal and melt them and Hammer them
together<00:02:35.020> what<00:02:36.020> we'll<00:02:36.200> be<00:02:36.380> doing<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.710> oxygen

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
together what we'll be doing is oxygen

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.080 
together what we'll be doing is oxygen
acetylene<00:02:37.490> fuel<00:02:38.320> torch<00:02:39.320> welding<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:40.090> then

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
acetylene fuel torch welding and then

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.230 
acetylene fuel torch welding and then
use<00:02:41.270> the<00:02:41.390> hammer<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.750> Dolly<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:43.820> work<00:02:44.000> the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
use the hammer and Dolly to to work the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.240 
use the hammer and Dolly to to work the
the<00:02:44.270> shrunken<00:02:45.050> area<00:02:45.350> caused<00:02:45.709> by<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.920> torch

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the shrunken area caused by the torch

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.560 
the shrunken area caused by the torch
and<00:02:46.430> that's<00:02:46.550> where<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.790> gets<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.060> term<00:02:47.240> hammer

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
and that's where it gets the term hammer

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.880 
and that's where it gets the term hammer
welding<00:02:48.020> it's<00:02:48.440> actually<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:48.800> different

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
welding it's actually a different

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.620 
welding it's actually a different
process<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.370> we'll<00:02:52.550> be<00:02:52.700> we'll<00:02:53.090> be<00:02:53.120> doing<00:02:53.480> this

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
process so we'll be we'll be doing this

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.449 
process so we'll be we'll be doing this
bodywork<00:02:54.020> in<00:02:54.380> our<00:02:54.530> shop<00:02:54.830> down<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.220> street

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
bodywork in our shop down the street

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.750 
bodywork in our shop down the street
that's<00:02:55.610> being<00:02:55.820> renovated<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:58.459> know<00:02:58.580> this

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
that's being renovated and you know this

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.000 
that's being renovated and you know this
next<00:02:59.090> time<00:02:59.300> you'll<00:02:59.480> see<00:02:59.630> us<00:02:59.780> we'll<00:03:00.260> be<00:03:00.440> we'll

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
next time you'll see us we'll be we'll

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.190 
next time you'll see us we'll be we'll
be<00:03:01.100> doing<00:03:01.400> bodywork<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.540> primer<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.080> paint

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
be doing bodywork and primer and paint

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.710 
be doing bodywork and primer and paint
on<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.709> and<00:03:04.239> it's<00:03:05.239> going<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.420> come<00:03:05.570> together

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
on this and it's going to come together

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.630 
on this and it's going to come together
really<00:03:06.110> quick<00:03:06.410> it's<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.709> smaller<00:03:07.010> car<00:03:07.340> and

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
really quick it's a smaller car and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.660 
really quick it's a smaller car and
those<00:03:08.239> tend<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.690> go<00:03:08.840> quite<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.769> bit<00:03:09.950> faster<00:03:10.100> but

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
those tend to go quite a bit faster but

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.500 
those tend to go quite a bit faster but
when<00:03:10.820> they're<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.150> good<00:03:11.360> of<00:03:11.390> condition

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
when they're in this good of condition

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.190 
when they're in this good of condition
then<00:03:12.170> things<00:03:12.380> go<00:03:12.530> really<00:03:12.830> really<00:03:12.950> fast
