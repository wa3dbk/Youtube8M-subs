00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
fantastic I I think that if I had to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.940 
fantastic I I think that if I had to
talk<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.610> couple<00:01:48.270> where<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:49.350> person<00:01:49.740> was

naturally thin and the other person was

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.160 
naturally thin and the other person was
obese<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:53.490> would<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.630> do<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> best<00:01:54.990> I

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
