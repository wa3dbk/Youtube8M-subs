00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.830
 different see once dc 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.730
 I got down to universe online 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.199
 loaded and a little bit on 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.359
 played on the playstation 4 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.009
 the same with ward frame in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.870
 this video would like to say you okay what 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.059
 I already have some experience with it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.469
 the playstation made with sony 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.960
 yourself and in the free to play model 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.250
 and also what's coming in the near future 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.510
 I have the plans with these games what 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.210
 content a little bit different than 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.559
 basically only on the computer 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.789
 I was able to play two games once 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.590
 download that was a cramp 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.360
 why i made a psn of course 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.100
 make store account and there I have 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.750
 already know largest problem country for me 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.039
 I'm not German, I mean 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.510
 no german identity card no 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.000
 german passport for the reason i can in 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.969
 psn-store do not buy anything I have to 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.280
 always buy psn store and then this 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.750
 somehow my credit recharge since me 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.640
 at the psn store can not prove 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.439
 We are so big problem over 18 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.869
 because some free to play games due 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.430
 age restriction not as free to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.130
 play games may be offered at 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.840
 sony but actually cost something 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.200
 that is at wolfram so it costs 50 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.180
 cent 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.369
 Blackwater showers are also similar to costumes 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.080
 on 50 cent dc universe online has just 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.580
 No age restrictions because of this 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.350
 so download it free-to-play that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.030
 There are many free to play games 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.619
 which costs just 50 cents 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.930
 what it pays or what it does 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.759
 costs then as in game currency that was 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.860
 was among the first hurdle I had the same 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.470
 also a playstation store or at the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.970
 psn plus membership for these too 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.710
 I had to buy extra because I did not 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.759
 could prove that I was 18 years old 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.570
 but now one for twelve months 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.770
 completed 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.200
 that means one of the first projects 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.049
 I actually always have it for you 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.579
 the current games of psn stores ps 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.790
 plus 8 life I mean 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.110
 sps plus with ps plus membership 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.579
 as this game imagine because 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.469
 You 've always had six games like that 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.149
 the free for a month and the 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.770
 next games coming out on 8 April 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.939
 that means I will be towards the end of the week 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.560
 you probably all players once 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.849
 So why show an overview ? 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.290
 membership costs, i think 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.910
 now just under 60 euros for twelve months 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.989
 I do not find that much six 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.489
 Games is a cool thing 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.319
 but you can also have a month like that 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.730
 memberships or that is 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.290
 maybe it's one or the other game 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.520
 here where he says that I wanted to have 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.739
 but I always wanted to play that 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.569
 not buy and therefore worth it 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.769
 maybe for you then for 1 or 2 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.150
 months this membership 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.470
 You can complete it on a monthly basis 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.870
 cancel and so on and so forth 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.519
 it I thought to myself that I will show you 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.810
 because it's free somewhere 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.610
 games are just that to the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.810
 membership is there for me if 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.190
 Do not be mad you need this too 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.830
 membership to actually online 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.269
 to be able to play against others that was 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.380
 part of the xbox in any case duty and 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.420
 I think the playstation is at 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.440
 most games of duty and there 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.790
 it could be for one or the other 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.130
 actually worthwhile 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.450
 I'll just continue now yes 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.799
 At first the players give me a little bit 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.120
 to look more closely because maybe small 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.190
 to make reviews but not how much 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.140
 long as five to six minutes then 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.790
 also whenever something new comes out and 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.230
 I also have gta online what I have 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.019
 just doing some active games 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.060
 a lot of fun and in this 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.590
 context once respectful to all 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.090
 who can handle the controller 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.980
 I realized then I'm not anymore 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.049
 in there fighting went twice great though 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.239
 everything you need to be where you need to be is me 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.709
 completely out so I have really long 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.239
 used to reasonably baked 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.769
 and I realize I miss 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.420
 my mouse and a keyboard 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.769
 I just got used to it very much 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.019
 which I have also asked 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.130
 actually mortal kombat ickx and that 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.019
 I probably will not 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.470
 can show neither in the stream nor on 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.480
 youtube 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.489
 because the game is here in Germany 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.750
 become infected before release because 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.910
 I'm pretty sure because it just 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.769
 is too brutal for the German laws 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.880
 I also order them from Austria 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.720
 So in germany get the faith 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.549
 I do not buy at all 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.900
 and yes , I would definitely be there 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.200
 inquire what I can do with it 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.000
 game 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.019
 I'm really looking forward to it and me 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.400
 I would like to know a bit about it 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.329
 show because it's also a very cool one 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.889
 Game what I so far 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.510
 I actually saw that 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.680
 song how is the right situation again 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.120
 is you have noticed with the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.190
 larger youtube there were problems with 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.090
 your light was indexed the likely 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.040
 it does not show me time anymore 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.389
 or anyone else 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.220
 written that they leave that 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.639
 and yes I'm not 100 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.170
 percent in info yes that has always been 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.480
 give a brief overview of what 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.250
 she is currently so busy for the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.630
 play offs flawlessly sees tungsten 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.609
 great on the playstation 4 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.229
 works great too, so it works 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.840
 is there were only made for 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.400
 and dc universe is online 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.960
 but still there is fun so I 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.889
 find that it is also in the game what you are 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.080
 actually also playstation times 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.910
 It can cost nothing you can watch 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.229
 Do a lot and you are welcome 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.880
 in the comments write which 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.350
 games should I introduce you where you 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.669
 Hey , I've been thinking about that 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.050
 Maybe I download that 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.370
 It is not exactly small in part 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.840
 and you do not have unlimited numbers 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.130
 disk space on the playstation 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.449
 then just write in the comments 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.260
 I'll see what I actually do 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.560
 can make 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.550
 I also have hot dogs and 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.229
 mode shadow I have somehow in the 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.270
 offer at media market for 49 euros 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.120
 just bought a pc game something 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.350
 such a three-pack goes online 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.460
 I will definitely do it now 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.070
 I'll see a workmate there 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.300
 borrow platform becomes one 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.600
 Colleague from linen walls with it 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.600
 through is 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.050
 I'll be able to look at it in 1886, too 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.830
 so something on the playstation which I like 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.540
 can still look 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.669
 but I'm very curious what you are 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.680
 want to see it and fit me so 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.270
 diligently write and pack comments 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.500
 I also have a link to the video i.com 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.260
 I bought all the things there 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.090
 is called the psm the psn credit a ps 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.440
 plus membership if you like about it 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.090
 buy war against war one more 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.160
 small percentage approach though 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.110
 your better service prefers to buy there 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.729
 and does not come over the turks it was 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.010
 Just leave it to all of you 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.060
 So people I hope we'll see you then 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:37.800
 in my next video and until then 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.800
 I'm out once
