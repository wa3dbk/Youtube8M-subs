 64 bits as a processor and we have lte 4g 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.200
 in the back we found this 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.560
 sticker 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.549

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.810

 instructions that everyone knows and 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.710
 is already and well let's move on to what 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.710
 is the mobile phone 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.680
 as you see is a 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.110
 it's quite big as it occupies almost 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.050
 all my whole hand as you see 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.570

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.170
 front camera is 5 there we have the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.360
 sensor 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.560
 notifications read as you see there that is 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.830
 they illuminate green and then here 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.690
 the infrared after we have 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:47.880
 in the back we have a camera 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:51.570
 of 3 megapixels the microphone and we have 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:55.370

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.370
 and below we have the speaker 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.980
 in the left front they will face 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.200
 on the left side is totally 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.080
 clean is free of buttons and in this 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.709
 side as we do as I said 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.709
 is what is the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:17.170
 the volume the blocking the sd and the sim and 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.900
 good as you see in the background 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.140
 It is quite customizable as I see you 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.880
 how are you going to see now as you see 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.530
 I have a good subject to have been 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.230
 on twitter well here I do not have a 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.020
 little prepared everything for my tastes here 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.110
 we have the 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.340
 now with time the music the 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.130
 next optimization is an application 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.340
 of the mobile then we have twitter 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.210
 web instagram is everything does not go down 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.210
 electric 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.930
 spotify 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.550
 I am a player 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.550
 on youtube and play store 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.330
 good and things to emphasize 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.590
 some negative things that as you can see 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.260
 They have a menu option 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.500
 it's all in the same pages here 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.420
 there's a calendar and what's google 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.380
 well here that we're going to meet 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.650
 good 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.620
 this backwards this to measure us to the 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.200
 main mode and this to remove the 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.210
 Applications 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.280
 As you can see, I have many applications 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.770
 open look at all the applications that 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.889
 I have open and the mobile still flows 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.469
 cool 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.430
 and then have your own 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:39.909
 features like gallery videos etc 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.909
 and good 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.800
 and it's pretty cool on the mobile 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.710
 liked the truth is fine and the material 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.900
 it resembles a little 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.950
 to our beloved our dear 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 apple paper 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.720
 and I do not know more things to highlight here 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.570
 we have a sound 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.430
 and then we have here an application of 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.880
 Huawei that is administered as an option 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.470
 phone is analyzed by you and so on 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.120
 we have also to use that is the 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.760
 button from the beginning that we're going to 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.249
 optimize and that goes using then 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.289
 we have more things we have 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.869
 we have two applications that serve you 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.609
 find worth issues topics this is a 

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:26.120
 pretty cool game thing 

00:05:21.609 --> 00:05:28.040
 for example you will see in this more 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.310
 and right now I bet you one but if 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.100
 we put the theme of the hobbit how are you 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.129
 to see now to apply what we apply and now 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.699
 you will see how everything changes 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:41.889
 applied theme look how it changes everything 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.629
 change for example now the call is 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.289
 a sword to see if you can appreciate 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:48.580
 that does not want to focus and changes everything 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.169
 change all applications by 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.169
 example files that is a chest etc 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.420
 then when blocking for example 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.480
 we unlock 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.920
 we can do and to unlock it now 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.449
 how is it easy 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.840
 or so 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.460
 we take here on the sword to the edge and what 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.490
 we drag and then we have the pattern 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.419
 I do not care what you see 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.540
 and so then we also have to see if the 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:19.639
 meeting 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:22.729
 a magnifying glass a pretty good magnifying glass 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:25.300
 it has a flash to see what 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.300
 as 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.689
 in the small print 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.689
 micro SD 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:40.099
 captive make sure it looks pretty good 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.389
 and good to see has a good flashlight and 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.729
 to see what else we have we have to 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:46.819
 update we have the radio and we have a 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:49.099
 mode except the mirror mode is for 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:52.689
 see you to make you fish etc. 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:57.309
 what things I do and good 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:59.849
 this to play with if you want to clean 

00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:59.849
 mirror 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.590
 and we have taken a picture 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.590
 there is 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:14.320
 and I think it's already 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.270
 things to highlight is a good terminal what 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.810
 Pilla with vodafone in truth this 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:22.750
 terminal costs about 350 400 euros 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:27.090
 although it has come out quite cheap and I 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.090
 I think it's a good pack for the price 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:33.640
 that suits us is recommended with 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.920
 everything it brings and with a cover that 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.830
 I 've never seen it on any cell phone and 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.290
 good and here it ends already what is a 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.660
 small review that I wanted my 

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:46.560
 mobile and see you in the next video 

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.560
 until next time 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.030
 and has
