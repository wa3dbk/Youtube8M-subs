00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.630

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.059
 and 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.930
 I understand that life is not easy but 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.490

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.610
 hope and not stay in the 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:30.020

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.759
 of that god our creator is love and 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.380
 who has been in charge of preparing a plan 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.790
 to eradicate pain and suffering 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.840
 to humanity 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.320
 I would like to show you that plan tell me what 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.640
 things God has planned to do look what 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.860
 says the psalm chapter 37 verse 29 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.430
 please have the kindness of yourself 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.800
 read it thank the righteous themselves will sew 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.320
 the earth and they will receive forever on 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.059
 she 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.500
 Imagine people who crave 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.379
 you will have an opportunity 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.780
 wonderful will live forever on the 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.900
 land where there will be no more crimes 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.090
 the bad guys will not exist, so the 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.290
 bad people god is going to remove it from 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.300
 correct planet of the entire planet of 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.130
 way that only people will remain 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.830
 want to do what is good in the eyes 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.299
 of God now look at another promise in 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.310
 ecclesiastes 14 a generation goes away and 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.970
 a generation comes but the earth 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.710
 there is an indefinite time 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.229
 note that there is a very obvious truth 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.289
 although it seems impossible for what it does 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.420
 today the man our planet 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.119
 will subsist forever, that is, the being 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.190
 human will not destroy it will end 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.850
 with pollution and everything bad that 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.590
 has made man with her so is God 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.229
 will take care of giving the solution 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.720
 definitive to all this now let me 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.830
 show you another very encouraging promise in 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.950
 Isaiah chapter 25 verse 8 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.020
 read it please he will really swallow 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.330
 to death forever and the lord 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.860
 sovereign jehovah will certainly cleanse 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.930
 tears all over his face 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.090
 and the reproach of his people away from 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.300
 the whole earth because that organism what 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.210
 has spoken the death will be eliminated to 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.180
 what do you mean and this, although 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.280
 seems to make no sense is a solution 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.200
 radical that god will do to the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.270
 humanity one of the greatest 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.720
 sufferings is death and god the 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.910
 will eliminate in other words the people 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.070
 loyal to God will have the perspective of 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.530
 live forever on earth with 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.490
 perfect health and with renewed strength 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.830
