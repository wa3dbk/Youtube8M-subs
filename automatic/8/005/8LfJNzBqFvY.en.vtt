00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
that's all I can think of I put in the

same pocket or bag as your phone so it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870 
same pocket or bag as your phone so it
started<00:01:25.590> off<00:01:25.680> pretty<00:01:25.920> smooth<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.520> gave<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
started off pretty smooth I gave it a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.609 
started off pretty smooth I gave it a
few<00:01:27.000> clanks<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.420> scratches<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> key<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
few clanks and scratches with the key to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319 
few clanks and scratches with the key to
get<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> legitimately<00:01:29.430> scuffed<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
get it legitimately scuffed up and

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.749 
get it legitimately scuffed up and
simulate<00:01:30.810> being<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> same<00:01:31.619> pocket<00:01:31.920> but

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
simulate being in the same pocket but

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.330 
simulate being in the same pocket but
the<00:01:33.180> way<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.320> really<00:01:34.799> don't<00:01:35.100> like

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the way I see it I really don't like

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219 
the way I see it I really don't like
intentionally<00:01:35.880> scratching<00:01:36.540> your<00:01:36.659> devices<00:01:37.049> so

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
intentionally scratching your devices so

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.530 
intentionally scratching your devices so
I<00:01:37.259> did<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.979> guys<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:39.000> thumbs<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.390> for

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
I did this for you guys so thumbs up for

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.480 
I did this for you guys so thumbs up for
that<00:01:39.689> down<00:01:39.930> below<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.650> sure<00:01:40.890> enough<00:01:41.159> after<00:01:41.340> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that down below but sure enough after a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.460 
that down below but sure enough after a
few<00:01:41.700> minutes<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.119> scratches<00:01:42.600> were<00:01:42.780> mostly

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
few minutes the scratches were mostly

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.330 
few minutes the scratches were mostly
minimized

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
minimized

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.060 
minimized
I<00:01:44.369> say<00:01:44.700> minimized<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.509> completely<00:01:46.140> gone<00:01:46.380> but

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
I say minimized not completely gone but

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.889 
I say minimized not completely gone but
definitely<00:01:47.189> way<00:01:47.700> less<00:01:47.939> noticeable<00:01:48.270> than<00:01:48.479> when

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
definitely way less noticeable than when

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.600 
definitely way less noticeable than when
they<00:01:49.020> were<00:01:49.079> fresh<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.710> would<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.950> awesome<00:01:50.130> if

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
they were fresh this would be awesome if

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.710 
they were fresh this would be awesome if
you<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.850> dropped<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.329> phone<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
you like dropped your phone on the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.929 
you like dropped your phone on the
concrete<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.350> picked<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.130> back<00:01:53.280> up<00:01:53.340> put<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.850> in

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
concrete and picked it back up put it in

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.819 
concrete and picked it back up put it in
your<00:01:54.030> pocket<00:01:54.180> walked<00:01:54.689> home<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.259> then<00:01:55.619> took<00:01:55.740> it

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
your pocket walked home and then took it

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.469 
your pocket walked home and then took it
out<00:01:55.950> your<00:01:56.070> pocket<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.490> few<00:01:56.520> minutes<00:01:57.030> later<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
out your pocket a few minutes later and

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.090 
out your pocket a few minutes later and
you'd<00:01:57.780> barely<00:01:58.140> even<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.560> able<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.829> tell<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
you'd barely even be able to tell you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.069 
you'd barely even be able to tell you
dropped<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.490> phone<00:01:59.729> sounds<00:02:00.479> great<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:00.960> take

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
dropped your phone sounds great but take

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.539 
dropped your phone sounds great but take
a<00:02:01.110> look<00:02:01.259> back<00:02:01.380> at<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.619> official<00:02:02.040> video<00:02:02.280> from

right now I'm by New York City it's cold
it's<00:02:25.650> windy<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.520> maybe<00:02:26.940> 55<00:02:27.540> degrees

Fahrenheit or 13 degrees Celsius on a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.479 
Fahrenheit or 13 degrees Celsius on a
nice<00:02:30.959> day<00:02:31.200> out<00:02:31.319> here<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.830> decided<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.250> try<00:02:32.430> to

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
nice day out here so I decided to try to

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.640 
nice day out here so I decided to try to
simulate<00:02:32.760> some<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.390> heat<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.810> heal<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.260> by

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
simulate some of the heat to heal it by

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.140 
simulate some of the heat to heal it by
actually<00:02:34.980> rubbing<00:02:35.250> against<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> scratches

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
actually rubbing against the scratches

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.330 
actually rubbing against the scratches
really<00:02:36.540> fast<00:02:36.780> for<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.080> bit<00:02:37.260> now<00:02:37.410> as<00:02:37.590> crazy<00:02:38.010> as

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
really fast for a bit now as crazy as

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.130 
really fast for a bit now as crazy as
you<00:02:38.519> may<00:02:38.670> look<00:02:38.910> trying<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.660> warm<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:39.989> your

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
you may look trying to warm up your

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.780 
you may look trying to warm up your
phone<00:02:40.319> by<00:02:40.530> clutching<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.190> your<00:02:41.310> body<00:02:41.430> or

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
phone by clutching it to your body or

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.970 
phone by clutching it to your body or
rubbing<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.630> really<00:02:42.930> fast<00:02:43.200> or<00:02:43.500> playing<00:02:43.800> some

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
rubbing it really fast or playing some

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.620 
rubbing it really fast or playing some
intensive<00:02:44.459> games<00:02:44.700> as<00:02:44.940> long<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.480> you're<00:02:45.600> not

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
intensive games as long as you're not

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.850 
intensive games as long as you're not
microwaving<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.680> actually

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
microwaving it you can actually

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.009 
microwaving it you can actually
accelerate<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.970> healing<00:02:48.000> process<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.900> little

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
accelerate the healing process a little

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.039 
accelerate the healing process a little
bit<00:02:49.290> by<00:02:49.739> warming<00:02:50.220> up<00:02:50.370> device<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.959> know

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
bit by warming up device and you know

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.840 
bit by warming up device and you know
that's<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.530> pretty<00:02:52.769> neat<00:02:52.950> trick<00:02:52.980> now<00:02:53.430> finally<00:02:53.819> I

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
that's a pretty neat trick now finally I

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.970 
that's a pretty neat trick now finally I
took<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.180> knife<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.720> took<00:02:55.049> a<00:02:55.230> deep<00:02:55.590> scratch

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
took a knife and took a deep scratch

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.530 
took a knife and took a deep scratch
clean<00:02:56.519> across<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:57.030> back<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.420> device

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
clean across the back of the device

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.229 
clean across the back of the device
right<00:02:58.049> under<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.500> lte-a<00:02:59.069> logo<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.849> tried<00:03:00.209> a

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
right under the lte-a logo and tried a

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.820 
right under the lte-a logo and tried a
few<00:03:00.420> things<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.780> warm<00:03:01.049> up<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> device<00:03:01.560> and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
few things to warm up the device and

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.740 
few things to warm up the device and
heal<00:03:02.099> it<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.730> been<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.880> few<00:03:03.209> hours<00:03:03.239> since

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
heal it and it's been a few hours since

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.300 
heal it and it's been a few hours since
then<00:03:04.019> but<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.290> knife<00:03:04.500> scratch<00:03:04.860> isn't
