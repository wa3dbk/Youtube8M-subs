00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.750
 Now there are very good days, they are already sec 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.430
 and ready with the forecast details 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.200
 of time, accompany me, the image of 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.150
 satellite I'm going to talk about what happens 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.980
 for our region because from the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.680
 today I know what I say, ma'am 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360
 the heat will be felt and go 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.060
 quite in the 'sultana of the north' not 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.410
 only for the city of Monterrey 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.869
 practically the entire region or portion 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 northeast of the nation is going to feel this 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.920
 Here I talk to you is to say temperatures very 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.740
 elevated some morning mist 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.170
 we also hope that the environment will be 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.759
 pretty dry we estimate at least that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.670
 speaking now of the pacific zone 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.070
 the tendency of the training already of the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.300
 tropical storm of course you 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.030
 I will present in the following 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.920
 moments on screen good I got to the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.140
 region or rather to the portion 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.210
 precisely from the Pacific as a 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 tropical storm even though it's going to 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.710
 intensify to make a hurricane 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 category 1 its winds are sustained 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.579
 about sixty five 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 kilometers per hour the pressure that has 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.059
 this system is quite low and 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.550
 we can precisely appreciate in 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.159
 screen where already some sectors both 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.820
 from Michoacán also from the zone of 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.770
 Warrior 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.110
 it is in an increase of cloudiness and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.240
 the same for the southern area of ​​our 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.760
 entity at least as we can appreciate 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.860
 on screen this system is going to be formed 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.890
 like a category 1 hurricane for the day 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.560
 Friday during the early morning winds 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.840
 could reach up to 148 kilometers 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.570
 per hour and mostly we could say 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 that will affect the central pacific area 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.280
 speaking for example of jalisco colima 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.170
 nayarit also part of michoacán and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.580
 could extend to the area of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.700
 warrior for this for the next 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.470
 Sunday will be at least approaching 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.180
 quite bringing moisture as high 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.890
 in those sectors here everything happens 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.479
 opposite since good and if what 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.250
 we clear what has been dominating 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.229
 lately and will continue to be in the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.729
 next days the atmosphere will be 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.410
 quite warm today because no 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.100
 will be the exception the maxims will haunt 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.930
 more or less between 33 36 and 31 degrees 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.700
 centigrade in new laredo stones 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.530
 black reynosa matamoros city victoria 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.050
 the rain is completely maintained 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.300
 absent see nothing more in durango until 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.009
 the 39 degrees centigrade 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.440
 zacatecas with nice atmosphere more or 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.090
 less in the 23 so the morning to 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.489
 they are slightly cool 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.319
 well more than rich here in our entity 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.970
 federative happens the opposite already 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.129
 how good we have the contrast of 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.349
 temperatures quite high the 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.150
 maximums are going to be around more or less in 37 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.640
 for the mop area there are also in 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.400
 china in linares at 38 but arroyo 12 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.870
 with 29 in such Texan territory 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.790
 it seems that today comes the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.530
 blessing of rain temperatures 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.420
 they hover in the 92 tomorrow 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.519
 Wednesday and next Thursday it 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.709
 keeps the thermometer high among the 90s 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.390
 but the precipitation disappears in 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.200
 dallas today rains arrive at the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.769
 92 next days among the 93 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.630
 disappears the probability of 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.430
 precipitation at least at the moment 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.959
 we have a nice condition twenty one 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.930
 degrees centigrade south of the city 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.000
 a humid environment prevails but 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.310
 enough sun has come out during the afternoon 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.530
 we expect a maximum of 34 degrees the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.090
 environment will be quite comfortable but 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.099
 can take advantage to go washing the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.930
 car goes to some household chores 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.879
 I had pending because good 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.739
 dry environment trend will be what 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.660
 will be dominating unless the 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.370
 precipitation is going to be absent 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.140
 yes yes if you have planned to do 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.910
 some outdoor activity 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.100
 It is very important that not only 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.950
 use a sunscreen but 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.650
 also good take enough water and 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.800
 while being exposed to the rays v 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.360
 keep precisely with the blocker 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.910
 equally with pretty clear clothes for 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.530
 avoid so much heat in the 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.450
 next days we see that the heat 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.010
 intensifies reaches the dry line the 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.870
 region and will cause the 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.989
 temperatures remain between 38 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.510
 40 and 36 degrees centigrade for 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.459
 Wednesday Thursday Friday on Saturday 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.850
 decrease this condition by approaching 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.500
 temperatures of 33 31 degrees can 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.720
 to rain a little bit so good for that 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.489
 Then we will be benefited by 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.040
 last I present that postcard that I 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.200
