I<00:01:30.119> had<00:01:31.119> this<00:01:31.600> is<00:01:31.810> an<00:01:31.960> exact<00:01:32.350> one<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:32.619> had<00:01:32.860> on<00:01:33.039> it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.010 
I had this is an exact one I had on it
but<00:01:33.369> it's<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:33.970> like<00:01:34.179> it<00:01:34.390> except<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.840> one<00:01:34.990> I

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
but it's just like it except the one I

had on it was brand new I got for free
and<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.069> think<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.340> know<00:01:39.399> why<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:39.670> got<00:01:39.909> for<00:01:40.060> free

and I think I know why I got for free

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.399 
and I think I know why I got for free
because<00:01:40.360> soon<00:01:40.600> as<00:01:40.659> I<00:01:40.720> put<00:01:40.929> it<00:01:41.020> on<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.289> when<00:01:41.380> I

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
because soon as I put it on it when I

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.740 
because soon as I put it on it when I
seen<00:01:41.619> about<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.830> week<00:01:42.069> and<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:43.509> when<00:01:43.629> they

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
seen about a week and then when they

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.999 
seen about a week and then when they
went<00:01:43.959> to<00:01:43.989> start<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:44.440> car<00:01:44.649> and<00:01:44.679> he<00:01:44.830> just

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
went to start the car and he just

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.850 
went to start the car and he just
started<00:01:45.280> freewheeling<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.770> wouldn't<00:01:47.770> engage

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
started freewheeling and wouldn't engage

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.809 
started freewheeling and wouldn't engage
with<00:01:48.129> the<00:01:48.220> flywheel<00:01:48.989> so<00:01:49.989> I<00:01:50.050> said<00:01:50.530> that

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
with the flywheel so I said that

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.109 
with the flywheel so I said that
then<00:01:51.819> I<00:01:51.910> put<00:01:52.149> this<00:01:52.300> on<00:01:52.539> it<00:01:52.690> this<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.679> another

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
then I put this on it this is another

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.770 
then I put this on it this is another
gear<00:01:55.119> reduction<00:01:55.539> starter<00:01:55.929> but<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:56.950> one's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
gear reduction starter but this one's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.859 
gear reduction starter but this one's
off<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.840> 90<00:01:59.379> Lincoln<00:02:00.209> and<00:02:01.209> I<00:02:01.239> think<00:02:01.450> was<00:02:01.569> already

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
off a 90 Lincoln and I think was already

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.630 
off a 90 Lincoln and I think was already
on<00:02:02.319> its<00:02:02.349> way<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.679> being<00:02:02.860> burned<00:02:03.069> out<00:02:03.340> because

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
on its way to being burned out because

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.119 
on its way to being burned out because
it<00:02:03.849> quit<00:02:04.030> working<00:02:04.060> too<00:02:04.509> but<00:02:04.720> all<00:02:04.840> together<00:02:05.129> you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:06.129 
it quit working too but all together you

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:09.029 
it quit working too but all together you
know<00:02:06.190> kind<00:02:06.550> of<00:02:06.610> crummy<00:02:07.060> in<00:02:07.149> there<00:02:07.769> and<00:02:08.769> after

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
know kind of crummy in there and after

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.300 
know kind of crummy in there and after
that<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.220> put<00:02:09.429> this<00:02:09.640> one<00:02:09.879> on<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.920> is<00:02:12.069> an<00:02:12.160> old

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
that I put this one on this is an old

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.280 
that I put this one on this is an old
starter<00:02:12.670> Ford<00:02:12.940> used<00:02:13.209> in<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.480> 60s<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.080> 70s

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
starter Ford used in the 60s and 70s

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.080 
starter Ford used in the 60s and 70s
before<00:02:14.739> they<00:02:14.980> switched<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.489> smaller<00:02:15.819> ones

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
before they switched to the smaller ones

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.170 
before they switched to the smaller ones
here<00:02:16.620> now<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.800> one<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.010> used<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:19.060> actually

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
here now this one I used it actually

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.660 
here now this one I used it actually
worked<00:02:19.510> pretty<00:02:19.720> good<00:02:20.040> but<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.129> problem<00:02:21.250> was

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
worked pretty good but the problem was

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.490 
worked pretty good but the problem was
if<00:02:21.819> it<00:02:21.970> got<00:02:22.150> hot<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.690> stopped<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.260> wouldn't

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
if it got hot it stopped it wouldn't

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.850 
if it got hot it stopped it wouldn't
crank<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.860> engine<00:02:24.069> over<00:02:24.129> total<00:02:24.370> cooled<00:02:24.670> off

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
crank the engine over total cooled off

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.990 
crank the engine over total cooled off
so<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:26.920> said<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.190> whole<00:02:27.280> without<00:02:27.580> again<00:02:27.819> before

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
so I said the whole without again before

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.670 
so I said the whole without again before
I<00:02:28.150> get<00:02:28.300> stranded<00:02:28.599> somewhere<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.319> went<00:02:29.530> about

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
I get stranded somewhere so I went about

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.699 
I get stranded somewhere so I went about
a<00:02:29.739> brand<00:02:30.040> new<00:02:30.190> gear<00:02:30.430> reduction<00:02:30.790> stirrer<00:02:31.709> now

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
a brand new gear reduction stirrer now

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.680 
a brand new gear reduction stirrer now
the<00:02:32.769> advantages<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.400> these<00:02:33.670> ones<00:02:33.940> are<00:02:34.120> they're

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
the advantages to these ones are they're

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.890 
the advantages to these ones are they're
smaller<00:02:35.340> they<00:02:36.340> can<00:02:36.550> withstand<00:02:36.730> way<00:02:37.330> more<00:02:37.599> heat

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
smaller they can withstand way more heat

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.229 
smaller they can withstand way more heat
and<00:02:38.459> they<00:02:39.459> have<00:02:39.580> different<00:02:39.730> gear<00:02:40.060> ratios

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
and they have different gear ratios

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.149 
and they have different gear ratios
instantly<00:02:41.050> crank<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.470> engine<00:02:41.680> over<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.920> lot

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
instantly crank the engine over a lot

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.720
