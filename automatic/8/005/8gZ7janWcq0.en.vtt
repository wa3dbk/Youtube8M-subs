00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
enough to actually even do it because i

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.059 
enough to actually even do it because i
wouldn't<00:02:33.010> hit<00:02:33.129> shots<00:02:33.459> like<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:35.530> really<00:02:35.890> was

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
just a bummed-out kind of RC but on i

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.890 
just a bummed-out kind of RC but on i
still<00:02:39.099> think<00:02:39.129> i<00:02:39.370> did<00:02:39.580> like<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.480> little<00:02:40.750> bit

still think i did like a little bit
decent<00:02:41.319> probably<00:02:42.099> a<00:02:42.129> better<00:02:42.430> than<00:02:42.610> other

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
decent probably a better than other

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.640 
decent probably a better than other
people<00:02:42.790> at<00:02:43.120> least<00:02:43.330> like<00:02:43.569> because<00:02:43.780> i've<00:02:44.379> seen

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.870 
people hit like get hit markers like
crazy<00:02:46.750> like<00:02:47.110> my<00:02:47.950> friend<00:02:48.220> Pete<00:02:48.370> but<00:02:48.579> he<00:02:48.730> just

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
crazy like my friend Pete but he just

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.160 
crazy like my friend Pete but he just

hadn't worked everything just kept

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.809 
hadn't worked everything just kept
hitting<00:02:50.349> marker<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.769> hit<00:02:50.890> marker<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.549> he

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
hitting marker and hit marker and he

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.400 
hitting marker and hit marker and he
