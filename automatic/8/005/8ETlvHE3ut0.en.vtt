00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
samoto is also linked into all this and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.340 
samoto is also linked into all this and
goes<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.340> signal<00:01:35.759> Inc<00:01:36.020> now<00:01:37.020> most<00:01:37.170> people

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
goes to the signal Inc now most people

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.649 
goes to the signal Inc now most people
think<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.770> signalling<00:01:38.250> used<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.820> calling<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
think the signalling used for calling it

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.410 
think the signalling used for calling it
can<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:40.049> used<00:01:40.340> basically<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.460> any<00:01:41.729> voice<00:01:42.150> or

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
can be used basically for any voice or

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.170 
can be used basically for any voice or
digital<00:01:42.899> mold<00:01:43.170> where<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.490> required<00:01:45.000> for

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
digital mold where it's required for

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
incoming sound from a program will

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.469 
incoming sound from a program will
trigger<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.600> radios<00:01:49.079> PTT<00:01:49.939> now<00:01:50.939> once<00:01:51.119> I've<00:01:51.299> got

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
trigger a radios PTT now once I've got

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.960 
trigger a radios PTT now once I've got
that<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.689> set<00:01:52.110> up<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.860> next<00:01:53.040> step<00:01:53.250> was<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.610> use

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
that all set up the next step was to use

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.920 
that all set up the next step was to use
team<00:01:54.960> talks<00:01:55.259> software<00:01:56.270> which<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.719> see

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
team talks software which as you can see

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.590 
team talks software which as you can see
there<00:01:58.170> Tim<00:01:58.680> talks<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.280> basically<00:01:59.729> an<00:02:00.060> internet

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
there Tim talks is basically an internet

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.060 
there Tim talks is basically an internet
voice<00:02:01.290> over<00:02:01.710> IP<00:02:02.719> program<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.469> what<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.680> does

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
voice over IP program and what that does

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.730 
voice over IP program and what that does
that<00:02:05.430> allows<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.899> basically<00:02:07.020> speak<00:02:07.560> to

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
that allows you to basically speak to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.469 
that allows you to basically speak to
other<00:02:07.920> people<00:02:07.979> via<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.759> internet<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.330> not

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
other people via the internet it's not

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.210 
other people via the internet it's not
much<00:02:09.660> different<00:02:10.080> than<00:02:10.110> Skype<00:02:10.590> or<00:02:10.890> loud<00:02:11.099> talks

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
much different than Skype or loud talks

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.880 
much different than Skype or loud talks
and<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:14.050> idea<00:02:14.470> being<00:02:15.060> when<00:02:16.060> incoming<00:02:16.660> audio

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and the idea being when incoming audio

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.290 
and the idea being when incoming audio
comes<00:02:17.890> on<00:02:18.280> team<00:02:19.180> talks<00:02:19.600> hmm<00:02:20.440> he's<00:02:21.430> fed<00:02:21.760> into

comes on team talks hmm he's fed into

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.020 
comes on team talks hmm he's fed into
the<00:02:22.390> signaling<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.890> signaling<00:02:24.370> says<00:02:24.730> ah

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
the signaling and the signaling says ah

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.690 
the signaling and the signaling says ah
somebody's<00:02:25.600> talking<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.010> triggers<00:02:27.460> the

audio and it's feeding it through its
speaker<00:03:15.820> lines<00:03:16.030> like<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.480> normally<00:03:16.630> would<00:03:16.959> if

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
speaker lines like it normally would if

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.140 
speaker lines like it normally would if
it<00:03:17.230> was<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.350> speaker<00:03:17.800> attached<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.970> it's

it was a speaker attached and it's

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.880 
it was a speaker attached and it's
feeding<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.750> into<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:21.130> signaling<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.060> then

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
feeding it into the signaling and then

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.740 
feeding it into the signaling and then
inter-team<00:03:23.890> talked<00:03:24.480> now<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.540> good<00:03:25.690> thing

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
inter-team talked now the good thing

inter-team talked now the good thing
about<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.200> signal<00:03:26.560> Inc<00:03:26.709> is<00:03:26.890> it's<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.160> USB

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
about the signal Inc is it's a USB

about the signal Inc is it's a USB
soundcard

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
soundcard

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.960 
soundcard
so<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:29.590> required<00:03:29.980> doesn't<00:03:30.310> require<00:03:30.550> use<00:03:30.940> of

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
so it required doesn't require use of

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.500 
so it required doesn't require use of
your<00:03:31.239> computers<00:03:31.840> lying<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.880> what<00:03:34.390> you

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
your computers lying in and what you

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.720 
your computers lying in and what you
must<00:03:34.690> do<00:03:35.050> when<00:03:35.350> you<00:03:35.440> first<00:03:35.680> setup<00:03:35.980> team<00:03:36.400> talks

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
must do when you first setup team talks

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.930 
must do when you first setup team talks
if<00:03:36.970> you're<00:03:37.120> going<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.330> use<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:38.820> set<00:03:39.820> the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
if you're going to use this is set the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.199 
if you're going to use this is set the
sound<00:03:40.239> system<00:03:40.900> as<00:03:41.080> you<00:03:41.380> can<00:03:41.530> see<00:03:41.799> there<00:03:42.209> the

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
sound system as you can see there the

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.130 
sound system as you can see there the
sound<00:03:43.480> device<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.620> USB<00:03:45.519> audio<00:03:45.670> device<00:03:45.940> for<00:03:46.900> in

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
sound device is USB audio device for in

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.380 
sound device is USB audio device for in
and<00:03:47.320> out<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.100> won't<00:03:48.220> use<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.519> computer<00:03:49.120> sound

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
and out so it won't use a computer sound

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.020 
and out so it won't use a computer sound
card<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:50.470> signal<00:03:50.830> link<00:03:50.980> is<00:03:51.160> its<00:03:51.370> own<00:03:51.549> sound

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
card the signal link is its own sound

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.140 
card the signal link is its own sound
card<00:03:52.299> more<00:03:52.540> or<00:03:52.630> less<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:54.250> hopefully<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:55.000> next

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
card more or less and hopefully the next

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.120 
card more or less and hopefully the next
video<00:03:55.540> it'll<00:03:55.750> be<00:03:55.840> somebody<00:03:56.170> online<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:56.860> I<00:03:56.890> can

video it'll be somebody online so I can
give<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.430> demonstration<00:03:57.640> but<00:03:58.269> that's

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
give you a demonstration but that's

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.660 
give you a demonstration but that's
basically<00:03:58.720> how<00:03:59.110> it<00:03:59.260> works<00:03:59.519> now<00:04:00.519> what<00:04:00.640> that

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
basically how it works now what that

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.120 
basically how it works now what that
means<00:04:00.820> I'm<00:04:01.330> impressed<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:01.989> likes<00:04:02.230> now<00:04:02.620> so
