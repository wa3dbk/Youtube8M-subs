now there are several ways to tune the
guitar<00:00:59.080> you<00:00:59.650> can<00:00:59.680> tune<00:00:59.980> it<00:01:00.100> by<00:01:00.250> ear<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:02.050> course

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
guitar you can tune it by ear of course

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.820 
guitar you can tune it by ear of course
if<00:01:02.650> you're<00:01:02.800> starting<00:01:03.280> out<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:04.780> like<00:01:05.500> from

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
if you're starting out from like from

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.320 
if you're starting out from like from
nothing<00:01:06.220> you're<00:01:06.430> going<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.700> need<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:06.880> reference

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
nothing you're going to need a reference

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.480 
nothing you're going to need a reference
point<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:08.410> at<00:01:08.470> least<00:01:08.560> get<00:01:08.770> one<00:01:08.979> of<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.220> strings

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
point to at least get one of the strings

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.890 
point to at least get one of the strings
in<00:01:09.850> tune<00:01:10.180> to<00:01:10.540> standard<00:01:11.200> pitch<00:01:11.470> which<00:01:11.830> is<00:01:12.070> a<00:01:12.900> 440

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
in tune to standard pitch which is a 440

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.830 
in tune to standard pitch which is a 440
is<00:01:13.990> what<00:01:14.170> it's<00:01:14.350> called<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.880> let's<00:01:16.240> assume<00:01:16.600> that

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
is what it's called so let's assume that

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.030 
is what it's called so let's assume that
your<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.020> string<00:01:17.410> is<00:01:17.619> in<00:01:17.650> tune<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.960> there<00:01:20.200> you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
your a string is in tune from there you

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.530 
your a string is in tune from there you
can<00:01:21.070> tune<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.820> D<00:01:22.119> string<00:01:22.420> by<00:01:23.140> placing<00:01:23.530> your

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
can tune the D string by placing your

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.740 
can tune the D string by placing your
finger<00:01:25.540> on<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.440> 5th<00:01:26.740> fret<00:01:27.430> of<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.630> string

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
finger on the 5th fret of the a string

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.330 
finger on the 5th fret of the a string
and<00:01:29.320> this<00:01:29.440> will<00:01:29.590> give<00:01:29.619> you<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.950> D<00:01:30.160> note

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.639 

so<00:01:35.090> for<00:01:35.420> example<00:01:35.450> if<00:01:35.929> this<00:01:36.109> string<00:01:36.320> was<00:01:36.439> out<00:01:36.619> of

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
so for example if this string was out of

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.550 
so for example if this string was out of
tune<00:01:38.320> you're<00:01:39.320> just

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.749 

fifth<00:01:43.549> fret<00:01:43.970> on<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.380> fifth<00:01:45.380> string<00:01:45.670> gives<00:01:46.670> you

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
fifth fret on the fifth string gives you

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.890 
fifth fret on the fifth string gives you
the<00:01:46.850> a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.050 

we'd<00:01:53.900> use<00:01:54.080> your<00:01:54.260> ear<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.590> tune<00:01:55.130> up<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.880> that

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
we'd use your ear to tune up to that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.030 
we'd use your ear to tune up to that
string<00:01:56.480> and<00:01:56.750> then<00:01:57.410> you<00:01:57.560> could<00:01:57.680> use<00:01:57.860> that

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
string and then you could use that

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.640 
string and then you could use that
procedure<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.700> rest<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.210> strings

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
procedure on the rest of the strings

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.620 
procedure on the rest of the strings
always<00:02:00.650> on<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:00.950> fifth<00:02:01.190> fret<00:02:01.690> I<00:02:03.880> care

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:17.610 

I<00:02:08.640> was<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.670> little<00:02:09.940> out<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.060> tune

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.950 

now<00:02:18.620> when<00:02:18.770> you<00:02:18.860> get<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.340> third<00:02:19.580> string<00:02:19.960> you

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
now when you get to the third string you

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.480 
now when you get to the third string you
need<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.170> put<00:02:21.350> your<00:02:21.500> finger<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.100> fourth

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
need to put your finger on the fourth

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.450 
need to put your finger on the fourth
fret<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:25.310> gives<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.700> B<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:27.130> then<00:02:28.130> for

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
fret that gives you the B and then for

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.600 
fret that gives you the B and then for
the<00:02:28.870> high<00:02:29.870> E<00:02:29.900> string<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.710> once<00:02:31.130> again<00:02:31.280> would

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
the high E string you once again would

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.600 
the high E string you once again would
put<00:02:31.790> your<00:02:32.030> finger<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.900> 5th<00:02:33.260> fret<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:34.400> B

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
now in the next segment we will tune up

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.519
