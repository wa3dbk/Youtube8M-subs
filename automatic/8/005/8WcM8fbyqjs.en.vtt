00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
reason why the fact is it's getting

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.429 
reason why the fact is it's getting
rather<00:00:29.519> tough<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.179> advertisers<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.840> target

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
rather tough for advertisers to target

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.700 
rather tough for advertisers to target
particular<00:00:31.710> audiences<00:00:32.369> let's<00:00:32.669> take<00:00:32.940> TV<00:00:33.420> ads

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
particular audiences let's take TV ads

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
particular audiences let's take TV ads
they're<00:00:34.710> dead<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.280> mean<00:00:35.430> who<00:00:36.030> wants<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.360> watch<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
they're dead I mean who wants to watch a

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.299 
they're dead I mean who wants to watch a
TV<00:00:36.840> advertisement<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.590> can't<00:00:37.860> remember<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
TV advertisement I can't remember the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.790 
TV advertisement I can't remember the
last<00:00:38.489> time<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.790> actually<00:00:39.090> chose<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
last time I actually chose to do so and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.709 
last time I actually chose to do so and
the<00:00:41.040> reason<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.489> i<00:00:41.670> watch<00:00:41.969> everything<00:00:42.360> on

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the reason is that i watch everything on

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.330 
the reason is that i watch everything on
a<00:00:42.780> hard<00:00:43.170> drive<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.910> off<00:00:44.910> satellite<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
a hard drive and off satellite and and

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.619 
a hard drive and off satellite and and
even<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:47.520> watching<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.879> live<00:00:48.030> program<00:00:48.300> i'll

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
even if I'm watching a live program i'll

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.630 
even if I'm watching a live program i'll
wait<00:00:48.809> five<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.230> ten<00:00:49.440> minutes<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.370> start

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
wait five to ten minutes and then start

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.279 
wait five to ten minutes and then start
watching<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.360> when<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> ads<00:00:51.750> come<00:00:52.110> I

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
watching it so that when the ads come I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.950 
watching it so that when the ads come I
just<00:00:52.530> skip<00:00:52.739> over<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.039> ads<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.399> carry<00:00:53.640> on

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
just skip over the ads and carry on

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
just skip over the ads and carry on
that's<00:00:54.960> why<00:00:55.260> there's<00:00:55.649> been<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:56.190> big<00:00:56.520> campaign

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that's why there's been a big campaign

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
that's why there's been a big campaign
in<00:00:57.270> many<00:00:57.510> European<00:00:58.079> countries<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:59.039> allowed

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
in many European countries to be allowed

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.639 
in many European countries to be allowed
to<00:00:59.820> have<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> lot<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:00.570> placement<00:01:01.079> advertising

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
to have a lot more placement advertising

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.290 
to have a lot more placement advertising
so<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> products<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.579> behind<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
so the products are are behind the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.969 
so the products are are behind the
characters<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> scenes<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.559> an<00:01:04.710> offer<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
characters in the scenes of an offer of

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.550 
characters in the scenes of an offer of
a<00:01:05.189> particular<00:01:05.519> drama<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
a particular drama and so on because the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.640 
a particular drama and so on because the
pads<00:01:07.860> aren't<00:01:08.250> being<00:01:08.760> watched<00:01:09.060> anymore<00:01:09.650> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
pads aren't being watched anymore the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
pads aren't being watched anymore the
adverts<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.220> are<00:01:11.549> being<00:01:11.760> watched<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.270> are

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
adverts that are being watched are are

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200 
adverts that are being watched are are
ones<00:01:13.229> where<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.189> ad<00:01:14.340> itself<00:01:14.580> becomes

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
ones where the the ad itself becomes

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.609 
ones where the the ad itself becomes
part<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> entertainment<00:01:15.750> package<00:01:16.320> so

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
part of the entertainment package so

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.800 
part of the entertainment package so
