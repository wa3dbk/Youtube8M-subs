00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.589
 but at your time to say to myself I did 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.209
 to our hands and ears 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.129
 it is very difficult to do without one 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.720
 cell phone including on the street 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.849
 then you use it while walking 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.849
 ah yes often better avoid 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.009
 yes yes but it bothers me most 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.750
 time it never annoys me I read you very 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.000
 little phone I am more or less 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.059
 practiced school okay this is guy 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.949
 and those who use they do what with 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.350
 General the hive I call my friends 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.790
 young people I went to arte 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.000
 has reached there I 'm going from a way of 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.840
 texting to say that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.370
 ge happened what con but finally 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.920
 that's having gotten off the buses 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.680
 shops - like in town to use 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.700
 the plan to spot me already write some 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.100
 texting sometimes and not talking I phone 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.600
 I receive text messages 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.990
 here I am consulting my mails facebook 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.909
 finally smartphones what 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.500
 especially for listening to music 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.400
 then to pass some shots of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.470
 wire 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.770
 mainly as highs are 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.649
 I often watch internet 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.659
 extra nothing very original so but 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.429
 to constantly have the ears nose on 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.000
 his smartphone is not likely to 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.380
 crushed crush not approved yes 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.090
 among this danger he has no other in 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.909
 the street the device on him but he did not 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.189
 been designed to put his life in danger 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.090
 it depends if there are people it depends 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.090
 we do it depends 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.700
 not a good idea to do this all the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.020
 time like that I'm going across the street 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 there is no passage that is at stake 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.670
 because I did it all the time and 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.009
 it's possible that I look at my 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.530
 phone by doing it what danger 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.729
 it is to type slave also you are 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.440
 always a weak 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.080
 I see people are still trying 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.860
 to call to say not much 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.890
 in fact 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.750
 the danger that sense i lose the thread of my 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.640
 ideas and I'm not paying attention to what 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.099
 is happening around me so there is 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.010
 necessarily 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.790
 a car no mute bike like read 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.989
 a book when walking finally had 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.209
 so many problems when reading when we 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.110
 look at my phone then you do not have 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.220
 never had a problem with my phone 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.120
 I pay a lot more attention to what 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.230
 I'm doing and to 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.409
 cars passing case 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.090
 it has happened to me to stumble here 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:43.220
 sometimes we go in the legs we go 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.330
 not too much where we go but no it's me 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.569
 am relatively careful anyway 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.790
 yesterday precisely I was crossing the fire 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.099
 was green and in fact I did not see that 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.959
 in the opposite direction the police borrow 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.190
 a path that was not usual and 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.480
 so suddenly I found myself in 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.680
 danger because I heard nothing 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.569
 I had my headphones on my ears 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.030
 I was in my world and then and there 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.590
 I almost got knocked down I 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.269
 a very good friend who died of 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.760
 the car accident where he was hit 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.480
 by car talking phone a 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.319
 from my best friends 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.319
 so of course
