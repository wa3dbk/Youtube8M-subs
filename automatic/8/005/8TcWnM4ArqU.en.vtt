00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 friends, hello to you, that all games 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.429
 today we will discuss 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.809
 another interesting news regarding 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:16.470
 assassin's creed of but this time we are not 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.529
 will touch the new merged assassin 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.560
 Internet which is called victory 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.140
 we touch on another assassin like this 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.230
 nor strange because ubisoft is officially 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.500
 stated that they want to release 2 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.620
 assassin per year in this case in this 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.219
 year already out on the same day 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.260
 assassin's creed unity and Rogue and it 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.590
 Of course a strange move by ubisoft 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.420
 but as they say it is doubly better but 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.120
 next year will not be an exception 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:56.090
 there are also two assassins coming out, not counting 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 Row button early next year already 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.149
 interesting information appeared in 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.460
 the internet has already been networked victory 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.580
 but we will not touch her there so all 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.540
 less clear but at the same time with 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.270
 victory comes another game say it 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.729
 so the game that has long been wandering in 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.040
 the internet is assassin's creed rooms 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.830
 the actions of the rooms will take place in 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.900
 Japan oddly enough though for me 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.150
 This is very strange because not sand 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.650
 how would say that they do not want to see 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.009
 your game 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.930
 everyones going over it go somewhere i'm not 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.189
 should this did the news on the channel if 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.210
 you can ask find video 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.490
 there everything is told in detail for me 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.670
 it certainly came as a surprise 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.040
 in theory, ubisoft refused this 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.049
 siding well here they already would 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.000
 announce the second part and it is 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.430
 every Japan is a very strange game 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.810
 most likely you will be 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.539
 released on the console of the old generation 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.190
 because victory will be released on pc and 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.710
 console of the new generation and the rooms 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.580
 Naturally should in theory go to 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:23.640
 mazda gene what is the case timeline unity 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.570
 we will play for the hero who was born 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.240
 in Japan 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.660
 which grew well, that is, in theory, he, too 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.959
 will become an assassin somehow yes how 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.500
 and our all old assassins here open 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.130
 the world will be natural too 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.670
 will be as big as a for example 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.610
 unity to but he promises to be 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.920
 A bit less but in fact he will also 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.920
 quite interesting there will be a bunch 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.800
 additional assignments never before 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.500
 all this will be quite interesting as well 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.010
 there will be a character pumping something like that 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.640
 as it was in unity, that is, it will be possible 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.680
 change the cloak and all sorts of armor 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.320
 bracers up the hood and and legs so on along 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.320
 the idea is very interesting for now 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.350
 Little information is known about anyone here 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.890
 but I think that in the future 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.570
 matsii will more necessarily 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.989
 information will appear on our 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.980
 channel it anyway here well and 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.670
 Of course, ubisoft will eventually port 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.170
 rooms on p. 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.360
 so the case of sraw and liberation hd 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.790
 all friends are there for you 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.640
 interesting news maybe someone I already 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.950
 saw the internet read maybe someone 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.560
 they learned for the first time but in essence and 500 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.360
 of course 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.010
 surprised because next year by 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.540
 The idea will come out 3 assassins 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:04.380
 This is at the beginning of the year Rogue on the PC and rooms with 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.459
 Viktor is nice but as for me 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.290
 that is 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.680
 somehow too many assassins again 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.329
 In recent years, of course , that 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.600
 developers though there cut the dough 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.900
 more and all that but well damn well who 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.449
 will play on bf3 assassin 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.520
 at the same time if I like unity 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.810
 I had enough with my head for example after 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.600
 unity did not want to go rogu 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.419
 her on the pc and thank god she goes to 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.840
 next year maybe I would probably 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.270
 I did not master two games I probably had 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.660
 wrong overdose here such here assassin 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.660
 of all 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.760
 that's why I don't know if someone can 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.729
 read this is a good idea no one 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.970
 someone and 3 assassins year mom someone 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:55.900
 so for i am an avid flashlight and to someone and 1 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.889
 a lot but given that as heights when 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.650
 careless about their optimization then 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.449
 I think it is better to let them and three years 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.260
 make one game and after three years 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.710
 will release 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.160
 assassin but she will be good 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.650
 optimized without bugs without glitches 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.820
 without subsidence fps and so on, that is 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:21.460
 will not need to release gigabyte patches 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.530
 it is that which is essentially nothing 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.720
 change your memory on your hard 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.840
 drive 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.760
 but bombed so that 8 okay friends to everyone 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.949
 thanks for watching think new for you 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.000
 It was interesting and we will meet in the following 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.000
 video all bye
