00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
Wi-Fi and then Bluetooth so we want to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.510 
Wi-Fi and then Bluetooth so we want to
go<00:00:57.239> into<00:00:57.390> bluetooth<00:00:57.800> make<00:00:58.800> sure<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.399> on

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
go into bluetooth make sure that it's on

regular camera app that came with the
iPhone<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.989> should<00:03:11.140> work<00:03:11.170> great<00:03:11.549> all

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
iPhone and it should work great all

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.539 
iPhone and it should work great all
iPhones<00:03:13.049> work<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.230> same<00:03:14.440> way<00:03:14.709> as<00:03:14.920> far<00:03:15.160> as<00:03:15.220> you

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
iPhones work the same way as far as you

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.369 
iPhones work the same way as far as you
go<00:03:15.790> into<00:03:15.940> settings<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:16.569> then<00:03:16.660> Bluetooth<00:03:17.109> and

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
go into settings and then Bluetooth and

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.500 
go into settings and then Bluetooth and
just<00:03:17.500> make<00:03:17.650> sure<00:03:17.799> it's<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.970> process

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
just make sure it's on that process

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.849 
just make sure it's on that process
should<00:03:19.690> be<00:03:19.840> exactly<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.260> same<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.590> pretty

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
should be exactly the same on pretty

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.309 
should be exactly the same on pretty
much<00:03:20.980> any<00:03:21.190> iPhone<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:22.750> next<00:03:22.930> we're<00:03:23.139> going<00:03:23.230> to

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319

phone pretty much works exactly the same

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.490 
phone pretty much works exactly the same
way<00:03:33.130> but<00:03:33.549> what<00:03:33.700> we're<00:03:33.790> going<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:33.940> do<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.209> just

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
way but what we're going to do is just

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.580 
way but what we're going to do is just
push<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.880> bottom<00:03:36.880> scraps<00:03:37.660> onto<00:03:38.049> it<00:03:38.200> or<00:03:38.500> the

push the bottom scraps onto it or the
bottom<00:03:38.859> latches<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.340> one<00:03:40.090> thing<00:03:40.419> to<00:03:40.450> note<00:03:40.930> is

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
bottom latches and one thing to note is

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.229 
bottom latches and one thing to note is
you'll<00:03:41.680> want<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.040> make<00:03:42.160> sure<00:03:42.400> when<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:42.910> pull

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
you'll want to make sure when you pull

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.470 
you'll want to make sure when you pull

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
that slowly I've heard four stories we

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.599 
that slowly I've heard four stories we
haven't<00:03:50.560> seen<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.739> whole<00:03:50.829> lot<00:03:51.130> of<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.340> but<00:03:51.549> it

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.270 
haven't seen a whole lot of it but it
can<00:03:52.060> happen<00:03:52.480> that<00:03:53.200> if<00:03:53.349> you<00:03:53.470> stretch<00:03:53.799> if<00:03:54.130> you

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
can happen that if you stretch if you

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.610 
can happen that if you stretch if you
yank<00:03:54.819> on<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.120> too<00:03:55.299> hard<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.870> could<00:03:56.109> break<00:03:56.290> it

then I guess last we could just kind of

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.150 
then I guess last we could just kind of
review<00:04:10.629> a<00:04:10.840> lot<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:11.739> people<00:04:11.919> have<00:04:12.010> questions
