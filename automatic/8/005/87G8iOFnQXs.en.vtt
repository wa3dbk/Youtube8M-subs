00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
we can see our reads up in the 550

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.740 
we can see our reads up in the 550
megabytes<00:04:41.039> per<00:04:41.159> second<00:04:41.610> range<00:04:41.819> and<00:04:42.509> we<00:04:42.659> can

see<00:04:42.930> our<00:04:42.960> writes<00:04:43.259> actually<00:04:43.680> at<00:04:43.770> about<00:04:44.629> 415

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
see our writes actually at about 415

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.570 
see our writes actually at about 415
megabytes<00:04:46.110> per<00:04:46.229> second<00:04:46.710> right<00:04:47.129> there<00:04:47.370> for<00:04:47.550> a

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
megabytes per second right there for a

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.520

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.589 
32 and 64 gig 32 and 64 block size tests
so<00:04:53.430> there<00:04:53.550> we<00:04:53.639> can<00:04:53.759> see<00:04:53.879> some<00:04:54.060> comparable

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
so there we can see some comparable

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:55.999 
so there we can see some comparable
numbers<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.289> what<00:04:55.500> we're<00:04:55.620> seeing<00:04:55.800> from<00:04:55.889> the
