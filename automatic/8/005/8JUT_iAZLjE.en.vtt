00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.700
 terror before doraemon 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.100
 r the Japanese TV network asahi has issued the latest 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.840
 episode of doraemon 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.650
 about 30 years after his appearance in sleeves has been decided 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.720
 give already an end to the series 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.700
 several movies gazillion thousand episodes of anime and many others 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.470
 products has left us the mythical series 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.450
 the why 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.540
 the producers also claim that more and more people were taking doraemon 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.370
 as a pervert 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.320
 according to television asahi have decided to give an end to the series because it 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.250
 I was becoming repetitive 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.000
 we believe that in these 30 years Nobita has had to learn something 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.290
 believe that the series entered the shark jump 20 years ago and for more 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.380
 that we try we have run out of ideas 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.990
 any 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.310
 to say the great great grandchildren of the original writers of the series 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.820
 doraemon was already fed up with novie and wanted to go to the future 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.320
 and we were also fed up with the series, let's be honest 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.720
 the end of the doraemon manga out quite a few years ago and the situation does not 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.920
 it was so serious 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.060
 However, the Japanese authorities have prohibited its publication in other 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.040
 countries 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.799
 However, an anonymous person has brought the manga to Spain and translated it 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.940
 reactions the actors have not taken it well the decision 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.200
 thousands of Japanese children and some adults have gone to the top of the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.020
 buildings to throw themselves away to the other world 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.979
 the situation in the big cities of japan andia has become even more 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.690
 chaotic for circulation 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.180
 since now the drivers have to dodge the large number of corpses 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.300
 Some people have decided to demonstrate these days to ban 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.660
 the replacement of the last episode and resume the series from the penultimate 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.409
 chapter issued 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.229

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.069

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.239
 and what is left 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.120

 that are beginning to be canceled 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.930

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:56.129
 the authorities are preparing to face so many deaths 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.859
 but they are also trying to prevent mass cancellations 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:00.779
