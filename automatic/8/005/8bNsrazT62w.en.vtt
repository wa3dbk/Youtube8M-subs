00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
guys a program that you guys might

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.179 
guys a program that you guys might
benefit<00:00:17.419> from<00:00:17.480> with<00:00:18.199> finding<00:00:18.679> swims<00:00:18.949> are

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
benefit from with finding swims are

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.970 
benefit from with finding swims are
becoming<00:00:19.489> competitive<00:00:20.109> it's<00:00:21.109> called<00:00:21.349> mirc

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
becoming competitive it's called mirc

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.890 
becoming competitive it's called mirc
and<00:00:22.189> hopefully<00:00:22.699> it<00:00:22.789> comes<00:00:22.909> back<00:00:23.150> one<00:00:23.449> csgo

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
and hopefully it comes back one csgo

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.960 
and hopefully it comes back one csgo
comes<00:00:24.169> out<00:00:24.319> I<00:00:24.349> mean<00:00:24.619> modern<00:00:25.249> warfare<00:00:25.400> 3<00:00:25.550> just

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
comes out I mean modern warfare 3 just

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.309 
comes out I mean modern warfare 3 just
set<00:00:26.089> up<00:00:26.210> their<00:00:26.359> channel<00:00:26.720> when<00:00:26.810> they<00:00:26.929> came<00:00:27.109> out

00:00:27.309 --> 00:00:27.319 
set up their channel when they came out

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.769 
set up their channel when they came out
so<00:00:27.589> it's<00:00:28.159> populated<00:00:28.669> in<00:00:28.880> other<00:00:29.060> divisions<00:00:29.569> but

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
so it's populated in other divisions but

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.049 
so it's populated in other divisions but
sadly<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.679> counter<00:00:30.890> strike<00:00:31.069> source<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:31.519> 1.6

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
sadly the counter strike source and 1.6

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.540 
sadly the counter strike source and 1.6
channels<00:00:32.449> are<00:00:32.539> dying<00:00:32.769> so<00:00:33.769> it's<00:00:34.190> actually<00:00:34.309> this

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
channels are dying so it's actually this

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.799 
channels are dying so it's actually this
is<00:00:34.670> what<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:34.879> program<00:00:35.059> looks<00:00:35.359> like<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:35.750> you

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
is what the program looks like and you

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.380 
is what the program looks like and you
might<00:00:35.989> have<00:00:36.050> seen<00:00:36.199> it<00:00:36.260> before<00:00:36.969> it's<00:00:37.969> kind<00:00:38.300> of
