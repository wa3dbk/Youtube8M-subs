Andy's<00:00:53.879> body<00:00:54.180> position<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.289> shapes<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
Andy's body position the shapes the

and was able to move his body into the
correct<00:03:39.660> position<00:03:39.810> this<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.650> because<00:03:40.920> he's

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
correct position this is because he's

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.410 
correct position this is because he's
processed<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.610> information<00:03:41.700> he<00:03:42.299> has

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
to go he's able to analyse all that it's

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.470 
to go he's able to analyse all that it's
it's<00:03:46.680> coming<00:03:46.890> towards<00:03:47.430> him<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.819> therefore

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
it's coming towards him and therefore

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.029 

so<00:04:18.180> far<00:04:18.509> the<00:04:18.930> lights<00:04:19.169> have<00:04:19.379> been<00:04:19.560> shot<00:04:19.859> off

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
so far the lights have been shot off

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.259 
so far the lights have been shot off
when<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.400> ball<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:20.609> in<00:04:20.789> midair

when the ball is in midair

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.600 
when the ball is in midair
but<00:04:21.900> now<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.560> lights<00:04:22.770> will<00:04:22.979> be<00:04:23.009> turned<00:04:23.129> off

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
but now the lights will be turned off

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.450 
but now the lights will be turned off
just<00:04:23.939> at<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.479> moment<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.080> Lee<00:04:25.289> kicks<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.770> can

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.710 

that<00:04:59.950> was<00:05:00.040> a<00:05:00.100> great<00:05:00.400> finish<00:05:00.820> this<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.480> great

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
that was a great finish this is great

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.930 
that was a great finish this is great
because<00:05:02.200> I<00:05:02.260> imagine<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.280> boys<00:05:03.460> coming<00:05:03.850> I

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
because I imagine the boys coming I

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.970 
because I imagine the boys coming I
scared<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.330> go<00:05:04.540> there<00:05:04.990> with<00:05:05.230> the<00:05:05.320> face<00:05:05.530> I'll<00:05:05.800> go

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
scared to go there with the face I'll go

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.970 
scared to go there with the face I'll go
with<00:05:06.130> of<00:05:06.790> chest<00:05:07.330> off<00:05:07.540> shoulder<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.470> then<00:05:08.800> put

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
with of chest off shoulder and then put

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.520 
with of chest off shoulder and then put
the<00:05:09.070> right<00:05:09.190> same<00:05:09.520> quality<00:05:09.970> great<00:05:10.480> finished<00:05:10.870> so

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
the right same quality great finished so

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.740 
the right same quality great finished so
tell<00:05:11.950> me<00:05:12.100> how<00:05:12.550> difficult<00:05:13.030> is<00:05:13.150> that<00:05:13.180> I<00:05:13.360> mean<00:05:13.600> the

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
tell me how difficult is that I mean the

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.450 
tell me how difficult is that I mean the
last<00:05:13.990> one<00:05:14.230> when<00:05:14.380> we<00:05:14.470> adjusted<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.010> time<00:05:15.310> and

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
last one when we adjusted the time and

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.250 
last one when we adjusted the time and
aligned<00:05:15.670> yeah<00:05:16.150> it's<00:05:16.330> so<00:05:16.600> difficult<00:05:16.870> they've

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
aligned yeah it's so difficult they've

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.780 
aligned yeah it's so difficult they've
done<00:05:17.440> studies<00:05:17.770> like<00:05:17.890> this<00:05:18.040> using<00:05:18.340> computer

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
done studies like this using computer

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.130 
done studies like this using computer
simulations<00:05:19.420> so<00:05:19.600> you<00:05:19.660> watch<00:05:19.870> it<00:05:20.020> on<00:05:20.080> a

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
simulations so you watch it on a

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.420 
simulations so you watch it on a
computer<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.680> just<00:05:20.710> have<00:05:20.920> to<00:05:20.950> say<00:05:21.190> where<00:05:21.370> the

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
computer and just have to say where the

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.250 
computer and just have to say where the
balls<00:05:21.610> going<00:05:21.700> and<00:05:22.180> from<00:05:22.570> then<00:05:22.750> they<00:05:22.930> can<00:05:23.110> see

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
balls going and from then they can see

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.960 
balls going and from then they can see
that<00:05:23.410> early<00:05:23.650> athletes<00:05:24.100> can<00:05:24.580> tell<00:05:24.760> much

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
that early athletes can tell much

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.310 
that early athletes can tell much
earlier<00:05:25.360> where<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.570> ball<00:05:25.810> is<00:05:25.870> coming<00:05:26.020> from

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
earlier where the ball is coming from

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.840 
earlier where the ball is coming from
but<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:26.860> have<00:05:27.010> to<00:05:27.130> actually<00:05:27.280> produce<00:05:27.580> a

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
but to have to actually produce a

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.670 
but to have to actually produce a
physical<00:05:28.360> response<00:05:28.570> when<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.020> ball<00:05:29.230> is<00:05:29.260> flying

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
physical response when a ball is flying

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.130 
physical response when a ball is flying
at<00:05:29.920> you<00:05:30.100> then<00:05:30.670> it's<00:05:31.120> really<00:05:31.690> good<00:05:31.870> skills

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
at you then it's really good skills

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.680 
at you then it's really good skills
amazing
