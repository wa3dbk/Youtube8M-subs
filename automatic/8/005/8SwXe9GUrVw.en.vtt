00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.050
 requirements for city and city 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.710
 space of the modern city dweller 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.869
 equal to urban user 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.080
 increased significantly 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:32.610
 This is absolutely not what it was even 10 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.399
 years ago and that means cities 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.070
 need some way very quickly and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.000
 flexibly and quickly rebuild for 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.940
 to be demanded here 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.320
 these new townspeople I would say so 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.079
 that today the townspeople 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.230
 most of them are 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.780
 advanced users in this city 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.329
 related to many aspects like so 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.430
 that we are simply open to the world today we 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.010
 we can compare and see different cities 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.369
 different spaces and we expect it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.820
 from the places we live with 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.369
 so that technological leap related 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.260
 with a variety of soft and not only 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.150
 soft of digital honey creeps 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.220
 infrastructure too essential 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.619
 way changes the quality of our lives and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.180
 urban quality and requirements 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.170
 which we present today to the city 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.320
 environment and here of course the main problem 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.000
 lies in huge inequality 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.369
 which exists today in this 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.840
 as an urban environment between large 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.990
 urban agglomeration my 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.920
 and other settlements smaller 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.869
 scale or even that suburban 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.770
 periphery which is very active today 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.360
 formed in urban agglomerations 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.189
 townspeople 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.790
 moving to the suburbs precisely for that 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.920
 to improve the quality of your life but 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.950
 while falling into a certain trap 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.869
 because about no urban environment in 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.180
 the suburb can not speak and that's it 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.000
 the difference is like as urban 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.039
 environment it exists in space 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.410
 same city ​​especially if 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.570
 we are talking about large hail 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.150
 ah or at least medium-sized cities 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.330
 we all know how much different 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.820
 quality of life and cultural life in that 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.360
 including in the city centers and on the outskirts 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.650
 and we have to work with it somehow 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.600
 while we know only one example of an attempt 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.400
 work with field centric structure 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.280
 cities form such a finger 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.810
 centric structure in Moscow by this 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.180
 deals with the Department of Culture of the city 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.800
 Moscow and the last two years need 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.150
 give yourself a little bit it's a very process 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.070
 long and the process that requires such 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.860
 quite subtle and reflexive and what 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.520
 really happening in these 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.460
 spaces in these neighborhoods suburbs 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.280
 and so on like in reality people 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.470
 enjoy the urban environment which they do not 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.990
 enough what constipation what request for this 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.450
 urban environment and I really like 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.780
 some modern foreign approaches 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.380
 research when this happens 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.680
 very accurate and accurate fixation 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.240
 everyday life 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.380
 urban in terms of 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.440
 demand for certain urban 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.820
 functions and attempt to rank these 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.620
 features by popularity not like 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.570
 babes are absolutely necessary or 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.650
 vice versa like some extra 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.870
 quality services 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.590
 and it's actually quite curious 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.600
 history because we seem to understand 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.940
 that quality of life should be everywhere 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.150
 the same but actually in different 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.300
 different communities live there and 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.459
 There are some nuances that will distinguish 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.700
 substantially the requirements of this 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.450
 community city citizens to quality 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.450
 urban environment
