00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
up as a Chippendales dancer and then

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.860 
up as a Chippendales dancer and then
every<00:02:20.640> time<00:02:20.790> after<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.660> had<00:02:21.780> to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
every time after that it's just had to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
be something new why wait until the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.449 
be something new why wait until the
second<00:02:25.680> half<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:26.300> take<00:02:27.300> off<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.690> shirt
