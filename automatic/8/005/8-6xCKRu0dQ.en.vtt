00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.469 
so that's grilled not fried try and
maybe<00:00:52.589> skip<00:00:52.830> the<00:00:52.979> fries<00:00:53.220> go<00:00:53.970> for<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> water

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
maybe skip the fries go for a water

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.979 
maybe skip the fries go for a water
gatorade<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:56.360> if<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.570> really<00:00:57.809> need

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
gatorade and then if you really need

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.719 
gatorade and then if you really need
maybe<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.800> pick-me-up<00:00:59.040> maybe<00:00:59.519> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
maybe a pick-me-up maybe you know a

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.460 
maybe a pick-me-up maybe you know a
Snickers<00:01:00.180> bar<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.479> has<00:01:00.540> a<00:01:00.659> nice<00:01:01.019> protein

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it gives you a quick spike but it really

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.410
