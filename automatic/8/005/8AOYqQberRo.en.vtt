00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.600
 why because you left the party 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.360
 maybe stops to dose you good 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.719
 actually as I tell you during the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.119
 practices that I started had a month and 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.290
 half practically stopped when returning and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.400
 train as hard as I came 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.869
 doing together with the group of 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.090
 globetrotter had a nuisance account 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.380
 either in the heel and in the knee or 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.570
 load base 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.369
 Today, the lawyer did not think it was 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.890
 necessary between with good intensity in 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.190
 a first room where the goal of 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.590
 that everyone does that physical work 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.910
 He saw me very well on the court saw that I 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.670
 he did not have the big one either 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.320
 in or because I also have to 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.850
 me not and the group was playing well 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.470
 there are also many possibilities for 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.440
 group b where it 's night they did it 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.510
 pretty well of course they waited 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.030
 globetrotter this team season you see 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.079
 as the likely candidates for 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.269
 fight in the title to globetrotter 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.060
 knowing that they are always there fighting 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.760
 of the championship already good 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.680
 at least it does not happen to us what what 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.940
 passed the team last year not 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.440
 to travel to the last stage where to my 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.570
 person as it is going to conjugate or not 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.420
 beneficial because they passed but the 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.030
 first goal will be to try to pass 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.830
 without much stress at least start the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.480
 start will be very important to start as 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.800
 intensity winning match because 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.330
 we know that mid - season the 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.230
 team are adjusted and everyone and 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.450
 with many players are catching 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.660
 trust a match won one lost 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.580
 with guaros what aspects they hope to improve 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.440
 jack martÃ­nez personally and what 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.840
 aspects to improve of the same type 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.670
 for to have it up there because 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.590
 well actually follow and continue to follow 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.380
 strengthening physical conditions 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.200
 scored a little bit of 100% I think 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.690
 that that would be clear the heart the mind 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.030
 the veteran experience is there and 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.770

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.110
 company was my team to help me team 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.610
