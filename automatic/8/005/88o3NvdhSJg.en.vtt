covered<00:02:53.469> with<00:02:53.530> tape<00:02:53.799> there<00:02:54.099> as<00:02:55.030> well<00:02:55.209> as<00:02:55.359> the

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
covered with tape there as well as the

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.589 
covered with tape there as well as the
holes<00:02:55.870> from<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.439> flashers<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.220> then<00:02:58.000> some

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
holes from the flashers and then some

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.119 
holes from the flashers and then some
panels<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.019> go<00:02:59.139> over<00:02:59.439> the<00:02:59.560> windows<00:02:59.889> that<00:02:59.919> were

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
panels to go over the windows that were

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.179 
panels to go over the windows that were
moving<00:03:00.549> on<00:03:00.669> on<00:03:00.939> both<00:03:01.120> sides<00:03:01.419> of<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.629> bus

moving on on both sides of the bus
biggest<00:03:03.189> thing<00:03:03.310> we've<00:03:03.489> accomplished<00:03:03.879> so<00:03:04.030> far

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
biggest thing we've accomplished so far

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.819 
biggest thing we've accomplished so far
in<00:03:04.389> the<00:03:04.510> bus<00:03:04.689> is<00:03:04.870> building<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.319> bed<00:03:05.530> platform

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
in the bus is building the bed platform

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.949 
in the bus is building the bed platform
this<00:03:06.579> isn't<00:03:06.909> how<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.000> finished<00:03:07.120> Bethel<00:03:07.750> look

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
this isn't how the finished Bethel look

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.659 
this isn't how the finished Bethel look
but<00:03:08.379> in<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.739> meantime<00:03:08.919> it'll<00:03:09.310> give<00:03:09.459> us<00:03:09.489> a

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:09.669 
but in the meantime it'll give us a

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:14.459 
but in the meantime it'll give us a
place<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:10.030> sleep<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.750> biggest<00:03:14.079> thing<00:03:14.230> we<00:03:14.349> had

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
place to sleep the biggest thing we had

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:15.899 
place to sleep the biggest thing we had
to<00:03:14.590> consider<00:03:14.919> when<00:03:15.280> building<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.730> bed

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
to consider when building the bed

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.479 
to consider when building the bed
platform<00:03:16.200> was<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.650> bed<00:03:17.859> would<00:03:18.159> block

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
platform was that the bed would block

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.000 
platform was that the bed would block
the<00:03:19.209> biggest<00:03:19.629> entrance<00:03:20.019> we<00:03:20.169> had<00:03:20.379> for<00:03:20.709> getting

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
the biggest entrance we had for getting

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.309 
the biggest entrance we had for getting
furniture<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.939> building<00:03:22.540> materials<00:03:23.019> through

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
furniture and building materials through

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.830 
furniture and building materials through
so<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.129> solve<00:03:24.459> that<00:03:24.639> problem<00:03:24.700> we<00:03:25.510> made<00:03:25.689> the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
so to solve that problem we made the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.729 
so to solve that problem we made the
middle<00:03:26.049> of<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.409> bed<00:03:26.590> removable<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:31.739> end

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
middle of the bed removable the end

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.250 
middle of the bed removable the end
sections<00:03:33.250> are<00:03:33.489> connected<00:03:34.269> by<00:03:34.479> four<00:03:34.840> bolts

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
sections are connected by four bolts

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:53.500 
sections are connected by four bolts
each<00:03:35.409> topped<00:03:36.010> with<00:03:36.250> wing<00:03:36.489> nuts

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.150 

that<00:03:54.510> gives<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.840> pathway<00:03:55.080> for<00:03:55.470> large<00:03:55.650> objects

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
that gives a pathway for large objects

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.110 
that gives a pathway for large objects
to<00:03:56.280> get<00:03:56.400> through<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.670> bus<00:03:56.850> during

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
to get through the bus during

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.510 
to get through the bus during
construction<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:58.020> next<00:03:58.620> time<00:03:58.770> we<00:03:58.890> update<00:03:59.070> you

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
construction the next time we update you

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.980 
construction the next time we update you
the<00:03:59.940> bus<00:04:00.120> should<00:04:00.270> look<00:04:00.420> significantly

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
the bus should look significantly

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.640 
the bus should look significantly
different<00:04:01.470> see<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.220> next<00:04:02.490> time
