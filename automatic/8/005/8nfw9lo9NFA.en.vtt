00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.799
 cases it turns out better because

 poor-quality velcro quickly comes out of 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.840
 building the next option for those who 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.759

 grind glove for unfortunately not important 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.500
 we get in but the point is that 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.520
 when the palm is squeezed, the inside is not 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.490
 should bristle 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.850
 all fingers should sit very tight and 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.100

 the inside of the palm and they are a little 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.470
 more durable than plain gloves with
