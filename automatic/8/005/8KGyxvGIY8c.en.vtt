00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello welcome back to 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.360
 dell design 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.889
 Today I am doing a very easy it now 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.940
 like that is my breakfast and so to speak 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.980
 First and foremost I would like to say that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.779
 Everyone can do the way he wants 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.480
 is my version you can do the same 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.710
 after doing or something else 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.330
 instead, take that is yours 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.260
 there are no limits left to yourself 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.230
 set 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.820
 I like it very, very well the need 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.009
 you decide for yourself 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.630
 Most people always say that immediately 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.640
 can not taste that at all and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.770
 But that's not true, so you have to 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 first try it out at all 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 to make a judgment about it and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.530
 I think he is a healthy thing 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.469
 and I like it and it makes me too 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.480
 fed up and go with the ingredients and 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.840
 then, of course, the processing of the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.960
 movies so i take for my smoothie 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.820
 three bananas twice beetroot a few 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.430
 So now I have seven dates here 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.540
 Slice some red grapes and a 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.360
 a little spinach 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.860
 if that's not so creamy right now 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.049
 I should have a little more here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.930
 to the emergency coconut water so there must 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.970
 you can see if it's like that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.640
 But if it really does, consistency will be 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.110
 you should still be too hard 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.509
 a little coconut or water 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.759
 Add normal water so that we can 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.430
 have a little more dilute 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.259
 Processing is easier than it is 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.939
 So first I start with the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.909
 red beets to come here quickly 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:42.540
 purely then I add the next 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:48.390
 banana with the dates now added 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:52.409
 few grapes spinach and one 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.649
 bit of coconut juice will be so now 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.979
 we tried the whole thing then we need it 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.979
 easy 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.840
 so now you can see that only one 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.400
 Part mashed is actually has this 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.230
 great thing a chopsticks where you get that from 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.750
 can push in the top but I have 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.650
 Unfortunately not found 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.840
 That's why I'm gonna do it a bit 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.680
 from here with a wooden spoon 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.680
 push in 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.180
 that is not much anymore 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.340
 and on you go 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.590
 so now the whole thing is done and mine 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.540
 Machine has her down anyway else 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.490
 I'll push that button now 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.390
 so that's a bit more 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.390
 gets creamier 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.540
 completely different 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.940
 that was it 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.970
 the only thing I have left now 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.700
 I go on to enjoy my cattle 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.530
 that's pretty viscous that's too 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.510
 well, then of course I would have 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.010
 the more liquid the longer it gets 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.140
 faster you get hungry 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.200
 Of course you should not forget that 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.390
 because fructose is included but 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.409
 Nonetheless , it is a healthy one 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.849
 mix and I enjoy this now 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.829
 my lying had seen how fast 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.720
 that went and it is really delicious as 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.370
 You absolutely have to do it and have it 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.500
 also did not take long at all 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.849
 and if you have bigger quantities 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.040
 Maybe you in the blood as well 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.780
 lunch or dinner like her 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.790
 So today I would like this morning 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.459
 I really do not have that big 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.049
 that's why it's enough for me 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.609
 and fall today at noon and tonight 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.650
 of course eat accordingly 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.750

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.109

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:29.820
