00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
another quick example I did a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.100 
another quick example I did a

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
engagement but I was able to sell three

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.180 
engagement but I was able to sell three
thousand<00:02:20.300> dollars<00:02:20.600> worth<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.960> books<00:02:21.200> in<00:02:21.950> that

thousand dollars worth of books in that
one<00:02:22.430> presentation<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.540> took<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:24.020> what<00:02:24.770> was

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
one presentation so I took it a what was

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.100 
one presentation so I took it a what was
a<00:02:24.950> thousand-dollar<00:02:25.760> exercise<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.810> four

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
a thousand-dollar exercise to a four

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.670 
a thousand-dollar exercise to a four
thousand<00:02:27.680> dollar<00:02:28.100> exercise<00:02:28.730> okay<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
thousand dollar exercise okay and the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.380 
thousand dollar exercise okay and the
reason<00:02:30.830> why<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.130> was<00:02:31.250> able<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.550> do<00:02:31.820> such<00:02:32.150> an

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
reason why I was able to do such an

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.630 
reason why I was able to do such an
amount<00:02:32.930> was<00:02:33.170> because<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.680> have<00:02:33.920> multiple<00:02:34.160> books

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
amount was because I have multiple books

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.360 
amount was because I have multiple books
now<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.050> market<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.650> there's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
now in the in the market and there's

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.550 
now in the in the market and there's
obviously<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.760> much<00:02:37.970> higher<00:02:38.540> spend<00:02:39.110> instead<00:02:39.470> of

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
obviously a much higher spend instead of

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.020 
obviously a much higher spend instead of
someone<00:02:39.740> spending<00:02:40.190> thirty<00:02:40.490> dollars<00:02:40.850> they

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
someone spending thirty dollars they

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.580 
someone spending thirty dollars they
could<00:02:41.210> be<00:02:41.360> there<00:02:41.780> buying<00:02:41.959> four<00:02:42.260> books<00:02:42.440> they

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
could be there buying four books they

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.690 
could be there buying four books they
could<00:02:42.740> be<00:02:42.830> spending<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.190> hundred<00:02:43.490> dollars

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
could be spending a hundred dollars

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.790 
could be spending a hundred dollars
that's<00:02:43.850> why<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.150> highly<00:02:44.630> recommend<00:02:44.900> you're

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
other thing like I mentioned before this

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.870 
other thing like I mentioned before this
is<00:04:28.160> a<00:04:28.190> big<00:04:28.370> thing

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
is a big thing

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
back and to make a difference to the

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.090 
back and to make a difference to the
lives<00:04:32.690> of<00:04:33.080> other<00:04:33.320> people<00:04:33.410> people<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:34.010> could

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
lives of other people people you could

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.710 
lives of other people people you could
never<00:04:34.370> reach<00:04:34.640> on<00:04:34.970> your<00:04:35.120> own<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.600> last

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
never reach on your own and the last

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
thing I think anyway it's a whole lot of

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.320 
thing I think anyway it's a whole lot of
whole<00:04:38.930> lot<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.080> fun<00:04:39.320> to<00:04:39.650> write<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.860> book<00:04:40.100> and

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
that's one of the things hopefully

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.900 
that's one of the things hopefully
you'll<00:04:42.320> get<00:04:42.470> throughout<00:04:42.920> this<00:04:43.040> as<00:04:43.250> well<00:04:43.400> that
