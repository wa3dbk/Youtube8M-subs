00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
are pretty self-explanatory so let me go

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.480 
are pretty self-explanatory so let me go
ahead<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.410> show<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.860> keyboard<00:02:17.310> real

ahead and show you the keyboard real

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.700

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
quick so as you can see that the letters

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.070 
quick so as you can see that the letters
are<00:02:22.920> much<00:02:23.220> larger<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.850> there's<00:02:24.390> no<00:02:24.600> wasted

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
are much larger and there's no wasted

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.190 
are much larger and there's no wasted
space<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:27.180> pretty<00:02:27.390> much<00:02:27.510> get<00:02:27.810> an<00:02:27.930> overall

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
space so you pretty much get an overall

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.290 
space so you pretty much get an overall
better<00:02:28.530> typing<00:02:29.130> experience<00:02:29.310> now<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.030> letter

better typing experience now the letter

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.660 
better typing experience now the letter

still do pop up and I don't have the
sound<00:02:32.880> turned<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.210> but<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.390> do<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.780> hectic

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
sound turned on but I do have the hectic

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.710 
sound turned on but I do have the hectic
feedback<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.070> pretty<00:02:35.340> nice<00:02:35.720> of

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
feedback on and it's pretty nice of

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.850 
feedback on and it's pretty nice of
course<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.500> does<00:02:37.680> landscape<00:02:38.490> also<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:42.860> much

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
I mean over overall it's a definite

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.220 
I mean over overall it's a definite

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
the swipe gestures are really cool for

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.760

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
and back and forth and one on and then

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.690 
and back and forth and one on and then
to<00:04:49.110> swipe<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.470> keyboard<00:04:50.010> down<00:04:50.190> instead<00:04:50.550> of

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
to swipe the keyboard down instead of

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.000 
to swipe the keyboard down instead of
having<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.000> hit<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.960> back<00:04:52.530> button<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.890> can

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
having to hit the back button you can

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.890 
having to hit the back button you can
actually<00:04:53.160> just<00:04:53.310> swipe<00:04:53.730> it<00:04:53.850> down<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.720> goes

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
actually just swipe it down and it goes

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.080 
actually just swipe it down and it goes
down<00:04:55.110> so<00:04:55.740> I'm<00:04:56.160> sure<00:04:56.310> they'll<00:04:56.490> add<00:04:56.640> more<00:04:56.880> stuff

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
down so I'm sure they'll add more stuff

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.180 
down so I'm sure they'll add more stuff
later<00:04:57.300> with<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.840> gestures<00:04:58.380> and<00:04:58.620> whatnot<00:04:58.920> but

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
later with the gestures and whatnot but

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.760 
later with the gestures and whatnot but
I<00:04:59.820> think<00:05:00.630> it's<00:05:00.750> really<00:05:00.990> cool<00:05:01.170> application

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
I think it's really cool application

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.590 
I think it's really cool application
it's<00:05:01.860> definitely<00:05:02.190> worth<00:05:02.310> two<00:05:02.520> bucks

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
it's definitely worth two bucks

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.050 
it's definitely worth two bucks
especially<00:05:03.600> if<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:03.780> like<00:05:03.990> you<00:05:04.350> know<00:05:04.440> the
