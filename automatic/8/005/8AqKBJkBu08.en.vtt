00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.540
 very good friends of youtube I am the magician 

00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:08.810
 and on this small occasion I bring you a 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.590
 tutorial for those people who 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:14.780
 they want to install what is ios 7 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.020
 well first of all I have to highlight 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.770
 that I will not teach how to install the year of 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.380
 7 but the appearance as such of this 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.610
 new operating system 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.340
 It is worth noting the following 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.560
 we are going to need what is the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.460
 jailbreak tool we are going to 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.010
 need 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.410
 silvia we are going to need what is the 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.690
 winter work and if they do not have the winter 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.480
 bold, you can check what is the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.570
 description of the video to know how 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.400
 install it or you can see in the video see 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.420
 if a note appears so that they can 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.420
 install good since 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.679
 Bearing all this in mind we will 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.679
 proceed with the video 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.070
 very good friends as you already know or those who 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.260
 do not know on June 10 of this date or 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.050
 of this year apple launches the new 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.040
 operating system that is the year of 7 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.650
 this new ios 7 changes totally not 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.770
 only the appearance but the interface and 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.440
 good almost everything all everything 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.260
 most of the entire operating system 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.370
 that we have been seeing in the versions 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.380
 previous of ios in the first place there are 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.830
 to note that this operating system 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.780
 is now in the beta version is a 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.200
 test version what you want to say 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.820
 that is not complete however already for 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.009
 Summer dates that are waiting for you 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.200
 they are going to launch the official version for 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.690
 those who want to install it can 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.550
 do it however , because we 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.490
 we can download and install this 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.650
 beta version on our devices 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.410
 but what's up this beta version is not 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.909
 compatible with all devices 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.149
 but with what it is 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.490
 the ipad second generation in the third 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.360
 generation in fourth generation also 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:15.680
 It is available for the iphone 4 fourth 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.470
 generation 4 and fifth generation and by 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.410
 course the ipod fifth generation what 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.300
 which means that what is 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:30.410
 the ipod 4 and previous versions the ipad 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.290
 1 and what is the iphone 3gs and versions 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.990
 above are not compatible with 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.630
 this operating system already having this 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.840
 in account then I'm going to teach you more than 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.190
 all 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.340
 change the appearance of the device to 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.940
 this new 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.280
 it is 7 as I said we are going to need 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.599
 the silvia tool we are going to open it and 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.599
 we wait for him to load 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.060
 very well once loaded cydia we are going to 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.460
 search for 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:11.050
 ios 7 this way 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:16.570
 yes and we are going to install what is ios 7 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:21.910
 look screen tests and ios 7 that is to say the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:25.920
 ios what is twitter and 17 in fact 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.920
 I have it right here 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.540
 we are going to install these two packages 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.540
 If these two packages are 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.010
 in chair for free 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.019
 once installed the two packages we 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.040
 we go to winter board which is the 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.390
 tool that we are going to use 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.239
 remember that winter work allows us 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.310
 add themes to our devices and 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.159
 well let's select now everything 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.579
 that has to do with ios 7 what is it 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:19.370
 that we have installed in this case the 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:21.620
 statu bar the luck battery messages 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.900
 in everything that has to do with ios 7 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.530
 we mark it 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.040
 if the notification center the look 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.780
 screen 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.630
 the folders 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:37.110
 in short everything good if we do not want 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.900
 install something just uncheck and we're going to 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.590
 take a break to apply 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.510
 the changes 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.540
 I'm going to press the video for a moment and 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.870
 I come back and good friends already here we will have 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.880
 what is the appearance of ios 7 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.190
 remember that nothing else is the appearance 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.960
 It's a theme 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.070
 I mean it just changes some 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.870
 things in this case we see the icons 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:06.580
 we see let's say 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:09.070
 that changes what is the applications the 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.570
 form and the applications or good of the 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.420
 icons of these applications you change them 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.520
 we can go good the safari follows 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.250
 being the same only that the icon changes 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.190
 but here in the adjustments we can notice 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.620
 that changes what is the interface of this 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.620
 application what is airplane mode 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:36.139
 well everything seems to change 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:39.169
 all this interface that is very very 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:43.880
 interesting here where they say there are times 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:48.930
 of time we can even configure 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.570
 said topic but I do not recommend touching it 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.240
 what more and good here as I could see 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:59.590
 the folders do not change them 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.460
 applications that come with by 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:08.020
 defect in our country 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:11.410
 and good, most of all is that even the 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:15.250
 balloons that are the balloons of 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:18.220
 notification that these are this this 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:22.480
 red balloon indicating in the amount 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.060
 a number number in quantity 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.220
 and good friends remember that only the 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.100
 appearance but good is fine since 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:34.380
 the year in 7 is only in the beta version 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:37.150
 already when it's in full let's say 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.820
 I will teach how to install it of all 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:44.530
 ways if you want to know how to install 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:46.060
 the ios 7 beta so you can tell me in 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.370
 the comments of taking the video 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.560
 tutorial concerning that however 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.560
 keep in mind that right now I do not have a 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.530
 device 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:00.210
 compatible with ios 7 so 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:03.310
 I will simply do what is a tutorial 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.640
 how to install it but I will not proceed to 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:10.569
 show them how you can install it by 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.999
 another part I think that's all 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:16.059
 I apologize for not uploading a 

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:18.159
 new video and good any doubt that 

00:07:16.059 --> 00:07:20.379
