basics in another pouch now this punch
is<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.289> bit<00:00:46.410> big<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> reason<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
is a little bit big and the reason is is

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.240 
is a little bit big and the reason is is
because<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.030> holds<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.480> my<00:00:48.510> brushes<00:00:49.070> if<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
because it holds all my brushes if you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.090

generally don't use a lot of brushes you

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100 
generally don't use a lot of brushes you
would<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.489> need<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> small<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.690> pouch<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
would just need a small little pouch and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.689 
would just need a small little pouch and
you<00:00:55.170> want<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.800> small<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.550> be

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
and how's just the basics and the reason
