some of his subscribers and I don't know
it's<00:00:50.200> just<00:00:50.410> I<00:00:50.590> don't<00:00:50.680> know<00:00:50.829> I<00:00:50.860> thought<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.040> was

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
it's just I don't know I thought it was

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.220 
it's just I don't know I thought it was
a<00:00:51.190> really<00:00:51.460> awesome<00:00:51.579> game<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.270> at<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.989> start

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
a really awesome game and at the start

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.170 
a really awesome game and at the start
we<00:00:53.320> kept<00:00:53.559> a<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:53.890> C<00:00:54.130> and<00:00:54.370> then<00:00:54.610> tetras<00:00:55.000> over

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
we kept a and C and then tetras over

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.760 
we kept a and C and then tetras over
there<00:00:55.300> cap<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.720> B<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.020> I<00:00:56.050> don't<00:00:56.230> realize<00:00:56.559> it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
there cap and B and I don't realize it

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.310 
there cap and B and I don't realize it
so<00:00:56.950> we<00:00:57.070> have<00:00:57.220> all<00:00:57.370> three<00:00:57.610> and<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:59.079> just<00:00:59.200> one

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
so we have all three and it's just one

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.350 
so we have all three and it's just one
of<00:00:59.410> those<00:00:59.500> things<00:00:59.829> where<00:01:00.100> I'm<00:01:00.370> kind<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.149> turned

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
of those things where I'm kind of turned

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.030 
of those things where I'm kind of turned
into<00:01:01.480> something<00:01:01.750> more<00:01:02.050> than<00:01:02.320> I<00:01:02.440> expected<00:01:02.590> it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
into something more than I expected it

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.280 
into something more than I expected it
to<00:01:03.100> but<00:01:04.059> I<00:01:04.089> have<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.239> start<00:01:04.479> I<00:01:04.570> use<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:04.809> ACR

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
to but I have to start I use the ACR

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.340 
to but I have to start I use the ACR
with<00:01:06.060> scavenger<00:01:07.060> hardline<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.570> ninja<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.259> it

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
with scavenger hardline and ninja and it

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.749 
with scavenger hardline and ninja and it
really<00:01:08.530> doesn't<00:01:08.860> work<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:09.070> my<00:01:09.100> favor<00:01:09.369> so<00:01:09.640> I'll

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
of over by C just by spawning over here

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.099 
of over by C just by spawning over here
and<00:01:21.429> since<00:01:21.670> everybody<00:01:22.240> else<00:01:22.389> was<00:01:22.569> kind<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.840> set

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
and since everybody else was kind of set

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.050 
and since everybody else was kind of set
up<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.350> their<00:01:23.469> own<00:01:23.590> areas<00:01:24.069> trying<00:01:24.759> to<00:01:24.909> hold

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
up in their own areas trying to hold

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.379 
up in their own areas trying to hold
down<00:01:25.209> the<00:01:26.069> domination<00:01:27.069> Flags<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.819> just<00:01:28.119> figured

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:28.389 
down the domination Flags I just figured

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:29.940 
down the domination Flags I just figured
I<00:01:28.450> would<00:01:28.569> stay<00:01:28.810> over<00:01:29.020> here<00:01:29.259> where<00:01:29.439> nobody<00:01:29.649> else

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
I would stay over here where nobody else

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.629 
I would stay over here where nobody else
is<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:31.139> yeah<00:01:32.139> so<00:01:32.529> I'm<00:01:33.039> basically<00:01:33.520> just

I<00:01:41.560> just<00:01:41.770> started<00:01:41.979> playing<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.749> bear<00:01:43.749> balm

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
I just started playing the the bear balm

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.019 
I just started playing the the bear balm
playlist<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.829> just<00:01:45.039> was<00:01:45.189> released<00:01:45.520> like<00:01:45.729> last

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:46.029 
playlist it just was released like last

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:48.480 
playlist it just was released like last
night<00:01:46.359> and<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:47.649> not<00:01:47.859> last<00:01:48.069> night<00:01:48.279> but<00:01:48.399> like

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
night and or not last night but like

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.889 
night and or not last night but like
yesterday<00:01:48.939> evening<00:01:49.299> I<00:01:49.329> guess<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.630> could<00:01:49.779> call

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
yesterday evening I guess you could call

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.749 
yesterday evening I guess you could call
it<00:01:49.959> depends<00:01:50.740> on<00:01:50.829> where<00:01:50.950> your<00:01:51.069> time<00:01:51.310> zone<00:01:51.340> is

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
it depends on where your time zone is

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.980 
it depends on where your time zone is
but<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.299> was<00:01:53.109> playing<00:01:53.349> it<00:01:53.649> with<00:01:53.829> X<00:01:54.249> Charles<00:01:54.700> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
but I was playing it with X Charles and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.379 
but I was playing it with X Charles and
a<00:01:55.990> few<00:01:56.469> other<00:01:56.619> people<00:01:57.009> and<00:01:57.189> it<00:01:57.340> was<00:01:58.090> really

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
a few other people and it was really

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.120 
a few other people and it was really
funny<00:01:58.689> because<00:01:58.779> we<00:01:59.259> got<00:01:59.439> into<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.649> free-for-all

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
funny because we got into a free-for-all

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.519 
funny because we got into a free-for-all
on<00:02:00.549> a<00:02:00.609> strike<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.719> I<00:02:01.779> thought<00:02:01.929> about<00:02:02.049> posting

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:02.529 
on a strike and I thought about posting

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:05.849 
on a strike and I thought about posting
the<00:02:02.590> gameplay<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.659> it<00:02:05.079> was<00:02:05.229> really<00:02:05.380> funny<00:02:05.709> to

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
the gameplay but it was really funny to

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.719 
the gameplay but it was really funny to
me<00:02:05.950> because<00:02:06.099> these<00:02:06.459> kids<00:02:06.880> were<00:02:07.209> in<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:08.080> back

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
me because these kids were in the back

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.210 
me because these kids were in the back
Nuka<00:02:09.729> boosting<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.770> there's<00:02:11.770> no<00:02:11.920> kill

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
Nuka boosting and there's no kill

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.500 
Nuka boosting and there's no kill
streaks<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:12.940> just<00:02:13.150> thought<00:02:13.300> it<00:02:13.450> was

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
streaks and I just thought it was

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.020 
streaks and I just thought it was
hilarious<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.140> uh<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:15.489> they<00:02:15.640> were<00:02:15.700> trying

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
hilarious that uh that they were trying

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.390 
hilarious that uh that they were trying
to<00:02:16.090> do<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:17.020> don't<00:02:17.710> know<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.920> probably

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
to do that and I don't know I probably

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.220 
to do that and I don't know I probably
eventually<00:02:18.670> post<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.240> clip<00:02:19.570> but<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.080> just

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
eventually post a clip but it's just

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.170 
eventually post a clip but it's just
the<00:02:21.290> pointless<00:02:21.650> had<00:02:21.800> just<00:02:21.980> released<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:23.120> a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the pointless had just released I have a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.000 
the pointless had just released I have a
few<00:02:23.390> gameplays<00:02:23.840> from<00:02:24.140> it<00:02:24.290> but<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:24.830> most

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
few gameplays from it but for the most

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.059 
few gameplays from it but for the most
part<00:02:25.159> it's<00:02:25.519> pretty<00:02:26.140> boring<00:02:27.140> because<00:02:27.620> when<00:02:27.980> you

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
part it's pretty boring because when you

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.380 
part it's pretty boring because when you
put<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> four<00:02:28.640> on<00:02:28.760> four<00:02:29.000> team

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
put like the four on four team

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.030 
put like the four on four team
deathmatch<00:02:29.629> on<00:02:30.080> there<00:02:30.290> it's<00:02:30.470> it's<00:02:30.769> one<00:02:30.950> of

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
deathmatch on there it's it's one of

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.670 
deathmatch on there it's it's one of
those<00:02:31.129> things<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.580> uh<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:33.140> really<00:02:33.500> not

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
those things that uh it's really not

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.640 
those things that uh it's really not
that<00:02:34.010> exciting<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.819> watch<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.569> we<00:02:36.349> wind<00:02:36.500> up

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
that exciting to watch so we wind up

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.050 
that exciting to watch so we wind up
backing<00:02:37.010> out<00:02:37.129> but<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.400> free-for-alls<00:02:37.879> were

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
backing out but the free-for-alls were

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.630 
backing out but the free-for-alls were
fun<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:38.860> we<00:02:39.860> had<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> lot<00:02:40.099> of<00:02:40.190> fun<00:02:40.340> with<00:02:40.459> those

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
fun and we had a lot of fun with those

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.890 
fun and we had a lot of fun with those
but<00:02:40.910> there's<00:02:41.090> some<00:02:41.209> guy<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:41.690> joined

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
but there's some guy that just joined

each his own I guess I'm still the first
prestige<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.970> level<00:02:55.970> 70<00:02:56.420> I'm<00:02:57.019> not<00:02:57.230> budging<00:02:57.440> so

prestige and level 70 I'm not budging so
and<00:02:58.190> I've<00:02:58.280> got<00:02:58.430> about<00:02:58.549> 12<00:02:59.030> days<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.269> playtime

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
and I've got about 12 days of playtime

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.619 
and I've got about 12 days of playtime
on<00:03:00.019> here<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.760> but<00:03:01.760> right<00:03:02.000> right<00:03:02.209> now<00:03:02.359> I'm<00:03:02.480> just

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
on here so but right right now I'm just

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.800 
on here so but right right now I'm just
kind<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.900> watching<00:03:03.200> see<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.599> basically<00:03:05.599> just

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
kind of watching see and basically just

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.110 
kind of watching see and basically just
hoping<00:03:06.109> they<00:03:06.230> don't<00:03:06.290> get<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:07.120> there's

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
hoping they don't get it and there's

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.910 
hoping they don't get it and there's
like<00:03:08.329> there's<00:03:08.810> like<00:03:09.019> everybody's<00:03:09.560> set<00:03:09.739> up<00:03:09.829> in

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
like there's like everybody's set up in

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.319 
like there's like everybody's set up in
their<00:03:10.040> own<00:03:10.069> spots<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:10.760> after<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.000> realize<00:03:11.299> that

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
their own spots and after I realize that

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.729 
their own spots and after I realize that
we're<00:03:11.629> this<00:03:11.750> far<00:03:12.109> I<00:03:12.140> didn't<00:03:12.440> know<00:03:12.530> if<00:03:12.620> we'd

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
we're this far I didn't know if we'd

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.080 
we're this far I didn't know if we'd
actually<00:03:12.859> get<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.310> cuz<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.519> figured<00:03:13.879> you<00:03:14.000> know

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
actually get it cuz I figured you know

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.330 
actually get it cuz I figured you know
it's<00:03:14.239> five<00:03:14.420> on<00:03:14.599> five<00:03:14.840> they'll<00:03:15.739> probably<00:03:16.099> be

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
it's five on five they'll probably be

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.880 
it's five on five they'll probably be
able<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:16.579> get<00:03:16.730> one<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.120> one<00:03:18.079> of<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.260> flags

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
able to get one of the one of the flags

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.680 
able to get one of the one of the flags
of<00:03:19.099> whatever<00:03:19.250> but<00:03:19.579> they<00:03:19.790> they<00:03:20.269> really<00:03:20.510> don't

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
of whatever but they they really don't

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.960 
of whatever but they they really don't
succeed<00:03:20.989> this<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.859> basically<00:03:22.220> complete
