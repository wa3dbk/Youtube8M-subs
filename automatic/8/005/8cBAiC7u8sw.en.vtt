I am so shocked as bullet pointed that
much<00:01:35.549> which<00:01:36.180> tells<00:01:36.479> me<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.900> no<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> was<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
much which tells me if no it was a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.719 
much which tells me if no it was a
critical<00:01:37.590> hit<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> should<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.579> done

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
critical hit it should not have done

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.730 
critical hit it should not have done
that<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.030> which<00:01:39.689> tells<00:01:39.960> me<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> only

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
that much which tells me that the only

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.590 
that much which tells me that the only
explanation<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.610> he<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.970> choice<00:01:42.180> banded

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
explanation is that he is choice banded

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
explanation is that he is choice banded
and<00:01:43.280> he<00:01:44.280> has<00:01:44.399> another<00:01:44.610> crit<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:46.070> since<00:01:47.070> his

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and he has another crit to and since his

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.399 
and he has another crit to and since his
choice<00:01:47.579> banded<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.090> her<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.750> I'm<00:01:48.869> guessing<00:01:49.290> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
choice banded or her so I'm guessing I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.410 
choice banded or her so I'm guessing I
send<00:01:49.619> out<00:01:49.710> my<00:01:49.799> steelix<00:01:50.250> bullet<00:01:51.119> punch<00:01:51.270> would

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
send out my steelix bullet punch would

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.960 
send out my steelix bullet punch would
do<00:01:51.570> absolutely<00:01:51.810> nothing<00:01:52.439> against<00:01:53.310> steelix<00:01:53.759> at

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
do absolutely nothing against steelix at

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.649 
do absolutely nothing against steelix at
all<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.369> explosion<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.630> just

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
all so I go for explosion here I just

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.800 
all so I go for explosion here I just
want<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> take<00:01:58.290> out<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.560> politoed<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.810> was

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.819 
want to take out that politoed I was
hoping<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.110> he<00:02:01.229> would<00:02:01.350> switch<00:02:01.619> into

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
hoping that he would switch into

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.590 
hoping that he would switch into
politoed<00:02:02.250> which<00:02:02.430> she<00:02:02.549> does<00:02:02.759> not<00:02:02.939> end<00:02:03.180> up<00:02:03.329> doing

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
politoed which she does not end up doing

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.469 
politoed which she does not end up doing
instead<00:02:03.840> he<00:02:03.930> goes<00:02:04.079> first<00:02:04.290> bronze<00:02:04.590> org<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
instead he goes first bronze org and

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.839 
instead he goes first bronze org and
that's<00:02:06.479> not<00:02:06.659> too<00:02:06.840> good<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.380> because<00:02:07.829> now<00:02:08.670> I'm

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that's not too good here because now I'm

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.609 
that's not too good here because now I'm

org<00:03:26.330> and<00:03:26.540> my<00:03:26.750> waterspout<00:03:27.410> will<00:03:27.770> be<00:03:27.980> able<00:03:28.100> to

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
org and my waterspout will be able to

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.970 
org and my waterspout will be able to
take<00:03:28.370> him<00:03:28.520> out<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:30.350> now<00:03:30.470> he<00:03:30.530> sends<00:03:30.830> out<00:03:30.950> his

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
take him out so now he sends out his

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.820 
take him out so now he sends out his
Caesar<00:03:31.520> and<00:03:31.820> I'm<00:03:32.240> maybe<00:03:32.960> he<00:03:33.230> realizes<00:03:33.620> that

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
Caesar and I'm maybe he realizes that

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.890 
Caesar and I'm maybe he realizes that
I'm<00:03:34.130> Troy<00:03:34.310> specs<00:03:34.730> so<00:03:34.970> he<00:03:35.150> goes<00:03:35.330> for<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.540> bullet

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
I'm Troy specs so he goes for a bullet

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.410 
I'm Troy specs so he goes for a bullet
punch<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.680> bring<00:03:36.890> my<00:03:37.040> HP<00:03:37.250> down<00:03:37.730> to<00:03:38.030> as<00:03:38.150> low<00:03:38.300> as

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
punch to bring my HP down to as low as

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.830 
punch to bring my HP down to as low as
possible<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:40.209> even<00:03:41.209> though<00:03:41.270> it<00:03:41.390> does<00:03:41.510> not<00:03:41.660> do

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
possible and even though it does not do

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.560 
possible and even though it does not do
much<00:03:42.080> it<00:03:42.650> still<00:03:43.090> actually<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:44.180> takes<00:03:44.390> away

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
much it still actually it takes away

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.949 
much it still actually it takes away
almost<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.990> third<00:03:45.200> of<00:03:45.290> my<00:03:45.350> HP<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:47.630> that<00:03:47.810> will

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
almost a third of my HP so that will

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.680 
almost a third of my HP so that will
weaken<00:03:48.350> my<00:03:48.590> waterspout<00:03:49.430> attack<00:03:49.730> but<00:03:50.480> since

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
weaken my waterspout attack but since

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.449 
weaken my waterspout attack but since
it's<00:03:50.870> raining<00:03:51.020> and<00:03:51.410> since<00:03:51.650> I'm<00:03:51.770> Troy<00:03:51.890> specs<00:03:52.280> my

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
it's raining and since I'm Troy specs my

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.070 
it's raining and since I'm Troy specs my
waterspout<00:03:52.910> will<00:03:53.120> still<00:03:53.450> be<00:03:53.690> able<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.930> take

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
waterspout will still be able to take

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.010 
waterspout will still be able to take
Cecil<00:03:54.470> wrap<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.370> now<00:03:55.490> here<00:03:55.760> I'm<00:03:55.940> thinking

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
Cecil wrap so now here I'm thinking

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
Cecil wrap so now here I'm thinking
waterspout<00:03:57.020> will<00:03:57.200> not<00:03:57.410> be<00:03:57.590> able<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:57.800> kill

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
waterspout will not be able to kill

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.870 
waterspout will not be able to kill
politoed<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.950> just<00:04:00.950> go<00:04:01.070> for<00:04:01.280> it<00:04:01.340> anyway<00:04:01.700> because

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
politoed I just go for it anyway because

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.030 
politoed I just go for it anyway because
I<00:04:02.060> just<00:04:03.050> want<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.290> get<00:04:03.410> as<00:04:03.470> much<00:04:03.560> damage<00:04:03.920> as

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
I just want to get as much damage as

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.290 
I just want to get as much damage as
possible<00:04:04.100> thinking<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:04.760> might<00:04:04.880> do<00:04:05.060> about

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
possible thinking you might do about

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.380 
possible thinking you might do about
half<00:04:05.740> instead<00:04:06.740> it<00:04:07.040> does<00:04:07.310> kill<00:04:07.700> with<00:04:08.360> a

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
half instead it does kill with a

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.900 
half instead it does kill with a
critical<00:04:08.870> hit<00:04:09.050> so<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.380> got<00:04:09.590> lucky<00:04:09.709> there<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.310> I

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
critical hit so I got lucky there and I

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.400 
critical hit so I got lucky there and I
guess<00:04:11.090> that's<00:04:11.209> payback<00:04:11.630> for<00:04:11.810> his<00:04:11.959> critical

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
guess that's payback for his critical

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.199 
guess that's payback for his critical
hits<00:04:12.650> against<00:04:12.950> my<00:04:13.130> Charizard<00:04:13.700> so<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:14.000> guess

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
hits against my Charizard so I guess

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.140 
hits against my Charizard so I guess
we're<00:04:14.390> even<00:04:14.420> now<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:16.430> know<00:04:16.580> since<00:04:16.790> that<00:04:16.850> has<00:04:17.000> V

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
we're even now you know since that has V

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.150 
we're even now you know since that has V
poori<00:04:17.450> on<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:17.840> go<00:04:17.989> for<00:04:18.170> waterspout<00:04:18.650> for<00:04:18.980> the

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
poori on I go for waterspout for the

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.659 
poori on I go for waterspout for the
kill<00:04:20.229> so<00:04:21.229> this<00:04:21.440> is<00:04:21.620> not<00:04:21.890> something<00:04:22.400> that<00:04:22.430> you

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
kill so this is not something that you

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.270 
kill so this is not something that you
see<00:04:22.850> every<00:04:22.880> day<00:04:23.240> a<00:04:23.830> waterspout

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
team I'm sweeping water pokemon with my

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.440 
team I'm sweeping water pokemon with my
water<00:04:32.420> attacks<00:04:32.900> so<00:04:33.260> that<00:04:33.440> is<00:04:33.710> just<00:04:34.250> amazing<00:04:35.030> I

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
water attacks so that is just amazing I

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.170 
water attacks so that is just amazing I
only<00:04:36.290> have<00:04:36.500> one<00:04:36.770> waterspout<00:04:37.340> attack<00:04:37.669> left<00:04:37.940> so

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
only have one waterspout attack left so

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.690 
only have one waterspout attack left so
I<00:04:38.210> stretched<00:04:38.510> out<00:04:38.720> into<00:04:38.870> weavile<00:04:39.380> here

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
I stretched out into weavile here

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.159 
I stretched out into weavile here
thinking<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:40.730> you<00:04:40.940> might<00:04:41.090> go<00:04:41.660> for<00:04:41.900> some

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
thinking that you might go for some

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.770 
thinking that you might go for some
scholars<00:04:42.889> or<00:04:43.010> something<00:04:43.490> but<00:04:43.730> city<00:04:44.389> goes<00:04:44.600> for

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
scholars or something but city goes for

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.990 
scholars or something but city goes for
protect<00:04:45.290> which<00:04:45.500> is<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.889> don't<00:04:46.669> know<00:04:46.730> why<00:04:46.820> you'd

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
protect which is I don't know why you'd

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.140 
protect which is I don't know why you'd
do<00:04:47.240> that<00:04:47.389> maybe<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.590> try<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:48.919> lower<00:04:49.400> my<00:04:49.700> attacks

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
do that maybe to try to lower my attacks

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.210 
do that maybe to try to lower my attacks
so<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:50.600> would<00:04:50.990> end<00:04:51.020> up<00:04:51.260> using<00:04:51.410> struggle<00:04:52.040> or

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
so I would end up using struggle or

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.540 
so I would end up using struggle or
forced<00:04:52.700> to<00:04:52.940> switch<00:04:53.770> but<00:04:54.770> he<00:04:54.889> goes<00:04:55.010> for<00:04:55.190> protect

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
forced to switch but he goes for protect

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.950 
forced to switch but he goes for protect
again<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:56.270> make<00:04:56.720> sure<00:04:56.930> that<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:57.860> don't<00:04:58.780> fake<00:04:59.780> out

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
again to make sure that I don't fake out

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.810 
again to make sure that I don't fake out
so<00:05:00.560> this<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:00.800> his<00:05:01.070> last<00:05:01.250> poke<00:05:01.460> want<00:05:01.669> his
