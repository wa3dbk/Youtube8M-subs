00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.820
 new trading video 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.349

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.050
 resounding sale you have been waiting for

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.990
 Episode the third episode is gone 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.940
 really very well we have passed the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.230
 200 like so I'll leave viking 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.510
 written did not serve to go and see 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.030
 today we begin immediately in this fourth 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.119
 episode we will start from 106 thousand credits 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.170
 that the budget in which we finished it 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.199
 last episode then the first 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.609
 The player we are looking for is neymar 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.739
 in its normal version 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.780
 we know this at less than 65,000 lo 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.370
 we buy at 55 thousand credits 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.679
 but beware of kids this was the 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.309
 version 87 because the version is also two 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.839
 upgrade 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.239
 so you go to school 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.800
 experimental will look for people 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.300
 87 small that you have compliments then 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.739
 go and see how much its price 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.539
 so go outside and go up 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.100
 transfers went to look for some 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.899
 its price at that time of course 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.659
 for example, check this moment 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.150
 sees therefore we find some at 77 thousand 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.910
 so its price will be 76,000 us 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.980
 we paid 50 5500 of course 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.710
 by doing this they will succeed both 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.600
 86 be in 87 you have to be careful 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.390
 you to which then you take in 86 yes 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.520
 will sell on the 72 thousand the 83 that yes here 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.320
 could sell 76,000 of the fantasy and 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.700
 all are in the field 2000 then 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.380
 paying so vichy they practically have it 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.680
 both though taking them less than 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.780
 65 thousand any people you will take there 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.780
 would earn about if you want 10 87 there 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.900
 earns 4,000 credit which is a 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.000
 therefore very active gain 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.130
 this way we always put 66 thousand 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.860
 we are going to look for another always from 65 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.580
 thousand more let's see if there are 86 87 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.090
 c is an 86 we pay 61,500 credits 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.710
 therefore also which gain is really 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.220
 very high and we sell it at 71,000 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.930
 credits while that 87 where we went 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.030
 c64 micheli other player we go 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.340
 to look for and the kun aguero attacker of the 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.080
 manchester city here in its version 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.460
 always upgrade him too with the over all 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.350
 87 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.050
 here we go to buy it immediately is 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.319
 released after a few seconds at 48,000 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.700
 credits and sold easily to 56,000 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.299
 of this you can go and look 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.170
 directly only 87 86 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.590
 you could hardly do market 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.030
 it is not like neymar and that much 86 87 to 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.980
 first equal this true search 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.499
 directly because 87 is really 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.900
 excellent at this time relief of 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:32.599
 see here talked 42 thousand and 250 million 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.219
 57 thousand other player who goes to 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.040
 look for philipp lahm makes you aware 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:38.959
 of this channel and who pay it 2600 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.469
 credits with the indefatigable understanding style 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.239
 37 contracts and therefore also a very good one 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.439
 understanding style and excellent contracts and yes 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.510
 he quietly sold 2 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.189
 3620 went to look for some players 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.359
 old because I have to tell the truth this is 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.400
 was one of the few widespread need 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.829
 I play a little more his 80 that is between 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.480
 very expensive players is because it is 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.909
 because with the budget I had of 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.489
 106 thousand credits then when you go 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.139
 to aim for 500,000 credits or 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.449
 where lower player tip though 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.019
 many pink cards have come out 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.090
 players 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.530
 their price has fallen and here they are 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.389
 went to look for those ones 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.409
 unique that have not precipitated as here 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:21.199
 races of a real beast 90 then 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.599
 always sellable but cat 125,000 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:25.909
 credits and it was quietly sold 240 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.680
 thousand were very few 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.280
 why with this pink classy cabbage 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.959
 the market practically subsided 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.400
 very much so I found a lot 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.530
 more difficulty than the other times 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.449
 tool that practically before with 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.689
 any player I could do 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:43.669
 quietly buying and selling instead of a 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.150
 a bit more difficult because you see something else here 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.329
 player 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.540
 I take suarez to 111,000 credit lo 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.290
 we quietly resell to many of 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.180
 more because 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.129
 which he also knows is one of those who 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.650
 right now almost everyone 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.109
 they are buying and therefore always 111 thousand 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.359
 believe you take it to sell it at 130 is a 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.709
 great gain and people at the end if 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.840
 buy it because one of the attackers 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.480
 stronger than this rite 15 and therefore 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.159
 will always have market the only hope is 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.900
 which will not fall even more though 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.579
 I don't think I think now that maybe 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.479
 pink players will be disposed of 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.639
 probably players should of 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.830
 new climb here we go to look 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.620
 sirigu porter of the omen hemand 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.210
 bought 2,900 previ I had to vary 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.400
 a little guys because a lot of players 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.340
 expensive has not been asking more and I wanted 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.630
 at least try to reach 100 kd 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.310
 gain in all that is the episode 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.900
 that I went to look for some 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.940
 players that maybe I remembered that 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.979
 they were out at the times you can 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.410
 paid two thousand and then 3700 was sold 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.570
 so there were a thousand 2003 profits 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.550
 removing a mandatory and then I have 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.229
 had to try to do some variation 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.240
 because the players were really a lot 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.800
 difficult to find in this period but 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.560
 obviously it will only be this small 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.830
 period because then just the players 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.940
 rose were out of the market there 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.380
 will be problems 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.440
 another player we are looking for e 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.360
 the tottenham joris goalkeeper that his 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.010
 price is a little higher than the south and vi 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.780
 it will seem strange because it shows how come 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.060
 it's up to someone and an opponent of two 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.340
 because guys right now 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.050
 and penalized the French championship 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.110
 one day period in the French Senate 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.669
 and so French players are a bit 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.840
 price increases here for 1200 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.340
 always quietly he sold on 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.800
 4829 lies his hold as soon as the 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.510
 Campano French will collapse badly 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.919
 so he is a player you have to be 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.659
 a little more careful because the price is 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.039
 missed a little for this reason therefore 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:37.440
 let's see all the players 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:41.070
 sold and look at how many are the 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.010
 our credits 208 thousand credits we started 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.289
 with 106 thousand credits therefore in 20 minutes 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.180
 we have done more than 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.490
 100k so really a result 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.500
 incredible and against all odds 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.169
 because I thought this episode I have 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.250
 found many more difficulties a 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.199
 record it because many players don't 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.810
 there were many players stood 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.760
 like pretty much tops were 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.720
 practically all of them almost at 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.150
 limit 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.610
 it was really very hard less bad than that 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.220
 I found these bale suarez aguero e 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.650
 then the others maybe mines rodriguez 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.510
 also quite good because this 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.800
 episode I liked we have for the 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.900
 next episode of the sale 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.940
 sensational we must always exceed 200 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.370
 I like it I recommend you do hope 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.750
 that I will try to register them then one 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.310
 small challenge that I launch as 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.570
 another time we didn't figure 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.680
 this time we hope to succeed in 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.380
 overcome 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.880
 if we can overcome the 100 life 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.860
 so guys it's not a business 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.190
 difficult but we can do it 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.900
 quietly 100 live within 6 pm 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.390
 I will charge you another methods not 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.010
 come with a particular player 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:46.110
 which I think is the best player in 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.150
 this moment for which it can be done 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.490
 he understands why he leaves practically not 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.960
 I know why I looked when I did it 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.540
 guys it seemed pretty much a bug 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.330
 because it always came out very appreciated 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.930
 at 18 I will check if there are more than 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.360
 100 live 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.370
 I 'll upload the quest video right away 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.900
 Another method of comparison to see you 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.840
 good component video product to everyone 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.490
 given by the cold and everything beautiful or glory is 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.169
 yes guys we are in the score 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.390
 look who our star will be 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:15.630
 guys from carlos tevez 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:18.919
 actions or a real beast 90 made of 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.919
 speed at 90 if I tell you
