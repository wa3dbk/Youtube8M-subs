00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:08.760
 And then, folks, all right, I hope so. 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.800
 So make a video for you guys. 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:19.400
 showing the details of the bike and that I 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.400
 I made is the text of the handlebar, right? 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.480
 I wanted to buy it already in the golden color but 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.410
 here in curitiba I was not finding 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:33.809
 ready for her and I only had one 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.020
 complete set in but this one is the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.960
 warm mitt has no way I did not 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.960
 here and here too 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:57.059
 detail in gold me in escape also 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:01:02.210
 I escaped with gold I did well 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:07.580
 One afternoon I could paint 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:12.229
 so varnishing is that 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.909
 the dema a stylized as they say 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.310
 the leakage will hold the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.530
 temperature 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.400
 possibly this part here in a rodeo 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.180
 with her maybe I can not stand it 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:36.869
 But the chick again here is not hot. 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:39.030
 then both will get here show 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.640
 For you and details on the fairing then the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.909
 the warm wind of the world's 91 engine in a 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.000
 room at all the same leg understood 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:57.570
 because the wind out side you will go 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.810
 I can not see it played here. 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:06.090
 it matters in heavy traffic it heats up 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.390
 but it does not bother you that on this side 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.390
 also 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.950
 the same thing I went to 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.950
 here 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.680
 So that's it folks I hate to 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.400
 lose this suspension a little 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.070
 leaving a little harder pressure 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.110
 on the ball because sometimes in two it was 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.410
 giving a bit of end of course to 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.950
 suspension has not improved. 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.630
 cool 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.880
 That's it, everybody, it's a show . 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.870
 ball 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.870
 I'm recording here now. 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.340
 recording another box in the 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.260
 less than recording a helmet because later 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.470
 which changes position here after 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:06.050
 getting hit is mostly complicated 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.290
 yesterday more what I do than the 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.030
 put on it maybe the only thing I 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.680
 I'm going for a sports filter on a 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.370
 cayenne 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.299
 but otherwise I will not mess with it anymore 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.329
 nothing that is already customized 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:29.000
 enough golden and I thought it was 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:32.470
 Well, it's cool, it's even that. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.470
 staff became stylish 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.250
 so this is it, personal beauty until the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.180
 next video 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.079
 I hope you enjoy your comments, and even 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.709
 next 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.709
 hug
