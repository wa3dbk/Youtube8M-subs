 of mysteries you will know others 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.940
 you will know but what is undoubtedly 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.220
 is that most of them do not have 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.769
 explanation and certainly not the 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.740
 never have never come to it 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:26.650
 the first mystery is that it happened with the 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.689
 appo that bolt gs everything starts when the 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.759
 professor echoes this 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.500
 extraordinary pokemon that in that 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.559
 then it was in the hands of the teacher 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.030
 ibi and decides to investigate the but 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.039
 they discover that it is because they are not going 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.660
 can teleport or use to 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.510
 capture go you can not do anything 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.280
 after studying the professor thoroughly 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.039
 do all kinds of experiments with it 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.379
 not get any results like 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.629
 Professor and saw that so little not 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.270
 get any results so 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.700
 as a last resort he instructs 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.010
 to be brought to Kurt by an expert in 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.110
 elaboration of little more to see if 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.660
 then in that way they discover the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.570
 secret of the po that bolt gs in the 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.520
 path as well try to discover the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.370
 mystery of the po that bolt but not 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.100
 get nothing is finally delivered to 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.000
 Kurt and after that he has not gone back to 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.940
 know nothing about the gs ball absolutely 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.100
 nothing strange something being the way the 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.380
 protagonist of all that crossing of ace 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.780
 practically in all that season the 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.310
 gs ball is like the main one 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.729
 protagonist so it's strange that 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.290
 disappear so suddenly the only thing that 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.899
 we can know is that in the version 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.750
 Japanese and only in the Japanese 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.509
 Crystal pokemon while covering the hut 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.660
 of the forest with the gs ball suddenly 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.149
 appears celebi yes gentlemen appears celebi 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.500
 will have something to do with celebi this 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.070
 Pokemon 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.810
 will be that celebi lives in the gs ball and for 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.330
 that nobody gets to open it or maybe 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.540
 televise the toad guardian that bolt 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.270
 but what is it that protects celebi for 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.580
 guard that pokemon in that way that 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.410
 there is inside that pokemon 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.200
 there may be something that is better not 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.230
 know and be the reason for the disappearance 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.360
 of Professor ibi and him and the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.450
 despair of brock every time 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.520
 they talk about it is something strange since the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.310
 ibi teacher as well you know also 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.560
 investigated the gs bolt you never know what 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.560
 happened with Professor ibi and she never 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.910
 will also know what happened to the gs ball in 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.730
 the next story we have the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.489
 mystery of the hunt formerly 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.560
 when pokemon the church was created if 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.750
 you are listening to the church well 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.950
 immediately went out to say that pokemon 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.380
 it was satanic vale they believed that pokemon was 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.320
 satanic and so they claimed but their 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.880
 accusations did not appreciate having any 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.840
 any sense 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.600
 but pokemon as studied 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.770
 it means a thousand times more powerful than 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.430
 God then this makes us think 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.320
 many things because the people who created 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.320
 pokemon who was the person who created 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.550
 pokemon and because he put him especially 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.400
 pokemon was chance or maybe the 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.210
 person who created pokemon was atheist not 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.190
 I believed in God what was the meaning of 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.620
 that I put pokemon so that the 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.350
 meaning of pokemon meaning 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.270
 a thousand times more powerful than god who 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.760
 can believe himself more powerful than god 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.740
 who can be against god and 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.380
 the ears of pikachu are actually 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.520
 horns that's what it's said that the 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.980
 Picacho ears are actually 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.860
 horns in the image that you have in 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.560
 screen the mark on the wing head 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.980
 hunt if you can see the hunt it seems 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.750
 be an esoteric pentagram that is a 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.240
 esoteric pentagram then I do not either 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.040
 I have a lot of ideas but what I do 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.650
 we know is that the production of the hunt 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.810
 what is cadabra has a clear star 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.510
 on your forehead as we can see doing 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.870
 more obvious the reference of the staff 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.270
 esoteric in hunting I admit no 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.730
 have no damn idea so I tell you 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.200
 idea of ​​what this symbol means and 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.720
 about this symbol I do not have very 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.780
 studied but what exists is that this 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.970
 symbol is related to the supernatural 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.910
 more specifically with the demons and the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.620
 satanic 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.010
 can you think 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.070
 there is behind the word pokemon that 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.070
 means pokemon really is something 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.070
 Satanic 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.400
 you can say it's not all nonsense and 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.069
 guys but pokemon means a thousand times 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.050
 more powerful than god that can be 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.060
 chance yes but the pentagram of 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.599
 Alcazar is related to the 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.310
 satanic jazz bandos coincidences 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:56.349
 we could be talking about the creator 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.360
 of pokemon the creator of the word 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:03.710
 pokemon hated god was a person 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.520
 to last the devil 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.520
