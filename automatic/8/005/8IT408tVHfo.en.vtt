00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:03.180
 jorissen snowman 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.680
 the wind is back in the country 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.680
 it has snowed quite a few times 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.779
 the children from it anyway have made a beautiful snowman 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.329
 show that is completely ready again 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.919
 a movie a button counting 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.749
 think norwegian playman 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.679
 I am in the middle of the square so I can see exactly what is happening 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.060
 indeed 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.140
 and crazy is all going on 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.500
 so every year I am still standing on Clausplein with very beautiful cherry poles 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 balls and garlands in all kinds of colors 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.540
 in the shops the lamps are lit. everything is nicely decorated 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.380
 also the nativity scene with the baby jesus 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.039
 Jozef Maria 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.080
 stands proudly in the same place 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.080
 but where are the ox and the donkey 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.270
 helicon how i feel now 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.120
 isis money behind many a back 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.670
 think you are high 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.680
 now i feel that the speaker 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.240
 He is a little scared of the snowballs that are going through the sky 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.230
 to go 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.570
 ans has just made a nice big snowball 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.719
 it is certain 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:23.490
 he is so shy 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.110
 but yes and jacob 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.010
 also have a ball in hand 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.610
 it grew like that 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.830
 how exactly at the same time 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.240
 on old 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 high sweeten you not far behind 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.080
 that is the voice of the Christmas tree 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.080
 also nice on time 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.190
 in a few 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.190
 then the children might get a present 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570
 but I do miss someone for the sled 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.540
 last year it was very bad and animal with a big nose 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.950
 corner is his name again 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.950
 I don't care about others 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.560
 He will be Santa Claus that he walked through the air 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.560
 to the children's homes 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.779
 so deep a new animal can make it 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.959
 so completely one can 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.669
 do you know the answer 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.539
 careful joesoef 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.089
 I have a high voice 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.089
 they are on the back of the sled 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.540
 where do they have to go and get hold of 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.540
 and I don't get hit by his hard fast ball 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.769
 they stop thinking quickly for the colorful 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.639
 it keeps it very tasty there 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.509
 to tackle his very best 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:50.750
 on all sorts 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.259
 make delicious things 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:57.029
 on the scale next to the eur they are 7 packages 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.569
 that is not sold next door 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.170
 Opposite, shopping is all children who like to enter 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:13.349
 you can see the map large gate over 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.439
 lot x 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.139
 toy stands up anyway 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.739
 the presents in the window are already nicely wrapped 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.769
 on a pier look up carefully 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.749
 same snowball from hans 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.749
 but yes or get Jacob 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.399
 they were not allowed to know 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:39.509
 jibril 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:43.409
 not only Jewish snowman watching large children in the square 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.919
 in addition, toy store peeked a few helpers from the 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:50.820
 warrior 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.129
 when we calibrated 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.859
 he plays sweet 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.359
 and it helps very well 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.290
 so I have to remember everything 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.290
 and later to strengthen Santa Claus 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.620
 Christmas 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.059
 per tuktuk presents are under the good Christmas tree 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:11.859
 but the ad is happy 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.859
 sleep a few more nights 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.019
 if you have more credit for the Christmas song 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.039
 enjoy your meal 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.270
 merry christmas 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.219
 6 through the snow 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.210
 he gives each give 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.850
 I think
