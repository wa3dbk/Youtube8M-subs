something<00:03:07.900> here<00:03:08.079> I<00:03:08.109> love<00:03:08.379> this<00:03:08.500> movement<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:08.859> do

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:08.919 
something here I love this movement I do

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.679 
something here I love this movement I do
in<00:03:09.069> my<00:03:09.099> basement<00:03:09.370> at<00:03:09.639> home<00:03:09.669> I<00:03:09.970> use<00:03:10.359> a<00:03:10.389> coffee

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
in my basement at home I use a coffee

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.500 
in my basement at home I use a coffee
table<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.379> I<00:03:11.650> got<00:03:11.799> an<00:03:11.919> old<00:03:12.069> travelling<00:03:12.639> lug<00:03:13.329> it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
table and I got an old travelling lug it

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.000 
table and I got an old travelling lug it
piece<00:03:13.659> of<00:03:13.840> luggage<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.199> sort<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.709> soft

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
piece of luggage that sort of soft

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.460 
piece of luggage that sort of soft
plastic<00:03:15.909> and<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.510> put<00:03:16.659> my<00:03:16.780> feet<00:03:16.959> up<00:03:16.989> on<00:03:17.169> that<00:03:17.349> and

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
plastic and I put my feet up on that and

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.479 
plastic and I put my feet up on that and
it<00:03:17.500> works<00:03:17.680> actually<00:03:17.919> better<00:03:18.220> than<00:03:18.340> a

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
it works actually better than a

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.490 
it works actually better than a
resistive<00:03:19.000> also<00:03:19.329> just<00:03:19.810> be<00:03:19.930> creative<00:03:20.199> with

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
resistive also just be creative with

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.780 
resistive also just be creative with
your<00:03:20.530> equipment<00:03:20.859> you<00:03:21.190> can<00:03:21.280> use<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> lot<00:03:21.699> of

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
your equipment you can use a lot of

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.849 
your equipment you can use a lot of
things<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.479> the<00:03:22.569> resistive<00:03:23.049> ball<00:03:23.169> helps<00:03:23.440> but

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
things and the resistive ball helps but

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:24.930 
things and the resistive ball helps but
it<00:03:23.979> kind<00:03:24.190> of<00:03:24.220> helps<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.519> notice<00:03:24.729> I<00:03:24.819> was

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
it kind of helps you notice I was

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.819 
it kind of helps you notice I was
struggling<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.049> kind<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.319> keep<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.650> centered

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
struggling to kind of keep it centered

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.460 
struggling to kind of keep it centered
there<00:03:26.979> so<00:03:27.159> it<00:03:27.220> helps<00:03:27.430> your<00:03:27.519> core<00:03:27.819> to

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
there so it helps your core to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.349 
there so it helps your core to
additionally<00:03:29.489> what<00:03:30.489> I<00:03:30.579> learned<00:03:30.909> is<00:03:31.030> doing

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
additionally what I learned is doing

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.199 
additionally what I learned is doing
this<00:03:31.510> yeah<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.139> that<00:03:32.260> if<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.129> come<00:03:33.310> all<00:03:33.609> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
this yeah is that if you come all the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.199 
this yeah is that if you come all the
way<00:03:34.239> down<00:03:34.389> and<00:03:34.720> actually<00:03:35.409> my<00:03:35.680> butt<00:03:36.129> was<00:03:36.729> hit<00:03:36.970> as

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
way down and actually my butt was hit as

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.699 
way down and actually my butt was hit as
hiddy<00:03:37.510> touching<00:03:38.019> actually<00:03:38.319> touching<00:03:38.680> the

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
hiddy touching actually touching the

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.990 
hiddy touching actually touching the
floor<00:03:38.949> so<00:03:39.729> that<00:03:39.760> really<00:03:40.379> stretches<00:03:41.379> your<00:03:42.280> your

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
floor so that really stretches your your

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.729 
floor so that really stretches your your
whole<00:03:43.180> shoulder<00:03:43.510> area<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.139> get<00:03:44.229> a<00:03:44.260> better

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
whole shoulder area and get a better

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.009 
whole shoulder area and get a better
range<00:03:45.129> of<00:03:45.310> motion<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:45.729> way<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.090> try<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.840> go

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
range of motion that way so try to go

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.839 
range of motion that way so try to go
down<00:03:47.049> as<00:03:47.349> deeply<00:03:47.889> as<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.129> can<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.639> will<00:03:48.729> make

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
down as deeply as you can that will make

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.099 
down as deeply as you can that will make
a<00:03:48.879> big<00:03:48.970> difference<00:03:49.150> for<00:03:49.629> you<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.810> actually

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
a big difference for you it actually

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.809 
a big difference for you it actually
makes<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.829> harder<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.280> you're<00:03:51.549> going<00:03:51.639> to<00:03:51.699> be

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
makes it harder and you're going to be

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.039 
makes it harder and you're going to be
able<00:03:51.849> to<00:03:52.000> do<00:03:52.090> less<00:03:52.329> reps<00:03:52.659> but<00:03:52.780> they're<00:03:52.959> gonna

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
able to do less reps but they're gonna

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.929 
able to do less reps but they're gonna
be<00:03:53.169> higher<00:03:53.319> quality<00:03:53.739> reps<00:03:53.949> absolutely<00:03:54.729> and

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
be higher quality reps absolutely and

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.460 
be higher quality reps absolutely and
like<00:03:55.329> we<00:03:55.449> said<00:03:55.599> in<00:03:55.720> one<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:55.959> our<00:03:56.109> other<00:03:56.169> videos

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
like we said in one of our other videos

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.409 
like we said in one of our other videos

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
in the joints you have to differentiate

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.800 
in the joints you have to differentiate
between<00:03:59.859> a<00:04:00.099> good<00:04:00.310> feeling<00:04:00.669> and<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:01.239> bad<00:04:01.419> feeling

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
between a good feeling and a bad feeling

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.629 
between a good feeling and a bad feeling
back<00:04:02.139> away<00:04:02.319> from<00:04:02.409> it<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.769> little<00:04:02.919> bit<00:04:03.159> but<00:04:03.519> if

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
back away from it a little bit but if

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:04.710 
back away from it a little bit but if
there's<00:04:03.790> no<00:04:03.909> negative<00:04:04.269> feelings<00:04:04.540> in<00:04:04.599> those

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
there's no negative feelings in those

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.849 
there's no negative feelings in those
joints<00:04:05.049> and<00:04:05.169> tendons<00:04:05.290> go<00:04:05.560> all<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.739> way<00:04:05.769> down

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
joints and tendons go all the way down

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.379 
joints and tendons go all the way down
get<00:04:06.129> a<00:04:06.159> nice<00:04:06.340> stretch<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:06.970> pause<00:04:07.120> for<00:04:07.329> a
