probably<00:00:33.930> jump<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.380> hole<00:00:34.469> which<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.070> what

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
probably jump in the hole which is what

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
probably jump in the hole which is what
I'm<00:00:35.340> used<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:36.050> yep

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
I'm used to yep

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.280 
I'm used to yep
oh<00:00:37.710> man<00:00:38.750> oh<00:00:39.750> man<00:00:41.510> I'm<00:00:42.510> gonna<00:00:42.690> assume<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:42.989> I'm

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
oh man oh man I'm gonna assume that I'm

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
oh man oh man I'm gonna assume that I'm
guessing<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.489> right<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
guessing that it's like right in the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.459 
guessing that it's like right in the
middle<00:00:45.300> name<00:00:45.600> can't<00:00:45.960> really

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
middle name can't really

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.130 
middle name can't really
I'm<00:00:46.620> gonna<00:00:46.710> guess<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.039> right<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.370> middle

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
I'm gonna guess is right in the middle
