00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:30.380 

Oh

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.260 

you

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.029 

it<00:01:34.869> wasn't<00:01:35.200> until<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.469> was<00:01:35.590> looking<00:01:35.859> at<00:01:35.920> this

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
it wasn't until I was looking at this

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.709 
it wasn't until I was looking at this
video<00:01:36.340> in<00:01:36.520> slow<00:01:36.670> motion<00:01:37.149> that<00:01:37.179> I<00:01:37.359> truly

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
video in slow motion that I truly

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.200 
video in slow motion that I truly
graphed<00:01:38.140> what<00:01:38.409> was<00:01:38.560> going<00:01:38.829> on<00:01:38.979> when<00:01:39.969> I<00:01:40.030> was

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
graphed what was going on when I was

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.969 
graphed what was going on when I was
watching<00:01:40.359> Stephanie<00:01:40.899> knit<00:01:41.049> in<00:01:41.140> real-time<00:01:41.350> it

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
watching Stephanie knit in real-time it

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.800 
watching Stephanie knit in real-time it
was<00:01:42.189> just<00:01:42.429> so<00:01:42.640> fast<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.509> seemed<00:01:43.689> to<00:01:43.750> be

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
was just so fast that it seemed to be

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.160 
was just so fast that it seemed to be
completely<00:01:44.049> otherworldly<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.310> impossible

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
completely otherworldly and impossible

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.690 
completely otherworldly and impossible
slowing<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.289> down<00:01:47.319> made<00:01:47.770> me<00:01:47.920> realize<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.610> if

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
slowing it down made me realize that if

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.389 
slowing it down made me realize that if
you<00:01:48.819> knew<00:01:48.969> English<00:01:49.149> style<00:01:49.600> which<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.319> do

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you knew English style which I do

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.590 
you knew English style which I do
there's<00:01:51.399> very<00:01:51.700> little<00:01:51.909> difference<00:01:52.119> between

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
there's very little difference between

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.539 
there's very little difference between
your<00:01:53.020> technique<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:53.920> harlots

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
your technique and the harlots

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.850 
your technique and the harlots
you<00:01:55.539> simply<00:01:55.840> must<00:01:56.020> hold<00:01:56.229> your<00:01:56.319> working<00:01:56.560> yarn

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
you simply must hold your working yarn

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.559 
you simply must hold your working yarn
and<00:01:57.069> an<00:01:57.219> appropriate<00:01:57.700> angle<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.270> your<00:01:58.390> working

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
and an appropriate angle to your working

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.389 
and an appropriate angle to your working
needle<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.289> that<00:01:59.439> your<00:01:59.560> right<00:01:59.740> hand<00:02:00.009> moves<00:02:00.219> as

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
needle so that your right hand moves as

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.539 
needle so that your right hand moves as
little<00:02:00.909> as<00:02:01.149> possible<00:02:01.390> in<00:02:01.990> this<00:02:02.920> video

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
little as possible in this video

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.639
