00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 cool and beautiful people who see my 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.230
 videos every Tuesday 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 I am bathes and I am not on how eager 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.529
 had to finally upload this video is that 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.200
 the truth the things that we are going to do 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.449
 to really need cool things 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.210
 We are going to have issues from 14 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.460
 February are details to deliver to 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.530
 those people that we most want so that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.199
 never forget that they are always going to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.780
 be in our heart I hope that you 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.780
 like it and let's start 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.629
 the materials the only thing that we're going to 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.350
 need is paper 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.570
 decorated with you or scissors once the 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.550
 paddles according to the lioness 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.010
 to form our palettes we need 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.720
 a triangle to make each heart what 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.780
 what will we do to make our 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.699
 sheet and place the tip towards the other 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.800
 end more or less like that after we go to 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.500
 take our rule and we will put it 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.840
 in the white border we will make the cutter with 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.369
 our faces and we cut that effect we 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.220
 is going to be a triangle that open it will 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.110
 to be square when unfolding we are going to 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.119
 cut through the middle where the line was 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.619
 marked so with practically a 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.420
 sheet reaches us to make two 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.119
 hearts we take the first triangle 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.220
 first we take the top tip towards 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.869
 us and then if you so that what 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.060
 see a little better and then they go to 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.830
 take the first tip and they will bend it 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.050
 up and the same thing is going to be done 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.030
 with the other peak we turn our 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.310
 heart try 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.500
 the tips out and the other 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.450
 also like this we already have our heart 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.720
 the following is going to unfold the sheet 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.960
 and with a feather down or what we 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.180
 We want to write what we feel for 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.210
 the person we are going to give 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.330
 our heart stick after that what 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.460
 they wrote they are going to take their palette and the 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.979
 they will place what they are going to do next 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.979
 which is to mark the heart again as 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.720
 we had it done after that they 're going to 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.140
 fold the corner of the back 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.730
 the other also and the other also and the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.730
 another one too and ready 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.780
 the truth that is fine you just need 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.450
 a sheet your scissors a pencil and a good 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.160
 pulse to draw a big heart shots 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 something round and after its circumferences 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.030
 I care that you do not look too perfect 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.910
 because I do not stay like that of all 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.530
 ways since I have these two circuits 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.890
 with a little point a bit far 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.800
 just in half and with your strips 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.560
 you're going to measure from the end of the edge of 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.750
 your circle up to that point and you're going to 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.710
 trace you have to be here with kevin 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:58.180
 pimp the heart the following thing is going to do 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.070
 cut out and trim the next thing you're going 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.440
 to do is write whatever you want in 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.840
 your letter first erase what you did 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.620
 with pencil and write what you want 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.820
 what follows is to bend the little circle and 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.100
 fold the other one too 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.650
 bend this up you will stay 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.750
 something like that and the next thing is to double this 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.910
 down if you have a spare tip what 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.620
 what you can do is fold it and here 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.730
 outside you decorate it with what you 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.730
 want and ready 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.020
 the truth is that it is something very simple and 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.020
 hope you like 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.230
 the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.650
 simple one cutter one eraser and ink 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.530
 for stamps first on your draft 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.990
 trace your heart 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.440
 so pretty much the next thing is going to be 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.350
 cut it with the cutter will cut everything 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.990
 the outline and the next thing is going to be going 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.650
 lowering the draft until you reach 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:00.100
 heart continues like this until you have your 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.100
 shape 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.050
 when he finishes skirting his figure and 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.940
 cut it down by cutting it with the cutter 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.310
 to be something like this remember that you must 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.069
 get pretty jumpy so when 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.130
 we remove it in the ink and press 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.590
 against paper do not get stained with 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.740
 outline of the heart 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.740
 and ready and the only thing left to do 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.260
 is to soak our our draft in 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.650
 ink and print it where we 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.650
 they want 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.410
 good little that was all for the video 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.750

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.820
