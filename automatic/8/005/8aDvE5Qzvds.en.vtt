Episode 8: Soccer Is Sweet

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.187
Bolle! I just wanted to see what you're up to.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:20.500
Heike! Err... How nice. How are you?

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.900
I just watched "The Four Roses of Balalaika" on TV

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.890
and after the beautiful happy end I just have to hug you.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.000
What's up with her?

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:29.560
Well, then hug me.

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:31.570
Now here we go!

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.154
Are you still watching soccer??

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.755
Oh that. That's just the recap of sunday.

00:00:35.847 --> 00:00:38.655
I see! Oh, who's that?

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:40.880
He's a real cutie!

00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:43.800
That's Messi! I've read something about him.

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.227
Supposedly it's really nasty at his place.

00:00:46.227 --> 00:00:49.271
He just gets new stuff and never throws anything away.

00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:52.662
The whole place is full of crap - when he must be making millions!

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.900
Ernst! Messi is his name! It's just his name! Lionel Messi...

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.510
Exactly!

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:04.500
How sweet! Millions on the bank but no messiness. Sweet!

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.475
You're killing me...

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.309
Hmm... And who's that?

00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:09.002
That bearded gummi bear over there?

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.132
See him?

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.687
That's Maradona. The coach of Argentina.

00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:15.937
He's just a mascot! He has no clue about tactics and theory.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.390
His own free kicks surpass those of his whole team

00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:20.219
and he'd rather join the game himself.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.371
Oh well, whatever.

00:01:23.537 --> 00:01:26.175
I'll get a little money and go shopping

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:30.124
and later at dinner we'll watch those strapping young lads at play!

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.727
Umm... Yeah, great... See you later...Darling.

00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:38.500
Ernst! It's a catastrophe!

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:42.475
Indeed! If she's watching with us, the party's over!

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.435
Dude! She's getting an overview of her account!

00:01:44.473 --> 00:01:47.552
Then she'll see we bought a TV for 2800 Euro!

00:01:47.552 --> 00:01:48.896
With her money!

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:54.510
Oh! Then let's hope her soccer-enthusiasm lasts a bit.

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:03.100
To be continued...
