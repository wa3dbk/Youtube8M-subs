guess<00:02:02.610> maybe<00:02:02.820> by<00:02:03.000> heat<00:02:03.180> touch<00:02:03.540> sensor<00:02:03.840> or

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
guess maybe by heat touch sensor or

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.200 
guess maybe by heat touch sensor or
whatever<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.680> knows<00:02:04.979> where<00:02:05.670> your<00:02:05.820> fingers<00:02:06.119> are

days<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:05.050> wish<00:05:06.050> I<00:05:06.139> hadn't<00:05:06.379> gotten<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:07.599> bluetooth

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
days I wish I hadn't gotten it bluetooth

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.350 
days I wish I hadn't gotten it bluetooth
compared<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:09.620> our<00:05:09.919> f<00:05:10.250> of<00:05:10.280> this<00:05:10.879> one<00:05:11.060> this<00:05:11.180> one's

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
compared to our f of this one this one's

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.950 
compared to our f of this one this one's
RF<00:05:11.690> this<00:05:12.469> one<00:05:12.620> be<00:05:12.740> bluetooth<00:05:13.509> the<00:05:14.509> advantage

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
RF this one be bluetooth the advantage

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.589 
RF this one be bluetooth the advantage
is<00:05:15.110> my<00:05:15.919> Apple<00:05:16.280> has<00:05:16.430> bluetooth<00:05:16.879> and<00:05:17.180> I<00:05:17.419> don't

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
is my Apple has bluetooth and I don't

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.080 
is my Apple has bluetooth and I don't
have<00:05:17.750> to<00:05:17.930> stick<00:05:18.830> another<00:05:18.979> USB<00:05:19.400> thing<00:05:19.759> on<00:05:19.909> there

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
have to stick another USB thing on there

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.089 
have to stick another USB thing on there
just<00:05:20.300> to<00:05:20.419> use<00:05:20.539> the<00:05:20.690> mouse<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:21.560> disadvantage

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
just to use the mouse the disadvantage

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.779 
just to use the mouse the disadvantage
is<00:05:22.250> it<00:05:22.699> takes<00:05:22.940> for<00:05:23.419> ever<00:05:23.689> to<00:05:24.430> pair<00:05:25.430> with<00:05:25.639> the

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
is it takes for ever to pair with the

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:26.860 
is it takes for ever to pair with the
computer<00:05:26.150> when<00:05:26.270> you<00:05:26.330> turn<00:05:26.449> the<00:05:26.479> computer<00:05:26.719> on

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
computer when you turn the computer on

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.959 
computer when you turn the computer on
who<00:05:27.830> knows<00:05:28.009> if<00:05:28.189> it's<00:05:28.310> going<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.490> pair<00:05:28.699> or<00:05:28.849> not

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:28.969 
who knows if it's going to pair or not

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.330 
who knows if it's going to pair or not
within<00:05:29.240> 30<00:05:29.629> or<00:05:29.779> 40<00:05:30.050> seconds<00:05:30.469> if<00:05:30.590> it's<00:05:31.009> all<00:05:31.190> up

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
within 30 or 40 seconds if it's all up

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.790 
within 30 or 40 seconds if it's all up
and<00:05:31.460> I<00:05:31.550> turn<00:05:31.789> it<00:05:31.940> on<00:05:32.029> who<00:05:32.930> knows<00:05:33.139> how<00:05:33.409> long<00:05:33.440> it's

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
and I turn it on who knows how long it's

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.439 
and I turn it on who knows how long it's
going<00:05:33.889> to<00:05:33.949> take<00:05:34.039> to<00:05:34.250> pair<00:05:34.430> sometimes<00:05:34.849> 15

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
going to take to pair sometimes 15

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.790 
going to take to pair sometimes 15
seconds<00:05:35.840> sometimes<00:05:36.020> it<00:05:36.379> takes<00:05:36.529> a<00:05:36.680> couple

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
seconds sometimes it takes a couple

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.409 
seconds sometimes it takes a couple
minutes<00:05:36.949> and<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.669> light<00:05:37.819> on<00:05:37.969> the<00:05:38.060> bottom<00:05:38.300> just

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
minutes and the light on the bottom just

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.149 
minutes and the light on the bottom just
blinking<00:05:38.870> away<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.469> computer<00:05:39.830> know<00:05:40.009> what's

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
blinking away the computer know what's

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:45.040 
blinking away the computer know what's
going<00:05:40.430> on<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:41.029> oh<00:05:41.060> my<00:05:41.180> gosh<00:05:41.500> so<00:05:42.500> bluetooth<00:05:44.050> I'm

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
going on and oh my gosh so bluetooth I'm

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.019 
going on and oh my gosh so bluetooth I'm
not<00:05:45.289> really<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.529> fan<00:05:45.680> of<00:05:45.740> it<00:05:45.919> so<00:05:46.069> far<00:05:46.099> the<00:05:46.879> only

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:47.029 
not really a fan of it so far the only

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.189 
not really a fan of it so far the only
nice<00:05:47.270> part<00:05:47.539> is<00:05:47.599> you<00:05:47.719> don't<00:05:47.779> have<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:48.020> have<00:05:48.110> that

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
nice part is you don't have to have that

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.230 
nice part is you don't have to have that
extra<00:05:48.409> hardware<00:05:49.009> like<00:05:49.430> this<00:05:49.669> mouse<00:05:49.879> have<00:05:50.120> to

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
extra hardware like this mouse have to

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.550 
extra hardware like this mouse have to
have<00:05:50.330> a<00:05:50.360> dock<00:05:50.599> which<00:05:50.870> charges<00:05:51.169> it<00:05:51.349> which<00:05:51.440> is

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
have a dock which charges it which is

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.439 
have a dock which charges it which is
nice<00:05:51.710> but<00:05:51.949> then<00:05:52.129> it's<00:05:52.400> not<00:05:52.550> portable<00:05:53.000> really

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
nice but then it's not portable really

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.659 
nice but then it's not portable really
uh<00:05:55.539> what<00:05:56.539> else<00:05:56.659> can<00:05:56.779> I<00:05:56.839> say<00:05:56.870> about<00:05:57.050> this<00:05:57.349> thing

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
uh what else can I say about this thing

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:59.800 
uh what else can I say about this thing
the<00:05:58.669> more<00:05:58.699> I<00:05:58.879> use<00:05:59.060> it<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.330> more<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.539> kind<00:05:59.750> of

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
the more I use it the more I kind of

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.119 
the more I use it the more I kind of
like<00:05:59.990> the<00:06:00.199> way<00:06:00.289> it<00:06:00.409> feels<00:06:00.440> it's<00:06:00.889> lightweight

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
like the way it feels it's lightweight

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.850 
like the way it feels it's lightweight
it's<00:06:01.639> nice<00:06:01.849> it<00:06:02.060> has<00:06:02.089> an<00:06:02.270> entire<00:06:02.569> ring<00:06:03.050> on<00:06:03.409> the

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
it's nice it has an entire ring on the

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.129 
it's nice it has an entire ring on the
bottom<00:06:04.159> that<00:06:04.550> makes<00:06:04.940> contact<00:06:05.449> when<00:06:05.839> it<00:06:05.930> slides

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
bottom that makes contact when it slides

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.610 
bottom that makes contact when it slides
so<00:06:06.500> it's<00:06:06.620> kind<00:06:06.800> of<00:06:06.830> nice<00:06:07.069> and<00:06:08.020> it<00:06:09.020> makes<00:06:09.529> it

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
so it's kind of nice and it makes it

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.079 
so it's kind of nice and it makes it
feel<00:06:09.770> more<00:06:09.800> like<00:06:10.009> a<00:06:10.159> heavier<00:06:10.490> mouse<00:06:10.669> even

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:11.089 
feel more like a heavier mouse even

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:12.610 
feel more like a heavier mouse even
though<00:06:11.150> it's<00:06:11.270> lighter<00:06:11.449> and<00:06:11.659> this<00:06:12.139> mass<00:06:12.349> here<00:06:12.589> I

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
though it's lighter and this mass here I

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.589 
though it's lighter and this mass here I
of<00:06:12.770> course<00:06:12.889> put<00:06:13.159> the<00:06:13.310> I<00:06:13.849> don't<00:06:14.330> know<00:06:14.389> what<00:06:14.509> are

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
of course put the I don't know what are

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:16.149 
of course put the I don't know what are
they<00:06:14.659> tough<00:06:14.930> lon<00:06:15.110> pads<00:06:15.409> on<00:06:15.710> him<00:06:15.740> to<00:06:15.949> make<00:06:15.979> it

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159 
they tough lon pads on him to make it

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:17.589 
they tough lon pads on him to make it
slide<00:06:16.370> better<00:06:16.610> but<00:06:16.759> I<00:06:16.819> was<00:06:16.940> also<00:06:17.029> like<00:06:17.270> a<00:06:17.330> year

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
slide better but I was also like a year

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:18.879 
slide better but I was also like a year

because<00:06:28.849> you<00:06:29.089> know<00:06:29.180> Apple<00:06:29.479> is<00:06:29.509> all<00:06:29.629> about<00:06:29.870> that

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
because you know Apple is all about that

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.120 
because you know Apple is all about that
 making<00:06:30.830> something<00:06:31.009> you<00:06:31.789> know

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
 making something you know

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.639 
 making something you know
better<00:06:34.539> looking<00:06:35.539> and<00:06:35.750> no<00:06:36.169> charge<00:06:36.469> them<00:06:36.620> more

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:36.649 
better looking and no charge them more

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:37.930 
better looking and no charge them more
even<00:06:36.979> though<00:06:37.039> it's<00:06:37.130> the<00:06:37.190> same<00:06:37.370> freaking<00:06:37.759> thing

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
even though it's the same freaking thing

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.220 
even though it's the same freaking thing
