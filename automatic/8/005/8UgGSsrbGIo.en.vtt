00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
still think that this is something that

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760 
still think that this is something that
you<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:50.219> likely<00:00:51.000> throw<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.510> an<00:00:51.600> EDC<00:00:51.870> bag<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
you would likely throw in an EDC bag I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.439 
you would likely throw in an EDC bag I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
mean you may carry advice hand or

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.229 
mean you may carry advice hand or

seems<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.129> reasonable<00:02:17.340> quality<00:02:17.790> this

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
seems to be a reasonable quality this

if that matters or not and there it is

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.580

in there big and shiny this the
stitching<00:02:28.980> all<00:02:29.340> seems<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.760> be<00:02:29.849> pretty<00:02:30.060> good

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239
