kuber's and what they do is they all
come<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.180> high<00:00:24.390> school<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.410> compete

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
come to this high school and we compete

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.170 
come to this high school and we compete
against<00:00:25.949> each<00:00:26.039> other<00:00:26.220> now

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
against each other now

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.109 
against each other now
each<00:00:27.420> competitor<00:00:27.750> has<00:00:28.279> three<00:00:29.279> souls<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.849> they

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
each competitor has three souls and they

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.749 
each competitor has three souls and they
take<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> average<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.869> those<00:00:30.990> three<00:00:31.050> souls

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
take the average of those three souls

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.100 
take the average of those three souls
last<00:00:32.759> year<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.450> travel<00:00:33.780> each<00:00:33.840> other's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
last year they just travel each other's

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.950 
last year they just travel each other's
queues<00:00:34.410> which<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> little<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.780> don't<00:00:36.780> know

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
queues which is a little I don't know

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.880 
queues which is a little I don't know
unfair<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.149> had<00:00:39.899> scrambles<00:00:40.410> printed<00:00:40.739> based

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
unfair but I had scrambles printed based

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.920 
unfair but I had scrambles printed based
in<00:00:41.070> choose<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.460> use<00:00:41.579> them<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.660> hope

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
in choose to use them and I hope

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
in choose to use them and I hope
hopefully<00:00:43.620> using<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.950> year<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> having<00:00:45.950> used

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
hopefully using this year so having used

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.709 
hopefully using this year so having used
them<00:00:47.100> yet<00:00:47.309> obviously<00:00:47.940> come<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> waste<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.600> paper

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
them yet obviously come a waste of paper

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.270 
them yet obviously come a waste of paper
but<00:00:49.649> yeah<00:00:50.000> last<00:00:51.000> year<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.780> won<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.469> event<00:00:52.890> with

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
but yeah last year I won the event with

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.479 
but yeah last year I won the event with
I<00:00:53.760> had<00:00:54.750> two<00:00:54.930> souls<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> 12<00:00:56.129> something

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
I had two souls one was a 12 something

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.549 
I had two souls one was a 12 something
and<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:56.940> was<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> 13th<00:00:57.510> I'll<00:00:57.989> try<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> have

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and there was a 13th I'll try to have

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.930 
and there was a 13th I'll try to have
the<00:00:58.620> link<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> video<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> description

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the link to the video in the description

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.260 
the link to the video in the description
below<00:01:00.469> but<00:01:01.469> yeah<00:01:02.039> there's<00:01:02.910> another<00:01:03.059> event

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
below but yeah there's another event

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.119 
below but yeah there's another event
it's<00:01:03.690> called<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.170> cube<00:01:04.500> tower<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> mean<00:01:05.100> I

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it's called a cube tower so I mean I

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.969 
it's called a cube tower so I mean I
believe<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.640> 16<00:01:06.180> cubes<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
believe it's 16 cubes that you have a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.609 
believe it's 16 cubes that you have a
group<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.280> four<00:01:08.520> people<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.260> need<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.470> go

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
group of four people and you need to go

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.160 
group of four people and you need to go
together<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.220> solve<00:01:12.090> all<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> cubes<00:01:12.990> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
together and solve all the cubes and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.249 
together and solve all the cubes and
fast<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.460> obviously<00:01:15.020> last<00:01:16.020> year<00:01:16.170> we

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
fast you can obviously last year we

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.690 
fast you can obviously last year we
dominated<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.799> event<00:01:17.130> by<00:01:17.280> about<00:01:17.460> two

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
dominated this event by about two

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.420 
dominated this event by about two
minutes<00:01:18.110> because<00:01:19.110> my<00:01:19.530> school<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> where<00:01:20.220> all

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
minutes because my school is where all

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.080 
minutes because my school is where all
the<00:01:20.700> fast<00:01:21.210> kuber's<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.110> guess<00:01:22.909> but<00:01:23.909> now

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the fast kuber's are I guess but now

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.270 
the fast kuber's are I guess but now
this<00:01:24.299> year<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.780> change<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> rules<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> four

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this year I change the rules to four

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.910 
this year I change the rules to four
people<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.700> each<00:01:26.880> team<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:28.290> for<00:01:28.710> every

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
people on each team and for every

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.340 
people on each team and for every
professional<00:01:29.460> level<00:01:29.759> solver<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.930> 30

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
professional level solver which is 30

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.050 
professional level solver which is 30
seconds<00:01:31.770> or<00:01:31.860> under<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.490> solve<00:01:32.729> three

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
seconds or under you have to solve three

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.240 
seconds or under you have to solve three
additional<00:01:33.659> cubes<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.229> top<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.650> top<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.130> what

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
additional cubes on top on top of what

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
additional cubes on top on top of what
they<00:01:35.340> already<00:01:35.369> give<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.479> will<00:01:36.689> give

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
they already give you so that will give

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.950 
they already give you so that will give
it<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.930> lot<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.110> schools<00:01:37.350> more<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.250> an<00:01:38.490> advantage

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
it a lot of schools more of an advantage

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
it a lot of schools more of an advantage
but<00:01:39.960> hopefully<00:01:40.650> we'll<00:01:40.799> still<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:41.040> able<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.220> win

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
but hopefully we'll still be able to win

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.230 
but hopefully we'll still be able to win
so<00:01:42.090> that'd<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.390> cool<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.350> yeah<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> was<00:01:45.210> just

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
so that'd be cool but yeah so I was just

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.120 
so that'd be cool but yeah so I was just
thinking<00:01:45.630> music<00:01:46.170> my<00:01:46.259> hands<00:01:46.590> memory<00:01:46.890> cube

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
thinking music my hands memory cube

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.950 
thinking music my hands memory cube
right<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:48.119> pretty<00:01:48.299> good<00:01:48.509> I'm<00:01:48.689> having

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
right now it's pretty good I'm having

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.310 
right now it's pretty good I'm having
some<00:01:49.110> issues<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.439> core<00:01:51.140> loosening<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.229> had

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
some issues with core loosening so had

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.200 
some issues with core loosening so had
to<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.619> tighten<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.009> up<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.909> yeah<00:01:54.030> it's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
to really tighten it up but yeah it's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
what it is but I have a little obsession

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.450 
what it is but I have a little obsession
with<00:02:18.090> them<00:02:18.270> just<00:02:18.480> these<00:02:18.690> standard<00:02:19.110> PVCs<00:02:19.740> that

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
with them just these standard PVCs that

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.250 
with them just these standard PVCs that
peel<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.210> this<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.750> aren't<00:02:21.900> even<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.200> good

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
peel like this and aren't even that good

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.340 
peel like this and aren't even that good
quality<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.610> um<00:02:24.080> yeah<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:27.090> what<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.020> wanted<00:02:28.230> to

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
quality but um yeah so what I wanted to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.680 
quality but um yeah so what I wanted to
do<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:28.800> feel<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.130> cube<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.459> see<00:02:29.640> how<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:30.240> is
