00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
not only does the air density decrease

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.930 
not only does the air density decrease
but<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.870> air<00:00:40.050> temperature<00:00:40.620> also<00:00:40.940> decreases

but the air temperature also decreases
with<00:00:42.180> altitude<00:00:42.620> this<00:00:43.620> explains<00:00:44.070> why<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.309> get

generally<00:00:51.930> speaking<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.379> air<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.770> more<00:00:53.010> dense

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
generally speaking the air is more dense

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.850 
generally speaking the air is more dense
closer<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> Earth's<00:00:54.420> surface<00:00:54.860> therefore

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
closer to the Earth's surface therefore

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.790 
closer to the Earth's surface therefore
a<00:00:56.039> higher<00:00:56.489> air<00:00:56.789> pressure<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.530> climb

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
a higher air pressure and as you climb

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.189

higher away from the Earth's surface the
air<00:01:01.379> density<00:01:01.649> decreases<00:01:02.510> therefore<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.930> air

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
air density decreases therefore the air

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.219 
air density decreases therefore the air

stratosphere as you now know maintains a

constant temperature with any gaining

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.980 
constant temperature with any gaining
altitude<00:02:11.820> however<00:02:12.820> this<00:02:13.360> does<00:02:13.570> not<00:02:13.600> remain

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990

it<00:02:18.280> eventually<00:02:18.730> reaches<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> point<00:02:19.480> where<00:02:20.020> any

it eventually reaches a point where any

it eventually reaches a point where any
gaining<00:02:20.680> altitude<00:02:20.830> actually<00:02:21.660> increases<00:02:22.660> the

gaining altitude actually increases the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.500 
gaining altitude actually increases the
air<00:02:22.990> temperature<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.940> lower<00:02:25.120> part<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.450> the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510

stratosphere<00:02:25.840> starts<00:02:26.350> off<00:02:26.500> maintaining<00:02:27.490> the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
stratosphere starts off maintaining the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.220

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
same air temperature with any gained in

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.560 
same air temperature with any gained in
altitude<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:30.010> eventually<00:02:30.520> gets<00:02:31.030> warm<00:02:31.390> or

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
altitude and eventually gets warm or

with any gain in altitude that's almost

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.430 
with any gain in altitude that's almost
