conference<00:01:39.740> being<00:01:39.980> as<00:01:40.130> tight<00:01:40.340> as<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.790> you

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
conference being as tight as it is you

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.520

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
know we could come from a from a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.230 
know we could come from a from a
fifth-place<00:01:42.920> position<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:43.670> put<00:01:43.790> ourselves<00:01:43.910> in
