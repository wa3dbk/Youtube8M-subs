this gonna be the first thought to the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.960 
this gonna be the first thought to the
step

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.690

this<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.090> our<00:03:46.269> new<00:03:46.420> Micromax<00:03:46.900> Tamia<00:03:47.349> may

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
this is our new Micromax Tamia may

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.890 
this is our new Micromax Tamia may
unlock<00:03:48.610> it<00:03:48.959> so<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.379> has<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.590> slim<00:03:51.250> suits<00:03:51.900> look

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.929 
unlock it so it has to slim suits look
at<00:03:53.110> sim<00:03:53.920> one<00:03:54.159> and<00:03:54.370> simple

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
at sim one and simple

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.350 
at sim one and simple
I<00:03:54.970> went<00:03:55.750> inserted<00:03:56.590> any<00:03:56.739> single<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.909> is<00:03:58.120> that

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
I went inserted any single so it is that

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.559 
I went inserted any single so it is that
we<00:03:58.599> have<00:03:58.689> no<00:03:58.840> sin<00:03:59.079> coordinate<00:03:59.500> yeah<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:03.569> look

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
we have no sin coordinate yeah and look

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.099 
we have no sin coordinate yeah and look
to<00:04:04.780> it

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
to it

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:13.080 
to it
I<00:04:06.810> get<00:04:07.810> cat<00:04:08.170> also<00:04:08.709> Phandroid<00:04:09.780> okay<00:04:11.879> let's<00:04:12.879> see

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
I get cat also Phandroid okay let's see

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.599 
I get cat also Phandroid okay let's see
where<00:04:13.540> can<00:04:13.900> be<00:04:14.049> in<00:04:14.170> tradition<00:04:14.769> or<00:04:14.950> thus

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
where can be in tradition or thus

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.550 
where can be in tradition or thus
where's<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.269> SIM<00:04:16.479> slot<00:04:16.720> available<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.410> this

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
where's the SIM slot available in this

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.620 
where's the SIM slot available in this
step<00:04:18.720> there<00:04:19.720> are<00:04:19.840> three<00:04:20.139> port<00:04:20.560> in<00:04:20.859> this<00:04:21.630> so

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
step there are three port in this so

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.650 
step there are three port in this so
here<00:04:23.260> this<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.650> for<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:24.039> micro<00:04:24.460> sim<00:04:24.610> this<00:04:25.510> is

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
here this is for the micro sim this is

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.140 
here this is for the micro sim this is
for<00:04:25.870> normal<00:04:26.350> sim<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.770> this<00:04:27.250> is<00:04:27.400> for<00:04:27.610> memory

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
for normal sim and this is for memory

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.879 
for normal sim and this is for memory
