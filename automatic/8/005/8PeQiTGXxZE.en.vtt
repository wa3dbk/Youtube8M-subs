00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.670
 here the museum for communication in den 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.620
 haag you see how fast the technical 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.420
 developments will deliver the mail 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.930
 for example, it used to be a pagan job 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.699
 despite this sorting machine from 1930 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.070
 we now send emails and seconds 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.289
 worried the postmen are not quite 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.599
 unemployed because they now deliver packages of 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.480
 web stores in those packages are full 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.189
 but how long more 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.380
 people download and book from the internet 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.300
 and put it on an e-reader e-books 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.030
 have multiple benefits 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.800
 they are cheaper sometimes as the free 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.899
 fit hundreds of e-books in the unicycle 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.070
 so that is easy to travel it for 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.109
 some people might get used to it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.820
 but the reading comfort of a unicycle 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.820
 is similar to a paper book 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.530
 at the moment you have around 100 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 euro or more a good belt earlier 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.910
 has a number of useful features 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.339
 I give some buying tips buy one 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.140
 e-reader with a real i-i screen that 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.300
 Inc. is a technique that only a black 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.000
 white image delivers but is quiet for that 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.520
 You can also see the eyes in full sunlight 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 good text reading another benefit 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.990
 the inc technique is that it is very economical 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.700
 is with a full battery you can often 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.290
 months ahead 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.799
 A disadvantage is that it leaves through the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.810
 pages goes a little slow e-books 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.880
 You can also read on a tablet computer 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.159
 only a tablet computer is less 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.719
 readable and full of daylight 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.280
 the screen is slightly less quiet for the 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.229
 eyes 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.420
 Many e-readers have screen size of 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.469
 6 inch most people can handle you well 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.670
 get along with it 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.829
 also because you can change the font 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.820
 There are also readers that are 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.700
 slightly larger 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.289
 7 or 8 energy then you can pay attention type 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.579
 slightly larger 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.380
 maybe useful for people with bad 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.329
 sight 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.710
 you can also agree with the kindle 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.880
 order an e-reader 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.159
 then you buy an excellent e-reader 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.320
 only the pass only the english speaking 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.149
 books from the other way around 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.399
 if you like wood books wood is 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.469
 highly recommended but realize that you are not the one 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:16.110
 books of European publishers can on 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:17.700
 deploy an important buying tip 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.590
 wheels with a touch screen 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.120
 that works easier than alone 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.040
 buttons around the screen 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.019
 for example, setting all sorts 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.660
 options or browsing the pages 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.010
 background is also an important trend 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.870
 lighting with e-readers 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.750
 that is handy because you can read in 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.909
 dark rooms the bedside lamp can be switched off and on 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.340
 you can read through also buy one 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.870
 protective case for your e-reader 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.970
 quadricycles go easy piece and 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.470
 repair is very expensive maybe just 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.879
 as expensive as buying a new one in 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.069
 mother 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.750
 they regularly test leader's 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.300
 vary a lot in quality and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.890
 possibilities show that our testing 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.810
 Do you want to know which ones are the best in the test 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.370
 please check the website of the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.379
 Consumers Association 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.390
 you read in the e-readers file 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.379
 also how you got those books and how you got them 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.379
 transfer them to the e-reader
