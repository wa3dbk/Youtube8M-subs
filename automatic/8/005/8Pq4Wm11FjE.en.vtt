00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.680 
and I will be bending some some pipe
that<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.530> plenty<00:02:16.800> off<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.489> welding<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.569> in

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
that have plenty off and welding it in

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.740 
that have plenty off and welding it in
there<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.890> I'll<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.130> putting<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.459> gs1<00:02:21.360> Suzuki

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
there and I'll be putting a gs1 Suzuki

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
GS 1000 tail piece on there and I think

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.150 
GS 1000 tail piece on there and I think
that<00:02:24.180> will<00:02:24.270> compliment<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.989> front<00:02:25.950> end<00:02:26.069> just

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
that will compliment the front end just

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.559 
that will compliment the front end just
right<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.930> want<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.989> keep<00:02:28.080> this<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:29.209> kind<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.330> a

but<00:02:35.190> with<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.970> benefit<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.980> modern<00:02:37.980> front

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310
