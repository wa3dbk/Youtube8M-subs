September and I think group a is 16 to
18<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:55.850> Group<00:01:56.420> B<00:01:56.450> nineteen<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.829> twenty<00:01:57.860> twenty

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
18 and Group B nineteen to twenty twenty

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.420 
18 and Group B nineteen to twenty twenty
first<00:01:58.909> okay<00:01:59.329> and<00:01:59.539> the<00:02:00.140> 19th<00:02:00.500> in<00:02:00.680> North<00:02:00.950> America

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
first okay and the 19th in North America

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.459 
first okay and the 19th in North America
is<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:02.090> 20th<00:02:02.509> year<00:02:02.659> if<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:02.960> play<00:02:03.079> on<00:02:03.170> evening

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.319 
is the 20th year if you play on evening
okay<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.399> basically<00:02:04.520> means<00:02:04.759> I<00:02:05.000> can<00:02:05.180> play

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.750 
okay so that basically means I can play
as<00:02:05.780> that's<00:02:06.560> what<00:02:06.770> we<00:02:06.920> assume<00:02:07.189> that<00:02:07.219> is

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
as that's what we assume that is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.190 
as that's what we assume that is
okay<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.270> if<00:02:08.390> you're<00:02:08.510> a<00:02:08.540> groupie<00:02:08.660> I<00:02:08.869> think<00:02:09.140> I

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
okay so if you're a groupie I think I

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.410 
okay so if you're a groupie I think I
can<00:02:09.380> play<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.280> know<00:02:10.850> you<00:02:10.940> said<00:02:11.180> that's<00:02:11.330> what
