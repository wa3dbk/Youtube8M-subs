its<00:00:39.740> stuff<00:00:39.980> sack<00:00:40.280> is<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.360> real<00:00:41.570> high

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
its stuff sack is the real high

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.000 
its stuff sack is the real high
tolerances<00:00:42.410> they<00:00:42.590> have<00:00:42.800> on<00:00:42.920> the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
tolerances they have on the

manufacturing everything on this cook

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.100 
manufacturing everything on this cook
set<00:00:44.960> is<00:00:45.080> really<00:00:45.500> tight<00:00:45.910> most<00:00:46.910> cook<00:00:47.150> sets<00:00:47.420> if

set is really tight most cook sets if

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.960 
set is really tight most cook sets if
you<00:00:48.230> did<00:00:48.380> something<00:00:48.650> like<00:00:48.770> this<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:49.340> it<00:00:49.460> you'd

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
you did something like this to it you'd

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.730 
you did something like this to it you'd
have<00:00:50.000> your<00:00:50.270> lid<00:00:50.480> flopping<00:00:51.260> all<00:00:51.350> over<00:00:51.380> the

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
have your lid flopping all over the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.910 
have your lid flopping all over the
place<00:00:52.330> this<00:00:53.330> cook<00:00:53.600> set<00:00:53.810> now<00:00:54.110> I<00:00:54.140> can<00:00:54.410> do<00:00:54.530> this<00:00:54.710> I

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
place this cook set now I can do this I

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.740 
place this cook set now I can do this I
can<00:00:55.100> pull<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.550> lid<00:00:55.700> out<00:00:55.820> but<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.180> just<00:00:56.210> takes<00:00:56.570> a

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
can pull the lid out but it just takes a

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.780 
can pull the lid out but it just takes a
really<00:00:56.930> hard<00:00:57.200> shake<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.650> do<00:00:57.800> that<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.700> the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
really hard shake to do that so the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.610 
really hard shake to do that so the
tolerances<00:00:59.240> on<00:00:59.420> this<00:00:59.600> are<00:00:59.780> very<00:01:00.080> tight<00:01:00.350> very

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
tolerances on this are very tight very

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.250 
tolerances on this are very tight very

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
silicone rubber insulation on them like

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.670 
silicone rubber insulation on them like
a<00:01:10.790> lot<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.120> other<00:01:11.270> ones<00:01:11.480> and<00:01:11.990> like<00:01:12.290> other<00:01:12.530> ones

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
a lot of other ones and like other ones

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.630 
a lot of other ones and like other ones
a<00:01:12.860> lot<00:01:13.010> of<00:01:13.070> other<00:01:13.280> ones<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.610> works<00:01:13.850> just<00:01:14.450> fine

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
a lot of other ones it works just fine

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.860 
a lot of other ones it works just fine
the<00:01:16.640> pot<00:01:16.880> itself<00:01:18.790> it's<00:01:19.790> got<00:01:20.000> gradient

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
the pot itself it's got gradient

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.140 
the pot itself it's got gradient
markings<00:01:21.290> at<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.710> 300<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.280> 600<00:01:22.550> milliliter

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
markings at the 300 and 600 milliliter

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.960 
markings at the 300 and 600 milliliter
marks<00:01:23.540> but<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.620> pot<00:01:24.830> can<00:01:25.040> handle<00:01:25.340> about<00:01:25.490> 30

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
marks but the pot can handle about 30

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.240 
marks but the pot can handle about 30
ounces<00:01:26.390> or<00:01:26.570> 31<00:01:26.930> ounces<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:27.530> it's<00:01:27.740> just<00:01:28.010> shy<00:01:28.220> of

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
ounces or 31 ounces so it's just shy of

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.130 
ounces or 31 ounces so it's just shy of
4<00:01:28.760> cups<00:01:29.740> your<00:01:30.740> pan<00:01:31.010> can<00:01:31.700> handle<00:01:31.970> 16<00:01:32.450> ounces<00:01:32.840> so

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
4 cups your pan can handle 16 ounces so

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.219 
4 cups your pan can handle 16 ounces so
about<00:01:33.560> 2<00:01:33.800> cups<00:01:34.210> but<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.330> really<00:01:35.720> neat<00:01:35.900> thing

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
about 2 cups but the really neat thing

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.800

made with buckyballs and an inverted
left-handed<00:01:48.390> twist<00:01:50.210> okay<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> made<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.630> last

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
left-handed twist okay I made that last

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.960 
left-handed twist okay I made that last
part<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.650> just<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.040> ceramic<00:01:53.490> silicon

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
part up it's just a ceramic silicon

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.730 
part up it's just a ceramic silicon
coating<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.500> powder

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
coating it's the think it's a powder

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.469 
coating it's the think it's a powder
they<00:01:55.920> spray<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:56.760> bake<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.180> into<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
they spray on and they bake it into the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.109 
they spray on and they bake it into the
kit<00:01:57.720> but<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.830> is<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.460> lot<00:01:59.700> tougher<00:01:59.940> than

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
kit but this is a lot tougher than

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.050 
kit but this is a lot tougher than
Teflon<00:02:01.520> but<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:02.820> bulletproof<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.880> kit

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
Teflon but it's not bulletproof the kit

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.350 
Teflon but it's not bulletproof the kit
itself<00:02:07.550> works<00:02:08.550> really<00:02:08.820> well<00:02:09.060> I'm<00:02:09.330> very

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
gap is how you uh you pour out and you

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.550 
gap is how you uh you pour out and you
uh<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:57.000> drain<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.329> water<00:02:57.450> off<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.750> any<00:02:58.049> pasta

for a bit so and my coating looks almost

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.460

would be a whisper light
a<00:04:41.010> whisper<00:04:41.580> lights<00:04:41.910> only<00:04:42.150> have<00:04:42.510> two<00:04:43.289> settings

away the last thing to remember on this

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.440 
away the last thing to remember on this
is<00:04:57.600> abrasives<00:04:58.590> don't<00:04:59.310> use<00:04:59.580> abrasives<00:05:00.210> on<00:05:00.330> the

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
is abrasives don't use abrasives on the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.320 
is abrasives don't use abrasives on the
nonstick<00:05:00.900> coatings<00:05:01.820> so<00:05:02.820> like<00:05:03.000> one<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.270> the

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
nonstick coatings so like one of the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.339 
nonstick coatings so like one of the
little<00:05:03.539> scratchy<00:05:03.840> pads<00:05:04.229> on<00:05:04.560> on<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:04.889> on<00:05:05.669> a<00:05:06.349> sponge
