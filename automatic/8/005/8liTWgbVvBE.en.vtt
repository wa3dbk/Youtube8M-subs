mounted to a pole here this is a one-way
check<00:02:29.830> valve<00:02:30.099> while<00:02:30.580> we<00:02:30.760> had<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.030> out<00:02:31.180> rejected

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
check valve while we had it out rejected

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.110 
check valve while we had it out rejected
to<00:02:31.780> make<00:02:31.959> sure<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.230> was<00:02:32.379> working<00:02:33.060> trying<00:02:34.060> to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
to make sure it was working trying to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.289 
to make sure it was working trying to
push<00:02:34.269> water<00:02:34.890> backwards<00:02:35.890> through<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.000> while<00:02:37.150> it

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
push water backwards through it while it

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.390 
push water backwards through it while it
was<00:02:37.330> off<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.680> wouldn't<00:02:38.860> let<00:02:38.980> water<00:02:39.190> go

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
was off and it wouldn't let water go

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.670 
was off and it wouldn't let water go
this<00:02:39.579> way<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.239> does<00:02:40.390> let<00:02:40.569> water<00:02:40.750> go<00:02:40.989> this

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
this way but it does let water go this

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.479 
this way but it does let water go this
way<00:02:41.950> from<00:02:42.640> pump<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.650> dream<00:02:44.860> field<00:02:45.130> which

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
way from pump to the dream field which

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:46.920 
way from pump to the dream field which
is<00:02:45.640> what<00:02:45.790> it's<00:02:45.910> designed<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.420> do<00:02:46.599> so<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.810> want

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
is what it's designed to do so you want

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.120 
is what it's designed to do so you want
to<00:02:47.049> check<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.230> while<00:02:47.590> it's<00:02:47.799> out<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:50.470> made<00:02:50.860> sure

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
to check that while it's out I made sure

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.350 
to check that while it's out I made sure
I<00:02:51.400> took<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.120> strapped<00:02:52.390> this<00:02:52.709> real<00:02:53.709> good<00:02:54.360> to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
I took and strapped this real good to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.289 
I took and strapped this real good to
the<00:02:55.450> pole<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:57.459> way<00:02:57.610> my<00:02:57.790> cords<00:02:58.180> don't

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
the pole that way my cords don't

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.900 
the pole that way my cords don't
interfere<00:02:58.599> with<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:58.989> fluke<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.560> what<00:03:00.430> goes<00:03:00.670> up

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
interfere with my fluke and what goes up

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.420 
interfere with my fluke and what goes up
but<00:03:01.510> pump<00:03:01.989> comes<00:03:02.260> on<00:03:02.440> flip<00:03:02.769> goes<00:03:02.950> down<00:03:03.160> pump

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
but pump comes on flip goes down pump

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.449 
but pump comes on flip goes down pump
goes<00:03:03.610> off<00:03:03.790> as<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.299> can<00:03:04.420> hear<00:03:05.069> hum<00:03:06.069> comes<00:03:06.310> on

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
goes off as you can hear hum comes on

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.180 
goes off as you can hear hum comes on
home<00:03:06.819> goes<00:03:07.030> off<00:03:07.620> okay<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.859> want<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.069> make

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
home goes off okay so you want to make

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.620 
home goes off okay so you want to make
sure<00:03:09.340> your<00:03:09.489> cords<00:03:09.760> are<00:03:09.880> real<00:03:10.000> good<00:03:10.329> and<00:03:10.450> clear

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
sure your cords are real good and clear

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.710 
sure your cords are real good and clear
that<00:03:10.840> before<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.170> put<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.410> back<00:03:11.500> together

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
that before you put it back together

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.970 
that before you put it back together
matter<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.840> fact<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.079> already<00:03:14.380> had<00:03:14.560> installed

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
matter of fact I already had installed

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.860 
matter of fact I already had installed
it<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.310> decided<00:03:15.639> to<00:03:15.700> pull<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:15.970> back<00:03:16.150> out<00:03:16.420> just

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
it and decided to pull it back out just

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.050 
it and decided to pull it back out just
I<00:03:16.989> could<00:03:17.579> do<00:03:18.579> that<00:03:20.609> and<00:03:21.609> we're<00:03:21.700> going<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.940> drop

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
I could do that and we're going to drop

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.190 
I could do that and we're going to drop
it<00:03:22.209> back<00:03:22.359> in<00:03:22.510> we're<00:03:22.660> going<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.840> connect<00:03:23.079> it

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
it back in we're going to connect it

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.009 
it back in we're going to connect it
back<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.440> our<00:03:23.560> union<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.780> I'll<00:03:25.780> put<00:03:25.989> some

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
back to our union and I'll put some
