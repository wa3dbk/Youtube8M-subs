00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.130

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.420

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 a schedule there with the director of 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.010

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 I ended up with a note from the morning and maybe 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.250
 plate that some areas where it is good but 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.170
 I always recommend the breakfast of the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.870
 lunch dinner with one thing much more 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.000
 easy to stay and super exciting hyper 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.720

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.800

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:09.240

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:25.210
