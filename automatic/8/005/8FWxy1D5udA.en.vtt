00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.790
 greeting yourself viewers of my channel 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.830
 today I will show you how to make a cover 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.260
 for the cookbook and a little bit 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.830
 I will tell the preface in general for what everything 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.960
 it is not necessary and you may need 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.740
 The fact is that until today, 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 me all the recipes are written mostly on 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.949
 individual torn pieces of paper which 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.720
 lying around me in all the rooms and even 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.449
 if they manage to gather in one place 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 they still fly away 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.110
 it turned out not judge strictly 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.149
 and with the memory of me is not very, and even if I 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.110
 I make the dish 20 times I still need 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.350
 Sling with the recipe and naturally such 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.539
 the state of my recipes 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.449
 uncomfortable for me ugly at all 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.019
 wrong for the hostess and so I 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.000
 decided to create a common cookbook 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.460
 somewhere disposable recipes but only 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.070
 our favorite family recipes and 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.180
 I cook pretty dishes 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:10.570
 yet I often think later this 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.570
 Book convey his daughter and that was 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.299
 interesting and she did not throw me a book 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.550
 make out in different techniques 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.460
 there will be both scrapbooking and embroidery and 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.590
 decoration sticker drawings even 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.800
 photos of your own meals and family 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.960
 feast 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.319
 Naturally I will write down secrets here 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.420
 which every hostess has now 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.789
 I will tell you more about the materials that we 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.740
 first of all it will be needed of course 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.319
 same cookbook itself 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.200
 I bought a regular notebook and hard 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.810
 bound with a spiral the only thing 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.409
 here I changed this leaflets which 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.490
 were very thin translucent I them 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:02:00.530
 pasted over with self-adhesive paper with one 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:05.180
 hand another will recipe like here 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.859
 for example here is a looking recipe here 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.450
 paper 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:11.420
 you can even use self-adhesive 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:17.570
 the cardboard will be even denser but this 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.609
 enough further means the fabric itself here 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.590
 she gives me such red white polka dots 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:28.260
 there is not specifically bought from me 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:31.620
 were old stocks such rags I 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:36.050
 she has already cut off to size left 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.819
 on both sides of the fabric to keep of 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:43.370
 you can bend 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.370
 its more like someone 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.459
 further it will be necessary itself of course 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.769
 embroidery 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.660
 especially for this project I went out 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:56.819
 a cheerful cook as I thought that 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.500
 get me out in a week but if 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.560
 honestly sat for a month and a half 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.060
 embroidered not even know why it is so in debt 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.329
 my whole body turned out to be necessary 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.110
 there will be decorations what it can be 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:17.160
 braid like my buttons still something 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:22.129
 all you want to decorate and still need 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:26.720
 will still need to be such a thing 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:29.819
 here it is called me 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.579
 polyethylene is found in shoe 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.540
 boxes or wrap it in household 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.380
 technique in the main monitor or 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.459
 tv 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:45.000
 but somewhere I have heat tape for windows 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.830
 I found a hardware store she 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.920
 certainly not like that 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.690
 plump like foam which 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.050
 wraps monitors 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.660
 but already comes with such a crisis and left 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:04.720
 party that will be very convenient for me 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:08.080
 no need to get my hands dirty 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:13.160
 Let's start with what we will 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:16.280
 sew the tape on four sides 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.030
 our embroidery I will do it manually 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.220
 Is it possible to do this on a garment 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.330
 it would be easier for a typewriter but unfortunately 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.150
 I don't have her here 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.960
 sew the whole body by hand and using 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.280
 by chance 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.700
 since it happened so you know that my husband is my husband 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:42.350
 watching all my videos give you this 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:47.000
 such a subtle hint buy cheap 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.630
 please have a sewing machine there 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.630
 without her 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.030
 the very process of shiva I show you 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.180
 I will not because it is all traditional 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.040
 just nothing original and new me 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.760
 to all of you showed 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:09.570
 and so notebook I pasted heat tape 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.480
 in two layers so that it is softer itself 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.930
 metal cover from petty seam 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.420
 so that the edges do not spread away from me we 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:24.780
 sewed on the front side of the cover itself 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:27.120
 picture embroidery now let's dress 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.360
 notebook cover see that what 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.220
 It turned out how all these looks I think 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.820
 that this project will be with me 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.240
 protracted for more than a decade 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:42.810
 I'll arrange everything gradually 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.610
 with taste and mood of course well 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.380
 and I hope that this is a notebook in general 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:51.330
 will become for us 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:54.740
 some interesting album and even 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:58.830
 family religions 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:02.310
 the main thing is not to throw anything 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:06.600
 everyone is very good 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:09.920
 Looks like I like everybody thanks for 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.920
 attention and bye
