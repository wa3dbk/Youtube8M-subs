00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.180 

there's<00:00:13.780> kind<00:00:13.960> of<00:00:14.080> two<00:00:14.139> theories<00:00:14.769> about

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
there's kind of two theories about

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.730 
there's kind of two theories about
trimming<00:00:15.490> brisket<00:00:16.000> one<00:00:16.299> is<00:00:16.660> not<00:00:17.200> to<00:00:17.410> trim<00:00:17.619> it

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
trimming brisket one is not to trim it

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.830 
trimming brisket one is not to trim it
and<00:00:17.860> leave<00:00:18.070> all<00:00:18.250> that<00:00:18.430> fat<00:00:18.700> on<00:00:18.730> because<00:00:19.689> it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
and leave all that fat on because it

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.200 
and leave all that fat on because it
renders<00:00:20.260> down<00:00:20.500> and<00:00:20.890> creates<00:00:21.400> more<00:00:21.550> flavor

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
renders down and creates more flavor

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.170 
renders down and creates more flavor
well<00:00:22.630> we<00:00:23.349> beg<00:00:23.560> to<00:00:23.710> differ<00:00:23.920> here<00:00:24.310> because<00:00:24.730> when

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
well we beg to differ here because when

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.720 
well we beg to differ here because when
you<00:00:25.300> trim<00:00:25.660> all<00:00:25.930> the<00:00:25.960> fat<00:00:26.290> off<00:00:26.800> first<00:00:27.279> and<00:00:27.610> then

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
you trim all the fat off first and then

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.609 
you trim all the fat off first and then
put<00:00:27.970> the<00:00:28.090> seasoning<00:00:28.300> on<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:28.840> smoke<00:00:29.050> it<00:00:29.230> you

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
put the seasoning on and smoke it you

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.589 
put the seasoning on and smoke it you
get<00:00:29.800> to<00:00:29.950> keep<00:00:30.220> all<00:00:30.399> that<00:00:30.610> seasoning<00:00:31.180> on<00:00:31.390> the

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
get to keep all that seasoning on the

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.950 
get to keep all that seasoning on the
meat

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
meat

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.380 
meat
if<00:00:32.020> you<00:00:32.619> seasoned<00:00:33.550> it<00:00:33.670> with<00:00:33.700> all<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.149> fat<00:00:34.360> on

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
if you seasoned it with all the fat on

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.510 
if you seasoned it with all the fat on
and<00:00:34.840> then<00:00:35.200> you<00:00:35.320> have<00:00:35.440> to<00:00:35.559> trim<00:00:35.829> it<00:00:35.950> off<00:00:36.130> you're

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
and then you have to trim it off you're

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.520 
and then you have to trim it off you're
losing<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.180> chance<00:00:37.480> for<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.899> other<00:00:38.079> flavor

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
losing that chance for the other flavor

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.500 
losing that chance for the other flavor
to<00:00:39.219> stay<00:00:39.489> on<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.850> meat<00:00:40.030> what<00:00:40.210> you're<00:00:40.360> actually

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
have here is the top part is called the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.249 
have here is the top part is called the

muscles separate it almost just pulls

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.680 
muscles separate it almost just pulls
itself<00:02:16.269> apart<00:02:17.519> so<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:18.730> we<00:02:18.910> put<00:02:19.090> aside<00:02:19.180> we<00:02:19.540> use

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690
