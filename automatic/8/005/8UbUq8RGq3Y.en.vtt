four<00:04:15.560> months<00:04:16.340> I<00:04:16.580> think<00:04:16.940> I<00:04:17.090> think<00:04:17.450> because<00:04:18.410> of

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
four months I think I think because of

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.380 
four months I think I think because of
vinyl<00:04:18.920> we<00:04:19.130> need<00:04:19.310> like<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.489> good<00:04:19.760> four<00:04:20.000> months

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
vinyl we need like a good four months

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.450 
vinyl we need like a good four months
now<00:04:20.720> for<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:21.350> know<00:04:21.470> pressing<00:04:21.980> and<00:04:22.190> all<00:04:22.280> those

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
now for you know pressing and all those

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.510 
now for you know pressing and all those
things<00:04:22.730> so<00:04:22.940> we<00:04:23.270> can<00:04:23.660> shoot<00:04:23.990> for<00:04:24.530> March<00:04:25.340> or

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
things so we can shoot for March or

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.900
