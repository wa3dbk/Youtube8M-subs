out very well together in a way that

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.380 
out very well together in a way that
they<00:01:24.830> each<00:01:25.069> highlight<00:01:25.640> what<00:01:25.910> makes<00:01:25.940> the

they each highlight what makes the
original<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.110> good<00:01:27.470> like<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.310> espionage<00:01:29.000> plot

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
original so good like the espionage plot

original so good like the espionage plot
leans<00:01:29.810> more<00:01:30.170> on<00:01:30.349> the<00:01:30.649> humor<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.160> creativity

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
leans more on the humor and creativity

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.779 
leans more on the humor and creativity
while<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.869> romance<00:01:33.289> plot<00:01:33.619> aims<00:01:33.950> more<00:01:34.369> for<00:01:34.640> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.540 
charm as for them individually some
could<00:01:38.479> argue<00:01:38.869> that<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.229> espionage<00:01:39.890> plot<00:01:40.190> is

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
could argue that the espionage plot is

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.580 
could argue that the espionage plot is
not<00:01:40.580> all<00:01:41.000> that<00:01:41.209> original<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:41.959> can<00:01:42.349> be

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
not all that original and can be

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.979 
not all that original and can be
predictable<00:01:43.280> but<00:01:44.000> it's<00:01:44.149> for<00:01:44.390> sure<00:01:44.569> that<00:01:44.840> it's

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:44.989 
predictable but it's for sure that it's

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:47.380 
predictable but it's for sure that it's
told<00:01:45.289> very<00:01:45.770> well<00:01:46.099> and<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.550> often<00:01:46.789> leads<00:01:47.060> to

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
told very well and it often leads to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.710 
told very well and it often leads to
some<00:01:47.750> small<00:01:48.140> unexpected<00:01:48.950> twists<00:01:49.489> as<00:01:49.670> for<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
some small unexpected twists as for the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.199 
some small unexpected twists as for the
romance<00:01:51.080> plot<00:01:51.410> they<00:01:51.950> don't<00:01:52.190> focus<00:01:52.489> on<00:01:52.819> it<00:01:52.880> too

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
romance plot they don't focus on it too

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.479 
romance plot they don't focus on it too
much<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.660> turn<00:01:53.840> this<00:01:54.080> into<00:01:54.319> a<00:01:54.440> romantic<00:01:55.190> comedy

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:55.489 
much to turn this into a romantic comedy

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:57.999 
much to turn this into a romantic comedy
but<00:01:56.479> they<00:01:56.599> give<00:01:56.750> us<00:01:56.929> a<00:01:57.050> right<00:01:57.319> amount<00:01:57.649> to<00:01:57.830> make

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
but they give us a right amount to make

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.820 
but they give us a right amount to make
it<00:01:58.160> an<00:01:58.280> important<00:01:58.819> part<00:01:59.060> of<00:01:59.149> a<00:01:59.300> movie<00:01:59.690> if<00:01:59.989> there

is<00:02:01.039> one<00:02:01.369> thing<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.819> would<00:02:01.880> criticize<00:02:02.630> it's<00:02:03.050> that

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
is one thing I would criticize it's that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.169 
is one thing I would criticize it's that

looks interesting to look around but

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.309 
looks interesting to look around but
then<00:03:28.549> when<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.940> characters<00:03:29.419> go<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.750> places

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
things look grand and it shows the true

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.890 
things look grand and it shows the true
creativity<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.650> animators<00:03:40.400> if<00:03:40.659> there<00:03:41.659> is

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
creativity of the animators if there is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.080 
creativity of the animators if there is
something<00:03:42.349> that<00:03:42.590> does<00:03:43.069> stand<00:03:43.459> out<00:03:43.639> in<00:03:43.849> terms

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
something that does stand out in terms

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.240 
something that does stand out in terms
of<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.389> animation<00:03:44.989> it<00:03:45.590> would<00:03:45.919> be<00:03:46.069> the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
of the animation it would be the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.189 
of the animation it would be the
transformation<00:03:46.819> bits<00:03:47.480> when<00:03:47.780> someone

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:48.199 
transformation bits when someone

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.439 
transformation bits when someone
consumes<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.889> purple<00:03:49.250> potion<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.909> the

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
consumes the purple potion and the

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.469 
consumes the purple potion and the
action<00:03:51.019> scenes<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.620> find<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:52.639> really<00:03:52.909> gives<00:03:53.269> the

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479 
action scenes I find it really gives the

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.539 
action scenes I find it really gives the
movie<00:03:53.629> some<00:03:53.989> new<00:03:54.229> abilities<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.129> makes<00:03:55.370> it

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
movie some new abilities that makes it

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.629 
movie some new abilities that makes it
stand<00:03:55.849> out<00:03:56.120> from<00:03:56.180> its<00:03:56.510> predecessors<00:03:57.440> I<00:03:57.709> won't

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
stand out from its predecessors I won't

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.879 
stand out from its predecessors I won't
say<00:03:58.940> that<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.329> animation<00:04:00.019> is<00:04:00.199> the<00:04:00.229> highlight

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
say that the animation is the highlight

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.430 
say that the animation is the highlight
of<00:04:00.919> the<00:04:01.159> film<00:04:01.370> but<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.209> will<00:04:02.510> say<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:03.079> they<00:04:03.199> did

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
of the film but I will say that they did

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.349 
of the film but I will say that they did
a<00:04:03.470> fascinating<00:04:03.889> job<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:09.260> characters<00:04:10.359> the

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
a fascinating job the characters the

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.059 
a fascinating job the characters the
characters<00:04:11.900> are<00:04:12.079> possibly<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.680> biggest

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
characters are possibly the biggest

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.550 
characters are possibly the biggest
reason<00:04:13.790> why<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.000> was<00:04:14.239> so<00:04:14.479> excited<00:04:14.659> to<00:04:15.049> see<00:04:15.199> this

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
reason why I was so excited to see this
