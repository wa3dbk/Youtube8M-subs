00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 so I explain to you how to do 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.779
 to pass a door girls 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.389
 before take your stupidity our 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.809
 together guys like this you 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.820
 get the square this is a square 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.880
 then you position your square 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.740
 in your excavations at that you 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.260
 position after your skin is not 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.420
 in your door would you be taking 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:38.270
 a screw like these will come early or 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.270
 cat is our big crutch 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.860
 parallel to your door 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.860
 we have 19 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.940
 19 years old 8 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.890
 first your hammer and you type 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.590
 slightly on the screw head to make 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.489
 to sell 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.489
 the meta below 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.670
 mostly 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.020
 then you will use this match 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.880
 does nobody electric 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.890
 why an electric drill by 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.719
 compared to a normal screwdriver because 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.429
 perspective the cliques falls faster 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:22.710
 so prevents it from shattering and 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.630
 we will use but walk I have 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:32.420
 so a wick with a center point 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.420
 happy to be able to pierce I place myself 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.039
 I do and I count I will break through 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.310
 do not go father is that half of the 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.360
 door and I will repeat the state of the other 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.360
 side crossing 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.390
 I see it well to be well 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.750
 perpendicular to the door and well 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.750
 level 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:15.870
 then I use a ponk calade it's 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:17.720
 to break a little bonobo and I 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.010
 repeat the operation 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.090
 on the other side of the door to 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.090
 positions of my crutches 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:35.060
 I put the lily back in parallel 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:57.769
 I use my hammer to redo the 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:57.769
 same state and I landmark 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.540
 always by the people 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.650
 then I just have to gather my 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.370
 crutches this technique that allows 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.010
 to avoid that becky force10 recognized any 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.900
 inverted in one go to the opposite case 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.800
 that you take half by trade and 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.800
 you will always be at the table
