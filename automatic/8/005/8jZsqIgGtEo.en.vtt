keys I'm sorry and as you can see just

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.139 
keys I'm sorry and as you can see just
on<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> first<00:00:45.440> try<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.770> managed<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.879> some

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
on the first try I managed to get some

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.319 
on the first try I managed to get some
deep<00:00:48.450> scratches<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.129> skin<00:00:50.309> protector<00:00:50.760> but

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
deep scratches on the skin protector but

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.619 
deep scratches on the skin protector but
III<00:00:51.870> applied<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.890> huge<00:00:53.190> force<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.239> guess

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
III applied the huge force and I guess

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.319 
III applied the huge force and I guess
it<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> spec<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.710> expected<00:00:56.149> because<00:00:57.149> it's

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it is a spec it is expected because it's

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.090 
it is a spec it is expected because it's
just<00:00:57.480> plastic<00:00:58.050> screen<00:00:58.469> protector<00:00:58.530> even
