pokemon can evolve
now<00:00:30.810> most<00:00:31.050> pokémon<00:00:31.500> evolve<00:00:31.830> while<00:00:32.099> leveling

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
now most pokémon evolve while leveling

now most pokémon evolve while leveling
go<00:00:32.879> but<00:00:33.540> there<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.750> actually<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.290> number<00:00:34.440> of

go but there are actually a number of
unique<00:00:35.129> different<00:00:35.610> ways<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.600> easiest<00:00:36.870> way<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
unique different ways the easiest way is

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.280 
unique different ways the easiest way is
by<00:00:37.589> using<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.100> stone<00:00:38.519> on<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.780> now<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> screen
