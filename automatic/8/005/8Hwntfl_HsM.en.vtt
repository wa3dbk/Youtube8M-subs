you<00:00:17.730> can<00:00:17.880> see<00:00:18.060> there<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.300> took<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> GoPro<00:00:19.109> Hero

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
you can see there I took a GoPro Hero

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.170 
you can see there I took a GoPro Hero
flat<00:00:19.710> surface<00:00:20.100> mount<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.580> trimmed<00:00:20.880> off<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
flat surface mount and trimmed off the

top<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> hacksaw<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:23.010> took<00:00:23.160> an

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
top with a hacksaw then I just took an

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.920 
top with a hacksaw then I just took an
exacto<00:00:23.850> knife<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.359> trimmed<00:00:24.600> off<00:00:24.750> the

adhesive backing on the back of the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.730 
adhesive backing on the back of the
mount<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.599> matched<00:00:27.840> perfectly<00:00:28.140> to

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
mount so that it matched perfectly to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.160

the<00:00:28.859> shape<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.820> vent<00:00:30.060> slide<00:00:30.390> then<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> just

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the shape of the vent slide then I just

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
the shape of the vent slide then I just

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
mount onto the vent slide and let it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.490 
mount onto the vent slide and let it
cure<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.630> 24<00:00:37.050> hours<00:00:37.969> and<00:00:38.969> here's<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:40.020> GoPro

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
cure for 24 hours and here's my GoPro

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.580 
cure for 24 hours and here's my GoPro
Hero<00:00:40.770> 2<00:00:41.010> camera<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:41.910> drilled<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
Hero 2 camera and I just drilled in to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.290 
Hero 2 camera and I just drilled in to
the<00:00:43.710> housing<00:00:44.100> there<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.640> access<00:00:45.120> to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the housing there so I have access to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.420 
the housing there so I have access to
the<00:00:45.420> external<00:00:45.899> mic<00:00:46.020> input<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:47.039> used<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the external mic input and I just used a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.990 
the external mic input and I just used a
j-hook<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.390> there<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.969> just

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
j-hook as you see there and you just

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.650 
j-hook as you see there and you just
simply<00:00:51.660> slide<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.640> j-hook<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:54.120> onto<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
simply slide the j-hook there onto the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.619 
simply slide the j-hook there onto the
mount<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.550> you'll<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> nice<00:00:57.000> field<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
mount and you'll get a nice field of

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.080 
mount and you'll get a nice field of
view<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> road<00:00:58.289> much<00:00:58.680> better<00:00:58.980> than<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.789> had

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
view of the road much better than I had

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.060

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
before where I had it mounted lower on

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.860 
before where I had it mounted lower on
the<00:01:02.190> chin<00:01:02.460> bar<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> helmet<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.260 

in<00:01:34.960> my<00:01:35.530> opinion<00:01:36.009> I<00:01:36.130> still<00:01:36.670> recommend<00:01:37.210> the

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
in my opinion I still recommend the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.170 
in my opinion I still recommend the
GoPro<00:01:37.689> hero2<00:01:38.020> over<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:38.740> GoPro<00:01:39.100> Hero<00:01:39.130> 3<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.850> 3

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
GoPro hero2 over the GoPro Hero 3 and 3

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.719 
GoPro hero2 over the GoPro Hero 3 and 3
plus<00:01:40.210> just<00:01:41.140> because<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.649> GoPro<00:01:42.009> Hero<00:01:42.070> 2<00:01:42.579> is

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
plus just because the GoPro Hero 2 is

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.330 
plus just because the GoPro Hero 2 is
proven<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.179> be<00:01:43.329> more<00:01:43.539> reliable<00:01:43.869> I've<00:01:44.860> had<00:01:45.159> my

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
having problems and on top of that you

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.260 
having problems and on top of that you
have<00:01:58.689> to<00:01:58.840> get<00:01:58.960> an<00:01:59.110> external<00:01:59.469> mic<00:02:00.060> adapter<00:02:01.060> in
