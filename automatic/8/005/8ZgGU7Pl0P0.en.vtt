to<00:02:02.030> have<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.050> life<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.890> I<00:02:03.920> never<00:02:04.220> thought

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
to have a life that I never thought

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.200 
to have a life that I never thought
possible

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
possible

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.150 
possible
except<00:02:05.690> for<00:02:05.840> gymnastics<00:02:06.050> but<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:06.950> knew

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
except for gymnastics but that I knew

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.340 
except for gymnastics but that I knew
exactly<00:02:07.310> what<00:02:07.910> I<00:02:07.970> wanted<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.450> do<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:09.050> didn't

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
exactly what I wanted to do and I didn't

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.600 
exactly what I wanted to do and I didn't
believe<00:02:09.560> in<00:02:09.709> dream<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.100> Olympics<00:02:10.429> they

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
believe in dream of the Olympics they

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.090 
believe in dream of the Olympics they
happened<00:02:11.090> because<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.720> loved<00:02:12.110> what<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.410> did<00:02:12.530> and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
happened because I loved what I did and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.440 
happened because I loved what I did and
it's<00:02:13.280> good<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.519> have<00:02:13.610> goals<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:14.239> all<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.420> that

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
it's good to have goals and all of that

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.080 
it's good to have goals and all of that
but<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.780> think<00:02:14.840> if<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.560> love<00:02:15.890> what<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.220> do<00:02:16.489> it's

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
but I think if you love what you do it's

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.940 
but I think if you love what you do it's
not<00:02:17.269> even<00:02:17.510> hoping<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.080> what's<00:02:18.260> next<00:02:18.440> it's

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
not even hoping for what's next it's

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.670 
not even hoping for what's next it's
being<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.790> moment<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.330> being<00:02:21.290> as<00:02:21.410> good<00:02:21.620> as

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
being in the moment and being as good as

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.949 
being in the moment and being as good as
you<00:02:21.890> can<00:02:22.100> as<00:02:22.760> passionate<00:02:23.450> as<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.840> be

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
you can as passionate as you can be

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.300 
you can as passionate as you can be
about<00:02:23.989> what<00:02:24.530> you're<00:02:24.739> doing<00:02:25.010> at<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.160> moment

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
about what you're doing at that moment

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.240 
about what you're doing at that moment

expect<00:02:28.550> them<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.030> never<00:02:29.390> expected<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.110> be<00:02:30.170> in
