00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.809
 Zero victory was a flashy one 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.010
 start today yes and after that davis fell 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.889

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.699
 not completely satisfied the first half 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.960
 is that not true at all? 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.029
 no but you often have that kind of thing 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.590
 races so I alone have 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 hard to play because you almost 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.580
 can never do well 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.260
 but well I have a lot of them myself 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.050
 have to play this i thought it was modern 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.210
 because if you are a bit busy you turn quickly 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.440
 got the ball back but we did it 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.570
