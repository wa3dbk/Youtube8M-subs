networking<00:00:06.240> ports<00:00:07.160> now<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.580> might<00:00:08.790> get<00:00:09.179> a

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
networking ports now you might get a

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.390 
networking ports now you might get a
little<00:00:09.660> bit<00:00:09.900> lost<00:00:10.290> initially<00:00:10.950> with<00:00:11.130> this

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
little bit lost initially with this

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.720 
little bit lost initially with this
concept<00:00:12.030> but<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.809> hope<00:00:13.320> once<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.130> finish<00:00:14.460> showing

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
concept but I hope once I finish showing

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.410 
concept but I hope once I finish showing
you<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.440> diagram<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:17.369> help<00:00:17.550> represent<00:00:17.880> what's

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
you a diagram to help represent what's

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.599 
you a diagram to help represent what's
happening<00:00:18.900> it'll<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:20.039> bit<00:00:20.250> clearer

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
happening it'll be a little bit clearer

network traffic in the background ok

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420 
network traffic in the background ok
there's<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> lot<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.259> different<00:01:40.590> services<00:01:41.159> that

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
there's a lot of different services that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.030 
there's a lot of different services that
could<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.640> running<00:01:42.180> which<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.439> send<00:01:43.890> and

receive network traffic ok so an example

would be traffic from a website now

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.039 
would be traffic from a website now

so<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.800> know<00:02:31.950> with<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.460> said<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:33.000> you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
so you know with that said you you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.880 
so you know with that said you you
really<00:02:33.840> could<00:02:34.020> only<00:02:35.450> receive<00:02:36.450> one<00:02:36.750> type<00:02:37.620> of

really could only receive one type of

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.670 
really could only receive one type of
network<00:02:38.850> traffic<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.450> or<00:02:39.630> run<00:02:39.990> one<00:02:40.350> type<00:02:40.650> of

application on your computer in addition

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
application on your computer in addition
once<00:02:45.959> we<00:02:46.230> start<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:47.010> uniquely<00:02:47.400> identify<00:02:48.380> what

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
once we start to uniquely identify what

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.160 
once we start to uniquely identify what
services<00:02:50.070> use<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> particular<00:02:50.820> port<00:02:51.330> we<00:02:52.020> can

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
services use a particular port we can

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.500 
services use a particular port we can
also<00:02:52.350> do<00:02:52.709> some<00:02:53.130> more<00:02:53.610> advanced<00:02:53.910> things<00:02:54.030> and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
also do some more advanced things and

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.260 
also do some more advanced things and
improve<00:02:55.170> security<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.130> our<00:02:56.160> environment<00:02:56.820> and

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
improve security on our environment and

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.620 
improve security on our environment and
prevent<00:02:57.630> all<00:02:58.590> traffic<00:02:59.190> on<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.610> particular<00:03:00.060> port

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
prevent all traffic on a particular port

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.510 
prevent all traffic on a particular port
number<00:03:00.959> from<00:03:01.290> ever<00:03:01.500> hitting<00:03:01.800> our<00:03:02.040> computer

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
number from ever hitting our computer

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.479 
number from ever hitting our computer
okay<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.360> that's<00:03:03.480> how<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.660> firewall<00:03:04.350> works<00:03:04.650> but

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
okay and that's how a firewall works but

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.260 
okay and that's how a firewall works but
we<00:03:05.610> won't<00:03:05.790> go<00:03:05.910> into<00:03:05.940> any<00:03:06.300> detail<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.200> so

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
we won't go into any detail on that so

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.670 
we won't go into any detail on that so
that's<00:03:09.270> really<00:03:09.480> what<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> port<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.290> unique

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
that's really what a port is this unique

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.670 
that's really what a port is this unique
number<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:12.000> different<00:03:12.510> type<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.959> traffic<00:03:13.290> is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
number the different type of traffic is

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.790 
number the different type of traffic is
sent<00:03:13.890> over<00:03:14.300> so<00:03:15.300> let's<00:03:15.540> just<00:03:16.050> jump<00:03:16.290> over<00:03:16.440> have<00:03:16.770> a

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
sent over so let's just jump over have a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.729 
sent over so let's just jump over have a
really<00:03:17.220> quick<00:03:17.400> look<00:03:17.640> at<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:18.350> basic<00:03:19.350> example

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
really quick look at a basic example

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.110 
really quick look at a basic example
that<00:03:20.430> I've<00:03:20.549> got<00:03:20.820> him<00:03:21.060> now

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
that I've got him now

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.759 
that I've got him now
this<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.330> example<00:03:24.840> this<00:03:25.110> diagram<00:03:25.560> is

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
this is the example this diagram is

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.199 
this is the example this diagram is
extremely<00:03:26.459> basic<00:03:26.930> but<00:03:27.930> hopefully<00:03:28.680> it<00:03:28.799> will

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
extremely basic but hopefully it will

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.270 
extremely basic but hopefully it will
help<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.450> understand<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.290> I've<00:03:31.440> removed<00:03:31.890> all

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
help you understand and I've removed all

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.880 
help you understand and I've removed all
the<00:03:32.610> complexities<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.360> may<00:03:34.080> be<00:03:34.140> present<00:03:34.769> in

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
the complexities that may be present in

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.979 
the complexities that may be present in
a<00:03:34.980> network<00:03:35.430> such<00:03:35.820> as<00:03:35.970> switches<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.720> routers

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
a network such as switches and routers

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.930 
a network such as switches and routers
and<00:03:37.260> all<00:03:37.980> those<00:03:38.220> sorts<00:03:38.519> of<00:03:38.580> things

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
and all those sorts of things

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.440 
and all those sorts of things
because<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.810> really<00:03:40.560> just<00:03:40.590> want<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.070> to

because I really just want you to

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.420 
because I really just want you to
hopefully<00:03:42.450> understand<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.320> know<00:03:43.440> what<00:03:44.400> a

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
hopefully understand you know what a

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.870 
hopefully understand you know what a
port<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:45.290> now<00:03:46.290> what<00:03:46.830> we've<00:03:46.980> got<00:03:47.250> here<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.549> we

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
port is now what we've got here is we

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.080 
port is now what we've got here is we
have<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.239> desktop<00:03:48.690> computer<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.880> on<00:03:50.880> that

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
have a desktop computer and on that

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.690 
have a desktop computer and on that
computer<00:03:51.600> we're<00:03:51.810> running<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.320> web<00:03:53.160> browser<00:03:53.340> and

computer we're running a web browser and
an<00:03:53.790> email<00:03:54.180> program<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:55.170> that's<00:03:55.260> what<00:03:55.500> any

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
an email program so that's what any

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
desktop okay now what happens is our web

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.490 
desktop okay now what happens is our web
browser<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.690> web<00:05:06.690> traffic<00:05:07.100> runs<00:05:08.100> on<00:05:08.310> port<00:05:08.790> 80

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.800 
browser and web traffic runs on port 80
okay<00:05:10.500> now<00:05:11.190> you<00:05:11.640> can<00:05:11.700> run<00:05:11.970> on<00:05:12.120> other<00:05:12.300> ports<00:05:12.690> as

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
okay now you can run on other ports as

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.280 
okay now you can run on other ports as
well<00:05:12.860> but<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.220> default<00:05:14.970> standard<00:05:15.450> is<00:05:15.750> port<00:05:16.050> 80

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
well but the default standard is port 80

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.700 
well but the default standard is port 80
and<00:05:16.530> it<00:05:17.130> may<00:05:17.310> be<00:05:17.370> port<00:05:17.790> 443<00:05:18.600> as<00:05:18.930> well<00:05:19.290> for

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
and it may be port 443 as well for

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.290 
and it may be port 443 as well for
secure<00:05:20.580> web<00:05:20.910> pages<00:05:21.500> but<00:05:22.500> port<00:05:22.830> 80<00:05:23.040> is<00:05:23.370> running

our website and on our email program we

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.630 
our website and on our email program we
use<00:05:29.280> port<00:05:29.610> 23<00:05:29.970> now<00:05:30.870> these<00:05:31.080> are<00:05:31.290> reserved<00:05:32.190> port

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
use port 23 now these are reserved port

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.610 
use port 23 now these are reserved port
numbers<00:05:33.000> that<00:05:33.270> are<00:05:33.480> reserved<00:05:33.960> and<00:05:34.200> are<00:05:34.410> an

browse a web site that uses HTTPS okay

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.330 
browse a web site that uses HTTPS okay
now<00:05:53.480> what<00:05:54.480> happens<00:05:54.810> we<00:05:55.110> this<00:05:55.680> that's<00:05:56.010> fairly

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
now what happens we this that's fairly

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.950 
now what happens we this that's fairly
basic<00:05:56.520> I<00:05:56.760> mean<00:05:56.790> that's<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.240> that's<00:05:57.570> really

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
basic I mean that's the that's really

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.620 
basic I mean that's the that's really
the<00:05:58.080> read<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.980> result<00:05:59.730> of<00:05:59.910> it<00:06:00.090> okay

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
the read the result of it okay

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.410 
the read the result of it okay
the<00:06:01.170> traffic<00:06:01.500> comes<00:06:01.710> down<00:06:01.980> there<00:06:02.820> on<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.030> unique

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
the traffic comes down there on a unique

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.710 
the traffic comes down there on a unique
port<00:06:03.780> and<00:06:04.020> a<00:06:04.740> desktop<00:06:05.370> is<00:06:05.760> able<00:06:06.150> to<00:06:06.300> read<00:06:06.570> that

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
port and a desktop is able to read that

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.280 
port and a desktop is able to read that
information<00:06:07.470> and<00:06:08.180> determine<00:06:09.180> from<00:06:09.750> that<00:06:09.840> port

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
information and determine from that port

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.280 
information and determine from that port
number<00:06:10.520> what<00:06:11.520> application<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.690> web<00:06:13.020> traffic

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
number what application the web traffic

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.370 
number what application the web traffic
or<00:06:13.860> the<00:06:14.130> network<00:06:14.790> traffic<00:06:15.180> should<00:06:16.170> be

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
or the network traffic should be

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.180 
or the network traffic should be
delivered<00:06:16.920> to<00:06:17.660> now<00:06:18.660> obviously<00:06:19.650> there's<00:06:19.860> a<00:06:19.950> lot

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
delivered to now obviously there's a lot

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.340 
delivered to now obviously there's a lot
more<00:06:20.400> that<00:06:20.670> goes<00:06:20.700> on<00:06:21.060> in<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:22.110> background

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
more that goes on in the background

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.070 
more that goes on in the background
we've<00:06:22.950> got<00:06:23.250> devices<00:06:24.030> that<00:06:24.240> sit<00:06:24.390> between<00:06:24.570> that

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
we've got devices that sit between that

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.070 
we've got devices that sit between that
which<00:06:25.830> did<00:06:26.100> help<00:06:26.370> also<00:06:26.730> help<00:06:27.060> determine<00:06:27.600> where

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
which did help also help determine where

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.530 
which did help also help determine where
on<00:06:28.230> the<00:06:28.350> network<00:06:28.740> is<00:06:29.010> traffic<00:06:29.520> goes<00:06:29.850> to<00:06:30.120> based

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
on the network is traffic goes to based

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.840 
on the network is traffic goes to based
on<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:30.870> port<00:06:31.140> number<00:06:31.470> and<00:06:31.680> we<00:06:32.490> also<00:06:32.640> have

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
on the port number and we also have

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.330 
on the port number and we also have
firewalls<00:06:33.510> that<00:06:33.630> could<00:06:33.960> block<00:06:34.380> that<00:06:34.620> so<00:06:35.070> if<00:06:35.310> we

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
firewalls that could block that so if we

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.450 
firewalls that could block that so if we
implemented<00:06:35.850> a<00:06:36.120> firewall<00:06:37.010> here<00:06:38.010> somewhere

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
implemented a firewall here somewhere

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.450 
implemented a firewall here somewhere
before<00:06:38.700> we<00:06:39.090> even<00:06:39.470> arrived<00:06:40.470> at<00:06:40.650> our<00:06:40.770> desktop

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
before we even arrived at our desktop

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.830 
before we even arrived at our desktop
we<00:06:42.000> could<00:06:42.240> prevent<00:06:43.080> port<00:06:44.010> 80<00:06:44.340> traffic<00:06:44.840> from

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
we could prevent port 80 traffic from

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.690 
we could prevent port 80 traffic from
going<00:06:46.080> anywhere<00:06:46.470> we<00:06:46.770> will<00:06:46.920> just<00:06:47.040> say<00:06:47.190> or<00:06:47.370> port

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700 
going anywhere we will just say or port

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.990 
going anywhere we will just say or port
80<00:06:47.880> traffic<00:06:48.560> stop<00:06:49.560> okay<00:06:50.220> and<00:06:50.430> that's<00:06:50.820> how

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
80 traffic stop okay and that's how

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.870 
80 traffic stop okay and that's how
firewall<00:06:51.570> works<00:06:51.780> but<00:06:52.550> hopefully<00:06:53.550> that<00:06:53.730> gives

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
firewall works but hopefully that gives

firewall works but hopefully that gives
