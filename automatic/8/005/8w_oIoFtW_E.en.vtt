 the printed and we are in the last 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:08.179
 chapter with the uterus not the penultimate 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.580
 because the last one is the assembly but the 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.799
 last chapter of pc components 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.139
 finally after almost a year power 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.109

 most has lasted nearly a year Mrs. 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.599
 truth is yes after almost a year 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.599
 of this last piece has cost us 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.090
 a lot of time of economic savings 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.820
 because it has cost yours because it has been 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.320
 a very good processor I think and the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.700
 It's true that it was expensive, not because 17 300 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.980
 308 euros I started as a component 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.650
 cost create from here thanks in case 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.330

 everyone and good attentive because this is 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:22.210
 the processor is a little palante 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.789
 Maria a 74 1790 and leave it in to be 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.330
 present 6 hibbert is the processor 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.330
 be no more 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.679
 this already and also the reader what we 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.360
 we bought it because of course 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.299
 computer without a reader because it can 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.340
 work like that obviously but good here 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.479
 this is one of your we are going to open it and the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.610
 truth is that we already have many 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.130
 you win because with all this when now 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.500
 we will mount the computer as well 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.319
 we can render much faster 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.539
 we can see the camera at 1080 that 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.759
 now serving a very bad quality 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.159
 First of all, it is also to say that the 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.750
 mount on girlfriend person from here 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.119
 first of all I'm going to thank you 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.369
 a boy who has always been always 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.570
 on the subject of the assembly of the computer that 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.270
 it's a woe 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.520

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.940
 Many thanks to asia school and good 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.640
 this is a reader a dvd recorder 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.010
 what has cost 13 euros unasur that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.050
 well I always trust your 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.270
 a brand that I love very much and 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.440
 well for that price 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.360
 quality is very much above its the raval 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.730
 or maximum that is possible or that is very 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.070
 recommendable had thus to which unicaja 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.440
 or anything or very well because it's from 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.400
 components because in that aspect of you 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.970
 you save the in boxes by the middle the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.970
 processor 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.380
 here is what is the processor well 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.459
 the instruction manual here and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:58.600
 fix what comes comes what is the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:01.330
 processor and what is the heatsink that 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.450
 everyone already knows what it is you can 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.400
 mount but in a pc gamer like the one 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.910
 we are going to ride because we already have 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.650
 the cooling of corsair and this one 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.540
 we are going to save it although it could be 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.610
 ride but hey the other one is always 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.370
 advisable to put one that refrigerates 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.930
 better not and so good this is the 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.530
 processor that now we are not going to take it out 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.530
 from here for now 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.940
 because it 's super super super 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.310
 this is the reflected Armenian filmmaker 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.680
 those who thought that it was more thing not 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.670
 the processor this is what makes your 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.319
 computer render a lot so it's a 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.870
 past the parties I think obviously 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.060
 but so I hope nothing good 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.940
 First, thank you all for the support 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.530
 shown and that without your support then 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.390
 this would not have been possible 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.010
 because it has cost us a lot of time 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.680
 you have been there you know that 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.569
 it has cost us a lot of time and now 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.239
 we are going to enjoy it because 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.519
 we can make gameplays we can do 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.840
 direct of games and without the 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.099
 computer resents and that goes bad and 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.109
 let's hope that the quality increases 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.680
 channel and thanks everyone for being there 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.680
 until
