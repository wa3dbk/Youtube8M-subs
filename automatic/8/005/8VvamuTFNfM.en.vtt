as<00:00:48.489> a<00:00:49.390> tip<00:00:49.809> try<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.290> keep<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:50.680> name<00:00:50.860> short<00:00:51.219> for

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
as a tip try to keep the name short for

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.040 
as a tip try to keep the name short for
when<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.059> have<00:00:52.210> lots<00:00:52.510> more<00:00:52.630> pages<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.719> next

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
when you have lots more pages the next

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.959 
when you have lots more pages the next
thing<00:00:56.260> is<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.710> choose<00:00:56.950> a<00:00:56.980> category<00:00:57.280> in<00:00:57.700> a<00:00:57.760> room

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
thing is to choose a category in a room

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.360 
thing is to choose a category in a room
for<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.239> page<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.840> is<00:00:59.410> really<00:00:59.800> important<00:01:00.280> to

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
for the page it is really important to

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.979 
for the page it is really important to
do<00:01:00.520> this<00:01:00.730> step<00:01:00.940> at<00:01:01.120> this<00:01:01.210> time<00:01:01.480> as<00:01:01.719> now

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
do this step at this time as now

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.690 
do this step at this time as now
whenever<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.559> add<00:01:02.770> something<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.340> that<00:01:03.370> page

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
whenever you add something to that page

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.369 
whenever you add something to that page
it<00:01:03.969> will<00:01:04.119> automatically<00:01:04.750> be<00:01:04.930> given<00:01:05.079> this

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
it will automatically be given this

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.289 
it will automatically be given this
category<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:05.979> room<00:01:06.159> which<00:01:06.729> means<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.119> locks

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
category in room which means the locks

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.910 
category in room which means the locks
on<00:01:07.479> app<00:01:07.659> will<00:01:07.900> be<00:01:08.049> all<00:01:08.170> neat<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:08.530> ordered

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
on app will be all neat and ordered

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.130 
on app will be all neat and ordered
according<00:01:09.159> to<00:01:09.340> rooms<00:01:09.610> and<00:01:09.850> categories<00:01:10.330> so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
according to rooms and categories so

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.920 
according to rooms and categories so
let's<00:01:11.770> choose<00:01:12.220> lighting<00:01:13.030> for<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.330> category

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
let's choose lighting for the category

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.950 
let's choose lighting for the category
and<00:01:15.810> Hall<00:01:16.810> for<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.229> room<00:01:17.560> there<00:01:18.520> we<00:01:18.610> go<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
and Hall for the room there we go so the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.960 
and Hall for the room there we go so the
next<00:01:20.170> step<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.979> drag<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.250> input<00:01:21.790> and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
next step is to drag the input and

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.539 
next step is to drag the input and
output<00:01:22.119> onto<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.840> page<00:01:27.960> simple<00:01:28.960> so<00:01:29.110> far

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
output onto the page simple so far

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.830 
output onto the page simple so far
finally<00:01:30.549> we<00:01:30.729> need<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.909> add<00:01:31.150> something<00:01:31.450> so<00:01:31.810> that

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
finally we need to add something so that

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.870 
finally we need to add something so that
when<00:01:32.080> we<00:01:32.200> press<00:01:32.439> our<00:01:32.650> attractive<00:01:33.159> switch<00:01:33.400> it

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
when we press our attractive switch it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.210 
when we press our attractive switch it
will<00:01:34.090> toggle<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.479> light<00:01:34.720> on<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.320> off<00:01:35.500> so<00:01:36.070> that

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
will toggle the light on and off so that

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.590 
will toggle the light on and off so that
the<00:01:36.310> light<00:01:36.460> isn't<00:01:36.880> just<00:01:37.060> on<00:01:37.180> when<00:01:37.360> we<00:01:37.479> are

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
the light isn't just on when we are

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.170 
the light isn't just on when we are
pressing<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.020> switch<00:01:38.140> on<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.729> function

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
pressing the switch on this function

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.999 
pressing the switch on this function
block<00:01:40.360> is<00:01:40.509> called<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.840> push<00:01:41.049> button<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:41.619> it

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
block is called the push button and it

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.649 
block is called the push button and it
is<00:01:42.130> one<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.520> simplest<00:01:42.939> blocks<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.450> locks

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
is one of the simplest blocks and locks

can search through any of the function
blocks<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:16.920> add<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.430> from<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
blocks that you can add in from the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.030 
blocks that you can add in from the
program<00:02:18.180> tab<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.110> just<00:02:19.410> search<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.620> push

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
program tab so we just search for push

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.130 
program tab so we just search for push
it<00:02:20.550> brings<00:02:20.850> up<00:02:21.030> those<00:02:21.210> words<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.750> there's<00:02:21.990> the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
it brings up those words and there's the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.740 
it brings up those words and there's the
push<00:02:22.320> button<00:02:22.710> let's<00:02:23.640> just<00:02:23.880> close<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.270> for

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
push button let's just close that for

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.710 
push button let's just close that for
now<00:02:25.280> now<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:26.340> need<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.700> connect<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.150> input<00:02:27.540> and

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
now now we need to connect the input and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.200 
now now we need to connect the input and
the<00:02:27.870> output<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> push-button<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.970> click

go<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.650> there<00:02:41.580> we<00:02:41.700> go<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.210> basic

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
go and there we go that is basic

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.050 
go and there we go that is basic
lighting<00:02:42.840> done<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.280> test<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.940> see

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
lighting done we can test this to see

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.760 
lighting done we can test this to see
that<00:02:45.210> it<00:02:45.330> works<00:02:45.510> with<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.780> simulation<00:02:46.530> mode

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
that it works with the simulation mode

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.370 
that it works with the simulation mode
which<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.280> found<00:02:47.520> in<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.700> testing<00:02:48.209> tab<00:02:48.480> here

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
which is found in the testing tab here

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.170 
which is found in the testing tab here
there's<00:02:50.040> going<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.310> be<00:02:50.400> more<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.000> the

there's going to be more on that in the
