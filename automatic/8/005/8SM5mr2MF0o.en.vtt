before people what happens to those

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.260 
before people what happens to those
people<00:01:37.509> consider<00:01:38.110> if<00:01:38.259> you<00:01:38.380> will<00:01:38.610> Moses<00:01:39.610> he<00:01:40.149> had

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
people consider if you will Moses he had

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.210 
people consider if you will Moses he had
just<00:01:40.509> seen<00:01:40.690> a<00:01:40.720> bunch<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.110> miracles<00:01:41.649> by<00:01:41.830> God<00:01:42.100> and

just seen a bunch of miracles by God and
he<00:01:42.310> said<00:01:42.490> basically<00:01:43.360> I'm<00:01:43.869> paraphrasing<00:01:44.350> the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
he said basically I'm paraphrasing the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.160 
he said basically I'm paraphrasing the
miracles<00:01:45.580> are<00:01:45.700> great<00:01:45.970> but<00:01:46.179> I<00:01:46.270> want<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.570> see<00:01:46.780> you

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170

God<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.830> God<00:01:47.950> said<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:48.280> can't<00:01:48.520> see<00:01:48.849> me

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
God and God said you can't see me

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.969

because<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.840> would<00:01:50.140> kill<00:01:50.500> you

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
because it would kill you

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.330 
because it would kill you
so<00:01:51.399> instead<00:01:51.880> God's<00:01:52.840> glory<00:01:53.530> passed<00:01:54.039> him<00:01:54.310> by

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340
