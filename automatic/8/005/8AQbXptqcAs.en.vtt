smaller pieces and what I mean by that
is<00:00:30.760> you<00:00:30.789> don't<00:00:31.029> want<00:00:31.300> any<00:00:31.570> big<00:00:32.199> chunks<00:00:32.529> in

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
break the whole entire thing into the

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.660 
break the whole entire thing into the
smallest<00:00:37.780> little<00:00:37.989> pieces<00:00:38.410> that<00:00:39.160> you<00:00:39.190> can<00:00:39.489> make

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
smallest little pieces that you can make

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.240 
smallest little pieces that you can make
and<00:00:40.260> you're<00:00:41.260> just<00:00:41.379> going<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:41.620> do<00:00:41.800> this<00:00:41.949> to<00:00:42.129> the

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
and you're just going to do this to the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.640 
and you're just going to do this to the
whole<00:00:42.460> entire<00:00:42.790> thing

whole entire thing
and<00:00:44.740> the<00:00:45.550> reason<00:00:45.700> you<00:00:45.940> do<00:00:46.120> this<00:00:46.150> is<00:00:46.330> because<00:00:46.600> if

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
and the reason you do this is because if

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.020 
and the reason you do this is because if
you<00:00:47.170> leave<00:00:47.410> those<00:00:47.620> big<00:00:47.890> chunks<00:00:48.190> in<00:00:48.490> there<00:00:48.760> it's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
you leave those big chunks in there it's

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.810 
you leave those big chunks in there it's
going<00:00:49.240> to<00:00:49.300> kind<00:00:49.480> of<00:00:49.630> break<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.410> crack<00:00:50.820> again

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
going to kind of break and crack again

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.850 
going to kind of break and crack again
after<00:00:52.390> you<00:00:52.510> fix<00:00:52.810> it<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.200> you<00:00:53.230> kind<00:00:53.560> of<00:00:53.590> want<00:00:53.800> to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
after you fix it so you kind of want to

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.110 
after you fix it so you kind of want to
just<00:00:53.920> mold<00:00:54.310> it<00:00:54.460> all<00:00:54.640> completely<00:00:55.230> together

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
just mold it all completely together

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.850 
just mold it all completely together
rather<00:00:58.120> than<00:00:58.270> just<00:00:58.660> fixing<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:59.260> broken<00:00:59.440> part

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
rather than just fixing the broken part

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.160 
rather than just fixing the broken part
and<00:01:00.040> leaving<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:01.120> big<00:01:01.300> sections<00:01:01.780> alone

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
and leaving the big sections alone

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.450 
and leaving the big sections alone
you're<00:01:02.680> just<00:01:02.830> going<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.010> want<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.250> do<00:01:03.340> the

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
you're just going to want to do the

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.480 
you're just going to want to do the
whole<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.940> whole<00:01:04.240> thing<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.830> help<00:01:06.010> seal<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.460> a

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
whole the whole thing to help seal it a

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.280 
whole the whole thing to help seal it a
little<00:01:06.700> bit<00:01:06.940> better<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.420> I<00:01:07.840> didn't<00:01:08.050> have<00:01:08.170> any

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
little bit better and I didn't have any

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.200 
little bit better and I didn't have any
saran<00:01:08.710> wrap<00:01:08.920> so<00:01:09.130> I<00:01:09.160> just<00:01:09.370> took<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.580> ziplock

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
saran wrap so I just took a ziplock

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.660 
saran wrap so I just took a ziplock
baggie<00:01:10.510> and<00:01:10.690> I<00:01:10.960> put<00:01:11.170> it<00:01:11.260> on<00:01:11.350> top<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:12.370> kind<00:01:12.520> of

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
baggie and I put it on top to kind of

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.460 
baggie and I put it on top to kind of
like<00:01:12.790> further<00:01:13.120> smash<00:01:13.690> it<00:01:13.960> just<00:01:14.200> so<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.350> doesn't

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
like further smash it just so it doesn't

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.040 
like further smash it just so it doesn't
get<00:01:15.280> everywhere<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:15.850> kind<00:01:16.030> of<00:01:16.090> stays<00:01:16.450> in

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
get everywhere and it kind of stays in

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.340 
get everywhere and it kind of stays in
the<00:01:17.650> pan<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.190> it<00:01:18.850> helps<00:01:19.150> with<00:01:19.330> just<00:01:19.810> making<00:01:20.229> it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
the pan and it helps with just making it

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.149 
the pan and it helps with just making it
a<00:01:20.440> little<00:01:20.619> less<00:01:20.860> messy

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.669 

and<00:01:24.249> this<00:01:25.240> will<00:01:25.390> actually<00:01:25.570> work<00:01:25.929> for<00:01:25.990> any<00:01:26.380> type

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
and this will actually work for any type

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.270 
and this will actually work for any type
of<00:01:26.710> powder<00:01:27.130> product

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950 

and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.330> going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> take<00:01:33.750> some

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and then I'm just going to take some

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.690 
and then I'm just going to take some
rubbing<00:01:34.350> alcohol<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.400> pour

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
rubbing alcohol and I'm going to pour

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.399 
rubbing alcohol and I'm going to pour
some<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> higher<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
some of that in there and the higher the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.660 
some of that in there and the higher the
percentage<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.070> better<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:38.580> gonna

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
percentage the better it's just gonna

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.300 
percentage the better it's just gonna
make<00:01:38.760> it<00:01:39.060> dry<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.450> bit<00:01:39.690> faster<00:01:40.140> now<00:01:40.350> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
make it dry a little bit faster now you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
make it dry a little bit faster now you
don't<00:01:41.549> really<00:01:41.700> want<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.030> stoke<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.479> completely

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
don't really want to stoke it completely

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.090 
don't really want to stoke it completely
just<00:01:43.380> enough<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.180> all<00:01:45.330> at<00:01:45.780> least<00:01:46.560> wet<00:01:46.920> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
just enough to get it all at least wet I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.620 
just enough to get it all at least wet I
mean<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.400> really<00:01:47.520> doesn't<00:01:47.880> matter<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.420> put

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
mean it really doesn't matter if you put

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.969 
mean it really doesn't matter if you put
too<00:01:48.659> much<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.740> take<00:01:49.830> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
too much it's just going to take a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.070 
too much it's just going to take a
little<00:01:50.130> bit<00:01:50.340> longer<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.790> dry<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:51.420> I'm

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
little bit longer to dry and then I'm

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.510 
little bit longer to dry and then I'm
just<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.409> kind<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.800> over<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
just going to kind of go over it and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
just need to press really firmly so it

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.670 
just need to press really firmly so it
really<00:02:32.069> packs<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.150> there<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.500> paper

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
really packs it in there and the paper

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.979 
really packs it in there and the paper
towel<00:02:34.950> actually<00:02:35.430> helps<00:02:35.730> soak<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.360> excess

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
towel actually helps soak up that excess

towel actually helps soak up that excess
alcohol<00:02:37.680> also<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:39.299> after<00:02:39.570> you're<00:02:39.720> done<00:02:39.840> with

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
alcohol also so after you're done with

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.210 
alcohol also so after you're done with
that<00:02:40.049> you're<00:02:40.440> going<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.680> kind<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
that you're going to kind of have the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.800 
that you're going to kind of have the
pattern<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.850> paper<00:02:42.060> towel<00:02:42.360> or<00:02:42.480> whatever

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
pattern of the paper towel or whatever

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.500 
pattern of the paper towel or whatever
you<00:02:43.079> use<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.310> put<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:44.820> top<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.299> if<00:02:45.390> you

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
you use that you put on top so if you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.970 
you use that you put on top so if you
really<00:02:45.810> don't<00:02:45.959> like<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.799> all<00:02:46.950> you

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
really don't like that you can all you

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.680 
really don't like that you can all you
can<00:02:47.340> take<00:02:47.489> your<00:02:47.610> finger<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:47.970> kind<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.390> smooth

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
can take your finger and kind of smooth

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.750 
can take your finger and kind of smooth
it<00:02:48.870> out<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.320> there's<00:02:49.530> really<00:02:49.709> no<00:02:50.070> pattern<00:02:50.519> but

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
it out so there's really no pattern but

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.990 
it out so there's really no pattern but
I<00:02:50.790> mean<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.269> not<00:02:51.450> necessary<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.700> then<00:02:53.700> it's

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
I mean it's not necessary and then it's

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.180 
I mean it's not necessary and then it's
done<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.510> then<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:55.440> needs<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.920> dry

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
done and then it just needs to dry

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.520 
done and then it just needs to dry
completely<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.239> will<00:02:57.390> be<00:02:57.510> exactly<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
completely and it will be exactly the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:10.000 
completely and it will be exactly the
way<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.920> was<00:02:58.950> before<00:02:59.579> was<00:02:59.940> broken

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.979 

and<00:03:10.099> if<00:03:10.790> you're<00:03:10.939> like<00:03:11.090> me<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.599> have<00:03:11.780> some
