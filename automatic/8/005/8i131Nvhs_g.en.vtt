it<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.820> little<00:03:31.850> bit<00:03:32.180> sharper<00:03:33.280> make<00:03:34.280> sure<00:03:34.550> that

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
it a little bit sharper make sure that

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.520 
it a little bit sharper make sure that
you<00:03:34.850> blend<00:03:35.120> all<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.750> darker<00:03:36.110> products
