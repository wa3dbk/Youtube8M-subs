 and digital youtube community here 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.500
 scott up with a new video on the 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.330
 xbox when I 'll talk about the red ring 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.670
 of death a problem that has 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.429
 effected long ago but a lot 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.259
 time here information one of the 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.310
 serious problems that plagued the xbox 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:21.080
 360 is red ring of death this is not 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.200
 will affect the xbox one 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.210
 at least it is very unlikely asserts one 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.490
 of the maximum responsible of product 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.530
 of the redmond company according to microsoft 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.900
 the problems of overheating that 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.640
 they made an appearance in the xbox 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.310
 360 especially in the first 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.900
 Internal hardware releases do not 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.360
 are present in the new generation 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.220
 of consoles this problem generates a 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.620
 significant cost over current 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.100
 generation of consoles in 2008 had to 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.930
 invest 1,150 million dollars to 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.790
 claim defective consoles and 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.670
 replace them with models without problems 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.770
 and of course those problems did 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.329
 that Microsoft would probably lose a 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.600
 good handful of potential buyers 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.670
 kevin console of your micro crowder 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.990
 processor report confirmed grace 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.950
 affirmations of those responsible for 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.750
 microsoft 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.250
 it is considerably much less 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.259
 likely to produce the rings 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.329
 reds of death the past that 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.100
 it generated a lot of heat we had problems 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.649
 with the tics with the energy cycles and 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.479
 with its packaging in this case we can 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.159
 hope that development does not happen 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.869
 of the console has also been much more 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.720
 solid microsoft engineers 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.970
 accelerated the launch of the xbox 360 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.969
 to be able to compete in the market in 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.979
 2005 and lucid and have all guarantees 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.380
 that the architecture designed by and 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.299
 well it would behave without problems in the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.039
 case of the xbox one those engineers 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.530
 they will be able to access much more designs 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.299
 solid and tested today and have 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.890
 counted with many more guarantees for 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.500
 evaluate the behavior of the chips 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.450
 in working conditions but 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.069
 that will be all for this video if you liked it 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.509
 dale I like button here down like 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.090
