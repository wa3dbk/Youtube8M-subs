00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
right from the start that I had to do an

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.349 
right from the start that I had to do an
entire<00:00:43.329> episode<00:00:43.569> dedicated<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.739> vehicles

entire episode dedicated to vehicles

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.989 
entire episode dedicated to vehicles
it's<00:00:46.359> just<00:00:46.799> such<00:00:47.799> a<00:00:47.829> core<00:00:48.190> part<00:00:48.399> of<00:00:48.609> why<00:00:48.760> I<00:00:48.789> love

course<00:00:52.870> I<00:00:58.799> like<00:00:59.799> the<00:00:59.920> idea<00:01:00.039> of<00:01:00.309> taking<00:01:00.489> a

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
course I like the idea of taking a

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.489 
course I like the idea of taking a
familiar<00:01:01.149> real-world<00:01:01.659> place<00:01:02.139> like<00:01:02.469> a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
familiar real-world place like a

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.820 
familiar real-world place like a
driver's<00:01:03.010> education<00:01:03.239> training<00:01:04.239> course<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
driver's education training course and

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.820 
driver's education training course and
then<00:01:06.070> recreating<00:01:06.790> that<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.540> in<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.440> Halo

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
then recreating that in in the Halo

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:18.480 
then recreating that in in the Halo
universe<00:01:08.860> here<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:16.350> built<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.500> fairly<00:01:18.070> standard

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
universe here I built a fairly standard

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.110 
universe here I built a fairly standard
looking<00:01:19.090> course<00:01:19.480> but<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:20.740> course<00:01:21.430> Lauren

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
looking course but of course Lauren

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.590 
looking course but of course Lauren
being<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:23.200> kind<00:01:23.410> of<00:01:23.530> person<00:01:23.590> he<00:01:24.160> is<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.700> knew

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
being the kind of person he is I knew

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.040 
being the kind of person he is I knew
that<00:01:25.900> he<00:01:26.470> would<00:01:26.590> have<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.830> build<00:01:27.040> in<00:01:27.220> some<00:01:27.550> some

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
that he would have to build in some some

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.070 
that he would have to build in some some
obstacles<00:01:29.050> that<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.970> were<00:01:31.120> simply<00:01:31.510> unfair

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
obstacles that just were simply unfair

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.950 
obstacles that just were simply unfair
in<00:01:32.320> every<00:01:32.530> possible<00:01:32.770> way<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:34.360> part<00:01:34.720> of<00:01:34.780> why<00:01:34.930> I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
in every possible way it's part of why I

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.620 
in every possible way it's part of why I

up<00:01:48.790> in<00:01:49.150> a<00:01:49.510> series<00:01:49.870> of<00:01:49.900> funny<00:01:50.230> ways<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:51.240> so

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
up in a series of funny ways and so

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.149 
up in a series of funny ways and so
that's<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.540> was<00:01:52.780> part<00:01:53.050> of<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.320> part<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:53.920> what<00:01:54.130> I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
that's that was part of a part of what I

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.980 
that's that was part of a part of what I
found<00:01:54.400> so<00:01:54.580> funny<00:01:54.909> about<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.240> situation<00:01:55.450> is

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
found so funny about the situation is

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.390 
found so funny about the situation is
that<00:01:56.020> there's<00:01:56.409> absolutely<00:01:56.800> no<00:01:57.010> good<00:01:57.159> reason

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
that there's absolutely no good reason

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.399 
that there's absolutely no good reason
for<00:01:57.730> Warren<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.180> build<00:01:58.390> these<00:01:58.540> traps<00:01:58.900> and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
for Warren to build these traps and

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.200 
for Warren to build these traps and
there's<00:01:59.560> also<00:01:59.710> no<00:02:00.040> good<00:02:00.220> reason<00:02:00.400> for<00:02:00.700> Cobra<00:02:01.090> to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
there's also no good reason for Cobra to

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.700 
there's also no good reason for Cobra to
keep<00:02:01.450> trying<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.870> drive<00:02:02.080> around<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.470> course

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
keep trying to drive around the course

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.440 
keep trying to drive around the course
but<00:02:03.070> he<00:02:03.640> he<00:02:04.330> keeps<00:02:04.600> going<00:02:04.930> anyway

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.180 

this<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.690> probably<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.410> most<00:02:10.710> complicated

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
this was probably the most complicated

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.680 
this was probably the most complicated

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
depending on each individual shot lots

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.180 
depending on each individual shot lots
of<00:02:38.430> pan<00:02:38.700> into<00:02:39.060> lots<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.540> situations<00:02:39.720> where<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
of pan into lots of situations where the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.950 
of pan into lots of situations where the
character<00:02:41.580> who's<00:02:41.760> speaking<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.360> moving

character who's speaking is moving

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.960 
character who's speaking is moving
across<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.350> screen<00:02:43.770> from<00:02:44.160> left<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.490> right<00:02:44.610> so

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
across the screen from left to right so

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.790 
across the screen from left to right so
I<00:02:45.030> had<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.210> make<00:02:45.300> sure<00:02:45.360> their<00:02:45.720> voice<00:02:45.930> match

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
I had to make sure their voice match

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.560 
I had to make sure their voice match
that<00:02:47.160> pan<00:02:49.490> now<00:02:50.490> some<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.940> traps<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.360> built

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
that pan now some of the traps I built

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.050 
that pan now some of the traps I built
into<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.140> into<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:52.980> training<00:02:53.490> course<00:02:53.670> here

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
into this into this training course here

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.190 
into this into this training course here
are<00:02:54.330> set<00:02:54.690> on<00:02:54.720> timers<00:02:55.410> for<00:02:56.120> example<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.630> these

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
are set on timers for example this these

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.330 
are set on timers for example this these
fusion<00:02:58.590> coils<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.010> fall<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.430> Cobra<00:03:00.420> here<00:03:00.630> I

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
fusion coils that fall on Cobra here I

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.060 
fusion coils that fall on Cobra here I
built<00:03:02.340> them<00:03:02.520> unto<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.300> set<00:03:03.750> spawn<00:03:04.350> timer<00:03:04.770> in

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
built them unto a set spawn timer in

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.030 
built them unto a set spawn timer in
forge<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.510> when<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:06.900> was<00:03:07.080> filming<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.740> had<00:03:07.920> to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
forge so when I was filming I had to

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.890 
forge so when I was filming I had to
position<00:03:08.280> Cobra<00:03:08.880> where<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.120> needed<00:03:09.510> him<00:03:09.660> and

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
position Cobra where I needed him and

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.850 
position Cobra where I needed him and
then<00:03:09.990> wash<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.230> clock<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.750> start<00:03:12.750> acting<00:03:13.410> at

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
then wash the clock and start acting at

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.190 
then wash the clock and start acting at
the<00:03:13.980> scene<00:03:14.190> at<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.489> right<00:03:14.670> time<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.690> when

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
the scene at the right time so that when

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.160 
the scene at the right time so that when
the<00:03:16.320> clock<00:03:16.590> hit<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.860> certain<00:03:17.160> moment<00:03:18.170> Cobra

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
the clock hit a certain moment Cobra

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.470 
the clock hit a certain moment Cobra
would<00:03:19.320> be<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.530> position<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.160> ready<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:21.300> hit

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
would be in position and ready to to hit

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.020 
would be in position and ready to to hit
the<00:03:21.600> trap<00:03:22.250> similar<00:03:23.250> situation<00:03:23.760> with<00:03:23.790> this

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
the trap similar situation with this

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.540 
the trap similar situation with this
kill<00:03:24.270> ball<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:24.840> that's<00:03:25.140> set<00:03:25.350> on<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.500> timer<00:03:26.340> as

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
kill ball here that's set on a timer as

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.620 
kill ball here that's set on a timer as
well<00:03:27.980> as<00:03:28.980> some<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.370> other<00:03:29.550> traps<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.239> this

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
well as some of the other traps in this

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.699 
well as some of the other traps in this
in<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:31.320> environment<00:03:31.880> for<00:03:32.880> example<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.709> sum

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
in this environment for example the sum

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.920 
in this environment for example the sum
of<00:03:34.860> these<00:03:35.040> traffic<00:03:35.850> cones<00:03:36.090> actually<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.750> have

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
of these traffic cones actually you have

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.110 
of these traffic cones actually you have
fuel<00:03:37.200> barriers<00:03:37.560> built<00:03:37.830> into<00:03:38.160> them<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.940> by

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
fuel barriers built into them so by

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.850 
fuel barriers built into them so by
driving<00:03:39.420> over<00:03:39.780> them<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.050> will<00:03:40.230> automatically

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
driving over them you will automatically

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.160 
driving over them you will automatically
explode<00:03:41.400> this<00:03:42.300> one<00:03:42.540> here<00:03:42.840> there's<00:03:43.110> a

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
explode this one here there's a

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.199 
explode this one here there's a
teleporter<00:03:43.950> field<00:03:44.220> built<00:03:44.519> into<00:03:44.820> that<00:03:44.850> cone

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
teleporter field built into that cone

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.300 
teleporter field built into that cone
there<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:45.810> driving<00:03:46.260> over<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.530> really<00:03:46.830> does<00:03:46.980> war

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
there so driving over it really does war

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.810 
there so driving over it really does war
p<00:03:47.459> out<00:03:47.580> into<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.030> middle<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.480> ocean<00:03:48.600> here

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.009 

that<00:03:53.820> was<00:03:53.910> one<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.090> my<00:03:54.180> favorite<00:03:54.540> shots<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.959> the

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
that was one of my favorite shots in the

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.650 
that was one of my favorite shots in the
whole<00:03:55.170> episode<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.890> was<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:56.330> one<00:03:57.330> came<00:03:57.480> out

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
whole episode that was that one came out

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.100 
whole episode that was that one came out
really<00:03:57.810> well

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.290 

this<00:04:04.110> final<00:04:04.440> trap<00:04:04.830> that<00:04:04.860> cobra<00:04:05.460> runs<00:04:05.670> into<00:04:06.060> is

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
this final trap that cobra runs into is

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.950 
this final trap that cobra runs into is
another<00:04:06.840> example<00:04:06.990> where<00:04:07.590> I<00:04:08.420> went<00:04:09.420> in<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.600> forge

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
another example where I went in to forge

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.630 
another example where I went in to forge
and<00:04:10.230> created<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.650> whole<00:04:10.860> bunch<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.160> landmines

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
and created a whole bunch of landmines

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.700 
and created a whole bunch of landmines
and<00:04:12.030> set<00:04:12.630> them<00:04:12.780> all<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.050> spawn<00:04:13.320> into<00:04:13.530> the

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
and set them all to spawn into the

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.920 
and set them all to spawn into the
environment<00:04:13.950> at<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.370> certain<00:04:14.580> time<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.300> I<00:04:15.720> just

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
environment at a certain time so I just

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.900 
environment at a certain time so I just
had<00:04:16.050> to<00:04:16.110> get<00:04:16.350> him<00:04:16.560> there<00:04:16.800> act<00:04:17.190> out<00:04:17.550> the<00:04:17.700> scene

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
had to get him there act out the scene

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.880 
had to get him there act out the scene
between<00:04:18.180> him<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:18.690> Warren<00:04:19.050> and<00:04:19.500> then<00:04:19.650> wait<00:04:19.860> for

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
between him and Warren and then wait for

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.000 
between him and Warren and then wait for
the<00:04:20.130> clock<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.550> run<00:04:20.700> down<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:22.530> resulting

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
the clock to run down and the resulting

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.520 
the clock to run down and the resulting
explosion<00:04:23.340> was<00:04:23.880> ten<00:04:24.630> times<00:04:24.930> better<00:04:25.170> than<00:04:25.320> I

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
explosion was ten times better than I

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.930 
explosion was ten times better than I
could<00:04:25.710> have<00:04:25.800> hoped<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:26.280> one<00:04:26.490> worked<00:04:26.790> out

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
could have hoped that one worked out

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:35.630 
could have hoped that one worked out
really<00:04:27.330> well<00:04:31.400> in<00:04:32.400> this<00:04:32.610> final<00:04:33.120> scene<00:04:33.390> here<00:04:34.640> the

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
really well in this final scene here the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.040 
really well in this final scene here the
episode<00:04:35.910> of<00:04:36.150> course<00:04:36.330> ends<00:04:36.630> on<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.750> cliffhanger

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
episode of course ends on a cliffhanger

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.350 
episode of course ends on a cliffhanger
with<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.040> Warren<00:04:38.850> staring<00:04:39.420> up<00:04:39.600> at<00:04:40.760> some<00:04:41.760> object

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
on Cobra and it looked funny but I

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.960 
on Cobra and it looked funny but I
decided<00:04:58.170> to<00:04:58.440> cut<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:58.800> out<00:04:58.920> because<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.400> just

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
decided to cut it out because I just

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.170 
decided to cut it out because I just
kind<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.240> liked<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.600> idea<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:01.970> leaving<00:05:02.970> that

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
kind of liked the idea of leaving that

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.640 
kind of liked the idea of leaving that
little<00:05:03.600> bit<00:05:03.720> hanging<00:05:04.110> there<00:05:04.290> we've<00:05:04.500> already

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
little bit hanging there we've already

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.950 
little bit hanging there we've already
seen<00:05:05.040> Cobra<00:05:05.490> get<00:05:05.640> blown<00:05:05.880> up<00:05:05.910> so<00:05:06.300> many<00:05:06.420> times<00:05:06.570> in

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960

this<00:05:07.080> episode<00:05:07.350> I<00:05:07.740> thought<00:05:07.980> that<00:05:08.190> adding<00:05:08.580> one

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
this episode I thought that adding one

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.720 
this episode I thought that adding one
more<00:05:09.470> didn't<00:05:10.470> really<00:05:10.620> bring<00:05:11.160> anything<00:05:11.400> new<00:05:11.550> to

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
more didn't really bring anything new to

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.540 
more didn't really bring anything new to
the<00:05:12.030> episode<00:05:12.300> so<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:13.290> left<00:05:13.920> it<00:05:14.070> on<00:05:14.130> that<00:05:14.340> a

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
the episode so I left it on that a

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.830 
the episode so I left it on that a
little<00:05:14.760> bit<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:15.030> a<00:05:15.090> cliffhanger<00:05:15.360> there

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
little bit of a cliffhanger there

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.600 
little bit of a cliffhanger there
thought<00:05:16.110> it<00:05:16.200> was<00:05:16.290> more<00:05:16.470> funny<00:05:16.710> being<00:05:17.040> unseen

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
thought it was more funny being unseen

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.100 
thought it was more funny being unseen
