00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.609
 grow my friends 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.469
 shamov dmitry with you now i am 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.580
 to reach for in the middle of the sea 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.530
 certainly not very far from the coast but 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.139
 still you can see here 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.260
 such a special platform we are here 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.750
 arrived on a special ship such 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.449
 fishing vessel to catch here 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.220
 the fish just came for fishing 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.059
 what type of fishing exists in japan 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.210
 can see another country people too 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.370
 they catch and this road is concrete 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.559
 just in the middle of the sea it does not lead to anywhere 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.700
 you can only get to the shore 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.129
 on the ship and he is there in the distance you see by 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.090
 and ship 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.090
 Mickey catches here too 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.100
 Necker of that color 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.460
 unlike crayfish you can fish here 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:21.130
 here in this sea you can catch an octopus 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.899
 then you became the scad of the scad you and the fish 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.700
 then another different japanese fish i'm not 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.229
 I understand this very much therefore 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.390
 I can not say for sure but in principle 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.280
 a lot of different types here 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.899
 to catch 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:40.060
 jellyfish were also swimming here recently 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.619
 of course there is no reason to catch them 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:49.310
 in the distance some kind of industrial area like 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:53.060
 I understand and in principle is capable of 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.830
 there is nothing right now about 6-20 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:01.039
 6:30 am dawn is already 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.170
 here we came yet there were 5 legs 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:06.110
 the ship departs 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.590
 just before five o'clock he is far away 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.819
 see something like a ship too 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.260
 probably fishing well and basically here 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.209
 so here is this place enough 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.480
 I am now appeasing 5 times 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.260
 fishing that is possible 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.799
 getting out 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.040
 with mickey with his father gradually reaching 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.129
 this art today is nothing yet 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.400
 caught but hopefully meeting once and or 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:40.730
 tonight later something will work out 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.290
 catch help now I threw the bait 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.920
 probably 50 times already 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:52.819
 and so far nothing caught my own 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:57.200
 fishing rod and coffee bottle coffee too 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:01.310
 become show if interested here such 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:06.739
 here's a regular black coffee costs 130 there 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.370
 yen around the store here is enough 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:17.950
 cold plus is blown from both sides 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.950
 so I'm a little cold even 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.880
 catch so sometimes hard to do 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.410
 short breaks about 50 times 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:33.900
 I usually throw further and give a little 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:37.560
 rest and catch again if you come in 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.620
 Japan try to go at least once 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.720
 fishing because i think where anyway 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.790
 different from what is in Russia and 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.670
 principle 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.530
 Japan fishing she is such enough 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.910
 interesting because here you can 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.170
 see how the rest of the usual Japanese 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:00.890
 how do they behave in everyday life 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.569
 here and comes from children and wives 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.250
 that is how you see alcohol too 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.860
 nobody drinks because everyone is here 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.850
 come by car and come back then 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.340
 by car so here itâ€™s really only 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:20.729
 fishing in principle here is not particularly 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:24.090
 rest as you see I hope that 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:26.910
 the video was quite interesting though 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.190
 small if you manage to catch something 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.820
 or something interesting show i 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.100
 be sure to take off a little later sky 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.760
 now it has become very beautiful and in general 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.080
 quite beautiful in general has become all 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.910
