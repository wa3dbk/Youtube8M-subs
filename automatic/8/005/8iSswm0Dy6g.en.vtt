00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
the jet mass cycle was over my cycle for

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.540 
the jet mass cycle was over my cycle for
creatine<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.920> I'm<00:00:10.920> impressed<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.460> the

been<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> great<00:00:19.470> eight<00:00:19.680> weeks<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.340> worked<00:00:20.939> out

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
been a great eight weeks I worked out

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.550 
been a great eight weeks I worked out
hard<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.630> feel<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.050> helps<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.289> recover

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
hard I feel like it helps you recover

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.769 
hard I feel like it helps you recover
faster<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> jet<00:00:24.150> mass<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.630> get

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
faster and it's the jet mass so we get

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.200 
faster and it's the jet mass so we get
the<00:00:24.869> ball

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.900 

I<00:00:31.240> also<00:00:31.779> started<00:00:32.110> taking<00:00:32.529> jet<00:00:32.739> fuse<00:00:33.100> in<00:00:33.489> AU<00:00:33.670> X

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
I also started taking jet fuse in AU X

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.390 
I also started taking jet fuse in AU X
and<00:00:34.300> it's<00:00:34.570> a<00:00:34.750> pre-workout<00:00:35.140> it<00:00:35.950> helps<00:00:36.220> a<00:00:36.280> lot

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
and it's a pre-workout it helps a lot

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.360 
and it's a pre-workout it helps a lot
too<00:00:36.690> I'm<00:00:37.690> about<00:00:37.930> building<00:00:38.380> muscle<00:00:38.559> or<00:00:39.160> whatnot

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
too I'm about building muscle or whatnot

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.569 
too I'm about building muscle or whatnot
with<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.910> jet<00:00:40.629> fuse<00:00:40.930> but<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.440> helps<00:00:41.650> you<00:00:41.800> have

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
with the jet fuse but it helps you have

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.910 
with the jet fuse but it helps you have
more<00:00:42.820> stamina<00:00:43.570> throughout<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.290> workout<00:00:44.650> and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
more stamina throughout the workout and

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.100 
more stamina throughout the workout and
you<00:00:45.489> recover<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.910> lot<00:00:46.120> faster<00:00:46.180> between<00:00:46.629> sets

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
you recover a lot faster between sets

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.689 
you recover a lot faster between sets
but<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:47.920> jet<00:00:48.190> masked-man

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
but the jet masked-man

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.960
