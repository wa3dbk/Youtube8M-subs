00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.309
 «People turn to Matze who got so many requests that I 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.309
 but once again to make goals again what are you upset 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.029
 on the videos associations and I also like to do 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.820
 and I just thought because I have not done a tutorial for a long time either 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.699
 have 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.050
 sometimes Reithofer 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.909
 new tutorial 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.909
 and life enjoy the video 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.600
 Euro Vol at 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.780
 the Adidas Kunert has no idea the zoos are going through and some players 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.970
 return 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.399
 A simple trick explains how hard and fast 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.019
 quickly two cash registers reproduced jersey 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.659
 You know if you keep pushed when we lure to demand store 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.370
 or forward makes it easy to lure 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.070
 l2 hold down and stand with right stick from below all were 72 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.520
 Turn degree to the left or turn 102 90 degrees to the right 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.390
 Yes 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.390
 Würzburg really say that 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.540
 is 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.340
 Century ago 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.150
 So, nice core, SuS will now be five star players as possible 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 that is the Leon 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.189
 and year the get back to the l2 Foster 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.109
 since then the team is wearing and 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.320
 we're doing a miss that is 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.430
 that we hold the l2 Trust in Cloud and then Fierek third and direct 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.550
 after that x 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.960
 Borussia is best sorry for four contexts 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.460
 first talk and then it works so I also paints first circle and Alex AR 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.270
 I dance more easily Piet and then nothing 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.339
 St SID 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:18.619
 Just pick where we keep the White House to 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:20.769
 the thief 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.559
 Soros 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:28.409
 and the ESO quickly declared as another goal hold down when we 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.589
 Run forward to see the right one 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.609
 he was and us if you stained 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.019
 very easily 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.989
 simply cool 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.349
 and 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.349
 p 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:50.219
 worked out Bremen where was a bit harder problem 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:55.499
 Munich where one gave yes one percent the right scene after investigation 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:56.959
 must give 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.549
 here you have to also a shortcoming in the hike also times alma mater below 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.089
 only Chrome shortly after half past eight euros that looks like that 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.789
 and 7 the title was about to happen 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:16.789
 and then again on the body 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.559
 What 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:24.549
 The Bravo David we do when we present the ball 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.849
 and in the course of the stop want to be elegant manner 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:37.459
 So cheaper are far ahead as you've already shown entertain Darnell 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.629
 Elz 2 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.919
 Then kicked under Filed under and counter movement rose in the 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.180
 opposite direction that means if I now run from the front Willibald 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.949
 set before 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:52.449
 and then l 2 as confesses plus x and 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.489
 in the opposite direction, so to speak, down 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.589
 and not four commission at the same time he should drive and then nothing comes that 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:05.339
 square my stomach and then slide directly onto Beck's 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.759
 and then that is the only way to be stopped 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.759
 d 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.249
 The banging heard we hold a 2 and put the right kick Federer without 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:21.430
 to the left or in October in comparison to the part itself short 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.990
 why it was long ago 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.990
 and there and right 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.770
 p 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.409
 we have what 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.749
 Conclude one more a very popular one 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.550
 The holiday can be very many 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.159
 is 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.159
 and there are many variants how to do that 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.180
 Most municipalities in the back carries 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.370
 but the simplest option is the ticket percentage 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.939
 under it were 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.369
 we think as if overflowed left like to go to the gate 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:05.020
 and 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.719
 more 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:12.110
 «Move we move faster to the right and births was there once 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.110
 short rectangle

 the hocus-pocus ots - in the beginning a bit hard Aabar victory not here 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.479
 Baues started holding Elz 2 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.710
 and against it set up DEK 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.960
 clockwise from the right 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.870
 once made wings and then directly opposite ocean are again 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:37.870
 just 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.870
 you have to see it that way 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.809
 that was
