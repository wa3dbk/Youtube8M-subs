00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello welcome to this which is the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.850
 summary of the video analysis of the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.770
 technology news from the nation's 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.750
 this week as always there was a 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.570
 lots of things here we're going to rescue what 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.360
 that touches us most closely this week 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.820
 there were at least two important ones to 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.859
 gods the first the bill gates that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.080
 he retired after more than three decades 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.250
 because he founded with polar in the company 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.560
 microsoft in 1975 retired almost by 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.840
 full of this company which makes 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.579
 windows office and others is doing 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.219
 only once a week 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.440
 office and in redmon at headquarters 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.980
 on the microsoft campus and the rest of the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 he's going to dedicate it, he said 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.790
 charitable organization that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.370
 has with his wife with melinda 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.730
 this perhaps indicates that computing in 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.550
 general is about to change 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.950
 bill gates view a long time ago when 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.570
 almost nobody saw it that was ever going to 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.150
 see a computer on each desk and 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.870
 in each home and it was right and this is the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.640
 reason for his immense wealth he has is 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.979
 the largest shareholder of majors that has 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.290
 about 87 percent of the 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.630
 microsoft shares this is something like this 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.430
 like 58 billion dollars is no longer 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.009
 the richest man in the world there is already a 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.410
 rich couple richer than him but without 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.880
 doubt guessed right in that first vision perhaps 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.320
 his retirement has to do with the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.090
 charity but perhaps also have 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.040
 to see what he sees that the cycle where 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.520
 a company like mike especially 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.860
 powerful begins to fade and 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.690
 it's just going to be in other things in 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.150
 every case was a man who has changed 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.820
 the way we do 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.980
 almost everything that we used to do in 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.860
 an office or entertainment in the 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.040
 home or games and so on there was also 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.280
 a god is the goddess xp xp today is left 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.690
 of selling in the weekend came a 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.040
 note where all this is explained but 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.730
 basically what happens today is that 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.920
 stop selling 'microsoft to the great 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.350
 computer manufacturers the windows 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.710
 xp can no longer be bought in cash and without 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.619
 However, they will have until January 2009 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.480
 the integrators the clones those that 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.190
 they make computers without marks they go 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.709
 to be able to continue selling equipment 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.050
 Find out about that topic because this has 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.130
 what to do with the class of the system 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.740
 operative that you are going to have in your 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.550
 computer besides all this bad 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.920
 news 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.200
 Turkish hackers attacked the sites 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.230
 nothing less than the authorities that 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.260
 dedicate to establishing what name and what 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.030
 number have the sites on the internet to 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.160
 those same sites and they put up a poster 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.540
 now you are seeing where you say 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.280
 they believe they control the sites 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.080
 we control them there are the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.790
 hackers doing theirs but without 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.420
 doubt the control structure of 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.060
 address 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.060
 of all kinds of web mails and others is 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.739
 quite fragile enough this leaves it 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.090
 perfectly demonstrated these 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.010
 organizations have not done 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.349
 still comment at least until the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.110
 close of this video and a good 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.850
 kreisler had the idea to start selling 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.790
 an accessory that will be able to convert 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.100
 the cars of your brand both and others in 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.630
 a kind of place hotspot where 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.880
 you have internet access actually 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.100
 it's about a telephone service 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.480
 cellular with internet that integrates the 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.940
 car in such a way that if you there 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.470
 you have some device that has 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.489
 possibility to connect via wifi to 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.489
 you can do it
