00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.390
 it's France's wish 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.939
 before these two models 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.759
 in any case it is first of all war 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.349
 he was 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.919
 a few steps if it was a moment 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.409
 the tiny in the coming days 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.169
 meanwhile 500 billion square meters 955 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.509
 it is already the wonder is amazing because we could not see it after 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.659
 many things 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:29.249
 just like on the real ones 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.970
 I discovered with artists only shot 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.190
 district 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.950
 witness his departure 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.920
 the basic rules 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.920
 a space at this level there is no risk exists 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.680
 the possibilities are limitless 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.160
 it must be said that we can see things 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.560
 we need to go faster 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.270
 moreover his luck 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.430
 extraordinary power of change 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.150
 at the slaughterhouse of 1 6% 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.860
 benoÃ®t lavoie the canvas 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.860
 winston 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.150
 as far as they are concerned 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.150
 who knows how to adapt 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 tom clancy 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.510
 today advise 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 we are facing a game 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.580
 I'm never satisfied 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.940
 these last months 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.880
 it's a pretty long place 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.680
 the sunday telegraph 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.900
 first because the style evokes also suffered damage 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.550
 as a result of what happens in a gallery and then because the 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.550
 artists are exposed and the same 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.030
 for me it was going to happen an ovation in paris 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.970
 it's the security side of the organization 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.330
 here it is 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.670
 it is a beautiful place very slightly improved 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.570
 place of the city hall of paris 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 - range 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.300
 box of this note 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.640
 to be able to realize 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.640
 lily 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.209
 otherwise the train station 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.629
 jules-grare galleries are often affected in the world according to him 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.849
 that's when it's advertised 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.989
 and then if we managed to make a place that is 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.669
 the evolutionary creative 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.849
 polymorphous 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.129
 the terrible did not experience announced that it is going well 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.919
 a gallery is the harvest of the walls with artefacts 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.589
 the skier freeride the gallerists and that's a wonderful thing because 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.449
 it's bluff 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:37.599
 that is, to wear it 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.599
 still today this way 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.219
 as each time artists united behind us on civil society 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.869
 it's really the world 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.219
 even if we are a pleasure for me 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.359
 to a month of trouble and the estimated 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.769
 having made known 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.469
 daniel allain it's a beautiful story 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.469
 because it's a flavor 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.659
 very nice evening I am delighted 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.659
 in his answer in this article 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.499
 and that-c 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:33.699
 it also appears that his age 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:38.839
 extraordinary novel woman character or film character always 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.649
 doing things at once 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.649
 in love with the full of projects on the alert 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.579
 I open the long vacuum of doubt 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.389
 the disappointment is 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.889
 the csss 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.109
 anais not at all concerned 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.339
 this year it does not pass 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:59.219
 for 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.819
 I made a computer model 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.039
 he's here as elsewhere it's very surprising and obvious that the team 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.800
 exchange 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.119
 in his statement 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:10.119
 So here is holland at the back of their body of water 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.169
 but here too 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.489
 me too original 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.269
 if ever that 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.490
 the Internet 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.099
 to the federal police 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.360
 but at the same time she has this kind of 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.319
 what way 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:32.039
 maybe the feeling of victory 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.919
 while wanting to be 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.110
 she had to do finally I do not know 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.529
 this je-ne-sais-quoi 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.469
 on not bad to see young people this voice against 28% by his side so that 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:44.469
 can express himself 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.800
 serenity 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.230
 call them answers m
