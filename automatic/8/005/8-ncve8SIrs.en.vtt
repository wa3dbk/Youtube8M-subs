00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:09.799
 I am posting a gunpla production video It is gunpla 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.799
 I would like to get into the production of Wing Gundam's arm part this time 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.810
 This is part of Wing Gundam's arm though 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.360
 I will hear both arms so 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.060
 etc 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:32.329
 The parts are so small that it is really real graze 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:37.129
 There are a lot of parts so small, so it 's pretty black for cutting out 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:39.460
 So as always we would like to do from violets using here inking paint 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.460
 I'm sorry 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.230
 me 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.770
 tm 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:20.820
 As 3 cars were completed, I think that I want to apply a matte spray here 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 Clean play is dry , so I would like to color by design massage 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.340
 Hmm 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.350
 had 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.700
 Since coloring with Yutaringuba is also completed, I would like to assemble it . 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.770
 ben ten 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.770
 pa 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.220
 I took it 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.260
 me 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.260
 Hmm 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.880
 Parts of arms of Wing Gundam 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.880
 It was completed 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:04.930
 Or it is a fairly simple mechanism, but after all parts are pretty small 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:09.609
 The assembly itself was quite difficult 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:11.330
 It is this red part that was a bit dangerous, but this place to be attached 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.100
 Hey school 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.500
 It's vacant gap 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:21.860
 If you look at it here, that's a bit of a gap, or something like this, the park has come in 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.010
 No I felt like Although this Deetto 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.490
 but ok it's state 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:32.080
 Well , that's when I assembled this 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.270
 Though I thought that I could not enter , I tried to stab to the end 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.270
 Oh anymore 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.420
 If you look at the manual often enough, it's ok in this state, so it's good not to force it 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:47.670
 It is 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:54.009
 I think that maybe I had broken the parts if I put it in forcibly without noticing this 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:56.600
 It was dangerous I think that it was good to review the manual of that child or 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:01.130
 It is such a part of people part 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:05.540
 It's a design divided into 3 posts, but this is a very small part 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.900
 But it is firmly divided into three and assembled 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:13.280
 So I also have a little bit 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:16.020
 Such place is truly in the clean of'll agent containing the design 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:24.020
 It's a real grade. 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:24.020
 So next time because both arms was completed in the stomach would like to manufacture the parts of the portion of the head
