00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.460
 greetings and welcome all my name is 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.320
 Raquel This is the design of nail art 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.590
 in which we will be working now 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.779
 let's start the first thing I did is that I 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.300
 apply this wayne wild enamel that 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.470
 it's called private the wind on all my 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.420
 girl 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.280
 after applying this enamel 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.320
 I'm painting a French design 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.019
 I'm starting to paint the line of 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.699
 smile of my French design and now 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.629
 nothing else I will fill in the part of 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.160
 up with a white color below the 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.900
 video I will list all the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.409
 tools that I used for this 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.409
 design 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.350
 above my French design I'm 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.350
 applying a glaze with bright highlights 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.500
 to prepare my brush the submerged in 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.510
 water and now I remove the excess and this 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.479
 makes the tip of the brush remain 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.550
 good planet now dips half in 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.369
 the color red and the other half in the 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.830
 white color I'm going to go over my little plate 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.229
 several times I always show you this 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.450
 step because it 's very important because 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.119
 helps the brush is well 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.250
 loaded and also so that there is a 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.259
 smooth transition between the two colors 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.360
 that they chose then continue 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.350
 doing this until they see that it is 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.570
 well loaded your brush 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.930
 I'll start by painting the petal of my flower 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.580
 from the center and I'm doing the coming 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.420
 towards given because it's going to be an average 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.340
 flower nothing more and there was the first 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.770
 petal for the second petal I'm going to 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.200
 do it coming to the side I'm 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.080
 rounding a little bit and for the third 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.130
 petal here tape a little with my hand 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.649
 Excuse me, but I'm doing 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.680
 basically the same thing for my third 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.810
 petal for the opposite side more towards 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.060
 up I decided to make another half flower and 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.970
 I'm doing basically the same thing 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.680
 following the same pattern and the same 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.680
 technique to paint my flower 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.200
 in the center of your two flowers use 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.750
 a green color and nothing else with pure 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.370
 minced add the color above 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.370
 from this add white dots 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.360
 Now let's outline each one of the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.130
 petals using a white color and 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.800
 remember to do the same steps 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.620
 for the two flowers followed by this I'm going 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.770
 to make two curved lines the first 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.020
 will be longer than the second in the 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.150
 top flower I will make one more limited 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.390
 now it's time to make a limit of 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.080
 little white dots going down and 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.880
 another going up and that's all 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.340
 that's how they're going to achieve this design of 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.290
 Nail Art Swims Apply from your coat 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.840
 of transparent brightness to seal well 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.760
 design hope you enjoyed 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.100
 this video and have this design done 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.239
 thank you very much and see you for the 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.239
 next goodbye
