well<00:00:30.630> first<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.170> all<00:00:31.230> let<00:00:31.619> me<00:00:31.650> show<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.920> what

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
well first of all let me show you what

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.700 
well first of all let me show you what
this<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:36.140> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.410> pro<00:00:37.800> 7<00:00:38.480> synthesis<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.780> in

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
this is this is pro 7 synthesis and in

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.850 
this is this is pro 7 synthesis and in
my<00:00:41.040> theory<00:00:41.840> it's<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> best<00:00:43.230> protein<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
my theory it's the best protein of a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.940 
my theory it's the best protein of a
mate<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.370> mean<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.660> hot<00:00:45.870> patent<00:00:46.260> pro<00:00:46.440> protein

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
mate I mean it's hot patent pro protein

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.810 
mate I mean it's hot patent pro protein
34<00:00:47.730> grams<00:00:48.000> per<00:00:48.239> serving<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.960> doesn't<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.410> any

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
34 grams per serving it doesn't have any

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.119 
34 grams per serving it doesn't have any
soy<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.780> love<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.350> stuff<00:00:52.620> man<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
soy in it so I love this stuff man a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.610 
soy in it so I love this stuff man a
little<00:00:53.789> bit<00:00:54.030> i<00:00:54.390> die<00:00:54.780> by<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.469> i<00:00:55.649> kill<00:00:56.550> over<00:00:56.850> it

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
little bit i die by it i kill over it

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.420 
little bit i die by it i kill over it
but<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.980> expensive<00:00:59.370> it<00:01:00.149> costs<00:01:00.359> us<00:01:00.629> $64<00:01:01.469> $65

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
but it's expensive it costs us $64 $65

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.380 
but it's expensive it costs us $64 $65
and<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.629> think<00:01:04.110> I'll<00:01:04.260> read<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.820> nutria<00:01:06.150> shop
