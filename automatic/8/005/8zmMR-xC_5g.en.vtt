00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.559
 do not forget January favorites and so 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.110
 we are practically at the end of 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.740
 February but well I guess it's better 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.289
 late that are never five things in 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.970
 do it in plan top 5 I do not know if all the 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.250
 I'll be able to do it like that for months 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.989
 at least I will try and nothing I hope 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.189
 that interests you and you stay to see the 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.260
 video 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.930
 I'm going to start with my favorite lipstick 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.170
 month of January that is you and others that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.449
 It's the New York Apple 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.679
 and the ones taught in some video is this 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.679
 So beautiful tone from here 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.420
 It's a dull red with 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.150
 a certain shade of pink does not look like 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.130
 Starlets pink is a beautiful whole 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.530
 I love for me is the 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.010
 the perfect red for day to day is a 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.140
 very very beautiful color very wearable and the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.490
 it's true that I'm in love this 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.490
 life and he used it very much 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.579
 also for lips I will continue with 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.579
 this peel lip peeling 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.840
 which is great to come back 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.119
 a caramel has a smell that we go is 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.390
 one last and good is a peeling that 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.240
 It has some small granules that help 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.090
 to exfoliate the lips very gently 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.850
 the truth is not not an aggressive peeling 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.049
 I think it's great because during the whole month 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.250
 January the truth is that I had the 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:50.000
 pretty dry lips streaks then 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.690
 this has gone to me we go perfect 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.790
 it's my head 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.920
 my color this the favorite during the month 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.880
 of January is certainly this one here is the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.600
 Mauve is also a peach pink tone 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.730
 very very nice and good despite being 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.340
 very clearly the truth is that pigments a 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.149
 heap 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.149
 for what 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.709
 it's a beautiful tone and I tell you very 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.330
 pigmented cheat enough for what 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.910
 clarito that is 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.480
 precious of those blushes that are worth 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.640
 for any light for day to day 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.840
 I already tell you I love this coloring and 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.840
 what used a lot 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.879
 as a foundation of makeup the one that 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.280
 been using is the studio fix 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.530
 fluid theme that is the tone in the c 15 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.180
 true for the voice but I'm a little bit 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:49.459
 constipated and it shows good is the tone nc 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.879
 15 and it's a pretty opaque base but 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:56.189
 It was also a month my skin fitfully 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.530
 I had many imperfections many 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.180
 granites then this base the truth is 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.370
 I came in very handy because it covers a lot 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.500
 but by itself I could not use it 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.370
 so I was mixing it with the face 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.060
 and body 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.129
 put a layer of the studio fix with the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.860
 shell sponge to stay 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.569
 more integrated in the face and then a 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.920
 small layer of the face and body in 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.560
 practically all the face except the 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.510
 nose is the area where I get 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.879
 shines and good and with this gone pulling 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.099
 and finally another foundation 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:38.540
 this time compact of him for those 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:41.879
 days that you have skin especially 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.560
 well and you do not feel like makeup 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.879
 good been using a lot these 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.400
 powders that the truth is that I had you 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.590
 abandoned in a drawer 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.409
 you know how worn out they are but I was 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.319
 months that I did not remember them is the 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:58.390
 porcelain tone 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.880
 and Well 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.520
 this is being used a lot already 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.560
 I say despite being a make-up on 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.230
 dust that usually does not cover much 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.920
 these powders cover the skin enough 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.430
 but they do not leave 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.519
 the face with that dusty finish does not 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.650
 they stay very nice if they are used in your 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.840
 just measure and the truth is that for 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.060
 those days that you get up you put on 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.780
 Powder mascara colors and 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.150
 list 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.220
 and well so far my favorites of 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.990
 january I hope you liked it 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.010
