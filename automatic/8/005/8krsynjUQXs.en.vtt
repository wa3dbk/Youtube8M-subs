Acme cars it comes with Lee ready to run
vehicles<00:00:50.870> it's<00:00:51.870> basically<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.949> very<00:00:53.699> most

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
vehicles it's basically the very most

basic greater you can get for these sort
of<00:00:57.149> cars<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.679> got<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.160> all<00:00:59.250> strung

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
of cars and you got you for all strung

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.770 
of cars and you got you for all strung
trends<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.929> then<00:01:01.440> reverses<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.690> there<00:01:03.690> are

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
trends and then reverses and there are

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.080 
trends and then reverses and there are
few<00:01:03.929> problems<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.410> these<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.430> range<00:01:05.700> isn't

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
few problems with these the range isn't

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.260 
few problems with these the range isn't
very<00:01:06.480> good<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:06.960> you'll<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:07.950> 100<00:01:08.610> meters<00:01:09.030> max

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
very good and you'll get 100 meters max

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.200 
very good and you'll get 100 meters max
others<00:01:09.660> and<00:01:10.820> if<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.850> use<00:01:12.030> rechargeable

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
others and if you use rechargeable

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.210 
others and if you use rechargeable
batteries<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> goes<00:01:13.260> down<00:01:13.440> consider<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> Rick

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
batteries it goes down consider a Rick

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.040 
batteries it goes down consider a Rick
and<00:01:15.380> another<00:01:16.380> thing<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.610> goes<00:01:17.790> by<00:01:18.090> crystals

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
and another thing is it goes by crystals

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.680 
and another thing is it goes by crystals
which<00:01:19.820> they're<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.910> this<00:01:21.030> radio<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.510> on<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
which they're on this radio it's on the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.560 
which they're on this radio it's on the
back<00:01:21.870> this<00:01:22.650> one<00:01:23.900> says<00:01:25.220> 27.25<00:01:26.220> 5<00:01:26.880> megahertz<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
back this one says 27.25 5 megahertz I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
back this one says 27.25 5 megahertz I
don't<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.050> see<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.230> or<00:01:28.530> not

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
don't know if you can see that or not

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.750 
don't know if you can see that or not
but<00:01:29.070> um<00:01:30.560> basically<00:01:31.560> what<00:01:32.040> these<00:01:32.160> crystals<00:01:32.640> are

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
but um basically what these crystals are

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.990 
but um basically what these crystals are
is<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.960> way<00:01:34.230> of<00:01:34.260> changing<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.860> frequency<00:01:35.130> so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
is a way of changing the frequency so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.340 
is a way of changing the frequency so
you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.270> run<00:01:36.420> more<00:01:36.600> than<00:01:36.660> one<00:01:36.870> kit<00:01:37.110> together

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you can run more than one kit together

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.540 
you can run more than one kit together
now<00:01:38.720> this<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:40.140> good<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.920> gets<00:01:41.340> to

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
now this is all one good but it gets to

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.920 
now this is all one good but it gets to
be<00:01:41.580> a<00:01:41.670> bit<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.910> a<00:01:42.030> payment<00:01:42.480> there's<00:01:42.750> only<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
be a bit of a payment there's only a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.010 
be a bit of a payment there's only a
certain<00:01:43.110> number<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.500> frequencies<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:44.640> you

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
certain number of frequencies and if you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
certain number of frequencies and if you
clash<00:01:46.020> with<00:01:46.260> two<00:01:46.410> people<00:01:46.740> with<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:46.860> same

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
clash with two people with the same

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.240 
clash with two people with the same
frequency<00:01:47.600> one<00:01:48.600> kit<00:01:48.840> will<00:01:49.050> you<00:01:49.680> completely

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
frequency one kit will you completely

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.770 
frequency one kit will you completely
lose<00:01:50.370> control<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.120> can<00:01:51.210> both<00:01:51.390> kits<00:01:51.660> will

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
lose control or you can both kits will

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.300 
lose control or you can both kits will
lose<00:01:51.870> control<00:01:52.260> and<00:01:52.440> you'll<00:01:52.830> end<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.070> dragging

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
lose control and you'll end up dragging

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.040 
lose control and you'll end up dragging
into<00:01:53.580> a<00:01:53.700> tree<00:01:54.030> or<00:01:54.210> something<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.720> very<00:01:54.750> handy

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
into a tree or something not very handy

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.990 
into a tree or something not very handy
and<00:01:56.060> it's<00:01:57.060> also<00:01:57.180> covered<00:01:57.540> disadvantages<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and it's also covered disadvantages and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
and it's also covered disadvantages and
also<00:02:00.740> they<00:02:01.740> are<00:02:01.970> very<00:02:02.970> cheap<00:02:03.000> those<00:02:03.720> which<00:02:03.930> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
also they are very cheap those which is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.690 
also they are very cheap those which is
why<00:02:04.170> they<00:02:04.320> come<00:02:04.470> with<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> kids<00:02:05.010> I<00:02:05.190> mean<00:02:05.610> you

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
why they come with the kids I mean you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.089 
why they come with the kids I mean you
can<00:02:05.790> probably<00:02:06.150> pick<00:02:06.270> up<00:02:06.450> an<00:02:06.660> entire<00:02:07.110> kit<00:02:07.470> with

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
can probably pick up an entire kit with

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.889 
can probably pick up an entire kit with
receiver<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.700> everything<00:02:09.090> actually<00:02:09.629> i'll<00:02:09.750> go

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
receiver and everything actually i'll go

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.690 
receiver and everything actually i'll go
see<00:02:10.229> right<00:02:10.410> now<00:02:11.239> yeah

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
see right now yeah

40<00:03:10.900> quid<00:03:11.140> which<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:11.799> really<00:03:11.980> good<00:03:12.310> for<00:03:12.579> 2.4

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
40 quid which is really good for 2.4

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.400 
40 quid which is really good for 2.4
gigahertz<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.780> about<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.049> cheapest

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
gigahertz this is about the cheapest

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.379 
gigahertz this is about the cheapest
even<00:03:14.650> buy<00:03:14.739> one<00:03:14.920> for<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.420> UK<00:03:16.780> at<00:03:16.930> least<00:03:17.109> and

even buy one for in the UK at least and

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.970 
even buy one for in the UK at least and
that<00:03:19.389> they<00:03:19.480> could<00:03:19.660> range<00:03:19.870> from<00:03:20.019> 40<00:03:20.380> quid<00:03:20.739> all

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
that they could range from 40 quid all

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.670 
that they could range from 40 quid all
the<00:03:21.160> way<00:03:21.220> up<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.370> say<00:03:21.790> 200<00:03:22.510> quid<00:03:22.750> which<00:03:23.380> she

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
the way up to say 200 quid which she

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.050 
the way up to say 200 quid which she
knows<00:03:23.829> a<00:03:23.859> bit<00:03:24.220> above<00:03:25.060> my<00:03:25.120> budget<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:27.670> what

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
knows a bit above my budget and so what

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.910 
knows a bit above my budget and so what
I<00:03:28.090> was<00:03:28.209> gonna<00:03:28.329> say<00:03:28.420> yes<00:03:28.810> advantages<00:03:29.470> to

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
I was gonna say yes advantages to

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.129 
I was gonna say yes advantages to
perform<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.340> house<00:03:30.549> there<00:03:31.359> are<00:03:31.540> no<00:03:31.660> crystals

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
perform a house there are no crystals

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.160 
perform a house there are no crystals
and<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.790> receiver<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.109> transmitter

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
and this receiver and the transmitter

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.500 
and this receiver and the transmitter
bind<00:03:35.859> when<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.430> turn<00:03:36.579> them<00:03:36.730> on<00:03:36.819> or<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.359> can

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
bind when you turn them on or you can

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.390 
bind when you turn them on or you can
use<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.660> blind<00:03:37.900> plug<00:03:38.139> or<00:03:38.290> something<00:03:38.500> but<00:03:39.280> which

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
use a blind plug or something but which

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.900 
use a blind plug or something but which
means<00:03:39.639> that<00:03:39.790> they<00:03:40.180> are<00:03:40.209> bound<00:03:41.170> together<00:03:41.380> and

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
means that they are bound together and

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.550 
means that they are bound together and
like<00:03:42.910> like<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.480> crystals<00:03:43.870> basically<00:03:44.319> but<00:03:44.500> you

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
like like the crystals basically but you

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.410 
like like the crystals basically but you
don't<00:03:44.739> have<00:03:44.859> to<00:03:45.040> use<00:03:45.579> any<00:03:45.609> questions<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.389> have

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
don't have to use any questions you have

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.690 
don't have to use any questions you have
to<00:03:46.630> change<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.930> frequency<00:03:47.470> by<00:03:47.620> but<00:03:48.519> it

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
to change the frequency by but it

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.930 
to change the frequency by but it
changes<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.060> by<00:03:49.150> itself<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:50.519> so<00:03:51.519> you<00:03:51.609> can<00:03:51.760> just

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
changes it by itself and so you can just

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.270 
changes it by itself and so you can just
turn<00:03:52.120> up<00:03:52.180> turn<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:52.840> on<00:03:52.959> turn<00:03:53.620> up<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.889> a<00:03:53.920> place

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
turn up turn it on turn up to a place

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.370 
turn up turn it on turn up to a place
where<00:03:54.459> there's<00:03:54.639> other<00:03:55.090> people<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:56.139> run

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
where there's other people and just run

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.599 
where there's other people and just run
it<00:03:56.500> without<00:03:56.620> worrying<00:03:57.069> about<00:03:57.130> you<00:03:57.519> know

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
it without worrying about you know

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.550 
it without worrying about you know
mixing<00:03:57.910> up<00:03:58.030> frequencies<00:03:58.420> or<00:03:58.540> whatever<00:03:58.900> which

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
mixing up frequencies or whatever which

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.870 
mixing up frequencies or whatever which
is<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.680> good<00:03:59.739> thing<00:03:59.859> and<00:04:01.049> yeah<00:04:02.280> there<00:04:03.280> is<00:04:03.430> better

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
is a good thing and yeah there is better

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.210 
is a good thing and yeah there is better
range<00:04:04.150> weather<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.200> aerials<00:04:05.739> much<00:04:06.010> more

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
range weather and the aerials much more

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.099 
range weather and the aerials much more
convenient<00:04:06.549> thing<00:04:07.150> what<00:04:07.840> that<00:04:08.380> long<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.840> yeah

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
convenient thing what that long so yeah

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.589 
convenient thing what that long so yeah
actually<00:04:11.349> with<00:04:11.650> this<00:04:11.799> I<00:04:11.950> can<00:04:12.010> get<00:04:12.220> well<00:04:12.639> over

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
actually with this I can get well over

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.259 
actually with this I can get well over
300<00:04:13.840> meters<00:04:14.290> range<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:14.650> started<00:04:14.950> walking<00:04:15.269> doing

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
300 meters range I started walking doing

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.900 
300 meters range I started walking doing
a<00:04:16.299> rain<00:04:16.479> check<00:04:16.780> got<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.349> about<00:04:17.769> 300<00:04:18.489> meters<00:04:18.579> and

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
a rain check got to about 300 meters and

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.940 
a rain check got to about 300 meters and
got<00:04:19.030> balls<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:19.510> came<00:04:19.660> back<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.200> you<00:04:20.739> know<00:04:20.829> they

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
got balls and came back so you know they

with a built-in failsafe
what<00:04:25.790> this<00:04:25.880> means<00:04:26.150> is<00:04:26.420> that<00:04:26.510> even<00:04:27.140> if<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.500> do

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
what this means is that even if you do

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.200 
what this means is that even if you do
go<00:04:27.980> out<00:04:28.130> of<00:04:28.280> range<00:04:29.230> say<00:04:30.230> just<00:04:31.220> an<00:04:31.460> accident<00:04:31.910> say

go out of range say just an accident say

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.390 
go out of range say just an accident say
oh<00:04:32.390> all<00:04:33.200> your<00:04:33.410> batteries<00:04:33.830> die<00:04:34.070> in<00:04:34.370> your

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
connection with your transmitter it will

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.520 
connection with your transmitter it will
send<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.920> kit<00:04:46.130> into<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.550> preset<00:04:47.180> modes<00:04:47.390> say<00:04:47.750> you

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
send the kit into a preset modes say you

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.330 
send the kit into a preset modes say you
can<00:04:48.650> preset<00:04:49.100> it<00:04:49.340> if<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:50.060> is<00:04:50.380> these<00:04:51.380> control<00:04:52.070> or

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
can preset it if it is these control or

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.400 
can preset it if it is these control or
losses<00:04:52.580> range<00:04:52.850> you<00:04:53.420> can<00:04:53.600> set<00:04:53.750> it<00:04:53.780> so<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.140> goes

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
losses range you can set it so it goes

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.830 
losses range you can set it so it goes
into<00:04:54.650> full<00:04:54.800> brake<00:04:55.100> or<00:04:55.400> seem<00:04:55.760> neutral<00:04:56.030> so<00:04:56.720> it

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
into full brake or seem neutral so it

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.630 
into full brake or seem neutral so it
doesn't<00:04:57.080> go<00:04:57.200> out<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.620> control<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.220> half<00:04:58.520> of

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
doesn't go out of control and half of

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.860 
doesn't go out of control and half of
what<00:04:58.760> you<00:04:58.850> called<00:04:59.030> a<00:04:59.090> runaway<00:04:59.390> where<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.750> goes

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
what you called a runaway where it goes

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.470 
what you called a runaway where it goes
wide<00:05:00.200> open<00:05:00.500> throttle<00:05:00.650> just<00:05:01.460> zooms<00:05:01.760> out<00:05:02.030> as<00:05:02.270> far

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
wide open throttle just zooms out as far

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.480 
wide open throttle just zooms out as far
as<00:05:02.630> as<00:05:03.230> far<00:05:03.290> as<00:05:03.590> it<00:05:03.710> goes<00:05:03.860> until<00:05:04.100> it<00:05:04.310> hits

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490
