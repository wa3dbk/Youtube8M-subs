00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
nothing would happen so I would always

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.740

itself<00:03:18.489> it<00:03:18.670> could<00:03:18.850> have<00:03:18.940> left<00:03:19.120> behind<00:03:19.329> some

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
itself it could have left behind some

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.039 
itself it could have left behind some
trails<00:03:20.109> some<00:03:21.040> entries<00:03:21.489> perhaps<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.209> windows

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
trails some entries perhaps and windows

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.099 
trails some entries perhaps and windows
you<00:03:23.920> know<00:03:24.010> it's<00:03:24.220> still<00:03:24.430> going<00:03:24.639> to<00:03:24.730> be

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
you know it's still going to be

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.240 
you know it's still going to be
processing<00:03:26.109> those<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.650> certainly<00:03:27.100> that

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
processing those and certainly that

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.589 
processing those and certainly that
could<00:03:27.459> lead<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.790> slowdown<00:03:28.150> if<00:03:28.389> you<00:03:28.510> have

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
could lead to a slowdown if you have

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.990 
could lead to a slowdown if you have
hundreds<00:03:28.930> or<00:03:29.019> thousands<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.590> these<00:03:30.000> orphaned

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
hundreds or thousands of these orphaned

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.970 
hundreds or thousands of these orphaned
entries<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:32.019> it's<00:03:32.170> always<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.560> good<00:03:32.650> idea<00:03:32.709> to

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
entries so it's always a good idea to

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.920 
entries so it's always a good idea to
clean<00:03:33.250> those<00:03:33.370> up<00:03:33.549> if<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.790> have<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.239> software

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
clean those up if you have a software

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.470 
clean those up if you have a software
program<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.290> can<00:03:35.500> do<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:35.799> reliably<00:03:36.389> but<00:03:37.389> I'm

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
program that can do so reliably but I'm

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.720 
program that can do so reliably but I'm
going<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.810> just<00:03:38.019> mark<00:03:38.739> that<00:03:38.950> we'll<00:03:39.430> come<00:03:39.579> back

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
going to just mark that we'll come back

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.039 
going to just mark that we'll come back
to<00:03:39.849> that<00:03:39.880> point<00:03:40.150> because<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.569> always<00:03:40.780> want<00:03:40.989> to

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
to that point because you always want to

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.960 
to that point because you always want to
backup<00:03:41.530> your<00:03:41.769> registry<00:03:42.310> first<00:03:42.549> before<00:03:42.760> you

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
backup your registry first before you

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.460 
backup your registry first before you
make<00:03:43.120> any<00:03:43.150> changes<00:03:43.359> that's<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:44.019> very<00:03:44.200> very<00:03:44.349> good

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
make any changes that's a very very good

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.259 
make any changes that's a very very good
habit<00:03:44.889> and<00:03:45.040> we'll<00:03:45.519> talk<00:03:45.790> about<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:46.180> a

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
habit and we'll talk about that in a

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:46.680 
habit and we'll talk about that in a
moment

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
moment

to buy three or four different programs
to<00:04:07.180> do<00:04:07.419> everything<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.109> one<00:04:08.290> program<00:04:08.470> does

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
to do everything this one program does

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.860 
to do everything this one program does
which<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.099> really<00:04:09.280> cool<00:04:09.489> junk<00:04:10.359> files<00:04:10.630> just

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
which is really cool junk files just

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.960 
which is really cool junk files just
stuff<00:04:11.500> in<00:04:11.620> your<00:04:11.680> recycle<00:04:12.160> bins<00:04:12.370> things<00:04:12.880> in

your temporary folders you know again

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:16.979 
your temporary folders you know again
things<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.269> could<00:04:16.450> be<00:04:16.539> taking<00:04:16.810> up<00:04:16.900> a

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
things that could be taking up a

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.900 
things that could be taking up a
surprisingly<00:04:17.620> large<00:04:17.859> amount<00:04:17.979> of<00:04:18.280> space<00:04:18.459> on

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
surprisingly large amount of space on

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.360 
surprisingly large amount of space on
your<00:04:18.940> hard<00:04:19.060> drive<00:04:19.380> which<00:04:20.380> are<00:04:20.560> generally<00:04:21.099> safe

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
your hard drive which are generally safe

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.360 
your hard drive which are generally safe
to<00:04:21.400> delete<00:04:21.820> right<00:04:22.890> shortcut<00:04:23.890> files<00:04:24.130> that

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
to delete right shortcut files that

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.900 
to delete right shortcut files that
point<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:24.700> nowhere<00:04:25.060> and<00:04:25.210> file<00:04:25.419> so<00:04:25.659> see

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
point to nowhere and file so see

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.820 
point to nowhere and file so see
problems<00:04:26.420> these<00:04:26.840> aren't<00:04:27.020> big<00:04:27.170> deals<00:04:27.440> it's

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
problems these aren't big deals it's

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.310 
problems these aren't big deals it's
more<00:04:28.070> just<00:04:28.310> like<00:04:28.400> housekeeping<00:04:28.640> right<00:04:29.320> so

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
more just like housekeeping right so

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.110 
more just like housekeeping right so
beyond<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.010> quick<00:04:31.190> scan<00:04:31.430> after<00:04:31.640> you<00:04:31.880> go<00:04:32.000> ahead

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
beyond the quick scan after you go ahead

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.970 
beyond the quick scan after you go ahead
and<00:04:32.450> let's<00:04:32.780> say<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:32.960> were<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.350> fix<00:04:33.650> those<00:04:33.950> up

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
and let's say you were to fix those up

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.610 
and let's say you were to fix those up
you<00:04:34.340> can<00:04:34.550> go<00:04:34.640> a<00:04:34.670> little<00:04:34.820> bit<00:04:35.000> deeper<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.620> do

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
you can go a little bit deeper and do

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.440 
you can go a little bit deeper and do
things<00:04:36.770> individually<00:04:37.460> right<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.030> quick<00:04:38.210> scan

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
things individually right the quick scan

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.790 
things individually right the quick scan
kind<00:04:38.960> of<00:04:39.050> talked<00:04:39.230> about<00:04:39.350> these<00:04:39.620> things

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
kind of talked about these things

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.980 
kind of talked about these things
already<00:04:40.100> but<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:40.400> can<00:04:40.520> go<00:04:40.700> and<00:04:40.940> just<00:04:41.450> scan<00:04:41.690> one

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
already but you can go and just scan one

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.410 
already but you can go and just scan one
of<00:04:42.110> those<00:04:42.260> four<00:04:42.800> areas<00:04:42.980> in<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.310> future<00:04:43.490> if<00:04:43.910> you

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
of those four areas in the future if you

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.660 
of those four areas in the future if you
suspect<00:04:44.810> you'd<00:04:44.960> need<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.350> system<00:04:46.220> optimize

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
suspect you'd need to system optimize

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.160 
suspect you'd need to system optimize
gives<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.090> a<00:04:47.120> lot<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.450> different<00:04:47.720> options<00:04:48.020> as

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
gives you a lot of different options as

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.840 
gives you a lot of different options as
well<00:04:48.380> like<00:04:48.560> I<00:04:48.740> haven't<00:04:49.130> played<00:04:49.280> with<00:04:49.340> too<00:04:49.640> many

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
well like I haven't played with too many

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.610 
well like I haven't played with too many
of<00:04:49.970> these<00:04:50.060> things<00:04:50.360> yet<00:04:50.600> I'm<00:04:50.750> still<00:04:50.900> pretty<00:04:51.470> new

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
of these things yet I'm still pretty new

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.230 
of these things yet I'm still pretty new
to<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.740> software<00:04:52.250> however<00:04:52.850> I<00:04:53.060> did<00:04:53.210> find

of<00:06:42.060> them<00:06:42.210> however<00:06:42.840> I<00:06:43.110> do<00:06:43.260> like<00:06:43.410> the<00:06:43.740> file

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
of them however I do like the file

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.740 
of them however I do like the file
splitter<00:06:44.400> and<00:06:44.520> the<00:06:44.580> file<00:06:44.820> shredder<00:06:45.210> I'll<00:06:45.600> be

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
splitter and the file shredder I'll be

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.990 
splitter and the file shredder I'll be
using<00:06:46.020> those<00:06:46.200> file<00:06:47.070> splitter<00:06:47.430> lets<00:06:47.640> you<00:06:47.760> break

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
using those file splitter lets you break

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.060 
using those file splitter lets you break
up<00:06:48.240> a<00:06:48.390> large<00:06:48.600> file<00:06:48.960> into<00:06:49.230> smaller<00:06:49.500> chunks<00:06:49.590> and

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
up a large file into smaller chunks and

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.730 
up a large file into smaller chunks and
then<00:06:50.190> join<00:06:50.490> it<00:06:50.670> again<00:06:51.000> useful<00:06:51.960> if<00:06:52.290> you<00:06:52.410> need<00:06:52.590> to

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
then join it again useful if you need to

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.320 
then join it again useful if you need to
transfer<00:06:53.310> a<00:06:53.340> large<00:06:53.520> file<00:06:53.790> between<00:06:54.180> two

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
transfer a large file between two

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.580 
transfer a large file between two
computers<00:06:54.630> and<00:06:54.960> you<00:06:55.020> don't<00:06:55.200> have<00:06:55.320> a<00:06:55.350> network

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
computers and you don't have a network

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.250 
computers and you don't have a network
connection<00:06:56.450> again<00:06:57.450> because<00:06:57.750> you<00:06:57.840> can<00:06:57.990> install

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
connection again because you can install

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.420 
connection again because you can install
this<00:06:58.410> program<00:06:58.650> on<00:06:59.010> more<00:06:59.160> than<00:06:59.250> one<00:06:59.400> computer

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
this program on more than one computer

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.000 
this program on more than one computer
it's<00:07:00.030> a<00:07:00.090> very<00:07:00.300> viable<00:07:00.570> solution<00:07:00.780> and<00:07:01.410> file

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
it's a very viable solution and file

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.070 
it's a very viable solution and file
shredder<00:07:02.430> lets<00:07:02.670> you<00:07:02.820> obliterate<00:07:03.330> a<00:07:03.600> file<00:07:03.900> so

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
shredder lets you obliterate a file so

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.620 
shredder lets you obliterate a file so
that<00:07:04.170> it<00:07:04.260> can't<00:07:04.500> be<00:07:04.650> uh<00:07:04.680> erased<00:07:05.310> or<00:07:06.000> undeleted

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
that it can't be uh erased or undeleted

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.290 
that it can't be uh erased or undeleted
with<00:07:06.780> special<00:07:07.470> tools<00:07:07.680> again<00:07:08.370> very<00:07:08.850> very<00:07:08.910> cool

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
with special tools again very very cool

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.930 
with special tools again very very cool

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470 
backup section you'll remember when we

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.100 
backup section you'll remember when we
first<00:07:14.160> started<00:07:14.640> our<00:07:14.760> video<00:07:15.150> together<00:07:15.390> I've

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
first started our video together I've

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.810 
first started our video together I've
said<00:07:16.500> it's<00:07:16.620> always<00:07:16.860> a<00:07:17.010> good<00:07:17.160> idea<00:07:17.250> to<00:07:17.490> backup

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820 
said it's always a good idea to backup

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.210 
said it's always a good idea to backup
your<00:07:18.050> registry<00:07:19.050> before<00:07:19.320> you<00:07:19.620> make<00:07:19.830> changes

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 
your registry before you make changes

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.980 
your registry before you make changes
and<00:07:20.400> you'll<00:07:20.490> see<00:07:20.640> that's<00:07:20.850> an<00:07:21.000> easy<00:07:21.540> to

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
and you'll see that's an easy to

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.500 
and you'll see that's an easy to
accomplish<00:07:22.440> tasks<00:07:22.740> with<00:07:23.400> smartpcfixer<00:07:23.760> a

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510 
accomplish tasks with smartpcfixer a

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.360 
accomplish tasks with smartpcfixer a
simple<00:07:24.870> click<00:07:24.990> of<00:07:25.110> the<00:07:25.200> button<00:07:25.230> you<00:07:26.040> can<00:07:26.190> back

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.370 
simple click of the button you can back

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.950 
simple click of the button you can back
it<00:07:26.550> up<00:07:26.610> I'd<00:07:26.820> recommend<00:07:27.270> maybe<00:07:27.450> putting<00:07:27.720> it<00:07:27.870> on

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
it up I'd recommend maybe putting it on

these things separately and sell very

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.219 
these things separately and sell very
well<00:07:56.760> you'd<00:07:57.419> spend<00:07:57.720> hundreds<00:07:58.080> of<00:07:58.169> dollars

00:07:58.219 --> 00:07:58.229
