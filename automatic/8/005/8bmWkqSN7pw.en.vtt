hello<00:00:01.410> here's<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.280> quick<00:00:02.610> look<00:00:02.790> into<00:00:03.240> this

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
hello here's a quick look into this

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.150 
hello here's a quick look into this
project<00:00:03.810> I've<00:00:03.959> been<00:00:03.990> working<00:00:04.380> on<00:00:04.470> for<00:00:04.799> quite<00:00:04.950> a

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
project I've been working on for quite a

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.749 
project I've been working on for quite a
while<00:00:05.310> now

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
while now

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.799 
while now
it<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.540> VGA<00:00:06.990> frame<00:00:07.259> grabber<00:00:08.330> meaning<00:00:09.330> it

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
it is a VGA frame grabber meaning it

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.730 
it is a VGA frame grabber meaning it
takes<00:00:09.870> VGA<00:00:10.559> input<00:00:10.769> from<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.670> PC<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.559> lets<00:00:13.559> you

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
takes VGA input from a PC and lets you

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.880 
takes VGA input from a PC and lets you
view<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.190> image<00:00:14.490> from<00:00:14.880> another<00:00:15.210> PC<00:00:15.719> using<00:00:16.379> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
view the image from another PC using a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.429 
view the image from another PC using a
web<00:00:17.580> browser<00:00:18.470> here's<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.770> PC<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.820> I'm<00:00:20.970> using

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
web browser here's the PC that I'm using

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.279 
web browser here's the PC that I'm using
there's<00:00:22.439> nothing<00:00:22.740> special<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
there's nothing special about it the

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.519 
there's nothing special about it the
resolution<00:00:25.289> has<00:00:25.410> been<00:00:25.470> said<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:27.170> 640<00:00:28.170> by

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
resolution has been said to be 640 by

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.070 
resolution has been said to be 640 by
480<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:30.269> standard<00:00:30.720> VGA

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
480 which is just standard VGA

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.760 
480 which is just standard VGA
resolution<00:00:32.420> and<00:00:33.420> here's<00:00:33.899> how<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.320> looks<00:00:34.530> like

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
resolution and here's how it looks like

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.110 
resolution and here's how it looks like
from<00:00:35.480> a<00:00:36.480> PC<00:00:37.440> now<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.489> connected<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
from a PC now it's connected to a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.040 
from a PC now it's connected to a
network<00:00:39.710> using<00:00:40.710> Ethernet<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:44.809> should<00:00:45.809> see<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
network using Ethernet so should see it

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319 
network using Ethernet so should see it
online<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.620> right<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.000> connect

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
online it's right there we can connect

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.910 
online it's right there we can connect
you<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:49.079> using<00:00:49.559> web<00:00:49.890> browser<00:00:50.160> this

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
to do some basic color conversion and

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.719 
to do some basic color conversion and
view<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> image<00:01:40.009> on<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:42.020> html5<00:01:43.020> canvas<00:01:43.709> now<00:01:44.580> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
view the image on a html5 canvas now the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.020 
view the image on a html5 canvas now the
framerate<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.299> kind<00:01:45.929> of<00:01:46.080> slow<00:01:46.289> but<00:01:46.670> it's<00:01:47.670> also

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
framerate is kind of slow but it's also

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.480 
framerate is kind of slow but it's also
quite<00:01:48.950> quite<00:01:49.950> decent<00:01:50.429> all<00:01:51.360> things<00:01:51.840> considered

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
quite quite decent all things considered

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.550 
quite quite decent all things considered
now<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> closer<00:01:54.119> look<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> board<00:01:54.840> now

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
now for a closer look at the board now

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.349 
now for a closer look at the board now
the<00:01:55.619> first<00:01:55.860> thing<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.369> after<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> VGA

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
the first thing I have after the VGA

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:03.740 
the first thing I have after the VGA
input<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.320> this<00:02:00.170> TVP<00:02:01.170> 7000<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> its<00:02:02.750> video

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
input is this TVP 7000 to its video

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.139 
input is this TVP 7000 to its video

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.389 
digitizing chip from Texas Instruments
it's<00:02:06.509> pretty<00:02:07.079> cool

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it's pretty cool

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.490 
it's pretty cool
it<00:02:08.759> takes<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.269> analog<00:02:09.690> input<00:02:10.019> gives<00:02:10.350> me

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it takes the analog input gives me

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.090 
it takes the analog input gives me
digital<00:02:11.160> output<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:12.600> image<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.140> stored<00:02:13.410> in

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
digital output the image is stored in

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.979 
digital output the image is stored in
SRAM<00:02:14.579> just<00:02:15.450> right<00:02:15.630> here<00:02:17.480> it's<00:02:18.480> half<00:02:18.780> a

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
megabyte of SRAM which is just enough

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.830 
megabyte of SRAM which is just enough
