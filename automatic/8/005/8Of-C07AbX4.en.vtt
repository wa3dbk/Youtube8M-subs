00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.290 
we're going to end the point before it
even<00:02:19.570> gets<00:02:19.840> started<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.830> I'll<00:02:21.400> be<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.850> pusher

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
even gets started and I'll be the pusher

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.080 
even gets started and I'll be the pusher
I'm<00:02:22.690> going<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.140> serve<00:02:23.350> most<00:02:23.680> pushers<00:02:24.400> have

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
I'm going to serve most pushers have

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.260 
I'm going to serve most pushers have
very<00:02:25.960> weak<00:02:26.230> serves<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.760> what<00:02:27.970> we're<00:02:28.120> going

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
very weak serves and so what we're going

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.640 
very weak serves and so what we're going
to<00:02:28.330> do<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.630> we're<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.020> tack<00:02:29.230> both<00:02:29.470> the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
to do is we're going to tack both the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.220 
to do is we're going to tack both the
first<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.280> second<00:02:30.700> serves<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.270> so<00:02:31.810> Lindsey

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
first and second serves and so Lindsey

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.220 
first and second serves and so Lindsey
over<00:02:32.470> there<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.860> going<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:34.270> put<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.990> ball<00:02:35.170> away

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
over there is going to put the ball away

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.150 
over there is going to put the ball away
by<00:02:36.190> hitting<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.730> winner<00:02:37.000> down<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.630> line<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.500> if

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
by hitting a winner down the line so if

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.400 
by hitting a winner down the line so if
she<00:02:39.520> hits<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.790> winner<00:02:39.940> down<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.270> line<00:02:40.450> now<00:02:41.110> I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
she hits a winner down the line now I

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.590 
she hits a winner down the line now I
cannot<00:02:41.860> push<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.820> alleviates<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.510> all

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
cannot push so it alleviates it all

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.840 
cannot push so it alleviates it all
