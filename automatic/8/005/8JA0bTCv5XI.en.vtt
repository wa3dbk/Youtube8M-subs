00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.910 
out the floorboards around here all
right<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:00.690> here<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.260> looks<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.590> where

the hole was we're gonna go down in

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.460 
the hole was we're gonna go down in
there<00:01:04.769> today<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.519> all<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.470> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
myself can actually finally see what was

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.850 
myself can actually finally see what was
down<00:01:10.799> there<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:12.720> what<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.110> rafael<00:01:13.439> put<00:01:13.680> down

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
down there and what is rafael put down

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.609 
down there and what is rafael put down
there<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.520> trap<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:16.580> here<00:01:17.580> we<00:01:17.610> go<00:01:18.619> going

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
there for the trap so here we go going

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.580 
there for the trap so here we go going
down<00:01:19.799> into<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.580> mysterious<00:01:20.729> hole<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
down into the mysterious hole in the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:31.429 
down into the mysterious hole in the
cave<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:26.210> tada<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.299> room<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.930> flower

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
cave and tada it is a room with a flower

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:40.240 
cave and tada it is a room with a flower
and<00:01:32.360> a<00:01:33.360> sapling<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:36.710> that's<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> I'm

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
and a sapling and that's it so I'm

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.039 
and a sapling and that's it so I'm
guessing<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:44.549> Rafael<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.329> use<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.750> power

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
guessing this Rafael just use this power

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.940 
guessing this Rafael just use this power
to<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:46.890> push<00:01:47.700> himself<00:01:47.909> up<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.420> then

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
to get out push himself up and then

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.830 
to get out push himself up and then
Xephos<00:01:49.950> threw<00:01:50.280> down<00:01:50.430> cobblestone<00:01:51.420> for

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
Xephos threw down cobblestone for

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.109 
Xephos threw down cobblestone for
honeydew<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.040> out<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.399> he<00:01:53.759> made<00:01:53.939> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
honeydew to get out and he made this

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.209 
honeydew to get out and he made this
tower<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.229> I'm<00:01:55.290> guessing<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:55.770> why<00:01:56.009> there's

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
tower so I'm guessing that's why there's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.480 
tower so I'm guessing that's why there's
the<00:01:56.399> cobble<00:01:56.729> stone<00:01:56.909> pillar<00:01:57.180> there<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:58.500> there

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the cobble stone pillar there but there

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.760 
the cobble stone pillar there but there
you<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:02.240> now<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.299> know<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:04.140> any<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.649> you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
you go so now you know for any of you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.469 
you go so now you know for any of you
who<00:02:04.950> are<00:02:05.159> wondering<00:02:05.340> that's<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.329> down

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
who are wondering that's what was down

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.550 
who are wondering that's what was down
the<00:02:06.750> mysterious<00:02:06.930> hole<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.910> odd<00:02:09.060> cave

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
the mysterious hole in the odd cave

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.090 
the mysterious hole in the odd cave
thanks<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.709> watching<00:02:10.739> hope<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.640> enjoyed<00:02:11.790> it
