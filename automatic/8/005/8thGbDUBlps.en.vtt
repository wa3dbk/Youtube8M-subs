00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.980 
cools completely and then we'll put our
last<00:05:21.630> layer<00:05:22.050> but<00:05:22.950> you<00:05:23.160> can<00:05:23.460> prepare<00:05:24.060> well<00:05:24.780> this

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
last layer but you can prepare well this

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.310 
last layer but you can prepare well this
is<00:05:25.139> in<00:05:25.289> the<00:05:25.380> refrigerator<00:05:26.240> cooling<00:05:27.240> what<00:05:28.050> we

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
is in the refrigerator cooling what we

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.129 
is in the refrigerator cooling what we
do<00:05:28.590> for<00:05:28.830> our<00:05:28.889> top<00:05:29.250> layer<00:05:29.580> is<00:05:29.610> we<00:05:30.150> melt<00:05:30.450> one<00:05:30.840> cup

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
do for our top layer is we melt one cup

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.620 
do for our top layer is we melt one cup
of<00:05:31.289> chocolate<00:05:31.470> chips<00:05:31.740> together<00:05:32.490> with<00:05:33.330> one

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
of chocolate chips together with one

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.080 
of chocolate chips together with one
tablespoon<00:05:34.320> of<00:05:34.470> butter<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.919> that's<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.789> and

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
tablespoon of butter and that's it and

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.000 
tablespoon of butter and that's it and
then<00:05:36.539> we're<00:05:36.780> going<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:36.960> spread<00:05:37.229> this<00:05:37.410> over<00:05:37.770> top

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
then we're going to spread this over top

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.920 
then we're going to spread this over top
so<00:05:38.520> you<00:05:38.610> can<00:05:38.729> do<00:05:39.000> that<00:05:39.180> ahead<00:05:39.479> of<00:05:39.599> time<00:05:39.780> and

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
so you can do that ahead of time and

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.969 
so you can do that ahead of time and
just<00:05:39.990> set<00:05:40.320> it<00:05:40.470> aside<00:05:40.669> while<00:05:41.669> this<00:05:42.000> is<00:05:42.210> chilling

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
just set it aside while this is chilling

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:45.770 
just set it aside while this is chilling
all<00:05:43.979> right<00:05:44.280> that<00:05:44.910> has

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
all right that has

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.050 
all right that has
been<00:05:45.960> sitting<00:05:46.380> in<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.560> refrigerator<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:47.490> it

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
been sitting in the refrigerator and it

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.600 
been sitting in the refrigerator and it
has<00:05:48.270> chilled<00:05:48.770> completely<00:05:49.770> as<00:05:49.980> you<00:05:50.190> can<00:05:50.370> see

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
has chilled completely as you can see

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.930 
has chilled completely as you can see
that's<00:05:51.300> pretty<00:05:51.630> hard<00:05:52.020> now<00:05:52.740> what<00:05:53.430> I<00:05:53.460> have<00:05:53.910> here

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
that's pretty hard now what I have here

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.870 
that's pretty hard now what I have here
is<00:05:54.570> my<00:05:54.600> melted<00:05:55.500> chocolate<00:05:56.040> butter<00:05:56.310> and<00:05:56.580> I<00:05:56.639> used

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
is my melted chocolate butter and I used

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.050

milk<00:05:57.240> chocolate<00:05:57.990> chips<00:05:58.260> this<00:05:58.470> time

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
milk chocolate chips this time

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.750 
milk chocolate chips this time
oftentimes<00:06:00.060> I<00:06:00.270> use<00:06:00.510> semi-sweet<00:06:01.110> it<00:06:01.980> depends

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
oftentimes I use semi-sweet it depends

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.470 
oftentimes I use semi-sweet it depends
you<00:06:02.940> could<00:06:03.090> also<00:06:03.240> use<00:06:03.810> ganache<00:06:04.740> if<00:06:05.280> you<00:06:05.669> would

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
you could also use ganache if you would

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.850 
you could also use ganache if you would
like<00:06:06.690> okay

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
like okay

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.180 
like okay
now<00:06:08.160> I<00:06:08.610> did<00:06:08.940> this<00:06:08.970> and<00:06:09.600> melted<00:06:10.050> it<00:06:10.169> well<00:06:10.500> this

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
now I did this and melted it well this

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.280 
now I did this and melted it well this
was<00:06:11.430> sitting<00:06:11.700> in<00:06:11.790> the<00:06:11.880> refrigerator<00:06:12.080> so<00:06:13.080> it's

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
was sitting in the refrigerator so it's

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.500 
was sitting in the refrigerator so it's
not<00:06:13.530> really<00:06:14.100> hot<00:06:14.370> when<00:06:14.639> I<00:06:14.669> spread<00:06:15.090> it<00:06:15.150> on

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
not really hot when I spread it on

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.560 
not really hot when I spread it on
because<00:06:15.930> I<00:06:16.139> don't<00:06:16.470> want<00:06:16.770> it<00:06:16.950> to<00:06:17.220> just<00:06:18.090> melt

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
because I don't want it to just melt

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:28.820 
because I don't want it to just melt
right<00:06:18.930> through<00:06:26.930> but<00:06:27.930> you're<00:06:28.140> gonna<00:06:28.320> have<00:06:28.560> to

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.850 
right through but you're gonna have to
work<00:06:28.980> fast<00:06:29.340> because<00:06:29.970> it<00:06:30.450> will<00:06:30.720> when<00:06:31.500> it<00:06:31.620> comes

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
I'm going to do exactly the same thing

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.680 
I'm going to do exactly the same thing
that<00:06:46.530> we<00:06:46.889> did<00:06:47.160> with<00:06:47.400> our<00:06:47.610> other<00:06:47.850> layers<00:06:48.150> we're

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
that we did with our other layers we're

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.170 
that we did with our other layers we're
going<00:06:48.900> to<00:06:48.990> set<00:06:49.200> this<00:06:49.380> in<00:06:49.620> the<00:06:49.650> refrigerator
