like my original one so hopefully that's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.310 
like my original one so hopefully that's
nice<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.210> clear<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:30.539> my<00:00:30.720> wick<00:00:30.900> cam<00:00:31.080> was

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320

like I don't know the lighting was awful

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.700 
like I don't know the lighting was awful
like<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.630> would<00:00:33.750> kept<00:00:33.930> changing<00:00:34.230> during<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
like it would kept changing during the

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650 
like it would kept changing during the
video<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.430> wasn't<00:00:35.850> too<00:00:35.940> happy<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
card and what I tend to do just before I

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.420 
card and what I tend to do just before I
start<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.790> King<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.720> Ring<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:47.110> put<00:02:47.950> one<00:02:48.160> that

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
start a King of the Ring I put one that

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.700 
start a King of the Ring I put one that
hasn't<00:02:48.640> been<00:02:48.820> approached<00:02:49.480> well<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.990> put<00:02:50.590> one

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
hasn't been approached well I put one

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.380 
hasn't been approached well I put one
that's<00:02:50.890> been<00:02:51.010> probed<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:51.640> not<00:02:51.790> fully<00:02:52.030> maxed

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
that's been probed but not fully maxed

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.030 
that's been probed but not fully maxed
out<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.900> drops<00:02:53.110> my<00:02:53.320> tear<00:02:53.590> down<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.860> little

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
out so it drops my tear down a little

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.800 
out so it drops my tear down a little
bit<00:02:54.190> well<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.370> think<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.700> does<00:02:54.820> anyway<00:02:55.210> and<00:02:55.450> then

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
bit well I think it does anyway and then

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.090 
bit well I think it does anyway and then

but I thought he actually legit won it
and<00:05:46.630> then<00:05:46.780> they<00:05:46.900> stopped<00:05:47.230> it<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:47.740> then<00:05:48.100> they

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
and then they stopped it and then they

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.890 
and then they stopped it and then they
said<00:05:48.370> he<00:05:48.430> got<00:05:48.460> disqualified<00:05:48.820> then<00:05:49.600> he<00:05:49.660> still

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
said he got disqualified then he still

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.360 
said he got disqualified then he still
went<00:05:50.020> off<00:05:50.140> with<00:05:50.320> a<00:05:50.380> belt<00:05:50.590> is<00:05:50.770> brilliant<00:05:51.190> that

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
went off with a belt is brilliant that

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.890 
went off with a belt is brilliant that
was<00:05:51.730> a<00:05:51.760> good<00:05:51.940> match<00:05:52.120> though<00:05:52.360> but<00:05:52.570> still<00:05:52.780> again

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
was a good match though but still again

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.470 
was a good match though but still again
it<00:05:53.380> was<00:05:53.650> kind<00:05:54.430> of<00:05:54.490> it<00:05:54.700> kind<00:05:54.820> of<00:05:55.000> dragged<00:05:55.270> out
