00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.829 
those fighting games that feature

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.189 
those fighting games that feature
digitized<00:00:27.550> graphics<00:00:27.579> and<00:00:28.449> weren't<00:00:28.749> called

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
digitized graphics and weren't called

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.370 
digitized graphics and weren't called
Mortal<00:00:29.589> Kombat<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.909> vast<00:00:31.329> majority<00:00:31.630> of<00:00:32.079> them

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
Mortal Kombat the vast majority of them

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.590 
Mortal Kombat the vast majority of them
were<00:00:33.010> just<00:00:33.519> god-awful<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.559> well<00:00:36.370> that<00:00:37.180> was

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
were just god-awful and well that was

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.319 
were just god-awful and well that was
the<00:00:37.750> first<00:00:38.140> thing<00:00:38.469> that<00:00:38.530> came<00:00:38.920> to<00:00:38.980> mind<00:00:39.399> when<00:00:40.269> I

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
the first thing that came to mind when I

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.560 
the first thing that came to mind when I
played<00:00:40.809> scourge<00:00:41.500> outbreak<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.910> under<00:00:43.359> normal

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
played scourge outbreak and under normal

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.770 
played scourge outbreak and under normal
circumstances<00:00:44.559> I<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:45.850> wouldn't<00:00:46.239> review<00:00:46.750> a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
circumstances I really wouldn't review a

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.950 
circumstances I really wouldn't review a
game<00:00:47.109> like<00:00:47.379> this<00:00:47.489> because<00:00:48.489> it's<00:00:49.239> a<00:00:49.629> me-too

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
game like this because it's a me-too

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.099 
game like this because it's a me-too
clone<00:00:50.769> that's<00:00:51.489> just<00:00:51.850> nowhere<00:00:52.149> near<00:00:52.690> as<00:00:52.989> good

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
clone that's just nowhere near as good

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.639 
clone that's just nowhere near as good
as<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:53.559> game<00:00:53.800> that<00:00:54.070> was<00:00:54.219> inspired<00:00:54.699> of<00:00:54.969> from<00:00:55.649> so

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
as the game that was inspired of from so

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.489 
as the game that was inspired of from so
what<00:00:56.829> game<00:00:57.010> was<00:00:57.339> it<00:00:57.489> inspired<00:00:57.850> by<00:00:58.030> well<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:59.260> was

00:00:59.489 --> 00:00:59.499 
what game was it inspired by well it was

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.340 
what game was it inspired by well it was
inspired<00:00:59.920> by<00:01:00.039> Gears<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:00.789> War<00:01:00.940> and<00:01:01.420> it<00:01:01.749> uses<00:01:01.989> the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
inspired by Gears of War and it uses the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.760 
inspired by Gears of War and it uses the
Unreal<00:01:02.379> Engine<00:01:02.949> but<00:01:03.519> that's<00:01:03.730> pretty<00:01:04.449> much

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
Unreal Engine but that's pretty much

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.970 
Unreal Engine but that's pretty much
where<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.100> quality<00:01:06.730> begins<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.870> ends<00:01:08.050> so

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
where the quality begins and ends so

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.040 
where the quality begins and ends so
here's<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.910> one<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:10.330> only<00:01:10.570> good<00:01:10.720> thing<00:01:10.930> I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
here's the one and only good thing I

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.630 
here's the one and only good thing I
gotta<00:01:11.260> say<00:01:11.440> about<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.740> game<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.160> it's<00:01:12.460> that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
gotta say about the game and it's that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.390 
gotta say about the game and it's that
it's<00:01:12.820> $10<00:01:13.540> and<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:14.140> appreciate<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:15.010> fact<00:01:15.040> that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
it's $10 and I appreciate the fact that

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.270 
it's $10 and I appreciate the fact that
the<00:01:15.550> publisher<00:01:16.230> basically<00:01:17.230> slapped<00:01:17.560> $9.99

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
the publisher basically slapped $9.99

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.600 
the publisher basically slapped $9.99
price<00:01:18.760> tag<00:01:19.060> on<00:01:19.300> there<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:19.840> not<00:01:20.310> $14.99<00:01:21.310> so

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
price tag on there and not $14.99 so

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.910 
price tag on there and not $14.99 so
that<00:01:21.880> was<00:01:22.000> cool<00:01:22.240> they<00:01:22.720> were<00:01:22.780> like<00:01:23.200> okay<00:01:23.620> well

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
that was cool they were like okay well

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.790 
that was cool they were like okay well
it's<00:01:24.430> 5<00:01:24.670> bucks<00:01:25.030> cheaper<00:01:25.840> than<00:01:26.170> most<00:01:26.380> arcade

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
it's 5 bucks cheaper than most arcade

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.680 
it's 5 bucks cheaper than most arcade
games<00:01:27.130> but<00:01:27.970> that's<00:01:28.090> about<00:01:28.420> it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
games but that's about it

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.610 
games but that's about it
everything<00:01:29.410> else<00:01:29.620> is<00:01:30.040> pretty<00:01:30.870> pretty<00:01:31.870> bad<00:01:32.170> I

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
everything else is pretty pretty bad I

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.460 
everything else is pretty pretty bad I
like<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.550> fact<00:01:33.790> that<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.390> can<00:01:34.600> bring<00:01:34.930> four

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
like the fact that you can bring four

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.010 
like the fact that you can bring four
players<00:01:35.860> as<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.190> four<00:01:36.460> player<00:01:36.730> version<00:01:37.630> of

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
players as a four player version of

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.440 
players as a four player version of
Gears<00:01:38.620> of<00:01:38.740> War<00:01:38.890> it's<00:01:39.340> broken<00:01:39.550> down<00:01:39.760> into<00:01:39.820> four

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
Gears of War it's broken down into four

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.480 
Gears of War it's broken down into four
levels<00:01:40.930> with<00:01:41.290> each<00:01:41.500> level<00:01:41.920> getting<00:01:42.220> a<00:01:42.370> little

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
levels with each level getting a little

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.890 
levels with each level getting a little
bit<00:01:42.700> bigger<00:01:43.440> than<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.590> one<00:01:44.620> that<00:01:44.920> preceded<00:01:45.280> it

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
bit bigger than the one that preceded it

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.440 
bit bigger than the one that preceded it
if<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:47.080> play<00:01:47.260> by<00:01:47.440> yourself<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.640> partner

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
if you play by yourself the partner

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.790 
if you play by yourself the partner
artificial<00:01:50.020> intelligence<00:01:50.470> it's<00:01:50.620> pretty

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
artificial intelligence it's pretty

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.140 
artificial intelligence it's pretty
competent<00:01:51.160> actually<00:01:51.760> it<00:01:51.850> was<00:01:51.940> kind<00:01:52.060> of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
competent actually it was kind of

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.870 
competent actually it was kind of

together so they don't really know where

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.370 
together so they don't really know where
they're<00:02:22.250> going<00:02:22.700> or<00:02:22.910> what's<00:02:23.240> happening<00:02:23.720> the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
they're going or what's happening the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.680 
they're going or what's happening the
four<00:02:24.770> levels<00:02:25.280> are<00:02:25.550> broken<00:02:26.240> down<00:02:26.360> into<00:02:26.420> a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
four levels are broken down into a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.320 
four levels are broken down into a
series<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.290> linear<00:02:27.740> pathways<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:29.000> pretty

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
series of linear pathways that pretty

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.000 
series of linear pathways that pretty
much<00:02:29.480> all<00:02:29.690> require<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.290> exact<00:02:30.560> same<00:02:30.770> thing

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
much all require the exact same thing

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.310 
much all require the exact same thing
you<00:02:31.160> go<00:02:31.280> from<00:02:31.550> one<00:02:31.790> point<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.720> next<00:02:32.840> point

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
you go from one point to the next point

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.340 
you go from one point to the next point
and<00:02:33.620> it's<00:02:34.190> completely<00:02:34.850> linear<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.390> as<00:02:36.080> you're

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
and it's completely linear and as you're

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.620 
and it's completely linear and as you're
making<00:02:36.470> your<00:02:36.770> way<00:02:36.800> there'll<00:02:37.220> be<00:02:37.280> a<00:02:38.150> bunch<00:02:38.570> of

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
making your way there'll be a bunch of

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.880 
making your way there'll be a bunch of
different<00:02:38.900> things<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.200> can<00:02:39.380> hide<00:02:39.680> behind

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
different things you can hide behind

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.040 
different things you can hide behind
which<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.850> where<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.210> cover<00:02:41.390> mechanic<00:02:41.600> comes

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
which is where the cover mechanic comes

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.300 
which is where the cover mechanic comes
into<00:02:42.290> play<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:44.140> there's<00:02:45.140> just<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.680> whole<00:02:45.980> bunch

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
into play and there's just a whole bunch

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.920 
into play and there's just a whole bunch
of<00:02:46.520> enemies<00:02:46.820> that<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.240> have<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.450> kill<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.900> you

like give me like a DNA sample or
something<00:03:12.170> like<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.709> grab<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.070> and

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
something like that you grab that and

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.020 
something like that you grab that and
boom<00:03:14.390> that's<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.440> all<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.250> enemies<00:03:16.550> disappear

linear and repetitive the gameplay is I

it through the campaign alone because

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.880 
it through the campaign alone because
just<00:03:28.760> not<00:03:29.120> exciting<00:03:29.810> enough<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.410> story<00:03:30.739> I

just not exciting enough and the story I

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.229 
just not exciting enough and the story I

you press it twice here you're just
firing<00:04:03.080> everywhere<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:04.160> what<00:04:04.280> ends<00:04:04.400> up

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
firing everywhere so what ends up

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.280 
firing everywhere so what ends up
happening<00:04:04.730> is<00:04:05.090> as<00:04:05.300> you<00:04:05.540> switch<00:04:05.840> weapons

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
the head before they drop it's just

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.810 
the head before they drop it's just
ridiculous<00:05:21.200> there<00:05:21.920> is<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.100> competitive

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
ridiculous there is a competitive

multiplayer mode but the weapons work
just<00:05:25.190> as<00:05:25.340> poorly<00:05:25.850> so<00:05:26.240> I<00:05:26.660> doubt<00:05:27.230> very<00:05:27.260> many<00:05:27.710> of

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
and probably the biggest disappointment

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.490 
and probably the biggest disappointment
is<00:05:31.790> the<00:05:32.060> fact<00:05:32.300> that<00:05:32.420> the<00:05:32.630> game<00:05:32.780> just<00:05:33.050> does<00:05:33.260> not

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
is the fact that the game just does not

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.860 
is the fact that the game just does not
