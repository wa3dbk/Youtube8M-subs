00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
tuned there's just a little bit of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.660 
tuned there's just a little bit of
assembly<00:01:43.049> when<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:43.770> Godzilla<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
assembly when you get Godzilla out of

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.700 
assembly when you get Godzilla out of
packaging<00:01:45.180> he<00:01:45.869> doesn't<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> complete

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
tail as that his other tail piece comes

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.710 
tail as that his other tail piece comes
separately<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.540> take

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
separately so you can just have to take

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.770 
separately so you can just have to take
that<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.880> just<00:01:53.880> apply<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> little<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.630> of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that and just apply a little bit of

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
that and just apply a little bit of
pressure<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.290> get<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.649> attached<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
pressure to get it attached to the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.109 
pressure to get it attached to the
bottom<00:01:56.759> end<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.119> his<00:01:57.270> tail<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.820> finished

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
bottom end of his tail the finished

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.359 
bottom end of his tail the finished
result<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> Godzilla<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.439> an<00:02:01.560> extremely

long<00:02:02.670> tail<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.509> NECA<00:02:04.110> toys<00:02:04.409> does<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:04.920> skimp

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
long tail and NECA toys does not skimp

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.969

giving us a very long tail on Godzilla

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.600 
giving us a very long tail on Godzilla
would<00:02:10.050> be<00:02:10.140> very<00:02:10.319> fitting<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:11.009> the

Godzilla<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:25.770> me<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.370> what<00:02:26.520> God's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
Godzilla in it for me but what God's

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.680

always<00:02:26.940> saw<00:02:27.360> was<00:02:28.020> very<00:02:28.350> impressive<00:02:28.770> I

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690

gravitate<00:02:30.690> towards<00:02:31.140> something<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.530> this

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
gravitate towards something like this

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.040 
gravitate towards something like this
too<00:02:32.160> because<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.940> reminds<00:02:33.420> me<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:33.840> I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050

and<00:04:25.449> let's<00:04:25.599> go<00:04:25.720> through<00:04:25.960> that<00:04:26.080> together<00:04:26.550> for

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
and let's go through that together for

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.580 
and let's go through that together for
his<00:04:27.819> head

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
his head

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.779 
his head
Godzilla's<00:04:29.590> head<00:04:29.889> does<00:04:30.189> rotate

independently on the standalone head

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.179 
independently on the standalone head
that<00:04:34.539> was<00:04:34.750> a<00:04:34.780> single<00:04:35.289> head<00:04:35.500> at<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.740> top<00:04:35.889> there

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:36.189 
that was a single head at the top there

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.249 
that was a single head at the top there
it<00:04:36.370> hinges<00:04:36.879> back<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.300> forth<00:04:37.509> on<00:04:37.629> a<00:04:37.689> bold<00:04:37.990> Lane

it hinges back and forth on a bold Lane
then<00:04:39.069> he<00:04:39.430> has<00:04:39.610> an<00:04:39.789> extra<00:04:40.270> ball<00:04:40.479> joint<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:40.960> the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
then he has an extra ball joint in the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.320 
then he has an extra ball joint in the
next<00:04:41.620> section<00:04:42.039> allowing<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.849> head<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.180> move

to the shoulder area and that's when we

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.749 
to the shoulder area and that's when we
really<00:04:49.300> start<00:04:49.599> to<00:04:49.629> see<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:49.930> amount<00:04:50.439> of<00:04:50.759> care

like the joints on their shoulders and
yes<00:05:36.430> I<00:05:36.610> looks<00:05:37.479> more<00:05:37.870> sectional<00:05:38.500> but

considering the fact for how much it is
on<00:05:41.379> here<00:05:41.770> they<00:05:42.310> do<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:42.490> very<00:05:42.699> good<00:05:42.819> job<00:05:42.969> of

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
on here they do a very good job of

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.839 
on here they do a very good job of
hiding<00:05:43.479> most<00:05:43.870> of<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.319> joints<00:05:44.860> when<00:05:45.669> it<00:05:45.729> comes

hiding most of the joints when it comes

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.249 
hiding most of the joints when it comes
to<00:05:45.940> those<00:05:46.060> legs<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.509> legs<00:05:46.719> are<00:05:46.870> also<00:05:47.020> on<00:05:47.229> a

to those legs the legs are also on a
ball<00:05:47.500> hinge<00:05:47.830> joint<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:48.339> they<00:05:48.460> move<00:05:48.969> very<00:05:49.210> very

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:49.569 
ball hinge joint so they move very very
