00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.010
 whereas the tradition today is 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.259
 the pot-au-feu in opodo fire it's 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 really the family plan but at once 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.010
 ancestral but both kippot super 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.630
 modern because I love my pot-au-feu 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.130
 know that we will prepare it 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.779
 and then in three hours there are 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.300
 buddies the family that comes we put that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.949
 on your behind we are finished we have a 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.210
 tare to be in three hours that's 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.250
 just a little bit their leather it stays 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.420
 a very simple recipe of the meat that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.769
 butt full of vegetables 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.480
 and then from there you see it's 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.829
 party is great group 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.940
 when you go to the butcher you 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.290
 ask him for two three pieces 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.540
 different to have a pole what 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.980
 is a bit of character that there are some 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.320
 people who prefer for example the addition 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.270
 of beef the chuck or the hock 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.800
 the hock is a slice of our 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.670
 role is for example but here we are on 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.500
 the oxen do not concern and then the little 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.899
 bone marrow jana the first operation 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 it consists of good is the meat etc 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.899
 so how do you produce it's 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.940
 very simple we'll soak in water 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.230
 and until when we take away all the meaning 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.030
 do not really hesitate to rinse with water 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.409
 cold because in fact the idea is to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.270
 remove them the maximum of 100 to have 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.619
 a super clear broth after brothers 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.060
 jeannet the meat the darling of color 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.189
 she was not going any more white 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.330
 I really had a good rinse 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.820
 put it in cold water and we're going 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.960
 bring to a boil involved to 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.030
 boiling we will peel all our 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.060
 vegetables 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.890
 I have to work we call vegetables to 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.880
 the screen the classic fire levels 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 really essential to salt from the boules 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.140
 we have turnips so did not have red or 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.060
 turnip young rutabaga nothing or turnip 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.710
 golden ball what we want the leek 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.140
 it's essential to really indulge 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.100
 nice taste small vegetables is 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.210
 essential if you need it 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.140
 use it in the markets but we 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 start to find even a little 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:52.829
 everywhere is called the breaded and here 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.469
 that you know or not and the famous 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.259
 onions that we will cost dakar good then 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.340
 there is peeled vegetables then the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.399
 look is not very beautiful what has happened 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.229
 passed ben salah and increases very high 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.090
 despite having as well as these lands one 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.940
 is obviously quite that cumes 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.370
 come on okay let's take that off 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.379

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.150
 of scum it allows you to have a 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.200
 pot-au-feu the most beautiful possible we will 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.030
 clean up their scum etc and we'll 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.370
 let the meat simmer 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.980
 for an hour after she 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.660
 you're going to cut wholesale in two years 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.190
 arranged in two the leeks agree 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.690
 nickel so now it stays to 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.420
 to cost onions 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.000

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.379
 onions to recover them at the end 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.819
 Or not agree to introduce not see 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.989

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.470
 osmosis is what it's cosmos and what 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.150
