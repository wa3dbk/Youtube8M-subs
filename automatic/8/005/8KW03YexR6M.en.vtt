00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.510
 james audubon you are in rhythm today 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 of carnival 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.140
 the rodrigo teacher left as he is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.849
 the turkey only in colorado 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.640
 but before that I'm going to teach you how to do 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.859
 a traditional milk pudding that in the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.800
 My opinion is the best of all time. 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.900
 that little melody that melts in my mouth 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.940
 friends you will like 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.430
 to start you will need to do the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.260
 Our pudding syrup and I no longer do 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.180
 directly to my pudding form if 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.030
 Do you want to make in a pan and then 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.400
 I'll start with the flu, too. 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.380
 here placing the sugar in our shape and 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.710
 Let's spread here, let's hit the final 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:04.409
 It's mine to get the sugar anyway. 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:08.490
 then let's throw water into water 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.570
 The next staff she has to stay 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 or less a finger a little finger like that 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.469
 of our sugar so the police do not know 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.869
 still the amount of water you go 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:22.140
 put more or less up to give a 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:26.840
 so kiss on top of our car 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.850
 It's good, let's start it on the fire. 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.229
 I caught mine here on low fire and now 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.049
 you can leave it there 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.179
 a lot of people keep messing with sugar 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.899
 You do not have to stay here and there 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.450
 moving 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.060
 it's just you to make it leave there and 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.829
 soon he will become the dog 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.090
 Caramel for us could then not 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.189
 need to worry 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.999
 let's leave it there already shows you how 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.130
 that is 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:51.210
 after a few days you will realize 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.130
 that starts to rise 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.899
 the smell of caramel why I 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.119
 I tell you not to hold on to time. 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.219
 Leave it there when you smell it and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.670
 you also realize that your cause 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.810
 started in the case of this caramel color 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.990
 You can turn off the fire and do the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.819
 cream of our fooding ball make one 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.590
 training to start doing the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.040
 sweet pudding cream you will need 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:26.390
 a large container and we will put the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.390
 condensed milk or milk 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.890
 and the eggs 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:52.250
 and let's mix it right here until you get a 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:54.230
 homogeneous cream finish mixing 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.750
 here the cream of us could and I'll take 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.350
 in the form of pudding that is already cold my 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:05.090
 caramel syrup and just put the 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.160
 guild afraid to put the club 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.710
 mine could in my own way now 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.720
 You'll need it differently. 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.580
 We'd like to shower 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.370
 I put my shape on it already with water 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.630
 I put another shape inside then the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.030
 two here 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.270
 and I'll take it to my strong pre 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.830
 heated to 180 degrees and I'll leave it there for 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.110
 a little time 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.360
 after a few minutes on my iphone already 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.250
 It's ready, I could see how you 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.130
 You know that I could be ready when 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.500
 you open the oven and swing it is 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.410
 looking gelatinous 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.720
 you see he 's just like jorginho 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.370
 it's ready now I just left the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.530
 chosen to leave the temperature 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.360
 environment or if you want faster 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.670
 You can leave the refrigerator for more or less 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.950
 A couple of hours there, you can 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.780
 Uninformed people our pudding 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.260
 I'll take to the fridge and then have 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.390
 show you how it was after a 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.050
 My time, I could already be cold and now 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.050
 unmount 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.880
 You'll know I could be ready. 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.590
 to turn when you move and it turns 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.109
 false that inside 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:29.410
 now just get a plate and turned the cost 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:32.200
 then place will go our money and let's go 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.260
 turn the pudding moment of expectation to 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.620
 Sometimes hunger went well and everything went 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.050
 right here, personal beauty that beautiful that 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.000
 stayed could we were full of holes 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.980
 people ask me how does what 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.770
 it might be full of holes that I do 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.450
 my mourning with you to tell the truth to 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.410
 Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not work. 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.020
 right 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.910
 and I believe it does not have a magic formula 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.280
 I believe it's because of the 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.190
 amount of sugar and our cause 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.530
 He looks good wet dreams movie is 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.870
 a theory no one else knows 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.000
 It's okay to say that he got crazy not 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.580
 usually when I do this way 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.060
 always leaves and look how cute it is 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.220
 soft and creamy and now it's 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.010
 only to experience this wonder is afraid 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.120
 to cut here my piece of the pudding 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.400
 but I wanted to show you 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.950
 interesting as much tail that remains 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.250
 this is due to the amount of sugar 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.200
 we used to make the syrup and he 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.570
 leaves a lot and charges you to put 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.310
 at the time of your plate that is more 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.260
 I like going out, I particularly like it 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.760
 a little more of the country than the 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:42.270
 could prove this 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.270
 beauty 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.670
 the staff there are thousands of amusements 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.410
 of our pudding is from our dear pudding 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.020
 has several versions 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.790
 But I particularly like this one. 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.320
 my best time version is that I more 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.470
 I like to do 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.590
 This one whenever I do I surprise myself 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.030
 because it seems every time it comes out better 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.210
 I think that task you will be 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.910
 perfecting increasingly even better 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.410
 and make only buy the ingredients to 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.600
 make this recipe with him that is worth 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.090
 Sorry if you liked this video that 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.530
 I liked practicing the channel share 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.820
 with their friends so they can learn to 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.580
 blow up 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.380
 if you have not written it yet after 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.810
 do after seeing if you could here in the 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.310
 channel must sign must leave 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.950
 because every day at nine in the morning 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:39.060
 have a new recipe did not have the 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.060
 bye bye bye
