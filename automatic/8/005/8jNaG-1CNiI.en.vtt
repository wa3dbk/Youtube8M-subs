00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.790 

it's<00:00:47.600> almost<00:00:47.780> different<00:00:48.140> between<00:00:48.410> this<00:00:48.559> looks

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
it's almost different between this looks

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.069 
it's almost different between this looks
package<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.460> last<00:00:49.670> one<00:00:49.910> firstly<00:00:50.870> we're

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
package and the last one firstly we're

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.810 
package and the last one firstly we're
playing<00:00:51.320> in<00:00:51.440> 7/8<00:00:51.980> which<00:00:52.250> is<00:00:52.399> an<00:00:52.489> odd<00:00:52.610> time

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
playing in 7/8 which is an odd time

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.670 
playing in 7/8 which is an odd time
signature<00:00:53.329> making<00:00:53.870> all<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.379> rhythmic

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
signature making all the rhythmic

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:28.120 
signature making all the rhythmic
phrasing<00:00:55.129> slightly<00:00:55.820> more<00:00:55.969> tricky

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130 

secondly<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.490> genre<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.880> different<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:31.020> we

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
secondly the genre is different so we

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.960 
secondly the genre is different so we
can<00:01:31.260> be<00:01:31.350> more<00:01:31.380> melodic<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.520> use<00:01:32.549> bit

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
can be more melodic here we can use bit

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.030 
can be more melodic here we can use bit
more<00:01:33.180> mobile<00:01:33.479> application<00:01:34.140> while<00:01:34.680> still

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
more mobile application while still

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160 
more mobile application while still
retaining<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.820> pentatonic<00:01:36.600> foundation

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
retaining that pentatonic foundation

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:50.320
