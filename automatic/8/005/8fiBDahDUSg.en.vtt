marbling the easiest way possible you're

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.369 
marbling the easiest way possible you're
going<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.879> need<00:00:05.910> some<00:00:06.029> plastic<00:00:06.629> cups<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:07.049> clear

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
going to need some plastic cups a clear

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.589 
going to need some plastic cups a clear
coat<00:00:07.589> some<00:00:07.950> nail<00:00:08.160> polish<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.760> tissue<00:00:09.030> paper<00:00:09.300> and

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
coat some nail polish a tissue paper and

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.690 
coat some nail polish a tissue paper and
a<00:00:09.690> safety<00:00:10.050> pin<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:10.950> you're<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.400> begin<00:00:11.639> by

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
a safety pin so you're going to begin by

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.910 
a safety pin so you're going to begin by
dropping<00:00:12.269> drops<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.750> nail<00:00:12.929> polish<00:00:13.139> into<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
dropping drops of nail polish into the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.760 
dropping drops of nail polish into the
glass<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.490> water<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.289> usually<00:00:16.289> drop<00:00:16.529> around

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
glass of water and I usually drop around

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.950 
glass of water and I usually drop around
six<00:00:17.400> droplets<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.480> think<00:00:18.690> that's<00:00:18.840> enough

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
six droplets and I think that's enough

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.660 
six droplets and I think that's enough
but<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.380> can<00:00:19.560> use<00:00:19.710> more<00:00:19.980> if<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.160> want<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.520> it

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
but you can use more if you want to it

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.779 
but you can use more if you want to it
all<00:00:20.789> depends<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.330> your<00:00:21.539> preference<00:00:22.789> after

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
all depends on your preference after

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.189 
all depends on your preference after
that<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.970> just<00:00:24.060> take<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> safety<00:00:24.779> pin<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
that I just take a safety pin and I

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.689 
that I just take a safety pin and I
create<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.500> design<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.160> also<00:00:26.400> use<00:00:26.550> a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
create my design you can also use a

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:41.670 
create my design you can also use a
needle<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.300> like

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.080 

similar<00:00:42.680> you're<00:00:42.860> going<00:00:43.040> to<00:00:43.100> do<00:00:43.250> that<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.730> the

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
similar you're going to do that to the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.450 
similar you're going to do that to the
other<00:00:44.120> glasses<00:00:44.660> of<00:00:44.990> water<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:45.500> in<00:00:46.250> between

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
other glasses of water and in between

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.220 
other glasses of water and in between
while<00:00:46.940> using<00:00:47.180> your<00:00:47.390> safety<00:00:47.750> pin<00:00:47.900> you're<00:00:48.050> going

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
while using your safety pin you're going

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.570 
while using your safety pin you're going
to<00:00:48.290> clean<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:48.650> up<00:00:48.830> with<00:00:49.040> a<00:00:49.070> tissue<00:00:49.340> paper

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
to clean it up with a tissue paper

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.580 
to clean it up with a tissue paper
because<00:00:49.970> that<00:00:50.180> ensures<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.810> much<00:00:51.050> more<00:00:51.320> better

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
because that ensures a much more better

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.120 
because that ensures a much more better
design<00:00:53.350> once<00:00:54.350> you're<00:00:54.470> done<00:00:54.590> just<00:00:54.800> let<00:00:55.010> the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
design once you're done just let the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.860 
design once you're done just let the
nail<00:00:55.280> art<00:00:55.460> designs<00:00:55.760> drive<00:00:56.060> for<00:00:56.330> around<00:00:56.510> 15

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
nail art designs drive for around 15

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.630 
nail art designs drive for around 15
minutes<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.440> after<00:00:57.590> that<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.160> can<00:00:58.250> start<00:00:58.310> to

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
minutes and after that you can start to

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.400 
minutes and after that you can start to
pull<00:00:58.880> them<00:00:59.030> out<00:00:59.150> of<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.360> water<00:00:59.540> but<00:01:00.230> just

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
pull them out of the water but just

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.020 
pull them out of the water but just
remember<00:01:00.470> to<00:01:00.770> be<00:01:01.010> very<00:01:01.310> gentle<00:01:01.580> with<00:01:01.880> them

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
remember to be very gentle with them

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.610 
remember to be very gentle with them
because<00:01:02.390> they<00:01:02.510> can<00:01:02.720> break<00:01:02.960> easily<00:01:05.500> then<00:01:06.500> you

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
because they can break easily then you

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.230 
because they can break easily then you
just<00:01:06.800> lay<00:01:06.950> them<00:01:07.130> on<00:01:07.220> a<00:01:07.280> tissue<00:01:07.550> and<00:01:07.910> put

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
just lay them on a tissue and put

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.300 
just lay them on a tissue and put
another<00:01:08.480> tissue<00:01:08.720> on<00:01:08.990> top<00:01:09.290> just<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.860> soak<00:01:10.130> up

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
another tissue on top just to soak up

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.380 
another tissue on top just to soak up
the<00:01:10.520> excess<00:01:10.850> one<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:16.520> can<00:01:16.700> either<00:01:16.880> use<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
the excess one you can either use the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.390 
the excess one you can either use the
whole<00:01:17.570> design<00:01:17.930> for<00:01:18.140> one<00:01:18.350> nail<00:01:18.619> or<00:01:18.800> you<00:01:18.979> can<00:01:19.160> cut

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
whole design for one nail or you can cut

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.450 
whole design for one nail or you can cut
it<00:01:19.430> up<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.820> use<00:01:20.030> on<00:01:20.240> two<00:01:20.510> or<00:01:20.660> three<00:01:20.960> new<00:01:21.460> before

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
it up to use on two or three new before

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.890 
it up to use on two or three new before
applying<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:23.000> design<00:01:23.300> you're<00:01:23.510> just<00:01:23.690> going<00:01:23.840> to

applying the design you're just going to

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.840 
applying the design you're just going to
apply<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:24.380> top<00:01:24.680> coat<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.340> design<00:01:25.640> has

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
apply a top coat so that the design has

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.910
