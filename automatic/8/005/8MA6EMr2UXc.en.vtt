00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.000
 a rom called huawei for the alcatel 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 one touch 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.590
 one 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.380
 it's a rom 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.490
 fluid 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.490
 it comes with its 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.789
 it is said that it remains with pure huawei 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.079
 who will see it 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:39.449
 although 511 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:39.449
 huawei 511 ion 1 255 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.540
 its 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.540
 recent android the same 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.670
 Kelvin 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.500
 its status bar is the same as that of 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.130
 by default, only the 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.050
 names and some touches 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.180
 what could I say wrong 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.870
 here is very fluid 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.950
 comes with youtube twitter facebook 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:17.090
 installed with chrome google chrome 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.090
 we go with root 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.250
 how fast for games 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.940
 just know or make a small 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.410
 of a game that is the ironman 3 that 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.420
 they have to have ointments or not for 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.920
 fix but this phone does not run very 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.850
 fluid 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.850
 they are a small example to say it 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.790
 intimidation more 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.790
 ok so is the game's interface 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.510
 I load all the noise 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.510
 after 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.500
 I have been left a bit to say 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.500
 true 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.820
 as the start 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.820
 this is bread 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.390
 in the beginning word 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.390
 all this is worth the game 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.750
 then I will go up as any 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.320
 example games with the one who has with the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.320
 fly down 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.500
 well you move it with the 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.500
 accelerometer 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.510
 If you drink a little, there was a doctor who 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:07.140
 I'm recording in the captor of the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.140
 good is the csr captors 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.080
 of course 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:30.200
 those who confess the protectors 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.049
 you see a little bit the guide does not matter 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.380
 look for sure recorder I'm not 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.160

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.160
 good 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.750
 we complete a mission is very good for 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.970
 the games this cell 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.290
 very fluid emails despite being 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.290
 a mid- range phone 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.360
 talking about the amount 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:01.490
 the first time the x's are out 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.780
 the game that were extremis 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.780
 if not 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.799
 all right 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.720
 of the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.720
 but we do not serve on the menu 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.670
 and that was all the guys until the 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.670
 Pressure
