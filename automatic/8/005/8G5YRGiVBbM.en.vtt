00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.150 

the<00:01:41.730> pickups<00:01:42.180> or<00:01:42.390> lindy<00:01:42.870> fralin<00:01:42.900> pickup<00:01:43.740> saw

the pickups or lindy fralin pickup saw

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.570 
the pickups or lindy fralin pickup saw
their<00:01:44.460> his<00:01:44.640> blues<00:01:44.970> specials<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.580> deviated

their his blues specials and I deviated

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.130 
their his blues specials and I deviated
from<00:01:47.610> making<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.360> truly<00:01:49.280> like<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> original

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
from making it truly like the original

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.770 
from making it truly like the original
it<00:01:52.140> has<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.860> these<00:01:53.490> are<00:01:53.670> hybrid<00:01:54.270> ones<00:01:54.540> that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it has the these are hybrid ones that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.430 
it has the these are hybrid ones that
have<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> raised<00:01:55.380> d<00:01:56.340> string<00:01:56.729> magnet<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.479> that

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
have a raised d string magnet and that

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.040 
have a raised d string magnet and that
really<00:01:58.860> helps<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.490> sound<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.300> you<00:02:00.900> know

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
really helps with the sound and you know

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.859 
really helps with the sound and you know
the<00:02:01.500> idea<00:02:01.530> what<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:03.390> you're<00:02:03.660> using

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the idea what this was if you're using

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.710 
the idea what this was if you're using
pine<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.740> no<00:02:04.890> truss<00:02:05.250> rod<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.940> get<00:02:06.090> tone<00:02:06.360> why

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
pine and no truss rod to get tone why

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:31.590 
pine and no truss rod to get tone why
not<00:02:06.930> use<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.470> very<00:02:07.680> best<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.160> everything

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.850 

the<00:02:32.600> tone<00:02:32.840> capacitor<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:35.110> made<00:02:36.110> by<00:02:36.290> mojo

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
the tone capacitor is is made by mojo

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.550 
the tone capacitor is is made by mojo
and<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:38.209> sort<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.540> vitamin<00:02:39.110> T<00:02:39.620> model<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:41.560> guess

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
and it sort of vitamin T model I guess

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.100 
and it sort of vitamin T model I guess
oil<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.100> paper<00:02:43.310> capacitors<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.569> really

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
oil and paper capacitors and I really

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.520 
oil and paper capacitors and I really
feel<00:02:45.319> like<00:02:46.510> there's<00:02:47.510> no<00:02:47.660> point<00:02:47.930> having<00:02:48.170> tone

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
feel like there's no point having tone

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.910 
feel like there's no point having tone
unless<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.130> use<00:02:49.310> those<00:02:49.550> capacitors<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:51.440> gives

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
unless you use those capacitors it gives

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.940 
unless you use those capacitors it gives
it<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.220> vintage<00:02:52.610> sound<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.770> we<00:02:54.770> actually

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
it the vintage sound and we actually

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:08.770 
it the vintage sound and we actually
have<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.340> usable<00:02:55.940> town<00:03:06.910> next<00:03:07.910> shape<00:03:08.300> it's<00:03:08.660> a

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.199 
depth you know I wanted to make sure
that<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:16.190> was<00:03:16.310> stable<00:03:16.850> with<00:03:16.940> no<00:03:17.120> truss<00:03:17.480> rod<00:03:17.810> and

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
that it was stable with no truss rod and

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.229 
that it was stable with no truss rod and
the<00:03:20.209> way<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.390> got<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.470> action<00:03:21.920> perfect<00:03:22.430> was<00:03:22.640> to

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
the way I got the action perfect was to

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.840 
the way I got the action perfect was to
clamp<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.230> guitar<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.519> bench<00:03:25.730> to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
clamp the guitar to the bench to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.350 
clamp the guitar to the bench to
simulate<00:03:26.510> string<00:03:26.900> tension<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.970> follow

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
simulate string tension and and follow

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.130 
simulate string tension and and follow
the<00:03:29.510> frets<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:30.140> then<00:03:30.560> once<00:03:30.829> I<00:03:31.040> put<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:32.140> strung

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
the frets and then once I put the strung

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.130 
the frets and then once I put the strung
it<00:03:33.290> up<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:34.040> neck<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.780> absolutely<00:03:35.780> straight

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
it up the neck is absolutely straight

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.199 
it up the neck is absolutely straight
over<00:03:36.650> time<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:37.040> might<00:03:37.190> get<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.519> tiniest<00:03:38.000> bit

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
over time it might get the tiniest bit

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.750 
over time it might get the tiniest bit
of<00:03:38.239> relief<00:03:38.630> but<00:03:39.019> it's<00:03:39.769> been<00:03:40.040> strung<00:03:40.340> up<00:03:40.549> for

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
of relief but it's been strung up for

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.340 
of relief but it's been strung up for
several<00:03:41.090> months<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.690> neck<00:03:41.900> is<00:03:41.930> still

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
several months and the neck is still

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.400 
several months and the neck is still
perfect<00:03:42.860> there's<00:03:43.040> no<00:03:43.100> buzz<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:45.079> feel<00:03:45.380> of

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
perfect there's no buzz is the feel of

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.770 
perfect there's no buzz is the feel of
the<00:03:45.680> neck<00:03:45.950> is<00:03:45.980> something<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.820> I've<00:03:46.970> worked

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
the neck is something that I've worked

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.979 
the neck is something that I've worked
on<00:03:48.019> for<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.350> while<00:03:48.530> I've<00:03:49.660> everybody<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:50.870> I've

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
on for a while I've everybody that I've

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.650 
on for a while I've everybody that I've
ever<00:03:51.019> made<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.410> true<00:03:51.799> v-neck<00:03:52.310> for<00:03:52.700> didn't<00:03:53.450> like

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
ever made a true v-neck for didn't like

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.750 
ever made a true v-neck for didn't like
it<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:54.709> is<00:03:54.769> what<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.280> would<00:03:55.489> call<00:03:55.700> a

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
it and so this is what I would call a

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.530 
it and so this is what I would call a
softy<00:03:56.600> profile<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:58.100> starts<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.940> taper<00:03:59.180> and

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
softy profile is it starts to taper and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.620 
softy profile is it starts to taper and
fairly<00:04:00.019> quickly<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.620> fingerboard<00:04:01.450> but<00:04:02.450> then

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
fairly quickly the fingerboard but then

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.449 
fairly quickly the fingerboard but then
it's<00:04:02.810> round<00:04:03.140> on<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.560> back<00:04:03.799> and<00:04:04.220> it's<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.430> very

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
it's round on the back and it's a very

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.849 
it's round on the back and it's a very
comfortable<00:04:05.180> knack<00:04:05.690> for<00:04:05.989> being<00:04:06.109> as<00:04:06.290> big<00:04:06.530> as<00:04:06.680> it

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
comfortable knack for being as big as it

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:16.000 
comfortable knack for being as big as it
is

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.420 

the<00:04:16.580> finish<00:04:16.970> i'm<00:04:17.150> using<00:04:17.630> is<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:18.430> mcfaddens

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
the finish i'm using is a mcfaddens

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.590 
the finish i'm using is a mcfaddens
nitrocellulose<00:04:20.270> lacquer<00:04:20.480> which<00:04:21.440> I<00:04:22.190> feel<00:04:23.180> is

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
nitrocellulose lacquer which I feel is

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.390 
nitrocellulose lacquer which I feel is
the<00:04:23.840> best<00:04:23.870> Locker<00:04:24.320> out<00:04:24.770> there<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:27.280> it's<00:04:28.280> a

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
the best Locker out there and it's a

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.990 
the best Locker out there and it's a
very<00:04:28.430> very<00:04:29.090> thin<00:04:29.930> finish<00:04:32.590> which<00:04:33.730> very<00:04:34.730> much

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
very very thin finish which very much

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.900 
very very thin finish which very much
enhances<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.720> sound<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.170> instrument<00:04:36.290> and

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
enhances the sound of the instrument and

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.350 
enhances the sound of the instrument and

the flathead screws like the originals
too

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.960 

the<00:05:10.850> first<00:05:11.120> Esquires<00:05:11.950> had<00:05:12.950> only<00:05:13.160> one<00:05:13.520> pick<00:05:13.790> up

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
the first Esquires had only one pick up

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.850 
the first Esquires had only one pick up
that<00:05:14.090> they<00:05:14.240> did<00:05:14.480> do<00:05:14.720> some<00:05:15.140> dual<00:05:15.410> pick<00:05:15.710> up

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
that they did do some dual pick up

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.020 
that they did do some dual pick up
escalators<00:05:16.670> and<00:05:16.940> I<00:05:18.340> this<00:05:19.340> guitar<00:05:19.730> was<00:05:19.760> an

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
escalators and I this guitar was an

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.000 
escalators and I this guitar was an
experiment<00:05:20.540> to<00:05:20.660> really<00:05:21.080> see<00:05:21.320> you<00:05:21.620> know<00:05:21.650> what

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
experiment to really see you know what

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.100 
experiment to really see you know what
the<00:05:22.130> tone<00:05:22.340> of<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.640> pine<00:05:22.910> bodied<00:05:23.360> instrument<00:05:23.930> was

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
the tone of a pine bodied instrument was

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.380 
the tone of a pine bodied instrument was
if<00:05:24.440> it<00:05:24.530> really<00:05:24.800> made<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.100> difference<00:05:25.220> and<00:05:25.970> I

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
if it really made a difference and I

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.560 
if it really made a difference and I
really<00:05:26.930> think<00:05:27.080> it<00:05:27.230> does<00:05:27.410> it's<00:05:28.370> it's<00:05:28.820> been

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
really think it does it's it's been

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.420 
really think it does it's it's been
pretty<00:05:29.870> amazing<00:05:29.990> to<00:05:30.440> hear<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:30.680> played<00:05:31.010> that

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
pretty amazing to hear it played that

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.640 
pretty amazing to hear it played that
because<00:05:31.640> i<00:05:31.760> thought<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.240> softer<00:05:32.660> body<00:05:32.930> you

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
because i thought the softer body you

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.770 
because i thought the softer body you
would<00:05:33.830> get<00:05:34.100> more<00:05:34.310> mid-range<00:05:34.670> but<00:05:35.510> you<00:05:35.630> would

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
would get more mid-range but you would

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.660 
would get more mid-range but you would
lose<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.170> high<00:05:36.350> end<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:37.010> it's<00:05:37.190> been<00:05:37.520> the

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
lose the high end and it's been the

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.460 
lose the high end and it's been the
complete<00:05:37.820> opposite<00:05:38.510> it<00:05:38.630> has<00:05:38.750> plenty<00:05:39.170> of<00:05:39.230> high

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
complete opposite it has plenty of high

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.610 
complete opposite it has plenty of high
end<00:05:39.800> it's<00:05:40.220> gained<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.730> very<00:05:41.210> beautiful<00:05:41.870> woody

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
end it's gained a very beautiful woody

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.930 
end it's gained a very beautiful woody
mid-range<00:05:43.340> sound<00:05:43.790> that<00:05:44.950> and<00:05:45.950> you<00:05:46.670> know<00:05:46.790> i'm

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
mid-range sound that and you know i'm

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.020 
mid-range sound that and you know i'm
i'm<00:05:47.900> just<00:05:48.230> amazed<00:05:48.620> you<00:05:49.130> know<00:05:49.250> I've<00:05:49.520> compared

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
i'm just amazed you know I've compared

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.030 
i'm just amazed you know I've compared
it<00:05:50.210> to<00:05:50.240> many<00:05:51.110> swamp<00:05:51.980> ash<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.840> Telly's<00:05:54.260> and<00:05:54.620> i

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
it to many swamp ash the Telly's and i

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.060 
it to many swamp ash the Telly's and i
think<00:05:55.820> it<00:05:55.940> actually<00:05:56.150> sounds<00:05:56.690> better<00:05:56.750> it<00:05:57.590> is<00:05:58.040> a

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
think it actually sounds better it is a

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.330 
think it actually sounds better it is a
very<00:05:58.460> soft<00:05:58.820> wood<00:05:59.210> so<00:05:59.480> it<00:05:59.630> is<00:05:59.750> going<00:05:59.990> to<00:06:00.350> dent

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
very soft wood so it is going to dent
