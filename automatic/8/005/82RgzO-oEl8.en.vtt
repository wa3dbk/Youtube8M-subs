00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
well oh you know I think that's right i

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.889 
well oh you know I think that's right i
actually<00:01:48.790> thought<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.030> first<00:01:49.240> 15<00:01:49.570> seconds

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
actually thought the first 15 seconds

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.660 
actually thought the first 15 seconds
was<00:01:50.050> better<00:01:50.229> than<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.830> last<00:01:50.860> 15<00:01:51.280> seconds<00:01:51.580> i

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
was better than the last 15 seconds i

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.340 
was better than the last 15 seconds i
think<00:01:52.000> they<00:01:52.090> sort<00:01:52.300> of<00:01:52.360> ran<00:01:52.479> out<00:01:52.600> of<00:01:52.630> gas<00:01:52.840> but<00:01:53.320> i

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
think they sort of ran out of gas but i

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.530 
think they sort of ran out of gas but i
but<00:01:53.560> i<00:01:53.620> think<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.920> greater<00:01:54.400> points<00:01:54.729> fine<00:01:54.940> the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
but i think the greater points fine the

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.940 
but i think the greater points fine the
the<00:01:56.020> notion<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.710> unlimited<00:01:57.370> funds<00:01:57.880> without

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the notion of unlimited funds without

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.410 
the notion of unlimited funds without
instantaneous<00:01:59.950> disclosure<00:02:00.550> i<00:02:00.820> think<00:02:01.300> is<00:02:01.390> a

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
instantaneous disclosure i think is a

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.510 
instantaneous disclosure i think is a
fix<00:02:01.720> or<00:02:01.810> later<00:02:02.229> there<00:02:02.530> i<00:02:02.560> think<00:02:03.010> that's<00:02:03.310> wrong

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
fix or later there i think that's wrong

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.860 
fix or later there i think that's wrong
i<00:02:03.640> mean<00:02:03.790> i<00:02:03.820> think<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.420> if<00:02:04.540> you're<00:02:04.690> going<00:02:04.810> to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
i mean i think that if you're going to

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.940 
i mean i think that if you're going to
if<00:02:05.110> you're<00:02:05.409> going<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.590> write<00:02:05.650> a<00:02:05.710> check<00:02:05.770> for

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
if you're going to write a check for

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.620 
if you're going to write a check for
five<00:02:06.250> million<00:02:06.490> bucks<00:02:06.670> then<00:02:07.120> that<00:02:07.299> ought<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.570> be

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
five million bucks then that ought to be

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.690 
five million bucks then that ought to be
in<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.840> record<00:02:08.110> within<00:02:08.260> 20<00:02:08.619> 24<00:02:09.310> hours<00:02:09.580> and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
in the record within 20 24 hours and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.009 
in the record within 20 24 hours and
then<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.090> becomes<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.450> political<00:02:10.570> question

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
then it becomes a political question

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.990 
then it becomes a political question
whether<00:02:11.410> you<00:02:11.980> want<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.190> accept<00:02:12.519> that<00:02:12.610> money<00:02:12.850> or

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
whether you want to accept that money or

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.729 
whether you want to accept that money or
not<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.330> mean<00:02:13.660> I'm<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.230> First<00:02:14.590> Amendment

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
not I mean I'm of the First Amendment

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.160 
not I mean I'm of the First Amendment
side<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.700> argument<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.269> I<00:02:16.450> think<00:02:16.720> money<00:02:17.080> is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
side of the argument so I think money is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.840 
side of the argument so I think money is
okay<00:02:17.470> hundreds<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.250> millions<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.790> dollars

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
okay hundreds of millions of dollars

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.300 
okay hundreds of millions of dollars
potentially<00:02:19.390> between<00:02:20.110> now<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.530> November<00:02:20.980> are

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
potentially between now and November are

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.500 
potentially between now and November are
going<00:02:21.549> to<00:02:21.610> be<00:02:21.700> shelled<00:02:22.000> out<00:02:22.209> by<00:02:22.450> these

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
going to be shelled out by these

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.960 
going to be shelled out by these
so-called<00:02:22.870> super<00:02:23.290> PACs<00:02:23.650> absolutely<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.700> and

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
so-called super PACs absolutely and and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.330 
so-called super PACs absolutely and and
I<00:02:25.150> think<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.660> an<00:02:25.989> issue<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.530> we<00:02:27.130> saw<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
I think it is an issue and we saw the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.449 
I think it is an issue and we saw the
the<00:02:27.790> interview<00:02:28.180> with<00:02:28.480> candy<00:02:29.019> crowley<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.459> an

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
the interview with candy crowley and an

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.670 
the interview with candy crowley and an
axle<00:02:31.000> rod<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.420> one<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.019> things<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.410> he

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
axle rod and one of the things that he

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.350 
axle rod and one of the things that he
worries<00:02:32.980> about<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.459> think<00:02:33.519> it's<00:02:33.850> true<00:02:34.120> is

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
worries about it I think it's true is

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.660 
worries about it I think it's true is
that<00:02:34.690> there<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:35.470> much<00:02:35.799> more<00:02:35.860> money<00:02:36.280> on<00:02:36.549> the
