00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
bolt-action rifle and I would really

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.170 
bolt-action rifle and I would really
recommend<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.840> try<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.789> set<00:00:48.030> up

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
recommend you to try this out to set up

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.080 
recommend you to try this out to set up
display<00:00:48.600> style<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.590> if<00:00:50.039> you're<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
display style or just if you're like the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.740 
display style or just if you're like the
sniping<00:00:51.809> guy<00:00:52.260> type<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.920> general<00:00:53.309> because<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
sniping guy type in general because the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.229 
sniping guy type in general because the
slug<00:00:55.110> rounds<00:00:55.320> are<00:00:55.649> really<00:00:56.610> accurate<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
slug rounds are really accurate and

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
slug rounds are really accurate and
powerful<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> bolt<00:00:58.620> actions<00:00:59.010> are

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
powerful just like the bolt actions are

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.880 
powerful just like the bolt actions are
and<00:00:59.399> with<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> rifle<00:01:00.809> scope<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and with a rifle scope on and you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.429 
and with a rifle scope on and you
basically<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.910> sniper<00:01:03.239> rifle<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
basically have a sniper rifle but I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.940 
basically have a sniper rifle but I
think<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.210> reach<00:01:06.210> ample<00:01:06.540> time<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.960> time<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
think the reach ample time to do time to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.660 
think the reach ample time to do time to
pump<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.640> shotgun<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.950> bit<00:01:11.130> faster

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
pump the shotgun is a little bit faster

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.609 
pump the shotgun is a little bit faster
than<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.850> bolt<00:01:12.119> actions<00:01:12.479> which<00:01:12.630> I'm<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
than the bolt actions which I'm going to

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.670 
than the bolt actions which I'm going to
the<00:01:13.850> director<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:16.610> director<00:01:17.990> directed<00:01:18.990> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the director the director directed to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.240 
the director the director directed to
the<00:01:19.740> director

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.670 

dead

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680

a<00:02:56.470> lot<00:02:56.739> more<00:02:56.770> often<00:02:57.250> if<00:02:57.400> you're<00:02:57.610> up<00:02:58.060> close<00:02:58.290> to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
a lot more often if you're up close to

a lot more often if you're up close to
the<00:02:59.410> enemy<00:02:59.530> I'm<00:03:00.489> not<00:03:00.730> quite<00:03:00.940> sure<00:03:00.970> how<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.810> I

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
the enemy I'm not quite sure how it is I

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.680 
the enemy I'm not quite sure how it is I
think<00:03:02.320> in<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:03.010> long<00:03:03.340> range<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:04.060> really<00:03:04.510> long

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
think in a long range so really long

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.449 
think in a long range so really long
range<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.110> will<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.500> get<00:03:05.680> two<00:03:05.950> headshots

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
range you will have to get two headshots

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.390 
range you will have to get two headshots
in<00:03:06.730> order<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.270> kill<00:03:07.480> your<00:03:07.780> enemy<00:03:08.410> I'm<00:03:09.070> not

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
in order to kill your enemy I'm not

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.900 
in order to kill your enemy I'm not
quite<00:03:09.610> sure<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:11.019> can<00:03:11.680> look<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.070> up<00:03:12.100> as<00:03:12.610> soon

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
quite sure and I can look it up as soon

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.740 
quite sure and I can look it up as soon
as<00:03:13.180> I'm<00:03:13.950> either<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.310> try<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.700> out<00:03:15.880> for<00:03:16.090> myself<00:03:16.209> or

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
as I'm either a try it out for myself or

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.070 
as I'm either a try it out for myself or
be<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.680> something.com<00:03:18.430> will<00:03:19.150> finally<00:03:19.690> put<00:03:19.870> up

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
be and something.com will finally put up

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.870 
be and something.com will finally put up
their<00:03:20.320> shotguns<00:03:20.800> that's<00:03:21.130> because<00:03:21.640> they

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
their shotguns that's because they

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.660 
their shotguns that's because they
haven't<00:03:22.209> done<00:03:23.200> anything<00:03:23.500> about<00:03:23.800> shotguns<00:03:24.040> yet

I've<00:03:39.580> seen<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.210> couple<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.569> videos<00:03:40.990> of<00:03:41.350> some

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
I've seen a couple of videos of some

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.400 
I've seen a couple of videos of some
guys<00:03:42.220> using<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.819> and<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.300> actually<00:03:43.660> looks<00:03:44.290> a

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
guys using it and it actually looks a

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.770 
guys using it and it actually looks a
little<00:03:44.440> bit<00:03:44.800> better<00:03:44.920> than<00:03:45.310> on<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.819> 870<00:03:46.510> in<00:03:46.630> my

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
little bit better than on the 870 in my

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.040 
little bit better than on the 870 in my
opinion<00:03:47.220> but<00:03:48.220> I<00:03:48.280> think<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.850> 870<00:03:49.569> is<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> little

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
opinion but I think the 870 is a little

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.980 
opinion but I think the 870 is a little
bit<00:03:50.170> stronger<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.940> since<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.090> has<00:03:52.240> a<00:03:52.480> lower

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
bit stronger and since it has a lower

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.210 
bit stronger and since it has a lower
pump<00:03:53.620> pumping<00:03:54.610> time<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.870> mean<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.980> takes

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
pump pumping time so I mean it takes

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.640 
pump pumping time so I mean it takes
longer<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.760> pump<00:03:57.970> but<00:03:58.810> still<00:03:59.110> I'm<00:03:59.290> not<00:03:59.320> quite

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
longer to pump but still I'm not quite

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.470 
longer to pump but still I'm not quite
sure<00:03:59.680> just<00:03:59.830> how<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:00.550> feel<00:04:00.850> about<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.150> gun<00:04:01.300> right

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
sure just how I feel about the gun right

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.800 
sure just how I feel about the gun right
now<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.730> seems<00:04:03.940> like<00:04:04.090> flashlights<00:04:04.630> are

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
now so and it seems like flashlights are

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.010 
now so and it seems like flashlights are
opie<00:04:05.410> again<00:04:05.880> anyways<00:04:06.880> something<00:04:07.330> else<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.840> want
