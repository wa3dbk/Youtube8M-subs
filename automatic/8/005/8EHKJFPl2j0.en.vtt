00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
might have seen the video before because

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.350 
might have seen the video before because
right<00:01:52.869> now<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.049> really<00:01:53.229> don't<00:01:53.649> know<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:55.060> there's

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
right now I really don't know if there's

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.300 
right now I really don't know if there's
a<00:01:55.450> difference

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.359 

so<00:02:03.820> they're<00:02:04.060> very<00:02:04.890> short<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:08.320> guess<00:02:09.190> they

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
so they're very short and I guess they

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.180 
so they're very short and I guess they
could<00:02:09.640> close<00:02:10.030> but<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.780> will<00:02:11.560> make<00:02:11.680> them<00:02:11.890> close

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
could close but I will make them close

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.740 
could close but I will make them close
because<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.550> don't<00:02:12.700> want<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.910> rip<00:02:13.180> them<00:02:13.510> or

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
because I don't want to rip them or

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.380 
because I don't want to rip them or
something<00:02:14.170> yeah

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
something yeah

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.120 
something yeah
so<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.420> think<00:02:16.870> they<00:02:17.020> stuff<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.440> pretty<00:02:17.740> much<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
so I think they stuff it pretty much the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.560 
so I think they stuff it pretty much the
same<00:02:18.310> as<00:02:18.550> they<00:02:18.640> did<00:02:18.850> last<00:02:18.880> month<00:02:19.210> obviously

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
same as they did last month obviously

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.030 
same as they did last month obviously
because<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:20.050> haven't<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.560> really<00:02:20.890> lost

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
because I haven't like really lost

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:29.960 
because I haven't like really lost
anyway<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:23.290> really<00:02:23.500> sucks<00:02:23.740> oh<00:02:24.959> yeah

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.400 

okay<00:02:30.970> now<00:02:31.090> second<00:02:31.420> pair<00:02:31.570> of<00:02:31.630> shorts<00:02:31.959> I'm<00:02:32.170> gonna

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
and they say their size medium but

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.670 
and they say their size medium but
they're<00:02:41.470> super<00:02:41.890> stretchy<00:02:42.459> like<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:44.140> material

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
they're super stretchy like the material

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.530 
they're super stretchy like the material
is<00:02:44.830> like<00:02:44.950> super<00:02:45.310> stretchy<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:45.820> they<00:02:45.970> fit<00:02:46.300> now

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
is like super stretchy so they fit now

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:55.229 
is like super stretchy so they fit now
but<00:02:47.350> no<00:02:47.500> way<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.709> can<00:02:48.010> wear<00:02:48.130> them<00:02:54.030> but<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.180> think

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
but no way I can wear them but I think

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:10.900 
but no way I can wear them but I think
they<00:02:55.540> fit<00:02:55.810> in<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.110> last<00:02:56.440> video<00:02:56.800> slow

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.720 

so<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.630> do<00:03:11.690> fit<00:03:12.200> but<00:03:12.500> they're<00:03:12.650> very<00:03:12.920> tight<00:03:13.340> so

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
so they do fit but they're very tight so

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:26.540 
so they do fit but they're very tight so
like<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.300> see<00:03:14.510> all<00:03:14.540> this<00:03:14.810> stuff

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
pants that I remember they didn't fit

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.150 
pants that I remember they didn't fit
before<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.870> mean<00:03:34.050> I'm<00:03:34.170> sure<00:03:34.350> they<00:03:34.500> still<00:03:34.560> don't

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.730 
before I mean I'm sure they still don't

but I had such a hard time getting in
them<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.160> probably<00:03:38.940> will<00:03:39.210> right<00:03:39.450> now

like around this area and I think it was

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
it's the same the same way and because

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.960 
it's the same the same way and because
of<00:05:22.930> that<00:05:23.110> it's<00:05:23.440> really<00:05:23.740> short<00:05:24.070> -<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.460> can't

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
they're size 8 but I think they're like

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.589 
they're size 8 but I think they're like
stretched<00:05:45.490> out<00:05:45.789> size<00:05:46.180> 8<00:05:46.479> Arnim<00:05:46.930> um<00:05:48.330> yeah<00:05:49.330> they

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
stretched out size 8 Arnim um yeah they

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.689 
stretched out size 8 Arnim um yeah they
actually<00:05:49.990> go<00:05:50.169> up<00:05:50.440> just<00:05:51.280> our<00:05:51.370> friends<00:05:51.639> because

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
actually go up just our friends because

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.510 
actually go up just our friends because
I<00:05:51.880> bought<00:05:52.150> them<00:05:52.330> they<00:05:52.479> didn't<00:05:52.870> so<00:05:53.520> that's

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
I bought them they didn't so that's

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.610 
I bought them they didn't so that's
pretty<00:05:54.880> good<00:05:55.150> I<00:05:55.180> guess<00:05:55.539> this<00:05:56.289> is<00:05:56.409> how<00:05:56.560> they

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
pretty good I guess this is how they

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.469 
pretty good I guess this is how they
look<00:05:56.830> like

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
look like

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.290 
look like
I'm<00:05:58.479> a<00:05:58.539> size<00:05:58.750> 11<00:05:58.780> again<00:05:59.500> so<00:05:59.919> I<00:06:00.400> think<00:06:00.970> these<00:06:01.240> are

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
I'm a size 11 again so I think these are

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.140 
I'm a size 11 again so I think these are
pretty<00:06:01.539> stretched<00:06:01.930> that<00:06:02.789> they<00:06:03.789> don't<00:06:04.000> close

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
pretty stretched that they don't close

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.080 
pretty stretched that they don't close
them<00:06:04.419> not<00:06:04.630> at<00:06:04.780> all<00:06:05.280> not<00:06:06.280> at

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
them not at all not at

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.070 
them not at all not at
like

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.890 

that's<00:06:15.650> it<00:06:16.069> um<00:06:16.879> like<00:06:17.509> I<00:06:17.599> already<00:06:17.750> mentioned

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
that's it um like I already mentioned

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.830 
that's it um like I already mentioned
it's<00:06:18.470> very<00:06:18.530> disappointing<00:06:19.180> that<00:06:20.180> I<00:06:20.569> haven't

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840

it's very disappointing that I haven't
made<00:06:21.169> any<00:06:21.440> progress<00:06:21.770> much<00:06:22.550> progress<00:06:23.090> at<00:06:23.270> all
