00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.830 
figure out how to stop them balls
spheres<00:00:27.900> even<00:00:28.830> falling<00:00:29.789> through<00:00:31.250> all<00:00:32.250> right

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840

I've done what everyone said I've on on
the<00:00:38.960> this<00:00:39.960> object<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:41.329> floor

the this object and floor

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.020 
the this object and floor
I<00:00:42.629> put<00:00:43.530> collide<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.510> I've<00:00:45.510> gone<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.140> simulation

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
I put collide on I've gone to simulation

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.709 
I put collide on I've gone to simulation
during<00:00:48.030> our<00:00:48.149> mix<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.600> create<00:00:49.379> Collider<00:00:50.719> first

of all the toilet of rigid body that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.560 
of all the toilet of rigid body that
didn't<00:00:53.430> work<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.760> everything<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.239> went

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
didn't work because everything just went

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.500 
didn't work because everything just went
all<00:00:54.750> over<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.170> place

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
all over the place

toilet we've collided and that stayed

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.569 
toilet we've collided and that stayed
still<00:01:00.020> but<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.199> they're<00:01:01.920> still<00:01:02.250> falling

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
still but then they're still falling

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.530 
still but then they're still falling
through<00:01:04.970> after<00:01:06.860> by<00:01:07.860> clicking<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.430> cloner<00:01:09.270> or

alright and I know a lot of people
having<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.570> trouble<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:28.290> I've<00:01:29.280> been

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
having this trouble because I've been

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.730 
having this trouble because I've been
trying<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.119> find<00:01:30.479> our<00:01:31.049> how<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> on

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
trying to find our how to do it on

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
trying to find our how to do it on
Google<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.250> YouTube<00:01:32.700> there's<00:01:32.970> not<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.299> video

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
Google on YouTube there's not one video

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.590 
Google on YouTube there's not one video
how<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:36.000> no<00:01:36.420> one

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
how to do it and you know no one

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.390 
how to do it and you know no one
everyone's<00:01:37.320> saying<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.770> do<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> it's

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
everyone's saying to do this and it's

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.170 
everyone's saying to do this and it's
just<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.700> working<00:01:39.259> basically<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.799> figured<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
just not working basically I figured it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.609 
just not working basically I figured it
out<00:01:42.740> rather<00:01:43.740> than<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.299> cloner<00:01:45.619> rather

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
out rather than on the cloner rather

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.370 
out rather than on the cloner rather
than<00:01:46.799> having<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:48.619> delete<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:51.140> open<00:01:52.140> up<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
than having that delete that open up the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.700 
than having that delete that open up the
cloner<00:01:53.509> without<00:01:54.509> highlight<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> clone<00:01:55.530> at

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
cloner without highlight in the clone at

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.520 
cloner without highlight in the clone at
the<00:01:55.770> top<00:01:56.009> I've<00:01:56.939> got<00:01:57.149> almost<00:01:57.360> fusing<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.439> know

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the top I've got almost fusing it I know

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.490 
the top I've got almost fusing it I know
autopsy<00:01:59.250> highlight<00:01:59.610> highlight<00:01:59.939> sport<00:02:00.500> not

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
autopsy highlight highlight sport not

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.830 
autopsy highlight highlight sport not
it's<00:02:02.070> not<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.250> same<00:02:03.079> forget<00:02:04.079> almost<00:02:04.290> fears

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
it's not the same forget almost fears

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.300 
it's not the same forget almost fears
know<00:02:06.170> this<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:08.080> add<00:02:10.180> the<00:02:11.180> dynamic<00:02:11.410> body<00:02:12.410> just

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
know this and add the dynamic body just

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.220 
know this and add the dynamic body just
to<00:02:13.489> them<00:02:13.670> see<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.450> net<00:02:14.720> there<00:02:14.959> isn't<00:02:15.170> one

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
to them see this net there isn't one

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
to them see this net there isn't one
next<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.590> clone<00:02:15.800> here<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:17.180> now<00:02:21.550> gonna<00:02:22.550> play<00:02:22.760> it

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
next to clone here and now gonna play it

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.210 
next to clone here and now gonna play it
there<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.930> reason<00:02:30.080> it's<00:02:30.319> not<00:02:30.380> falling<00:02:31.190> down

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
there the reason it's not falling down

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.100 
there the reason it's not falling down
is<00:02:31.550> because<00:02:31.700> I've<00:02:32.000> set<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.230> one<00:02:33.440> big<00:02:33.980> lump

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
is because I've set this to one big lump

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.740 
is because I've set this to one big lump
which<00:02:36.130> was<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.160> mistake<00:02:37.310> but<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:38.120> gotta<00:02:38.450> go<00:02:38.540> back

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
which was a mistake but I gotta go back

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.210 
which was a mistake but I gotta go back
far<00:02:39.019> enough<00:02:39.049> so<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:39.590> have<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.769> start<00:02:39.980> again

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
far enough so I just have to start again

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.080 
far enough so I just have to start again
so<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.870> mean<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.140> Box<00:02:45.580> goes<00:02:46.580> right<00:02:46.850> over<00:02:46.880> the

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
so I mean the Box goes right over the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.339 
so I mean the Box goes right over the
top

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.930 

nevermind

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
nevermind

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.580 
nevermind
you<00:02:52.940> know<00:02:53.060> how<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.180> do<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.480> now<00:02:53.599> I<00:02:53.840> hope<00:02:54.380> that's

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
you know how to do it now I hope that's
