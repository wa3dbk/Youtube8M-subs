00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi my name is ulyana illusion and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.569
 today we have another book so on 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.760
 my book channel so which i 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.219
 noticed quite recently to tell you the way 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.230
 true time or bookish scripts like me 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.630
 his will on translated into Russian and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.720
 I think it's pretty correct to them in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.279
 tag total seven questions that I 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.340
 Now I will quickly try to answer 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.890
 the first question you had to get rid of 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.990
 of all your books and you can save by 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.519
 one of each of the listed zhang 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.650
 this is some kind of modern literature 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.110
 content brows fiction 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.750
 non-fiction and any other genre that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.879
 you choose which books you leave if 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.070
 talk about the book content genre pareto in 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.690
 in this case you played online lost 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.980
 because I haven’t read this book yet 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.600
 there are still to be layers with 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.059
 driving stories was a trial 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.920
 but she ’s not saying that 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.300
 disappointing so I thought online 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.300
 may well be the kind of book that I 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.520
 I will take with him the next on the list is 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.250
 I'm coming to them fantasy genre 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 I rarely read fantasies 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.489
 say that almost do not read 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.979
 so now forgive me all well and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.689
 A little jeep is my genre and I take with 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.700
 is a network bonus because here too 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.350
 book you need to read recently 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.530
 which I have long wanted to read but 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.530
 for some reason it is not readable I began to dream 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.020
 when we were narrowing in Malaysia and then 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.850
 I tried to continue it in the summer 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.340
 the same year that is last year and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.080
 somehow it did not go to me but since I 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.790
 read more nothing will knock 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.159
 paler on what I take with the city 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.869
 totally not to infection genre which i 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.790
 I'll take it with me and I'll take it with me 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.759
 I mean leave this tina fay 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.350
 boyse prince because this book 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.030
 constantly amuse me every time 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350
 I do not pass it I just open 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.659
 I read some random moment 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.630
 because all the waters of the book are beautiful 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.930
 wonderful and i will leave and because not 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.850
 I want to or lose it well and 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.770
 the latter does not remain a genre on my 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.140
 discretion and i take fairy tales and legends 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.880
 seen because too long 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.710
 read and I think it will be very 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.689
 interesting because I already started 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.520
 read some things some things in 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.490
 don't believe passed us practically on 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.290
 each pair 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.329
 related stains we told these 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.920
 things so tales and legends can be seen on 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.729
 my last choice to the first question 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.610
 this because 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.500
 second question are you in the bookstore and you 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.959
 hear how the undergrowth speaks its 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.340
 mothers that he does not like to read but mom 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.099
 insists he have something 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.410
 choose you pass by and recommend 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.480
 the technique that you think is perfect those 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.700
 people who do not like to read that 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.080
 This is a book . We are not two books. 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.060
 who are so global thorough 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.800
 made me go back to reading this 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.420
 hunger games susan collins 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.890
 and this bible to talk about sarah 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.360
 the oddity of the combination is and 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.819
 as we recommend the book for 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.750
 teenager I would recommend just hungry 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.850
 games susan collins 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.560
 because this story we are here 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.269
 few people can be indifferent and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.830
 this is definitely one of my favorites 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.840
 teen serie head games 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.220
 so far any reason i recommend wu 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.970
 girlfriend them on hunger games susan 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.610
 collins 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.930
 third question you feel not 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.850
 very good and you need something like that 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.750
 that will help you somehow recover yourself 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.450
 and cheer up 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.000
 what book do you read so she 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.069
 gave you a good mood and 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.510
 This is a video welcome and this city 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.430
 Aleksin bill with that show their 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.739
 recent favorites of years it's wonderful 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.480
 a book that invigorates which makes 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.680
 to think that so this job and 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.390
 which says that everything is necessary 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.000
 will be well worth it just for the sake of it 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.100
 work hard so the emitter alexis 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.570
 Jones is my choice for this question you 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.609
 come back past your 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.859
 teenage years what book to be 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.560
 most likely will come from reading and 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.239
 it will definitely be making a pelican who 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.640
 on a cruiser because this is my one of 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.319
 favorite most books is one of my 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.060
 most favorite movies and so this 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.489
 there will be a certain making pelican 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.530
 Altron is a sinner I ask you to excuse me 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.210
 possible construction seams in the back 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.890
 plan 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.960
 I don't know what to do for the last two days 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.430
 so we have to endure it and we 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.380
 move on to the next question 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.600
 your friend surprises you four days 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.370
 trips with you and 1 hour to 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.530
 get together what book you take with 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.150
 is most likely it will be something from 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.400
 water and piles because boats from 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.720
 always with me on vacation i buy it 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.990
 there I bring her 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.210
 from trips and boat x here's a shot 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.130
 still unread her works give away 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.800
 on will please me on this rest to that 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.360
 four days is not so much possible 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.420
 relax and read something about 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.460
 killing the next question is 6 your house 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.010
 robbed don't worry all security 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.950
 but your bookshelf has suffered some 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.450
 losing what book do you think in 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.250
 the first seconds because you will 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.060
 hope she has security left 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.060
 your library 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.990
 at 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.199
 Russian Vietnamese Vietnamese Russian 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.880
 dictionary because what is losing it 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.850
 too expensive as a material thing 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.770
 and emotionally because everything 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.360
 go over it very hard to keep in 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.000
 overall I want them to stay with me 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.690
 at home I do not want to part with my 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.660
 dictionaries 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.460
 and the last final question is your 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.550
 A friend takes a book from you and defends Ilja in 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.270
 absolutely terrible condition you option a 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.450
 pretend not to notice anything b 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.460
 ask to buy the same book and c 2 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.160
 do the same with some 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.410
 their book is an interesting question at the very 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.260
 I rarely give anyone books to me 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.450
 easier to buy the same and give because 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.330
 what my books are there for wealth if 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.450
 someone do something bad with her and 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.060
 bad 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.889
 then I would be very upset and therefore 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.900
 I guess I'll ask you to buy the same book 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.910
 or it will be easier for me not to give at all 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.940
 nothing because I'm really bad at the very 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.340
 doing things like asking for 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.910
 return the copper money I lent 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.080
 book and stuff like that I can't 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.090
 do not mine why people can't 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.919
 remember that you gave them money and they 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.760
 you must turn them away why here 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:50.470
 you can't do it in general people who 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.630
 You know, the phone is ringing and you need to return 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.430
 debts they are created by people like me 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.229
 because i can't do it 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.000
 yourself then too emotional 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.370
 hard for me and people then take offense 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.889
 like you dare to demand your own 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.510
 money back here so here i am sooner 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.000
 I will give it to you than I will lend 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.919

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.200
 that I am distributing free books instead 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.419
 to lend to people whom then 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.490
 return and claim their own thing back 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.810
 such turned out to be my tender and 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.190
