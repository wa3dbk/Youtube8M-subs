the rat tail Tang going through it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.850 
the rat tail Tang going through it
there's<00:02:29.880> so<00:02:30.000> much<00:02:30.120> blade<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.200> front<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.740> it

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
there's so much blade to the front so it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.360 
there's so much blade to the front so it
feels<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:33.950> little<00:02:34.950> odd<00:02:36.800> what's<00:02:37.800> not<00:02:37.890> too<00:02:38.070> bad

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.010 

it's<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.580> very<00:02:41.940> sharp<00:02:42.330> blade<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:45.420> see<00:02:45.660> some<00:02:45.959> of

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
it's a very sharp blade you see some of

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.280 
it's a very sharp blade you see some of
the<00:02:46.080> different<00:02:46.380> layers<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.890> steel<00:02:48.290> one

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
the different layers of the steel one

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.500 
the different layers of the steel one
issue<00:02:49.560> again<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.940> feels<00:02:51.209> like<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:51.450> a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
issue again is it feels like it's a

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.330 
issue again is it feels like it's a
softer<00:02:52.310> steel<00:02:53.989> that<00:02:54.989> I've<00:02:55.320> had<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.680> where<00:02:55.860> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
softer steel that I've had it where it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.870 
softer steel that I've had it where it
gets<00:02:56.610> rolls<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.750> pretty<00:02:58.260> easy<00:02:58.640> which<00:02:59.640> is

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
gets rolls in it pretty easy which is

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.460 
gets rolls in it pretty easy which is
the<00:03:00.030> trade-off<00:03:00.270> of<00:03:00.420> do<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.780> want<00:03:00.930> rolls<00:03:01.200> or

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
the trade-off of do you want rolls or

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.640 
the trade-off of do you want rolls or
chips<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.980> guess<00:03:02.190> but<00:03:03.260> doesn't<00:03:04.260> take<00:03:04.350> too<00:03:04.530> much

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
chips I guess but doesn't take too much

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.160 
chips I guess but doesn't take too much
time<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.100> sharpen<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.550> back<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:09.000> sheath<00:03:09.300> is

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
time to sharpen it back up the sheath is

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.330 
time to sharpen it back up the sheath is
a<00:03:10.200> very<00:03:10.560> nice<00:03:12.020> wet<00:03:13.020> formed<00:03:13.880> leather<00:03:14.880> sheath

careful<00:03:25.680> using<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.400> sheath<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:27.000> when<00:03:27.300> you

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
careful using the sheath of when you

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.559 
careful using the sheath of when you
have<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.810> there

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.100 

don't<00:03:31.590> grip<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:33.480> think<00:03:34.480> this<00:03:34.569> is<00:03:34.629> just<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:34.959> bad

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
don't grip it I think this is just a bad

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.039 
don't grip it I think this is just a bad
idea<00:03:35.140> with<00:03:35.530> any<00:03:35.680> leather<00:03:36.099> sheath<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:37.049> you're

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
idea with any leather sheath of you're

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.479 
idea with any leather sheath of you're
going<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.290> want<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.620> know<00:03:38.799> where<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.250> blade<00:03:39.459> is

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
going to want to know where the blade is

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.149 
going to want to know where the blade is
so<00:03:40.269> if<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.510> blades<00:03:40.810> here<00:03:41.230> you're<00:03:42.010> going<00:03:42.099> to

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
so if the blades here you're going to

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:48.180 
so if the blades here you're going to
hold<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.549> here<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:45.959> slide<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:47.079> out<00:03:47.190> because

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
hold it here and slide it out because

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.619 
hold it here and slide it out because
you<00:03:48.670> just<00:03:48.819> never<00:03:48.970> know<00:03:49.269> when<00:03:50.819> you<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:52.420> knife

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
you just never know when you the knife

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.789 
you just never know when you the knife
the<00:03:53.230> sheath<00:03:54.120> gets<00:03:55.120> worn<00:03:55.420> down<00:03:55.659> and<00:03:55.989> if<00:03:56.620> the

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
the sheath gets worn down and if the

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:57.990 
the sheath gets worn down and if the
knife<00:03:56.950> might<00:03:57.190> come<00:03:57.430> through<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.819> you<00:03:57.849> could

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
knife might come through and you could

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.699 
knife might come through and you could
cut<00:03:58.209> yourself<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.840> could<00:03:59.019> be<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.140> nasty

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
cut yourself and that could be a nasty

cut yourself and that could be a nasty
nasty<00:04:00.220> cut<00:04:00.640> especially<00:04:01.150> in<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.269> field<00:04:01.540> of

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
cuz I have as much weight behind it so

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.379 
cuz I have as much weight behind it so
it<00:06:33.949> doesn't<00:06:34.070> do<00:06:34.220> these<00:06:34.340> chopping<00:06:34.850> tests<00:06:35.030> well

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389
