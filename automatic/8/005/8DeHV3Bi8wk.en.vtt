00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
sony system just because it has a pretty

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.859 
sony system just because it has a pretty
good<00:01:45.050> gameplay<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:47.300> first<00:01:47.570> thing<00:01:47.810> i

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
good gameplay to it the first thing i

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.930 
good gameplay to it the first thing i
want<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.110> get<00:01:48.200> into<00:01:48.350> is<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.740> story<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.820> make

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
want to get into is the story to make

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.790 
want to get into is the story to make
this<00:01:50.119> quick<00:01:50.509> because<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.140> sword<00:01:51.380> isn't<00:01:51.590> that

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
this quick because the sword isn't that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.010 
this quick because the sword isn't that
interesting<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.729> it's<00:01:52.850> very<00:01:53.119> confusing<00:01:53.330> I

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
interesting and it's very confusing I

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.260 
interesting and it's very confusing I
don't<00:01:54.619> really<00:01:54.890> want<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.190> rate<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:55.940> story

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
don't really want to rate the story

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.910 
don't really want to rate the story
because<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.780> would<00:01:56.899> be<00:01:56.930> incredibly<00:01:57.560> low

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
because it would be incredibly low

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.240 
because it would be incredibly low
because<00:01:59.590> like<00:02:00.590> I<00:02:00.740> said<00:02:00.800> that's<00:02:01.130> really

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
because like I said that's really

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.400 
because like I said that's really
confusing<00:02:01.790> for<00:02:02.390> anyone<00:02:02.750> who<00:02:02.869> hasn't<00:02:02.899> touched

portable<00:04:55.760> game<00:04:56.150> I'm<00:04:56.510> just<00:04:56.750> going<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.080> say<00:04:57.350> that

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
portable game I'm just going to say that

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.150 
portable game I'm just going to say that
and<00:04:57.860> leave<00:04:58.160> it<00:04:58.310> at<00:04:58.400> that<00:04:59.410> the<00:05:00.410> bigger

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
and leave it at that the bigger

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.640 
and leave it at that the bigger
characters<00:05:01.820> such<00:05:02.090> as<00:05:02.120> bosses<00:05:02.540> are<00:05:03.080> actually

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
characters such as bosses are actually

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.810 
characters such as bosses are actually
quite<00:05:03.920> decent<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.610> look<00:05:04.790> at<00:05:05.050> graphic<00:05:06.050> wise<00:05:06.230> and

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
quite decent to look at graphic wise and

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.100 
quite decent to look at graphic wise and
actually<00:05:08.290> pretty<00:05:09.290> creative<00:05:09.970> so<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.600> guess

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
actually pretty creative so I guess

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.440 
actually pretty creative so I guess
