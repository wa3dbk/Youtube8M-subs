00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
because we've got so many other because

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.209 
because we've got so many other because
we've<00:00:32.940> got<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.239> much<00:00:33.360> dust<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.350> leaves<00:00:34.530> we

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
we've got so much dust on the leaves we

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.040 
we've got so much dust on the leaves we
just<00:00:35.370> want<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.579> make<00:00:35.670> sure<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.690> contain

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
just want to make sure that we contain

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.630 
just want to make sure that we contain
it<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.440> doesn't<00:00:37.620> scatter<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.579> over

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it and it doesn't scatter all over

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.410 
it and it doesn't scatter all over
anything

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
anything

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
anything

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
these are just use these usually come in

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.289 
these are just use these usually come in
a<00:01:58.290> packet<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.860> about<00:01:59.100> thirty<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.909> buy<00:02:00.149> at

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
a packet of about thirty that I buy at

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.179 
a packet of about thirty that I buy at
the<00:02:00.420> craft<00:02:00.659> store<00:02:00.869> they're<00:02:01.590> very<00:02:01.860> inexpensive

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
the craft store they're very inexpensive

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.389 
the craft store they're very inexpensive
and<00:02:03.380> usually<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.649> making<00:02:04.799> leaves<00:02:05.189> I

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
and usually when I'm making leaves I

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.130 
and usually when I'm making leaves I
make<00:02:05.579> quite<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.820> few<00:02:05.909> at<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> same<00:02:06.450> time<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
make quite a few at the same time and

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.660 
make quite a few at the same time and
then<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.350> glaze<00:02:07.740> them<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> same<00:02:08.610> time

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
then I glaze them all at the same time

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
then I glaze them all at the same time
and<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.720> same<00:02:09.929> thing<00:02:09.959> we're<00:02:10.349> because

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and it's the same thing we're because

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.550 
and it's the same thing we're because
the<00:02:10.890> glaze<00:02:11.390> can<00:02:12.390> really<00:02:12.750> ruin<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.290> bra

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the glaze can really ruin a bra

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.140 
the glaze can really ruin a bra
should<00:02:13.709> make<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.890> very<00:02:14.040> sticky<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:15.000> find

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
should make it very sticky I just find

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.510 
should make it very sticky I just find
it's<00:02:15.330> much<00:02:16.020> easier<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.650> use<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.950> brush

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
it's much easier to just use a brush

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.990 
it's much easier to just use a brush
that<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:18.000> throw<00:02:18.120> away<00:02:18.300> once<00:02:18.959> I'm<00:02:19.140> finished

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
that I can throw away once I'm finished

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.420 
that I can throw away once I'm finished
so<00:02:21.000> what<00:02:21.120> we're<00:02:21.239> going<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:23.190> take<00:02:23.370> a

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
so what we're going to do is just take a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:33.510 
so what we're going to do is just take a
little<00:02:23.700> bit<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.630> glaze

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.780 

and<00:02:33.720> first<00:02:34.720> let's<00:02:35.050> do<00:02:35.320> our<00:02:35.350> little<00:02:35.790> filler

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
and first let's do our little filler

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.410 
and first let's do our little filler
flower<00:02:37.120> leaves<00:02:38.340> trick<00:02:39.340> with<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.640> glaze<00:02:39.880> is<00:02:39.910> to

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
flower leaves trick with the glaze is to

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.390 
flower leaves trick with the glaze is to
use<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.600> very<00:02:40.960> light<00:02:41.260> coat<00:02:41.650> one<00:02:42.010> that's<00:02:42.190> going

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
use a very light coat one that's going

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.880 
use a very light coat one that's going
to<00:02:42.460> help<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.790> dry<00:02:42.940> very<00:02:43.300> quickly<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:44.560> two

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
to help it dry very quickly and two

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.370 
to help it dry very quickly and two
really<00:02:45.730> don't<00:02:45.850> want<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.210> lot<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.450> Dripping

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
really don't want a lot of Dripping

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.080 
really don't want a lot of Dripping
going<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.800> because<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.250> may<00:02:48.490> actually<00:02:48.670> cause

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
going on because that may actually cause

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.390 
going on because that may actually cause
some<00:02:49.450> streaks<00:02:49.960> in<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.470> dusting<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.070> you've

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
some streaks in the dusting that you've

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.630 
some streaks in the dusting that you've
previously<00:02:52.150> done<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.200> my<00:02:53.650> trick<00:02:53.890> for<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.310> is

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
previously done so my trick for this is

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.340 
previously done so my trick for this is
really<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:55.210> using<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.600> little<00:02:55.630> bit<00:02:56.020> on<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
really just using a little bit on the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.940 
really just using a little bit on the
brush<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.980> instead<00:02:57.640> of<00:02:57.700> painting<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.840> just<00:02:59.410> use

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
brush and instead of painting I just use

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.180 
brush and instead of painting I just use
a<00:03:00.250> dabbing<00:03:00.730> motion<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.680> what<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.710> find<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.160> that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
a dabbing motion and what I find is that

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.040 
a dabbing motion and what I find is that
this<00:03:03.490> really<00:03:03.760> gives<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.240> nice<00:03:04.420> thin<00:03:04.750> coat

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
this really gives it a nice thin coat

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.560 
this really gives it a nice thin coat
and<00:03:05.380> then<00:03:05.800> I<00:03:05.920> don't<00:03:06.130> get<00:03:06.310> any<00:03:06.460> streak<00:03:06.850> marks<00:03:07.270> in

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
and then I don't get any streak marks in

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.040 
and then I don't get any streak marks in
the<00:03:08.380> dust<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.910> all<00:03:10.210> I'm<00:03:10.330> going<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.480> do<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:10.810> just

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
the dust and all I'm going to do is just

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.320 
the dust and all I'm going to do is just
dab<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.500> over<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.160> entire<00:03:12.430> surface<00:03:12.700> area<00:03:13.270> of

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
dab it over the entire surface area of

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.700 
dab it over the entire surface area of
the<00:03:13.570> leaf<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.680> can<00:03:14.860> see<00:03:15.100> how<00:03:15.280> it's

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
the leaf and you can see how it's

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.830 
the leaf and you can see how it's
becoming<00:03:17.710> nice<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:17.980> glossy<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:19.270> can<00:03:19.390> also<00:03:19.570> do

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
becoming nice and glossy you can also do

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.500 
becoming nice and glossy you can also do
multiple<00:03:20.020> coats<00:03:20.650> of<00:03:20.860> this<00:03:21.070> if<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.490> wish<00:03:21.700> once

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
multiple coats of this if you wish once

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.360 
multiple coats of this if you wish once
the<00:03:22.720> first<00:03:22.930> coat<00:03:23.200> dries<00:03:23.530> if<00:03:23.830> you<00:03:23.950> want<00:03:24.160> even

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
the first coat dries if you want even

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.600 
the first coat dries if you want even
more<00:03:24.520> gloss<00:03:25.230> then<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.410> could<00:03:26.680> add<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.160> second

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
more gloss then you could add a second

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.780 
more gloss then you could add a second
coat<00:03:27.850> this<00:03:28.810> glaze<00:03:29.110> is<00:03:29.350> also<00:03:29.650> really<00:03:29.920> great<00:03:30.280> if

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
coat this glaze is also really great if

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.880 
coat this glaze is also really great if
you're<00:03:31.000> making<00:03:31.390> little<00:03:31.570> gum<00:03:31.870> paste<00:03:32.170> berries

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
you're making little gum paste berries

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.540 
you're making little gum paste berries
like<00:03:33.880> raspberries<00:03:34.480> or<00:03:34.630> blackberries<00:03:35.230> or<00:03:35.550> snow

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
like raspberries or blackberries or snow

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.700 
like raspberries or blackberries or snow
berries<00:03:36.910> those<00:03:37.660> also<00:03:37.870> have<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.170> really<00:03:38.410> pretty

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
berries those also have a really pretty

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.280 
berries those also have a really pretty
shiny<00:03:39.460> look<00:03:40.210> to<00:03:40.450> them<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:40.960> this<00:03:41.140> is<00:03:41.260> a

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
shiny look to them and so this is a

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.100 
shiny look to them and so this is a
really<00:03:41.620> great<00:03:41.740> finishing<00:03:42.900> technique<00:03:43.900> for

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
really great finishing technique for

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.880 
really great finishing technique for
them<00:03:44.230> as<00:03:44.380> well

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
them as well

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.180 
them as well
