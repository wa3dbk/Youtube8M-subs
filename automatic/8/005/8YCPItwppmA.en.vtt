landing craft as you can see there it is
this<00:00:14.190> device<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:15.000> have<00:00:16.039> copied<00:00:17.039> from<00:00:17.640> other

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
this device I have copied from other

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.939 
this device I have copied from other
devices<00:00:20.240> but<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.300> find<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:22.050> my<00:00:22.380> adaption

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
devices but I find that my adaption

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.240 
devices but I find that my adaption
works<00:00:23.220> very<00:00:24.000> well<00:00:24.650> you<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.710> see<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> pipe

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
works very well you can see the pipe

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.310 
works very well you can see the pipe
comes<00:00:26.609> along<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:28.439> then<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.900> out<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.109> top

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
comes along and then up and out the top

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.200 
comes along and then up and out the top
the<00:00:31.529> exhaust<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> bottom<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.040> put<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.760> drainage

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the exhaust the bottom I put a drainage

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.170 
the exhaust the bottom I put a drainage
tube<00:00:36.450> because<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.079> device<00:00:37.550> does<00:00:38.550> cause<00:00:38.879> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
tube because this device does cause a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.619 
tube because this device does cause a
lot<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.570> liquid<00:00:40.070> water<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.850> all<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.239> just

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
lot of liquid water it's all it is just

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.440 
lot of liquid water it's all it is just
simply<00:00:42.870> warding<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.350> drains<00:00:43.649> back<00:00:44.010> down<00:00:44.450> under

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
simply warding it drains back down under

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.120 

similar<00:01:25.439> reason<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:27.829> haven't<00:01:28.829> yet

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
similar reason is is that I haven't yet

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
similar reason is is that I haven't yet
connected<00:01:29.640> 24<00:01:30.210> volts<00:01:30.600> I'm<00:01:30.750> waiting<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.140> a

now<00:01:33.409> what<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> should<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:35.810> just<00:01:36.810> turn<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
now what I should do here just turn it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.719 
now what I should do here just turn it
on<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> side<00:01:38.299> it's<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.360> separate<00:01:39.810> switch

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
on on the side it's a separate switch

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.359 
on on the side it's a separate switch
it's<00:01:41.729> there<00:01:42.000> whether<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.659> does<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:44.130> burns

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it's there whether it does it burns

can see at the end of the chimney you

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.730 
can see at the end of the chimney you
should<00:02:29.440> start<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:29.890> see<00:02:31.380> small<00:02:32.380> amount<00:02:32.680> of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
should start to see small amount of

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:40.020 
should start to see small amount of
smoke<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.340> moment<00:02:34.860> there<00:02:35.860> we<00:02:36.070> go<00:02:38.100> see<00:02:39.100> takes

smoke in a moment there we go see takes
a<00:02:40.180> few<00:02:40.390> moments<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.840> start<00:02:41.230> gain<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.880> might<00:02:42.880> need

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
a few moments to start gain I might need

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.690 
a few moments to start gain I might need
to<00:02:43.090> load<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.600> up

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
to load it up

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.510
