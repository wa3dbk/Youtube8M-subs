00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.220
 hello my name is erika silva i am the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.410
 director of the online school of 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.960
 gastronomic marketing a school that 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.980
 100% focus on the tourist world of the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.500
 restoration 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.390
 we thought that some training was missing 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.239
 updated because we saw that it was 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.550
 all quite obsolete and that does not stop 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.140
 nothing was like it was not good for what 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.140
 was really happening in the sector 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.510
 tourism and so our courses are 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.489
 totally online this means that 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.350
 can be used from anywhere in the 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.110
 world and in fact we have already had students 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.870
 from all Latin America of Spain we have 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.950
 also had from France New Zealand 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.840
 so we are very happy and 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.360
 We hope to continue helping many 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.610
 people to increase sales and improve 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.100
 restaurant management is why 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.050
 we have also thought about starting 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.170
 a series of tutorial videos of 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.189
 youtube to help in networking issues 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.439
 socially there are quite 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.960
 ignorance and many students have 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.270
 doubts and fear of how to start the networks 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.710
 social 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.679
 and then we will also see some 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.009
 videos of marketing tips examples cases 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:23.979
 of success everything to help the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.799
 sector and of course I will be delighted to 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.590
 listen to suggestions of what topics 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.110
 they interest more through this same 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.299
 video you can answer on youtube or on 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.439
 the blog or on any social network I 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.390
 I'd love to hear your suggestions 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.819
 because these days are for you 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.039
 then what you need 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:46.000
 is what I would really like to explain 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.489
 to me today for example and let's see a 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.399
 effective way to communicate in 

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:54.549
 facebook is worth many people have the 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.560
 ignorance of how it communicates in 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.380
 facebook that a lot of people think that what 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.360
 important is to open a profile and 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.360
 bombing there every day at 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.420
 people for offers or events 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.640
 with the prices with the menus of the day and 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.829
 that can not go further than it is 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.989
 really communication on facebook and 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.489
 on social networks as we can see 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.200
 here in the example of this restaurant 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.260
 that is called to take Jamie 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.790
 oliver 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.980
 and that I also very much agree 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.530
 that the great secret of how to communicate in 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.110
 social networks is photography and 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.780
 very very simple photographs because 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.459
 I have some students who were demonstrating or 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.400
 erika is that what happens that I have 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.069
 what to look for the best photo you can find 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.230
 it has to be the most professional the 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.760
 that have the best lighting because 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.340
 if I can not upload it to facebook and I will 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.769
 I said relax if on facebook people 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.590
 is for fun people are not 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.750
 looking with magnifying glass the detail of how it is 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.280
 taken the photo or with what device 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.349
 is taken out of facts so many pictures 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.799
 that we can see here are made by the 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.379
 mobile 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.299
 these rises that if I'm not wrong by 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.760
 instagram so you do not have to 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.810
 worry if we were a magazine of 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.459
 paper or other means it would be different 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.590
 but on facebook I insist people are 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.849
 to have fun and do not worry about 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.739
 the pictures 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.750
 on the contrary, worry that you have to 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.659
 upload photos but do not worry about the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.310
 quality is also not exaggerating to go up 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.319
 photos that are bad of course but 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.840
 I insist on the mobile is totally 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.800
 enough and then what kind of photos 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.770
 are those that 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.710
 upload on facebook for alleged photos of 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.410
 our dishes and very very important 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.020
 as we accompany any text and 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.940
 We are accompanying these photos because 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.570
 I insist people on facebook do not 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.680
 interest the price or want to know the 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.850
 dishes of the letter what you want is that 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.640
 see your side to interact from some 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:54.390
 way then it 's very interesting to put 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.660
 some photo always as indirectly 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.640
 not putting the menu back in front of 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.860
 people and buy me but that is how 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.170
 indirectly subtly always 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.180
 show the product put for example in 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.880
 this case that the special of the day is 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.100
 this marinated grilled chicken 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.290
 etcetera is valid but as we see in no 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.470
 good moment the price 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.109
 nor does he put an average reservation and that remains 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.910
 quite aggressive then we have another 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.650
 Photo with 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.860
 simply the description that what 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.290
 is the dish is also interesting 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.690
 put pictures of the staff 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.910
 of staff working the staff 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.230
 it has to be fully integrated in 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.360
 the communication strategy in the 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.640
 social networks because it's not just going to 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.340
 make you feel part of the team but that 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.680
 also the bases and feel good them 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.540
 they will also share what you are 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.710
 doing because obviously a 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.780
 restaurant a hotel 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.970
 you have evenings tens or hundreds of 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.850
 workers for whom not to involve them 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.010
 in our marketing region put your 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.110
 staff come here for example these two 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.500
 guys who are very happy to go out in 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.440
 the facebook photo another way too 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.450
 of 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.780
 to communicate exposing people working 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.490
 in the kitchen another dish is worth another 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.710
 prepared 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.930
 and this is also very interesting this 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.650
 example because I insist that instead of 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.660
 put for example for valentine 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.940
 reserve a valentine table and put the 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.610
 phone and the price of the menu is a lot 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.759
 more effective to put something like I insist on 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.710
 direct in this case it has arrived the 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.080
 valentine champagne and puts two 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.580
 very very nice people with the 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.710
 bottles boxes some photo 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:43.040
 totally casual let's say without any 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.810
 I do not know message more than since the 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.610
 Champagne has arrived but I insist that 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.130
 makes people constantly 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.680
 thinking about your brand but not a way 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.480
 heavy or constant and with prices because 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.690
 people that do not want it anymore people 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.060
 bored of that kind of advertising worth 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.700
 photos of the staff photos of the dishes and 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:06.560
 as we see in no time there is any 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.150
 price and what are the dishes 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.250
 but that is the error that I see 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.320
 every day on the walls of 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.510
 facebook really is a shame because 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.060
 over nobody says anything the people do not 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.780
 interacts look for example that effective 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.430
 this photo they simply put that if 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.380
 someone has tasted the hamburger 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.690
 this restaurant for a photo has also 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.240
 been a little artistic 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.040
 and there people say there 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.990
 interacts and such insists that that's 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.510
 much more effective than simply putting 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.330
 what is the price 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.770
 of the dish not here we have the case 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.100
 contrary to everything that is not necessary 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:47.180
 do for example here we see how it is 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:49.820
 the text text text and the people will be 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.640
 interaction that people do not 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.060
 it interests at all what they are 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:58.190
 commenting or is a restaurant has 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.710
 have pictures of gastronomy and here 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.710
 for example also in this space is 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.440
 a good place to put the photo of 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:10.310
 restaurant or the photo of our 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:13.030
 gastronomy is worth it and it is simply what 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.260
 I wanted to comment today on this first video 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.780
 just how to communicate in networks 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.420
 socially I insist this is not the way to 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.180
 communicate what we are seeing here 

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:26.600
 is the most usual thing we see in the 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:30.020
 Facebook walls unfortunately and os 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:33.290
 I leave with the image of the photos of the 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:35.900
 staff of these wonderful desserts 

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:38.570
 taken through instagram and as os 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.390
 I say it 's that simple pictures of our 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.940
 dishes asking such simple questions 

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.790
 how is this the dessert of our new 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:49.280
 dessert that you think if something so 

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:52.250
 simple as that is much more effective 

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.850
 on facebook that put flat texts and 

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.850
 boring 

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.759
