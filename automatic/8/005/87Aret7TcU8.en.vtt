there's<00:04:10.470> no<00:04:10.620> question<00:04:10.979> about<00:04:11.040> that

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
there's no question about that

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.499 
there's no question about that
especially<00:04:11.489> when<00:04:11.909> you<00:04:12.000> talk<00:04:12.150> about<00:04:12.209> that

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
especially when you talk about that

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:14.509 
especially when you talk about that
point<00:04:12.810> guard<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.169> that<00:04:13.319> big<00:04:13.530> but<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:13.859> think<00:04:14.129> the

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
point guard in that big but I think the

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.219 
point guard in that big but I think the
one<00:04:14.699> thing<00:04:14.729> that<00:04:14.970> really<00:04:15.150> pushed<00:04:15.720> Kevin<00:04:16.079> Love

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
one thing that really pushed Kevin Love

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.229 
one thing that really pushed Kevin Love
over<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.590> top<00:04:16.799> it's<00:04:17.039> an<00:04:17.130> opportunity<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:18.000> play

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
over the top it's an opportunity to play

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.390 
over the top it's an opportunity to play
with<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.599> best<00:04:18.779> player<00:04:19.139> on<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.529> planet<00:04:19.680> who

with the best player on the planet who

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.570 
with the best player on the planet who
doesn't<00:04:20.789> want<00:04:20.969> that<00:04:21.029> opportunity<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.930> yeah

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
doesn't want that opportunity and yeah

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.309 
doesn't want that opportunity and yeah
it<00:04:22.669> comes<00:04:22.879> with<00:04:22.970> pressure<00:04:23.389> and<00:04:23.689> it<00:04:24.050> comes<00:04:24.229> with

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:24.319 
it comes with pressure and it comes with

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.409 
it comes with pressure and it comes with
increased<00:04:24.860> expectations<00:04:25.280> but<00:04:25.970> Kevin<00:04:26.270> Love

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
increased expectations but Kevin Love

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.450 
increased expectations but Kevin Love

Clank him off the rim he had to watch

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.189 
Clank him off the rim he had to watch
the<00:04:37.310> derrick<00:04:37.610> williams<00:04:37.990> experiment<00:04:38.990> where

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
the derrick williams experiment where

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.499 
the derrick williams experiment where
all<00:04:39.500> he<00:04:39.650> could<00:04:39.770> do<00:04:39.979> was<00:04:40.009> run<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:40.969> jump<00:04:41.210> and

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
all he could do was run and jump and

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.080 
all he could do was run and jump and
dunk<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:41.990> little<00:04:42.259> bit<00:04:42.439> he<00:04:43.370> didn't<00:04:43.639> have<00:04:43.789> a<00:04:43.819> lot

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
dunk a little bit he didn't have a lot

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.580 
dunk a little bit he didn't have a lot
of<00:04:44.150> talent<00:04:44.599> around<00:04:44.689> him<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.139> I<00:04:45.169> think<00:04:45.289> he

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
of talent around him so I think he

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.920 
of talent around him so I think he
welcomes<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.250> opportunity<00:04:46.509> to<00:04:47.509> play<00:04:47.659> with

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
welcomes the opportunity to play with

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.149 
welcomes the opportunity to play with
some<00:04:48.080> of<00:04:48.169> the<00:04:48.229> best<00:04:48.349> players<00:04:48.650> in<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.949> NBA

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
this year for this train to be a success

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.830 
this year for this train to be a success

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
I think so actually dan and I understand

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.909 
I think so actually dan and I understand
what<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> lot<00:05:03.169> of<00:05:03.199> people<00:05:03.289> are<00:05:03.560> saying<00:05:03.800> it's

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
what a lot of people are saying it's

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.709 
what a lot of people are saying it's
going<00:05:04.219> to<00:05:04.280> take<00:05:04.460> some<00:05:04.490> time<00:05:04.909> to<00:05:05.360> come<00:05:05.569> together

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
going to take some time to come together

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.409 
going to take some time to come together
they<00:05:06.680> don't<00:05:06.889> have<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.310> experience<00:05:07.460> Kyrie

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
they don't have the experience Kyrie

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.270 
they don't have the experience Kyrie
hasn't<00:05:08.780> been<00:05:08.870> on<00:05:08.990> that<00:05:09.139> stage<00:05:09.469> Dionne<00:05:09.800> hasn't

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
hasn't been on that stage Dionne hasn't

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.800 
hasn't been on that stage Dionne hasn't
been<00:05:10.370> on<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.639> stage<00:05:10.909> Kevin<00:05:11.270> Love<00:05:11.449> hasn't

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
been on that stage Kevin Love hasn't

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.080 
been on that stage Kevin Love hasn't
been<00:05:11.930> on<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.259> stage<00:05:12.650> but<00:05:13.460> I<00:05:13.490> think<00:05:13.610> some<00:05:14.060> of

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
been on that stage but I think some of

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.760 
been on that stage but I think some of
their<00:05:14.389> issues<00:05:14.810> are<00:05:14.840> going<00:05:15.229> to<00:05:15.319> be<00:05:15.409> worked<00:05:15.620> out

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
their issues are going to be worked out

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.559 
their issues are going to be worked out
in<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:16.099> regular<00:05:16.490> season<00:05:16.699> obviously<00:05:17.029> you're

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
in the regular season obviously you're

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.149 
in the regular season obviously you're
not<00:05:17.690> going<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:18.050> know<00:05:18.199> how<00:05:18.409> Kevin<00:05:18.740> Love<00:05:18.919> and

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
not going to know how Kevin Love and

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:20.230 
not going to know how Kevin Love and
some<00:05:19.279> of<00:05:19.340> these<00:05:19.400> guys<00:05:19.610> are<00:05:19.639> going<00:05:19.909> to<00:05:19.969> react<00:05:20.210> to

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
some of these guys are going to react to

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.269 
some of these guys are going to react to
the<00:05:20.449> postseason<00:05:20.810> until<00:05:21.110> they<00:05:21.379> get<00:05:21.529> there<00:05:21.800> but

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
the postseason until they get there but

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:23.439 
the postseason until they get there but
the<00:05:22.370> chemistry<00:05:22.520> thing<00:05:22.969> that's<00:05:23.240> what<00:05:23.360> the

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
the chemistry thing that's what the

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.959 
the chemistry thing that's what the
regular<00:05:23.810> season<00:05:24.020> is<00:05:24.379> for<00:05:24.680> adjusting<00:05:25.669> to<00:05:25.819> new

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:25.969 
regular season is for adjusting to new

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.820 
regular season is for adjusting to new
roles<00:05:26.240> that's<00:05:26.690> what<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.930> regular<00:05:27.289> season<00:05:27.500> is

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
roles that's what the regular season is

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.589 
roles that's what the regular season is
for<00:05:28.099> and<00:05:28.310> I<00:05:28.340> think<00:05:28.550> by<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.729> time<00:05:28.849> the<00:05:29.240> playoffs

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
for and I think by the time the playoffs

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.439 
for and I think by the time the playoffs
roll<00:05:29.870> around<00:05:30.069> some<00:05:31.069> of<00:05:31.099> those<00:05:31.279> things<00:05:31.639> will

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
roll around some of those things will

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.839 
roll around some of those things will
already<00:05:32.840> be<00:05:32.990> figured<00:05:33.529> out<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:33.979> some<00:05:34.400> team<00:05:34.669> in

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
already be figured out and some team in

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.730 
already be figured out and some team in
the<00:05:34.940> NBA<00:05:35.120> has<00:05:35.750> to<00:05:35.990> figure<00:05:36.199> out<00:05:36.469> in<00:05:36.650> a

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
the NBA has to figure out in a

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.279 
the NBA has to figure out in a
seven-game<00:05:37.159> series<00:05:37.669> how<00:05:38.569> are<00:05:38.779> we<00:05:38.839> going<00:05:39.110> to

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
seven-game series how are we going to

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.189 
seven-game series how are we going to
exploit<00:05:39.710> any<00:05:39.889> weaknesses<00:05:40.639> of<00:05:40.699> this<00:05:41.000> team<00:05:41.300> four

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
exploit any weaknesses of this team four

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.290 
exploit any weaknesses of this team four
times<00:05:42.500> in<00:05:42.830> a<00:05:42.919> seven-game<00:05:43.250> series<00:05:43.699> and<00:05:44.089> I<00:05:44.120> just

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
times in a seven-game series and I just

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.119 
times in a seven-game series and I just
don't<00:05:44.479> think<00:05:44.810> there's<00:05:45.020> anybody<00:05:45.319> that<00:05:45.560> can<00:05:45.919> do

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
don't think there's anybody that can do

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.100 
don't think there's anybody that can do
that<00:05:46.159> because<00:05:46.550> I<00:05:46.879> don't<00:05:47.089> think<00:05:47.389> the<00:05:47.539> cavs<00:05:47.779> have

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
that because I don't think the cavs have

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.260 
that because I don't think the cavs have
enough<00:05:48.740> weaknesses<00:05:49.310> that<00:05:49.370> can<00:05:49.729> be<00:05:49.849> exploited

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
enough weaknesses that can be exploited

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.360 
enough weaknesses that can be exploited
