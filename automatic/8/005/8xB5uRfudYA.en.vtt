00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
their creativity it's all about this

image<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> back<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.330> something

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
image on the back it really is something

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.839 
image on the back it really is something
that's<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.020> set<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.259> apart<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.610> mean

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
that's going to set it apart so I mean

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.400 
that's going to set it apart so I mean
there<00:02:11.970> are<00:02:12.090> 14<00:02:12.510> different<00:02:12.660> artists

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
there are 14 different artists

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.380 
there are 14 different artists
was<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.560> different<00:02:13.860> artwork<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.700> as<00:02:14.970> will

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
was a different artwork so as will

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.180 
was a different artwork so as will
continue<00:02:15.780> here<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.620> see<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.800> there's

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
continue here you can see that there's

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.060 
continue here you can see that there's
enough<00:02:17.940> room<00:02:17.970> here<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:19.410> it's<00:02:19.560> still<00:02:19.800> enough

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
enough room here but it's still enough

enough over hanging over the switch for
silent<00:02:38.280> um<00:02:39.620> possibly<00:02:40.620> could<00:02:41.220> be<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> little

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
silent um possibly could be a little

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520 
silent um possibly could be a little
more<00:02:41.610> flush<00:02:41.970> as<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:42.870> see<00:02:43.080> maybe<00:02:43.260> there's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
more flush as you can see maybe there's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.850 
more flush as you can see maybe there's
a<00:02:43.620> little<00:02:43.770> room<00:02:44.070> right<00:02:44.400> there<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:45.710> like<00:02:46.710> I

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
said that's company to all about the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.380 
said that's company to all about the
creativity<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:49.230> do<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.890> buttons<00:02:50.390> kind

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
creativity you do have the buttons kind

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.080 
creativity you do have the buttons kind
of<00:02:51.480> externally<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.670> impression<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:53.940> can

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
of externally I impression so you can

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.530 
of externally I impression so you can
tell<00:02:54.240> where<00:02:54.360> they<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:55.760> all<00:02:56.760> right<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.300> also

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
have pretty good eye protection on the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.630 
have pretty good eye protection on the
bottom<00:03:01.230> here<00:03:01.440> alright<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.280> let's<00:03:02.430> take<00:03:02.520> the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
bottom here alright so let's take the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.390 
bottom here alright so let's take the
case<00:03:02.790> off<00:03:02.940> real<00:03:03.150> quick<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.800> as<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.160> see

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
case off real quick so as you can see

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.000 
case off real quick so as you can see
it's<00:03:05.760> really<00:03:06.060> not<00:03:06.360> too<00:03:06.420> easy<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.710> take<00:03:07.890> this

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
it's really not too easy to take this

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.470 
it's really not too easy to take this
off<00:03:08.190> because<00:03:08.340> there<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.940> picture<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.330> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
off because there is that picture on the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.040 
off because there is that picture on the
back<00:03:09.660> which<00:03:10.260> can<00:03:10.500> prevent<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:11.010> from<00:03:12.050> from

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
back which can prevent you from from

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.140 
back which can prevent you from from
being<00:03:13.200> with<00:03:13.440> banded<00:03:13.740> backwards<00:03:14.190> there<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.670> it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
being with banded backwards there so it

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.260 
being with banded backwards there so it
does<00:03:18.360> come<00:03:18.570> off<00:03:18.709> kind<00:03:19.709> of<00:03:19.860> difficult<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:20.730> it's

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
does come off kind of difficult but it's

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.790 
does come off kind of difficult but it's
kind<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.450> expected<00:03:21.780> like<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.140> said<00:03:22.470> because<00:03:22.680> of

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
kind of expected like I said because of

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.720 
kind of expected like I said because of
that<00:03:23.030> as<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.209> can<00:03:24.360> see<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.900> material<00:03:25.730> little

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
that as you can see the material little

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.290 
that as you can see the material little
bandy<00:03:27.000> little<00:03:27.240> givi<00:03:27.540> but<00:03:28.910> definitely<00:03:29.910> very

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
bandy little givi but definitely very

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.600 
bandy little givi but definitely very
durable<00:03:30.830> overall<00:03:31.830> I'd<00:03:31.950> like<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.250> say<00:03:32.459> that

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
durable overall I'd like to say that

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.760 
durable overall I'd like to say that
this<00:03:32.730> company<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.780> great<00:03:34.140> company<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.590> that

this company is a great company and that

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.110 
this company is a great company and that
they<00:03:34.920> really<00:03:35.190> do<00:03:35.340> set<00:03:35.520> apart<00:03:35.760> from<00:03:36.000> all<00:03:36.090> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
they really do set apart from all the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.520 
they really do set apart from all the
other<00:03:36.240> case<00:03:36.570> companies<00:03:36.959> because<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.350> fact

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
other case companies because of the fact

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.980 
other case companies because of the fact
that<00:03:37.650> they<00:03:37.800> are<00:03:37.920> trying<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.459> create<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.330> idea

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
that they are trying to create this idea

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.750 
that they are trying to create this idea
that<00:03:40.050> creativity<00:03:40.709> really<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.280> important

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760
