00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.609
 in this edition as you know we are 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.420
 celebrating the 30 years of the computer 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.070
 personal of ibm model 5150 appeared 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.400
 on August 12 was presented on 12 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.049
 August 1981 in New York 'and that 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.730
 started this revolution information that 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.870
 has put computers even in our 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.990
 pockets to make this video 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.330
 we got something really unique we 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.370
 we went very to the past we got a 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.020
 team that is practically the brother 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.230
 the portable brother of the first 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.850
 personal computer model 51 55 today 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.070
 we are as you will see not in the study of 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.140
 always but in the house of manuel trip 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.350
 or who is the president of the museum of 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.690
 IT from Argentina that since 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.430
 1996 is trying to save these 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.800
 equipment that is considered obsolete but 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.920
 they are really history history of 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.180
 future let's show you this is a 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.269
 original ibm 1984 pc 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.879
 portable ibm the laptop stays portable 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.750
 As you will see, there is nothing pending like this 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.880
 as the model 51 55 was seen once 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.470
 one pulled out the keyboard that was inserted 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.450
 here and therefore it was called 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.740
 portable portable because it has a 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.000
 handle on this side and our support of 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.940
 take away of course is a team 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.760
 tremendously heavy the keyboard was going 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.980
 plugged in there 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.840
 a typical pc keyboard with the keys 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.550
 of function see where they were or here 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.220
 up if not here the rest is 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.390
 virtually identical to what we have 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.060
 today the difference is that instead of being 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.560
 12 function keys are only 10 and 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.650
 that were here on the side in the front 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.540
 there was the screen here on the right what 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.000
 that there were originally 2 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.560
 these floppy drives and skates had not 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.930
 hard drive on this particular computer 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.540
 one of the disk drives was replaced 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.910
 a very smart move but it's not 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.410
 the original equipment for a hard drive 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.840
 originally came two floppies 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.310
 when because because in one in a 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.530
 diskette we had the operating system and 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.810
 in the other you put the applications if 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.850
 you were in a hurry was a problem 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.520
 these two little buttons here actually 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.619
 They are contrast and brightness knobs 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.190
 the screen of course the screen in 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.660
 text mode was monochromatic and inside 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.370
 this team had exactly the same 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.010
 characteristics that appreciate it 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.160
 originating and to model 5150 this is a 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.590
 Intel 8088 8-bit microprocessor 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.300
 still not even all 16 bits 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.640
 and had a base of 256 kilobytes kb 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.800
 megabytes and non- gigabytes memory kb 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.640
 ram that could expand up to a 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.310
 maximum of 640 fits this is the way 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.500
 with a little bit of imagination and some 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.819
 gym turning the computer into a laptop 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.379
 state pita here back shows something that 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.819
 he also consigns the team as a relative 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.130
 of the computers that we have today the 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.940
 power button 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.000
 the fountain and here are some plates 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.110
 peripheral adapters where 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.660
 can plug in for example this is the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.310
 port for printers but this is the 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.960
 great grandmother of the computer that you have 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.630
 there on your desk even from your 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.580
 notebook and of course also of all 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.980
 the other computer equipment that 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.019
 we have 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.959
 once this is closed the team 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.060
 it became a sort of little bag with a 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.690
 team that with a microprocessor that 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.569
 it operated at 47 megahertz 1 giga hertz and 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.340
 no megahertz of course and an iphone the 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.310
 phone you carry in your pocket is 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.200
 much but much more powerful than this 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.410
 machine what I'm going to do now is 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.819
 convert laptop to laptop 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.560
 the cable quoted it removed from here 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.200
 I just finished working and you had 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.510
 to go to your house 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.379
 then the keyboard was raised like that here 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.180
 there are these two stops and there it was 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.160
 turned the keyboard into the base of the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.620
 computer these little legs in the same 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.569
 time the keyboard pads but 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.840
 the little gold plants and this is very 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.299
 heavy of this equipment that is how it is 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.599
 he called it portable weighed 13 kilos and 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.599
 medium
