00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.330
 very good guys up how are you 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.010
 welcome to this new video in this 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.870
 new video I will show then the best 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.460
 tweets decided to go out a week and 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.230
 remember that all weeks will be in 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.930
 the description so that the face panches 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.940
 and the first tweet and there they mix boots 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.100
 is this what we are going to do is change 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.510
 the order of the numbers when unlocking 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.920
 our device and how can you see it 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.110
 can be for example zeros to 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.150
 beginning and three at the end and today I will 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.539
 what is my code that of 0 5 24 and 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.370
 now when blocking my ipod again 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.899
 will change or mess up the 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.089
 numbers for example there is the 6 the 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.409
 beginning and 1 at the end and this is going to 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.850
 happen every time we block our 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.890
 tb team will change what is 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.050
 the order of the numbers is something 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.609
 interesting because when someone sees in 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.979
 our code will be more difficult 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.899
 I can guess but well this is 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.999
 flame peace slave is free on the network or 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.620
 the big boats good we continue with this and 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.239
 cher 7 this tweet what will we do 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.469
 it is instead of having to enter the 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.420
 application to check our 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.459
 notifications simply being 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.809
 a bottom- up switch does not 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.790
 will expose that small menu where 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.740
 we can see our last 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.300
 recent notifications for example and 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.070
 if I open what he could great 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.320
 I would give minute me recent notification 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.240
 and if I do that to the right I could 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.680
 also eliminate and it is a condition 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.780
 also very very very good but also 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.970
 have we go to what it is there are tables we 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.310
 they give even more options than it is to mark it 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.100
 as as chosen to answer it or also 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.260
 remove it is a very complete tweet and it 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.030
 flame is going to be 7 very good good 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.740
 we continue with the fair this is my tweet 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.050
 favorite of the week that what is not going to 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.729
 to ask is a code when trying 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.620
 open an application for example me there 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.990
 He tried to open tweetbot, they asked me 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.240
 that is a code in adjustments we there 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.640
 we can go see the apps that we create 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.170
 that asks us the code includes there I open 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.400
 tweetbot and he asked me for example I 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.890
 I'm going to open for example that is facebook 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.360
 and he also asks me what the code is and 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.680
 can continue if I open they will urge 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.390
 he also asks me what my code is 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.800
 unlocking something very good from that tweet 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.690
 which is that it is also adapted for the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.030
 iphone 5 that and if you have the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.740
 touch adif nothing else asks you to 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.330
 put your fingerprint and the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.950
 application instantly works 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.380
 perfectly good and good here too 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.340
 in settings you have the settings for 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.019
 for example if I have inside what 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.660
 be adjustments and we look for the tweet here 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.000
 it's called asfel ya 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.880
 one and came in and asks for my code to 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.640
 be able to configure what there is for example is 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.960
 for in the first option is for 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.510
 example if I want to pay what is 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.910
 my ipod then by blocking my ipod and 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.520
 turn it off because it's going to ask for my code 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.110
 for example there if I pay it and it asks me 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.820
 my code that put it and if not then not 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.380
 let me pay as with the 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.700
 multitasking things like that and the task boli 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.860
 of the control center by explosive there 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.570
 activate and control center then ask me 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.990
 code is the or also very very very very 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.790
 functional and here we can choose the birds 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.320
 that we want you can block put the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.450
 followed and blocking adjustments may prevent 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.580
 also adjustments and in the upper corner 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.710
 right we have an option to block 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.620
 all the applications for the blog there 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.800
 in the upper right and select 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.390
 we can block them all or 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.850
 unlocked all also here is for 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.230
 change the code or for different 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.180
 options that you can be arriving 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.120
 there good is useful was the fair and I 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.740
 it looks great, we're going to end up with 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.930
 the last click is called compost 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.060
 out 17 style that he will not do is 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.860
 put two squares in control 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.510
 center to have quick access to what 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.909
 what I have is what it is 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.010
 my email or also what is nap sets 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:24.420
 and I press there you can send what 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.370
 is the function of snap sets to be able 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.110
 take a quick photo and see the one 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.120
 contact good as put here also 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.129
 allows us to do this from a 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.780
 application do it also very very good 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.879
 and good Asian is totally 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.980
 configurable if we do not go to the settings 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.299
 there we are to the judgments of the tweet by 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.739
 example there in the first option is for 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.450
 put what is the button on the side 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.310
 left and today I have snap set but you 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.500
 you can put for example that allows you 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.659
