00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.380 
picking a lot of guys if you listen to
Metallica<00:02:47.530> or<00:02:47.739> Slayer<00:02:47.980> they're<00:02:48.850> there<00:02:49.209> big

time<00:02:49.420> down<00:02:49.959> picker

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.809 

and<00:02:55.780> I'm<00:02:56.019> an<00:02:56.140> alternate<00:02:56.620> picker<00:02:56.859> and<00:02:57.129> I<00:02:57.549> think

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
and I'm an alternate picker and I think

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.729 
and I'm an alternate picker and I think
that's<00:02:58.060> another<00:02:58.540> place<00:02:58.870> where<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.439> groove

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
that's another place where the groove

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.339 
that's another place where the groove
comes<00:03:00.129> from<00:03:00.430> for<00:03:00.670> me<00:03:00.849> it's<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.780> swing<00:03:02.079> and

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
comes from for me it's the swing and

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:14.130 
comes from for me it's the swing and
I'll<00:03:03.219> just<00:03:03.430> sit<00:03:03.640> there<00:03:03.819> for<00:03:04.000> hours<00:03:04.030> working<00:03:04.900> on

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.970 

on<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> beach

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980

Oh<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:22.500> um<00:03:23.640> that's<00:03:24.640> that's<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.209> big<00:03:25.420> component

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
Oh so um that's that's a big component

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.500 
Oh so um that's that's a big component
of<00:03:26.200> this<00:03:26.379> riff<00:03:26.680> is<00:03:26.920> that<00:03:27.220> constant<00:03:27.790> feel<00:03:28.060> once

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
of this riff is that constant feel once

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
you do better and and that's where it

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.130 
you do better and and that's where it
happens<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:37.840> I'm<00:03:37.989> keeping<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:40.989> in

happens so I'm keeping the and I in

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:49.330 
happens so I'm keeping the and I in
between<00:03:41.410> every<00:03:41.680> chord

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.339 

every<00:03:50.060> chord<00:03:50.270> I'm<00:03:50.480> playing<00:03:50.750> off<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.020> low

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
every chord I'm playing off the low

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:52.839 
every chord I'm playing off the low
string<00:03:51.709> that's<00:03:51.920> where<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.220> chunk<00:03:52.489> is<00:03:52.640> in<00:03:52.760> the

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
string that's where the chunk is in the

00:03:52.849 --> 00:04:03.920 
string that's where the chunk is in the
16th

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.290 

um<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:06.430> know<00:04:06.550> and<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:06.790> can<00:04:06.970> play<00:04:07.150> it

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
um you know and you can play it

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.130 
um you know and you can play it
obviously<00:04:07.780> bar<00:04:08.080> course<00:04:08.410> or<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.550> can<00:04:09.990> which<00:04:10.990> is

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
obviously bar course or you can which is

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.140 
obviously bar course or you can which is
obviously<00:04:11.650> cool<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:11.920> have<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.430> tendency<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:12.880> try

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
obviously cool I have a tendency to try

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.300 
obviously cool I have a tendency to try
to<00:04:13.210> do<00:04:13.450> both<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:14.350> if<00:04:14.500> I'm<00:04:14.620> playing<00:04:14.800> maybe<00:04:15.160> the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
to do both so if I'm playing maybe the

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.410 
to do both so if I'm playing maybe the
first<00:04:15.460> time<00:04:15.700> around<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.330> give<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:16.660> that

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.940 

just<00:04:23.420> so<00:04:23.720> that<00:04:23.750> it<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.440> know<00:04:24.500> gives<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.890> a

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
just so that it you know gives it a

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.200 
just so that it you know gives it a
little<00:04:25.100> bit<00:04:25.250> more<00:04:25.370> life<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.850> doesn't<00:04:26.090> sound

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
little bit more life it doesn't sound

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.170 
little bit more life it doesn't sound
like<00:04:26.450> it's<00:04:26.630> a<00:04:27.370> computer<00:04:28.370> loop<00:04:28.640> of<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.940> same

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
like it's a computer loop of the same

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.610 
like it's a computer loop of the same
riff<00:04:29.450> over<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:29.930> over<00:04:30.170> again<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:33.170> it's

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
riff over and over again and and it's

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.500 
riff over and over again and and it's
just<00:04:33.830> that's<00:04:33.980> all<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.310> is<00:04:34.430> is<00:04:34.580> metronome<00:04:35.090> hours

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
just that's all it is is metronome hours

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.020 
just that's all it is is metronome hours
of<00:04:35.750> practicing<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:37.040> know<00:04:37.190> and<00:04:37.400> speeding<00:04:37.940> it

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
of practicing you know and speeding it

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.210 
of practicing you know and speeding it
up<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.390> speeding<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.840> up<00:04:38.960> and<00:04:39.170> slowing<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:40.010> way

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
up and speeding it up and slowing it way

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.220 
up and speeding it up and slowing it way
down<00:04:40.520> because<00:04:40.730> it's<00:04:41.000> a<00:04:41.060> lot<00:04:41.240> harder<00:04:41.510> to<00:04:41.660> play<00:04:41.930> I

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
down because it's a lot harder to play I

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:53.909 
down because it's a lot harder to play I
mean<00:04:42.680> literally<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.400> could<00:04:43.580> take<00:04:43.760> this<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.270> go

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.040 

it's<00:04:54.819> important<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.360> practice<00:04:55.840> those<00:04:55.990> things

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
it's important to practice those things

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.040 
it's important to practice those things
but<00:04:56.830> even<00:04:57.069> becomes<00:04:57.580> harder<00:04:58.060> when<00:04:58.569> you<00:04:58.689> slow

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
but even becomes harder when you slow

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:09.379 
but even becomes harder when you slow
the<00:04:59.319> riff<00:04:59.500> down

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:16.840 

-<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:10.169> know

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.340 

so<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:17.880> would<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.420> would<00:05:18.570> encourage<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:19.140> not<00:05:19.290> to

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
so I would I would encourage you not to

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.600 
so I would I would encourage you not to
just<00:05:19.740> work<00:05:19.950> on<00:05:20.160> speed<00:05:21.290> but<00:05:22.290> also<00:05:22.320> in<00:05:23.100> making<00:05:23.340> it

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
just work on speed but also in making it

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.970 
just work on speed but also in making it
even<00:05:23.820> slower<00:05:24.120> because<00:05:24.450> whether<00:05:25.290> you<00:05:25.470> know<00:05:25.830> it

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
even slower because whether you know it

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.520 
even slower because whether you know it
or<00:05:26.070> not<00:05:26.270> you<00:05:27.270> know<00:05:27.390> you<00:05:27.450> a<00:05:27.870> lot<00:05:28.080> of<00:05:28.200> people<00:05:28.440> are

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
or not you know you a lot of people are

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.430 
or not you know you a lot of people are
very<00:05:28.560> wowed<00:05:29.040> by<00:05:29.150> fast<00:05:30.150> drumming<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:30.900> fast

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
something like that you're playing

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:47.570

eighth notes boom um there's space and
every<00:05:47.880> note<00:05:48.180> has<00:05:48.600> a<00:05:48.630> value<00:05:49.350> and<00:05:49.560> if<00:05:49.920> you<00:05:50.070> rush

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
every note has a value and if you rush

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.190 
every note has a value and if you rush
one<00:05:50.640> note<00:05:50.940> over<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.390> other<00:05:51.600> you've<00:05:51.840> choked

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.260 
that note out of its value you've rushed
this<00:05:55.050> next<00:05:55.440> beat<00:05:55.730> and<00:05:56.730> that's<00:05:56.850> where<00:05:57.150> the

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
this next beat and that's where the

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.300 
this next beat and that's where the
where<00:05:57.840> you<00:05:57.930> start<00:05:58.140> to<00:05:58.230> lose<00:05:58.500> that<00:05:58.530> so<00:05:59.070> I

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
where you start to lose that so I

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.030 
where you start to lose that so I
practice<00:05:59.970> playing<00:06:00.210> really<00:06:00.660> slow<00:06:00.960> in<00:06:01.650> order<00:06:01.890> to
