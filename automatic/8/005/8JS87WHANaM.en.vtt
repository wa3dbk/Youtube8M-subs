like i did this on purpose here we have
my<00:00:36.840> other<00:00:36.930> galaxy<00:00:37.500> note<00:00:37.680> 2<00:00:38.450> but<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.719> I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
my other galaxy note 2 but what I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.310 
my other galaxy note 2 but what I
realized<00:00:40.489> above<00:00:41.489> when<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> did<00:00:42.660> crush<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
realized above when I did crush this

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
realized above when I did crush this
screen<00:00:45.140> that<00:00:46.140> galaxy<00:00:46.649> note<00:00:46.800> 2<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
screen that galaxy note 2 is that I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.869 
screen that galaxy note 2 is that I
realized<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.260> new<00:00:49.530> got<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.010> grab<00:00:50.399> ass<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
realized that this new got a grab ass to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.380 
realized that this new got a grab ass to
that<00:00:50.910> sounds<00:00:51.360> insane<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> they're<00:00:52.050> using<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
that sounds insane that they're using it

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.180 
that sounds insane that they're using it
breaking<00:00:54.390> sucks<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.199> think<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.860> previous

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
breaking sucks I think that the previous

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.459 
breaking sucks I think that the previous
generation<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> grab<00:00:57.120> ass<00:00:57.329> feels<00:00:58.140> like<00:00:58.199> it's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
generation of grab ass feels like it's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.099 
generation of grab ass feels like it's
stronger<00:00:59.100> because<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.760> don't<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.600> why<00:01:00.809> but

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
stronger because I don't know why but

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.399 
stronger because I don't know why but
the<00:01:01.590> gas<00:01:02.190> seems<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.820> shatter<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.750> very<00:01:04.199> very

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the gas seems to shatter very very very

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.950 
the gas seems to shatter very very very
easily<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.700> also<00:01:06.390> there<00:01:06.510> was<00:01:06.600> something<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
easily and also there was something I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.789 
easily and also there was something I
realized<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.439> galaxy<00:01:08.040> s3<00:01:08.610> hey<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.990> got<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> huge

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
realized my galaxy s3 hey I got a huge

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.380 
realized my galaxy s3 hey I got a huge
scratch<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.760> even<00:01:12.060> though<00:01:12.180> they

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
scratch on that one even though they

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.539 
scratch on that one even though they
throw<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> ground<00:01:13.229> when<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.799> was<00:01:14.010> when

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
something could produce some quality

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.590 
something could produce some quality
smartphones<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.840> will<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:32.670> won't<00:01:33.360> be

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
smartphones that will that won't be

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.560 
smartphones that will that won't be
crushed<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.229> easily<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.820> for

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570

real the iphone 5 the iPhone 5 has

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.670 
real the iphone 5 the iPhone 5 has
stronger<00:01:40.470> class<00:01:41.040> okay<00:01:41.960> because<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.140> did<00:01:43.409> a

the<00:01:49.439> iphone<00:01:49.770> 5<00:01:49.950> actually<00:01:50.369> survived<00:01:50.790> my

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the iphone 5 actually survived my

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.560 
the iphone 5 actually survived my
sledgehammer<00:01:51.270> form<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.850> from<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.270> 50

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
sledgehammer form like get from like 50

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.370 
sledgehammer form like get from like 50
centimeters<00:01:55.170> when<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.399> got<00:01:56.610> crushed

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
centimeters when this one got crushed

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.789 
centimeters when this one got crushed
you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.500> very<00:01:58.530> very<00:01:59.009> bad<00:01:59.430> at<00:02:00.079> around<00:02:01.079> 30

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you know very very bad at around 30

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.050 
you know very very bad at around 30
centimeters<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.689> sucks<00:02:05.000> something<00:02:06.000> you

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
centimeters so that sucks something you

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.700 
centimeters so that sucks something you
need<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.210> fix<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:07.110> annoying<00:02:08.000> used

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
need to fix this it's annoying used
