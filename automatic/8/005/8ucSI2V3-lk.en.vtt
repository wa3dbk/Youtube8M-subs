00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.769
 hello I'm super give 135 and this time 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.019
 I come with this video entitled critical to 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.120
 galp the demolitioner warned them that it is not 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.280
 destructive criticism for own reasons 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.980
 I did not do it like I promised it good 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.960
 I start the video first to me 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.269
 it seemed good the story is not a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.789
 history that gives roe nor is it a 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.070
 history of wade fuck and very apt for 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.019
 child public and in my opinion this 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.490
 movie can not be seen by people who 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.770
 do not know what fart with video games 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.900
 because they will not understand any whore 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.790
 mother 'to this movie I also think 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.040
 that there were many characters left in the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.740
 movie like for example some ni 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.630
 Islanders some play some reuters 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.220
 sweet fans of the sugar reuters and 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.560
 some soldiers of heroes beauty 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.930
 I also say that they exaggerated a lot with the 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.090
 rus sugar scenario that was almost 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.760
 in the whole movie and this is what is 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.320
 it makes me illogical about the movie one that 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.540
 michelle building and which 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.540
 Ralph destroys too great for 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.790
 level anders and up to fit in role 2 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.060
 you do not know where he lives fix it 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 Felix 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.119
 3 that you also do not know where they live 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.579
 the sugar reuters 4 that there is none 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.220
 of the 4 elements in its garros the air 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.950
 it's sugar the swamps are sweet and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.259
 there is no fire or water and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.119
 last eros beauty is on a planet that 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.159
 it is not the land but it has conditions 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.869
 good to live but the question is 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 how some humans got there 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.340
 including the sargenta calhoun yes 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.259
 they are very far from the earth years and as 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.200
 you do not notice in your face the years 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.470
 they were in the good space but so 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.360
 are the cartoons meaningless not and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.369
 Now I'm going to say what I did not think 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.289
 of the movie first that after 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.569
 so many years michel anders followed 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.310
 having contempt for ralph but I admit 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:52.439
 that without this point it would not have been done 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.420
 the second movie how strange I lived in 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.340
 a third trashcan that the sargenta 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.319
 calhoun at the beginning of the film there 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.539
 been very rude with ralph and felix and that 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.549
 then he apologized to Felix giving him a 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.170
 fourth kiss that they go that has been 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.360
 very rude at the beginning of the movie 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.580
 with ralp and then he apologized with 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.709
 Real brando him a good hug but so 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.990
 are women warm and cold when 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.210
 they want fifth that kim candy turbo 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.010
 has been jealous for a new game in my 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.960
 opinion that could not have thought that 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.210
 more players would come to the arcade than 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.950
 I would play in his game but I also admit 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.410
 that without this point I would not have continued 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.540
 the sixth movie that made him a lot 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.580
 but too much discrimination to vanrell 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.680
 or hairs play reuters although also 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.690
 this point was essential for the movie 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.970
 and finally that they do what they have 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.640
 destroyed his karts the jiffy and the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.650
 candy card of the princess the band 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.990
 sound was very good because it is very 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.820
 related to this topic I also think 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.250
 that if they had not put characters 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.650
 known from video games as sonic 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.390
 pacman mario bros among others no 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.270
 many people would have gone to see the 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.370
 film this movie or buy it another 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.870
 thing although you do not believe it the movie is 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.300
 it looks like the movie monsters 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.850
 also incorporated disney I will tell 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.990
 why one the protagonist is a 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.030
 giant panz in this case real 2 the 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.770
 protagonist has a very low friend of 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.430
 stature that sometimes disagrees 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.890
 with the protagonist in this case Felix 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.540
 3 the movie was about something in 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.359
 specific but everything changed when 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.340
 he met a girl the protagonist in 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.579
 this case that real wanted to be a hero and 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.379
 vanrell or p4 that the protagonist is 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.109
 have to face the villain of the 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.290
 girl who knew in this case who candy 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.870
 turbo i5 that at the end of the movie the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.750
 protagonist befriends the girl in 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.030
 this real case pib to mdio pe something more 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.250
 skerrit very short hand I copy to the 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.989
 3 movie forever in the part 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.629
 in which raÃºl punches the 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.579
 cake that also made it something that 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.829
 I did not like it in the dubbing is the voice of 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.720
 bnp the truth now the voice of Mary 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.760
 antonieta of the snows is of a 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.900
 old lady not of a girl like in the boy 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.389
 eight 'years ago 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.819
 another thing is that this movie had 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.680
 success and he deserved the oscar 2013 as 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.719
 better fight or nothing not that shit of 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.480
 brave movie that I did not like 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:10.590
 in the least bit good in conclusion the 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.139
 movie is good 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.389
 fun and tender good with this 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:20.030
