00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.710
 congratulations you're pregnant I know what 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.230
 most important to you at this time 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.510
 is the baby that you carry inside you know that 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.980
 If you do not take care of your oral health you can 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.980
 affect the development of your baby 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.880
 During pregnancy, many 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.380
 changes in the organism that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 manifest in many parts of the body 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.540
 and normally the mouth is one of the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.610
 great forgotten we know that in the 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.320
 third trimester pregnancy and in the 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.359
 first months of lactation are 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.010
 produce important changes in the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.470
 composition of the saliva that can 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.420
 affect the susceptibility to suffer 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.090
 caries seven out of ten pregnant women 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.430
 they suffer inflammation of the gums what 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.470
 it's called pregnancy gingivitis is very 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.379
 typical at this stage and that is 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.500
 produce large vascular changes and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.930
 hormonal increase in progesterone and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.760
 bohemian increase that is to say the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.290
 increase in blood in the body of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.629
 the mother because she has to create a 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.909
 new life makes the gums 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.739
 inflamen and tend to bleed control 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.710
 of the inflammation of the gums of the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.330
 pregnant mom is important because there 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.490
 certain studies that we have been told 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.770
 which can cause premature labor 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.240
 It says that the fetus when it is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 growing when it is in formation 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.400
 within the environment of the mother steals the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.409
 Mom calcium that lacks 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.749
 absolutely foundation because 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.819
 actually that calcium with which goes to 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:25.590
 form his skeleton he takes it from the diet 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.960
 of the mother if the mother's diet does not 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.179
 it's rich in dairy, the normal thing is that 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.950
 fetus take that calcium to form its 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.020
 own skeleton of reservations 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.880
 skeletons of the bone mother of the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.829
 mother but never from the teeth of 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.929
 way that is said that when the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.840
 dental mobility exists in mom 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.789
 pregnant woman is because she secretes 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.380
 hormone called relaxin that makes 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.789
 that the periodontal ligaments is equal 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.729
 that ligaments from other parts of the 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.950
 body become more lax and provoke 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.049
 dental mobility but that mobility 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.060
 the reality is caused by the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.920
 gingivitis of pregnancy ie 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.409
 inflamed gums that we're not 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.209
 adequately controlling nausea and 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.619
 Vomiting is frequent during the 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.929
 pregnancy especially during the first 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.390
 quarter we have to take into account 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.400
 that these vomits provoke a lot 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.170
 acid that makes teeth can be 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.000
 wear out at this stage during 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.010
 pregnancy is essential to have a 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.989
 Exquisite hygiene visit 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.970
 specialist to see if our 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.609
 gums are healthy so you see if the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.880
 surface of the enamel is intact and I 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.370
 I recommend that you 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.870
 a lot of milk because the dairy cheese 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.510
 Milk remineralizes in our enamel 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.360
 the stars when you drink cold things 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.269
 or hot you feel a whip when 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.860
 take very sugary foods stay 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.459
 a little while and I'll give you the advice 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.459
 to avoid it
