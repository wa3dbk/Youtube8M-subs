00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:09.830
 dear friends after the train starts in 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.830
 ruby stone variant 3 resp 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.980
 3-4 black would like players on 16 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.949
 but raise this immediately 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.550
 is not so beautiful Christmas springer 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.000
 bad sex bad from 6 the one there 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.250
 Spinnerin freikam further drugs 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 Wednesday 5 means that usually means 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.980
 black the rule tries swivel ex 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.079
 to prepare 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.450
 Spain is mostly played that me 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.100
 the second big often variant next to or 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.520
 imaginative with intent the black game 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.320
 on 56 countries and Bavarian exchange 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.469
 fight back with the other springer 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:01.789
 and here i am listening to a build up 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.199
 with controllable substitute offer 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.199
 We are well aware that in 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.049
 development phase there are two methods 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.080
 a uniform figure development that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.100
 what is in textbooks as the last 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 truth and otherwise others dynamic 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 dynamic development, for example 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.350
 first attack the storms 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.689
 bring and then in the gaps the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.630
 striker messed everything up 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.869
 had in size the size 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.960
 hit there then come the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.159
 Substitute player here next to striker 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.470
 jump here attack 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.909
 according to this concept and after 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.759
 norway jump the train pass 62 so 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.510
 Although a versatile train is from 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.330
 one side irradiated opponents 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.330
 from the other side knows comes faster 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:07.090
 drive so long and that also herbert 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.100
 that the 151 are being reset because 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.480
 The goal is as fast as possible 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.720
 just managed to create 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.240
 and what is especially amazing is very 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.910
 many fall into the trap here 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.600
 spinner stretch here about hidden g 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.180
 that's nothing special but if 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.300
 it black pink plays her sex and that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.170
 16 times already happened in cheshire 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.620
 concrete practice then goes black 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.590
 We think about it almost immediately 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.590
 which combo knows could here 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.590
 realize 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.450
 I think that many already beat this 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.690
 have seen 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.459
 here it works with walk-in closets 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:00.550
 7 is also excellent at 7 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.300
 curled up and then with the b 58 one 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.330
 Offer few runners so not only build 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.140
 is going to be conquered by this action 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.720
 but also the black tree structure 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.320
 smashed and fathers complex 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.660
 frightened 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.420
 that means white already after ten moves 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.780
 is on profit 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.870
 I have a party to demonstrate 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.030
 chosen by later number one in 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.540
 world ranking 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:38.310
 magnus carlsen year 2006 has against 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:41.560
 norwegian materials here are just these 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.110
 practical opportunity used and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.909
 opponent's place is still trying with 1005 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:51.340
 steam rises 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:54.950
 now with farmers less to claim 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.310
 benefit from 36 the idea was too 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.330
 interesting of materials with 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.849
 Shakespeare's control 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.400
 promoter complex in the tenant 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.890
 actually good thing and then on the b 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.129
 and c lines to launch counterattack 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.400
 but there are no weaknesses at all 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.799
 ownership of more tree differently can shows 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:21.859
 it's all interesting but not 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:24.680
 enough spring re 2 re 7 11 3 so 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.600
 it was his band also offered that 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.580
 the opponent is restricted springer 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.729
 and jump from e24 or tent can too 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:38.080
 attack chemical build 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:40.880
 now from 83 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.680
 that was the idea of doppelbauer beside 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.639
 to use the lines 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:50.330
 a good concept but not enough 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.150
 start it was here enough power 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.860
 the black against Spielberg and 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.669
 options to neutralize 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.430
 Now black is practically here 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.520
 his activity is now trying 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.729
 from the other side through more 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:12.580
 but we see that at night at one 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.800
 followed by springer 4 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.700
 white stands optimally with its builder 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:24.440
 and upward he stretches into 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:28.400
 durchsteckte 108 black best springer 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:31.030
 endgame were to know that springer 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.889
 a game is like building in the game 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.280
 website offered little rule easily 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:41.220
 imagine that if a farmer a game 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.620
 won is won then too 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:48.699
 cabinets racing game grass and mr first 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.759
 concentrated here with h4 and g4 of the 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:54.039
 black springer even more or with 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.030
 king if we knew women early in the 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:00.750
 won the game 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.750
 So we are that this story with 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.090
 427 while working from sheep that is 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.370
 already known for decades but off 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.740
 any reasons will still be 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.379
 hold new ones 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.969
 So maybe in our lot 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:17.969
 after this process
