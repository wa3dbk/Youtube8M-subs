with you all the way around you're
inhaling<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:15.030> side<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.570> exhaling<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.409> other

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
inhaling one side and exhaling the other

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.580 
inhaling one side and exhaling the other
side<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.610> let<00:01:17.939> your<00:01:18.210> arms<00:01:18.240> go<00:01:18.900> let<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
wrist go and the hands can just be

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.520 
wrist go and the hands can just be
really<00:01:22.619> floppy<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.570> actually<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:25.049> slap

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
really floppy and actually you can slap

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
really floppy and actually you can slap
yourself<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.490> body<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.090> little

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
yourself on your body just a little

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.880 
yourself on your body just a little
whipping<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.750> energy<00:01:28.200> right<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
whipping the energy right out of the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.630 
whipping the energy right out of the
fingertips<00:01:29.689> put<00:01:30.689> your<00:01:30.840> attention<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:32.490> your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
fingertips put your attention on to your

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.600 
fingertips put your attention on to your
spine<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.860> visualize<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.159> these<00:01:35.400> different

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
spine and visualize all these different

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.390 
spine and visualize all these different
vertebrae<00:01:36.150> moving<00:01:36.689> independently<00:01:37.400> this

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
vertebrae moving independently this

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.670 
vertebrae moving independently this
movement<00:01:39.030> bringing<00:01:39.540> twisting<00:01:40.380> into<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
movement bringing twisting into the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.490 
movement bringing twisting into the
spine<00:01:40.920> really<00:01:41.189> helps<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.850> increase<00:01:42.780> range<00:01:43.320> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
spine really helps to increase range of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.749 
spine really helps to increase range of
motion<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:43.979> spine<00:01:44.220> which<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.549> so

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
motion to the spine which is so

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.810 
motion to the spine which is so
important<00:01:45.390> especially<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.799> age<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.549> helps

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
important especially as we age and helps

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.210 
important especially as we age and helps
to<00:01:47.970> increase<00:01:48.420> flexibility<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.040> want

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
to increase flexibility to and you want

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
to increase flexibility to and you want
to<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:51.060> at<00:01:51.210> least<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.689> good<00:01:51.899> solid<00:01:52.259> two

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
to do this for at least a good solid two

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.469 
to do this for at least a good solid two
minutes<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.310> video<00:01:53.640> I'm<00:01:53.909> doing<00:01:54.329> this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
minutes so in this video I'm doing this

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.690 
minutes so in this video I'm doing this
for<00:01:54.540> two<00:01:55.110> minutes<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:56.340> you're<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.640> up

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
for two minutes so if you're not up

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.999 
for two minutes so if you're not up
already<00:01:57.240> stand<00:01:57.659> up<00:01:57.869> back<00:01:58.290> away<00:01:58.469> from<00:01:58.649> your
