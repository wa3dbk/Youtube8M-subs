00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
still lucky to the point where we still

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.450 
still lucky to the point where we still
have<00:00:58.359> powerful<00:00:58.780> cards<00:00:59.320> that<00:00:59.800> we<00:00:59.920> did<00:01:00.100> not<00:01:00.129> have

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
have powerful cards that we did not have

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.959 
have powerful cards that we did not have
back<00:01:00.820> then<00:01:01.179> but<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.170> only<00:01:02.350> thing<00:01:02.469> is<00:01:02.679> that<00:01:03.219> you

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
back then but the only thing is that you

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.850 
back then but the only thing is that you
will<00:01:04.120> get<00:01:04.269> punished<00:01:04.920> now<00:01:05.920> more<00:01:06.850> severely<00:01:07.860> now

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
will get punished now more severely now

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.370 
will get punished now more severely now
mostly<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.490> think<00:01:09.790> we<00:01:10.060> lose<00:01:10.270> priority<00:01:10.840> so<00:01:11.080> we

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
mostly I think we lose priority so we

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.070 
mostly I think we lose priority so we
lose<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.220> word<00:01:12.400> priority<00:01:12.939> low<00:01:13.119> priority<00:01:13.659> was

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
lose the word priority low priority was

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.730 
lose the word priority low priority was
very<00:01:14.290> very<00:01:15.220> different<00:01:15.520> in<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:16.420> way<00:01:16.450> because<00:01:16.840> um

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
very very different in a way because um

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.859 
very very different in a way because um
you<00:01:17.770> have<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.579> think<00:01:18.759> of<00:01:18.820> it<00:01:18.880> like<00:01:19.060> this<00:01:19.299> you

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
you have to think of it like this you

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.300 
you have to think of it like this you
can't<00:01:20.200> use<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.869> initial<00:01:22.869> effect<00:01:23.310> immediately

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
can't use the initial effect immediately

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.390 
can't use the initial effect immediately
when<00:01:25.030> you<00:01:25.180> summon<00:01:25.600> it<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:26.890> opponent<00:01:27.340> gets

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
when you summon it your opponent gets

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.240 
when you summon it your opponent gets
the<00:01:27.579> chance<00:01:27.759> to<00:01:27.880> respond<00:01:28.390> now<00:01:28.659> so<00:01:29.350> if<00:01:29.650> you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
the chance to respond now so if you

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.160 
the chance to respond now so if you
summon<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.610> rabbit<00:01:31.060> per<00:01:31.210> se<00:01:31.479> this<00:01:31.720> is<00:01:31.840> like<00:01:32.020> the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.060 
hurts a lot of decks it might not hurt
the<00:02:13.090> most<00:02:13.330> important<00:02:14.230> decks<00:02:14.440> but<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.680> hurts<00:02:14.860> oh

the most important decks but it hurts oh

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.650 
the most important decks but it hurts oh
I

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
I

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.160 
I
large<00:02:16.840> range<00:02:17.260> index<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:18.490> most<00:02:18.870> feared<00:02:19.870> death

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
large range index the most feared death

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.410 
large range index the most feared death
was<00:02:20.680> rabbits<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.370> everyone<00:02:21.760> said<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.090> now

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
was rabbits and everyone said that now

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.830 
was rabbits and everyone said that now
is<00:02:22.570> dead<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.700> don't<00:02:24.700> believe<00:02:24.790> rabbits<00:02:25.420> are<00:02:25.570> dead

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
is dead I don't believe rabbits are dead

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.800 
is dead I don't believe rabbits are dead
I<00:02:26.340> just<00:02:27.340> think<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.120> rabid<00:02:28.480> deck<00:02:28.630> will

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
I just think that the rabid deck will

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.290 
I just think that the rabid deck will
now<00:02:28.930> consist<00:02:29.320> of<00:02:29.530> three<00:02:30.370> forbidden<00:02:30.820> Lance's

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
now consist of three forbidden Lance's

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.440 
now consist of three forbidden Lance's
it's<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:32.020> must<00:02:32.380> now<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.850> guess<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.240> third

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
it's a must now and I guess the third

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.050 
it's a must now and I guess the third
space<00:02:34.900> it's<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.800> must<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.520> now<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.880> play

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
space it's a must and now you just play

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.150 
space it's a must and now you just play
a<00:02:37.090> little<00:02:37.330> bit<00:02:37.540> more<00:02:37.660> conservative<00:02:38.050> than<00:02:38.620> you

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
a little bit more conservative than you

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.440 
a little bit more conservative than you

so some of the judges are going to like

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.759 
so some of the judges are going to like
release<00:05:49.389> some<00:05:49.629> more<00:05:49.779> information<00:05:50.319> about<00:05:50.439> it
