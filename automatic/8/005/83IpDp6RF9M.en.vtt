00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.900
Hi. Today I will show you how to make
bouquet made from marshmallows and jelly beans.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.620
We need:

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.580
...marshmallows...

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.640
...jelly beans...

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.800
...soft candies...

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.860
...zircons...

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.900
...ribbon...

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.180
...cardboard circle...
(about 6 cm diameter)

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.680
...scissors...

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.860
...chiffon ribbon...

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.360
...cellophane...

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.780
...crepe paper...
(I fold an edge by using candy technique)

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.860
...and wooden skewers.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:41.560
Put marshmallows, jelly beans
and candies on wooden skewers.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.980
Make a few holes in cardboard circle.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:58.580
Put wooden skewers in holes.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:06.820
Tie them together by using ribbon.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:23.720
Wrap this bouquet in cellophane.
This will protect candies from dust etc.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:33.820
Wrap it by using chiffon ribbon.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.080
Now, wrap it by using crepe paper.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:53.920
Tie it by using ribbon.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:05.540
Glue some zircons to cellophane.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.780
And it's done.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:15.260
