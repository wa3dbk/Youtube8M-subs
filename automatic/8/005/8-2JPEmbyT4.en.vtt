00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.930
 so the highlights of the show however that the actress's reserve hero's son 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.930
 eric 5 mil 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:14.229
 by aeseville - trav the Indian edil said it 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.189
 Headphone is sturdy what I say it is made of plastic 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.320
 but it will be 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.849
 gives the impression that it is fragile but 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.430
 as I said the name of another accident 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.420
 really 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.220
 the headset 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.589
 really want 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.589
 according to the existing mayor 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.160
 It was just to show that this is going to show 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.390
 What I wrote 2010 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.379
 our camp a scared guy 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.940
 even because the producer 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.940
 my friends are far past 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.500
 the choices did not break 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.510
 practice the silicon valley 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.510
 honest he is quite comfortable 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.550
 for example musty the staff offers 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.070
 yesterday it does not solve to so many the mystery 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.940
 was heard 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.610
 simple construction 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.230
 but resist 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.290
 has pretty much behaved 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.150
 a product and has a price the lens 1 blatter said 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.770
 he proposes 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.130
 to do is so late proven 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.130
 what is written on the river 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.810
 the track had nothing 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.300
 before someone says that people 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.180
 not left was heard 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 after the settlement with doing this now 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180
 9 what? 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.470
 this stock 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.650
 click and another being that according to the newspaper 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.650
 I spoke to him 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:11.739
 because 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.659
 so I guess now it's complete 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.390
 anything see all those who have access to the devices 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.680
 throw the dragon off by little foot and did sway buildings
