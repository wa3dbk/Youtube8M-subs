wasn't really anything that you I was

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.980 
wasn't really anything that you I was
looking<00:01:27.340> online<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:28.060> your<00:01:28.180> model<00:01:28.479> no<00:01:28.690> it

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
looking online and your model no it

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.270 
looking online and your model no it
can't<00:01:29.200> be<00:01:29.260> like<00:01:29.470> you're<00:01:29.590> on<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.710> other<00:01:29.830> yeah

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
can't be like you're on the other yeah

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.460 
can't be like you're on the other yeah
yeah<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:31.090> benzoyl<00:01:31.510> peroxide<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.140> one<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.380> our

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
yeah the benzoyl peroxide is one of our

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.170 
yeah the benzoyl peroxide is one of our
point<00:01:32.710> is<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:33.040> you<00:01:33.160> can't<00:01:33.400> salicylic<00:01:33.970> you

point is that you can't salicylic you

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.750 
point is that you can't salicylic you
can't<00:01:34.420> use<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.860> it's<00:01:35.980> very<00:01:36.130> difficult<00:01:36.610> to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
can't use so it's very difficult to

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.750 
can't use so it's very difficult to
treat<00:01:37.410> breakouts<00:01:38.410> and<00:01:38.620> I<00:01:38.800> find<00:01:39.130> for<00:01:39.370> me<00:01:39.490> that
