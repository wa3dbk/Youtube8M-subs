00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:52.170

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.020
 directed by nuria sánchez we had 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.920
 several presentations at national level 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.350
 we did a friendly tour 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.909
 I also dance ballet for what I did 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.680
 for four years and now I dance in the 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.680
 group of the municipality solution 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.659
 de san carlos directed by solar always 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.980
 with what I identify most is like the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.260
 folklore 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.200
 because it's the representative dance of 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.969
 country 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.329
 and it's what I dance all my life 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.159
 then it's like what has me the most 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.409
 I have always had the support of my parents 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.380
 and moms I'm always behind me 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.719
 making up emails pulling things 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.030
 one of my brothers dances with me 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:43.240
 touched the municipality 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.350
 and the others I always say bermeo me 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.180
 they help in makeup 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.549
 a successful dancer has to have 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.780
 a lot of incipient a good attitude and 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.780
 know that if today it does not work out better 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.700
 for me they have marked my life as a dancer 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.670
 how was the first tour to me 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.550
 and once I got into a contest when 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.769
 Chaquira came in pheasant to the concert and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:19.860
 then all my family has got 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:21.840
 votes and then I managed to stay between 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.140
 is in fourth place 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.330
 so we went and we danced and I met 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.140
 many people and we dance with intervention 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.280
 arias a beautiful scope experience 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.120
 He called black but he also had my 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.580
 successes already come years ago but the most 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.879
 recent was with the autistic bomb solís 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.610
 the year before that we won in the 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.560
 choreographic festival at regional level and 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.709
 we are the second place at the level 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.069
 flower díaz work with children is a 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.069
 experience 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.890
 It takes me a lot I love it, I'm not going 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.890
 cry 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.549
 working with young children is a 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.190
 pretty pretty experience but at 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.770
 same time is quite difficult 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.780
 I love it, it fills me a lot to work with 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.300
 them the occurrences that have what 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.960
 do some are not happy and you have to 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.960
 have a lot of discipline 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.440
 work very hard because it is as 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.350
 their children and they love to judge and hesitate 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.270
 but I think I've taught them that there is a 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.740
 moment for everything and they are very children 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:37.940
 good irrigators 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.390
 at one point I thought I was going to live there 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.230
 almost the planted 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.810
 but make the decision to take the other 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.430
 career but I think my whole life is 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.430
 will take you by the hand to the dance 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.820
 they already cast their daughters I am a dancer and 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.180
