00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.990
 integrated work and continuity 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.540
 were the main focus of the collective 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.700
 held this Thursday at the headquarters of 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.009

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.570
 attended the auditorium of the entity 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.590

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.560
 his successor 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.960
 marco polo del nero presented the new 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.869
 general coordinator of selections 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.880
 gilmar rinaldi but highlighted the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.730
 importance of alexandre gallo in this 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.220
 partnership as one of the pillars of the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.990
 process of reformulation that is being 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.100
 done in the name of the excellence of our 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.140
 soccer 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.960
 after the end of the world cup 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.040
 watching the news about the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.040
 Brazilian football 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.390
 the comments 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.070
 beyond the cup result and dealing with 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.100
 our future 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.980
 were mainly directed to the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.660
 care we should take with 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.370
 base categories 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.450
 Our goal is precisely because this 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.270
 show the work that has been 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.780
 one year and six months ago and 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.940
 also give everyone a satisfaction 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.550
 we are realizing in what it says 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.290
 respect to our basic categories 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.620
 I felt quite honored with the invitation 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.510
 President Marim is his idea. 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.940
 doctor marco polo was undoubtedly a 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.130
 idea I find very interesting from 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.930
 specifically bring the 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.840
 professionalization to provide the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.520
 Brazil and we will be able to show you here 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.970
 For you a little of what we come 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.440
 doing during that period we 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.740
 we started the work on the 1st of 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.940
 February 2013 and the attempt without 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.720
 doubt was to make a reformulation 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.530
 complete in sub 15 and sub 17 categories and 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.380
 sub 20 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.540
 The first idea was to bring 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.850
 specific professionals for each 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.500
 category and hired as never before 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.660
 happened here in the Brazilian national team 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.630
 so that the athlete really has 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.360
 a sequence a support a trust 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.970
 there is continuity in these professionals 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.350
 after that we identified a problem 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.220
 seriousness in the basic categories 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.320
 happened 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.780
 there is no protocol for the acceptance of 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.080
 competitions in any category 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.970
 we created this protocol at 15 na 17 and 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.070
 we are very close to 20 of what is the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.990
 the main selection protocol for the 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.150
 our athletes are always protected 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.190
 and the accompaniment of the Brazilian national team 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.860
 without pre- selection of the main 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.720
 competitions that she understands 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.120
 that there is really a concern with 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.030
 our basic category athletes 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.560
 We brought the club into the CBB. 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.930
 I did not understand how to coach 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.570
 distance clubs and cbf and I am a 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.190
 instrument of convocation who does the 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.060
 athlete's training are truly 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.130
 the clubs 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.960
 so we show him what it is that 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.030
 We wanted the way we were going. 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.040
 to play what would be the card in the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.990
 a change of system like ours 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.610
 trainer wanted to work with the 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.500
 our goalkeeping coach likes a 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.360
 aggressive government than a goalkeeper line 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.310
 playing outside the area that we already 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.050
 we do since last year 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.430
 so it was important to bring clubs 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.770
 trainer coaches 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.050
 physical goalkeepers and 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.010
 coordinators of all 45 hours 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.920
 brazil clubs 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.720

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.550
 doctor marine doctor frame polo 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.630

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.310
 base Brazil 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.070
 one received an English course from us 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.790
 sponsor an online course during a 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.440
 year 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.990
 We will also bring all the 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.550
 players when the trips leave here 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.290
 rio de janeiro our museum 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.730
 they are very young they know little of the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.500
 history of our football 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.330
 We are also taking this 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.550
 initiative with work 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.990
 acknowledged victorious 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.730
 a year and a half at the base 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.680
 alexandre gallo knows very well the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.110
 importance of highlighting the new values 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.000
 of Brazilian football not only by the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.650
 proximity to the Olympic cycle but 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.870
 mainly through the process of 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.700
 renewal of the main selection 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.430
 and this partnership was quite outstanding 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.350
 by him during the collective 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.510
 only for him as well as for the youngest 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.470
 name the newest professional announced 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.780
 by cbf 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.980
 gilmar rinaldi agent comes out of a 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.540
 world where we have many 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.440
 teachings and we have a very 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.030
 well done 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.160
 no doubt we'll start 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.530
 already using this whole structure was 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.460
 prepared and that from what I stayed 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.930
 knowing also 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.490
 I'm aware, it 's much more 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.620
 prepared than we even think 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.310
 So this is the time for this. 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.770
 risk and have courage and believe in 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.750
 work if we have and we have to 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.810
 trust and that the way there we go 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.210
 then start the base our all will 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.160
 be the basis of selection that the cock is 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.470
 riding someone who understands this 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.330
 believe me as I believed 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.680
 marine doctor of the largest pole also 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.110
 believed 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.250
 the rooster did not like many details that I 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.900
 had no knowledge 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.669
 we're going to pass this is someone who 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.919
 following this philosophy we have to have 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.259
 here is a very serious and very 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.580
 defined that the person who comes will 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.440
 working with us knows the 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.270
 difficulties of taking the selection in a 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.530
 like this but know the great 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.910
 because it is already of the value that it has here 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.910
 We'll explain this very well.
