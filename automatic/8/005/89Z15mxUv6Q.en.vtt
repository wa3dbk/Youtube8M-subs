00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.859
 Yes Hello everyone 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.440
 used with ssb 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.219
 Microphone 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.440
 I would like to hear a bit of the sound quality 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.640
 Because there are several 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.660
 First of all 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.350
 This time 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.720
 hi-fi 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:31.980
 hi-fi audio it's a hi-fi audio deck 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:35.160
 I would like than in the out-demodulated in the next time that ssb 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.100
 Well then yeah 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.829
 When 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.380
 This belinger 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.570
 Hey mon cheap both but there are two way of 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.070
 Yeah 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.750
 I would like to see 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.020
 I do not use the opportunity to line up behind me this time 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.020
 Yes 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.140
 Oh yeah 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.140
 Well then 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.830
 First of all this sm 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:10.260
 This is sm 558 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.110
 I 'm taking it with ipad for a while 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:19.290
 When taking doing this and microphone 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.970
 The sound changes because ipad enters between our mouths 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.600
 sm 5 pachi 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.600
 Next this 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.490
 It is written as a root lab chair, but this is xm 8500 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:40.440
 I'm behringer 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.220
 This is cm 5 which is recently famous for Tomi 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.220
 It is em no 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.230
 One more capacitor a little 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.230
 I think I want to do this 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.270
 This is 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.010
 Loaded 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:05.570
 ntk 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:07.010
 Behind it is the condenser microphone of the crystal microphone remodeling of this love this 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.880
 Is also 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.220
 I would like to use it at fsb time 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.370
 The 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:23.360
 I have a tick tomorrow, so I would like to use it for comparison with sb's e this time 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.180
 It is four, which I think I want to use these four Bo book 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.090
 Then ai 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.680
 Follow 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.129
 This is it 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.260
 I 'm talking about sm 58 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.260
 It is in Yaria' known as 5 part 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.770
 About 50 years and a half century 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.290
 Vocal microphone 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.020
 The 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:53.230
 Is it true that you said to reign over the king ? 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.230
 It is a type with a built-in trance or old-fashioned transformer 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.980
 Recent dynamic is that 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.069
 There are many types without transformer 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.400
 That voice coil 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:12.689
 It has been made to be large and lightweight, and then it is explained that it can be used as a member of the magnet cooperation and can output high voltage 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.689
 Seems to have 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.490
 So we speak now sm 58 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.710
 It's sm no. 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.710
 How are you 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.980
 I would like to change to the Bellinger Exe 6 8500 Ultra Voice 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.050
 Huh-this is Beringer's xm 8500 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:47.720
 It's pretty easy , I guess this was 1500 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.230
 yeah 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.710
 It sounds pretty good, so calm 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:59.330
 Yes it does not it say in the love 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:02.260
 Well then that topic cm 5 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.860
 go to cm 5 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.770
 Yes this is cm child 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.100
 It is after cm 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.100
 this 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.220
 This is a cm child 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:23.990
 Since the three are side by side, the distance you are talking about is almost 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.950
 10 cm to 15 cm For vocal microphones this distance should go 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.950
 I guess I guess 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:35.100
 This will change from it looks cm child to I'll go one capacitor ntk 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.450
 a This is nt system 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.480
 ndk is a microphone, but that it is is this 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:50.040
 Just a little more stubborn a 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.730
 This is that 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:57.720
 To 20cm and Kara 20 centimeters 25cm 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:03.090
 It is stuck and it is nt system 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:06.440
 So it's also ntk condenser microphone for labor 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.440
 cm back 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.810
 Yes it is this is the No. cm No. cm 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:16.729
 It is cm No. 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:21.240
 Let me go back to xm 8500 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:24.420
 i xm is 8500 Well 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.990
 It is a black tarp of this middle 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.990
 This dane 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.200
 xm 8500 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:36.249
 Then I'm making a standard sound 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:42.489
 convert to asm bopper yes this is sm bopper 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:43.940
 Because even if there is no standard, it will be compared with Don, so this is the standard with efficacy 

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:46.100
 It is a thing 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.120
 Yes softening 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:53.270
 The camera does not smoke in the Chat rice 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.220
 Well now you can see Shack money 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.980
 The war is 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.980
 It is parents everywhere 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.900
 Well, in this state the next one is next 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:22.350
 I think this time with this and want a comparison with the demodulated by the Ebetsu receiver in the ssb and 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.350
 I'll finish it again, so I'll finish it up so I'm sorry I'm finished, goodbye
