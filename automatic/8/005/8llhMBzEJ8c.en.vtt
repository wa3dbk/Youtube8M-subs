00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.960
 Hello and welcome to a 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.540
 fashion imagination today there is one 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.440
 trailer pack from the company 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.780
 more hot bmm so that the type 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.330
 of the trailer bmm two versions once 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.900
 in two actions a beautiful one in yellow 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.400
 held 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.699
 the company itself is relative to me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.630
 unknown the big trailer is called here 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.859
 bmm 140 the little bmw 100 i think 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.550
 pretty sure we'll take a look 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.530
 in the shop 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.260
 exactly bmw 100 costs just 5800 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.140
 Euro maintenance is not the talk 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.210
 worth or she does not see worth talking about 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.579
 if we are all fruitful 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.010
 also available manure and seeds may 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.350
 We load capacity here varies because 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.680
 we have on rates either 13,000 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.180
 probably then 15,000 and 18,000 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.329
 and so when we are at it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.469
 the large one costs 1200 and the small one 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.350
 close to 900 9000 to 12,500 so 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.869
 nicely complementary moderate and as I said 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.180
 it is then possible with the superstructures 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.549
 that you have different capacities here 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.060
 He would have a great logo and murder 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.189
 is from ls mod team as said today 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.570
 great pictures in any case top what 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.759
 I'm a bit scared 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.369
 are the many mistakes here in the lok 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.580
 and both have many 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.000
 Textures errors or or 6 trainings before 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.640
 everything in the xml invalid filter is that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 So most compost is probably supposed to 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.210
 should offered I go out if that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.180
 word maybe in there who are the onyx 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.720
 then it must be annoying outside , too 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.850
 Not be 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.840
 Ok, let's take a closer look at the model 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.909
 then maybe we can get in here 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.369
 look at a better picture I have to say 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.310
 the texture looks very very horny from it 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.619
 is a bit the texture or or 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.439
 the logo a bit yes here so 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.860
 but pixelated is not all right 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.719
 bad 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.869
 The rims I find them in extremely cool 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.390
 off and the tires the tire profile too 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.860
 grip texture yes ok but is not so 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.110
 important from a distance you can see 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.910
 not so otherwise the others 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.090
 texture is relatively good very much 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.480
 actually detailed below 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.739
 Also with hydraulic hoses everywhere 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.510
 and here also the tail lights 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.040
 the texture really looks 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.760
 You can stand like that in a bombastic way 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.150
 however , everything is here for everyone 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.180
 case ok the model is top and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.349
 yes, exactly their page layout the whole 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.890
 Model is really good again 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.049
 successful 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.700
 stickers and other things everywhere 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:39.790
 and yes this trailer is but in 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.349
 referring to realistic driving on everyone 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.459
 better than many others than you 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.920
 for example, here also the 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.959
 manual PTO go here and on 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.579
 attach tractor and for example too 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.209
 start this prop we test that 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:58.060
 the same with the big case puma cvx 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.109
 Right now you are the same 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.220
 A message is still supported 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.599
 These hang down before they 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.900
 go off to avoid damage 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.739
 okay we go then so here go there 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.359
 yes, it is synonymous v support up here 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.650
 Well, it does not work out now 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.540
 but would not have to cool probably 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.500
 The PTO can attach with feces 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.269
 Run and fix and then now with 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.910
 Support it up now you go up too 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.889
 you see that works then and 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.859
 already you can drive here yes how 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.299
 We have several options 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.430
 light and blinker and also an all around 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:38.109
 light is there so very very 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:39.579
 you have to say the axis of the horny 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.349
 distance fits somehow you see 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.209
 really that that the drawbar 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.060
 not that far up there is nothing high up 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.370
 So everything fits very well 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.799
 As I said we can also with ex man 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.880
 Run the trailer is drive is 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:57.760
 makes sense if we for example 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.780
 want to transport seeds now yes 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.970
 We have to go back when we leave 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.859
 get back in groups or ascend 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.410
 and again the PTO attach that 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.750
 So you have to do it every time and that is 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.120
 stop really cool thing thing direction 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.090
 Realism in the inner life as I said 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.160
 everything is normal 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.870
 visually outside really the hammer and 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.880
 with b could still be the essays 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.769
 change so here would be normal so 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.150
 relatively flat here too with 9000 liters 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.200
 and then probably to the 10,500 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.260
 and then here again the 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.120
 or 10,000 and then 12,500 that 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.960
 maximum to say that's it again 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.780
 a lot more 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.180
 We can test how many times 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:43.270
 middle tower and displays 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.100
 but I will would like to fill here 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:50.740
 that may prove possible if now it works 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:53.890
 also great filming is nice there and 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.630
 we notice also really great to 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.680
 I must say 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.160
 you see friends here we have ten 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.550
 1500 liters and you can say that the 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.010
 first movie play nir zuk now she is too 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.570
 high not necessarily so many 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.580
 followers I complained that the 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.900
 movies are not too high enough here 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.410
 in any case, driving hours too high 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.670
 city ​​manager afraid that everything falls out 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.050
 but in itself it looks alright 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.790
 on the other hand, you can normally do the third construction 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.800
 on tour is no longer unfortunately 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.270
 you can also choose the ones from the side you 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.220
 can really do anything here 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.810
 that's crazy and has to say 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.240
 so many possibilities with a simple one 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.510
 I did not know any trailers until now 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.830
 Everything is there and I give it 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.450
 also a five star because otherwise 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.460
 really everything also fits wlan 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.660
 The lok here probably only should 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.390
 However, murder is always a condition 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.590
 decoupled you have had bad luck then 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.820
 you just have to stand in front of the support again 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.930
 fold out there you just have to 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.080
 Do not think a bit about it 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.430
 otherwise everything is in the bucket 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.200
 yes that was his job with fashion 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.270
 Introduction I'll give you five stops here 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.200
 the metro keeper is doing well 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.200
 soon yourself
