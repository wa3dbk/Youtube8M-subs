00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.750
 hi my name is lucas 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.610
 this is free fork begin not 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.860
 whenever you are a new combination 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.710
 to not eat only white rice now 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.780
 we make rice with spinach for this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.390
 basically what we need is the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.470
 spinach washed always always always 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.710
 wash the spinach is always something 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.930
 very important and we cut him with cut 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.150
 will help us get faster 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.250
 the preparation we are also going to need 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.410
 rice white rice talk them 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.140
 whole or yellow rice goes perfect 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.739
 this is white rice like and oil for 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 the boot as you see jump into the fire 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.300
 It's hot, we never touch 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.730
 we only measure if the heat 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.730
 a teaspoon of oil to start 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:00.220
 so directly about this we are going to 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:04.449
 put the spinach let's take advantage of the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.909
 spinach water to cook it 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.369
 not only with this water are we going to cook it 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.659
 we are going to add water also extra or 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.159
 not only with spinach water but 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.289
 we are going to take advantage of that juice that they leave 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:20.020
 for the cooking of rice indicates tevez 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:21.789
 there starts to start at this moment 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.030
 when we have to have rice 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:28.100
 ready to incorporate look at all that 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:33.729
 water is from spinach 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.729
 perfect now let's put rice 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.020
 direct 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.660
 about spinach it is very important that 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.410
 always be moving the preparation 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.550
 stir as long as it does not stick 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.920
 we look for the rice to be re-marked 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.540
 a little that absorbs that water that has 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.520
 the spine out, look, there's nothing 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.070
 liquid but in the pan that's not that 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.590
 it evaporated that the soybean rice 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.409
 absorb all the water then it is 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.329
 important that 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.479
 what we are going to do is incorporate water 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:13.739
 when we are going to directly put a 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.840
 cup a little bit more we let it cook 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.849
 this has to boil it has to lift 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.640
 more temperature if you want here not 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.920
 we have to stop regular passed more 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.680
 or less 10 minutes of cooking I had 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.860
 that add a little more water 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.319
 nightmare the rice is as pointed this 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.420
 always always take into account that 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.519
 it is to eye is how you like rice 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.739
 like more he took off the others he took off if 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.280
 you like it more, past you add it again 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.680
 water and they leave it more cardoso I now 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.200
 same area salt 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.090
 the good thing about adding salt now is that 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.219
 when we are going to add the salts after 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.750
 of cooking there is still throwing liquid 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.689
 what are you cooking so 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.810
 take advantage of that moment the pepper 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.000
 I have mill pepper so in the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.299
 moment but you can use pepper in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.859
 dust remember that at least road 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:11.099
 uses much more black pepper than this 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:14.269
 way there are already great started to hit is 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.269
 because it is already cooked 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:27.420
 and we go directly to the server a lot 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.489
 what I did is a bundle of spinach and 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.200
 a portion of rice that is a 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.879
 single person eats perfectly well 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.840
 hector if it does not work for two 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.340
 fittings see here only 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.879
 I'm serving a side of this 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.879
 for another more 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:52.209
 let's see to make it tedious and this 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.209
 let's say a little bit of cheese 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.860
 you do not want to put a little bit of floor 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.380
 olive oil top advance 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.510
 perfectly well we made the rice not 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.640
 it hit us it came out perfect it's something very 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.480
 rich with me spinach we made a 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.730
 new version of rice so puts the 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.740
 hands there in the kitchen and make it my name 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.590
