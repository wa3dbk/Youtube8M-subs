 pivot last week made my brain 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.870
 a little boil because the choice of games 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.960
 turned out to be too difficult not because 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 I'm looking to choose from the fact that there is a lot of candle 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.400
 cool projects was listed 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.540

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.550
 strategic bias but as for me 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.830

 on enemy bases and steal everything there 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.260
 bad lay and more efficient 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.580
 Fallout variation has become available on 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.860
 phone and why variation but because 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.350
 this is a slightly different game where 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.080
 it is important to engage in development and conservation 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.450
 the remnants of humanity in the bunker shelter 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.550
 often compared to polish you are from thieves 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.850
 Mine where the second looks exactly 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.770
 more interesting but also so average fallout 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.420
 shelter we all remember the good old 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.340
 fallout and now we have 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.560
 opportunity to play it not only on 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.470
 for now but also on the phones in the game you can 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.200

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.610
 explore wasteland looking for new things 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.130
 allies seek new armor weapons when 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.870
 this trying not to die will also have to 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.930
 prepare residents to repel the threat 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.540
 from the outside a shorter goal is to simply create for 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.340
 yourself and everyone a bright future is also in the game 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:28.020
