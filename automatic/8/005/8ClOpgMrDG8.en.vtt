00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120

there is one Hellion coming out from
cloud<00:03:28.890> just<00:03:29.160> scouting<00:03:29.430> across<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.970> map<00:03:30.180> and

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
cloud just scouting across the map and

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.720 
cloud just scouting across the map and
as<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:31.019> see<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.620> expansion<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:32.519> cloud

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
as you can see the expansion for cloud

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.790 
as you can see the expansion for cloud
has<00:03:32.940> been<00:03:33.120> on<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.750> uninterruptedly<00:03:34.590> has

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
has been on it and uninterruptedly has

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.590 
has been on it and uninterruptedly has
just<00:03:34.980> been<00:03:35.070> able<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.370> gather<00:03:35.519> minerals<00:03:36.030> he<00:03:36.510> is

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
just been able to gather minerals he is

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.300 
just been able to gather minerals he is
putting<00:03:36.840> up<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.110> base<00:03:37.290> at<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.739> high<00:03:37.890> yield<00:03:38.100> base

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
putting up a base at the high yield base

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.699 
putting up a base at the high yield base
as<00:03:38.550> well<00:03:38.760> so<00:03:39.360> he<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.660> going<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.959> have<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> huge

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
as well so he is going to have a huge

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.860 
as well so he is going to have a huge
economic<00:03:40.950> lead<00:03:41.519> although<00:03:42.000> he<00:03:42.390> already<00:03:42.630> does

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
economic lead although he already does

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.570 
economic lead although he already does
have<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:43.110> pretty<00:03:43.350> big<00:03:43.590> economic<00:03:43.920> lead<00:03:44.370> as<00:03:44.489> you

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
have a pretty big economic lead as you

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.160 
have a pretty big economic lead as you
can<00:03:44.730> see<00:03:44.850> on<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.000> income<00:03:45.330> tab<00:03:45.540> year<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
can see on the income tab year the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.840 
can see on the income tab year the
harvester<00:03:46.650> discrepancy<00:03:47.250> between<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.730> two

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
harvester discrepancy between the two

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.910 
harvester discrepancy between the two
players<00:03:48.090> as<00:03:48.300> well<00:03:48.360> as<00:03:49.050> about<00:03:49.440> six<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.890> seven

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
players as well as about six to seven

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.430 
players as well as about six to seven
hundred<00:03:50.220> minerals<00:03:50.880> /<00:03:51.450> starcraft<00:03:52.019> minute

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
hundred minerals / starcraft minute

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.110 
hundred minerals / starcraft minute
being<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.830> advantage<00:03:53.220> towards<00:03:53.640> cloud<00:03:53.880> right

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
being the advantage towards cloud right

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.759 
being the advantage towards cloud right
now<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:54.450> why<00:03:54.630> trot<00:03:54.840> just<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:55.170> really<00:03:55.500> really

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
now so why trot just in really really

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.280 
now so why trot just in really really
bad<00:03:55.980> shape<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.880> once<00:03:57.120> again<00:03:57.299> he<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.840> managing

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
bad shape so once again he is managing

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.569 
bad shape so once again he is managing
to<00:03:58.350> hold<00:03:58.440> on<00:03:58.739> but<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.010> don't<00:03:59.250> know<00:03:59.310> how<00:03:59.430> much

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
to hold on but I don't know how much

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.180 
to hold on but I don't know how much
longer<00:03:59.640> he<00:04:00.030> can<00:04:00.060> keep<00:04:00.299> this<00:04:00.480> up<00:04:00.540> because<00:04:01.260> cloud

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
longer he can keep this up because cloud

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.460 
longer he can keep this up because cloud
has<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:02.670> been<00:04:02.880> absolutely<00:04:03.090> relentless<00:04:04.019> in

00:04:57.369 --> 00:04:57.379 
infantry units in the medevac you can

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:58.960 
infantry units in the medevac you can
actually<00:04:57.530> take<00:04:57.830> out<00:04:58.039> a<00:04:58.069> good<00:04:58.400> amount<00:04:58.610> of<00:04:58.759> stuff

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
the great EMP I actually know what he

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.089 
the great EMP I actually know what he
does<00:05:05.840> not<00:05:05.990> have<00:05:06.139> any<00:05:06.319> high<00:05:06.409> templars<00:05:06.860> since

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
decent amount of units I mean he is not

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.860 
decent amount of units I mean he is not
fully<00:05:53.719> saturating<00:05:54.349> this<00:05:54.800> expansion<00:05:55.250> yet<00:05:55.520> but

fully saturating this expansion yet but

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.149 
fully saturating this expansion yet but
he<00:05:56.870> does<00:05:57.080> have<00:05:57.259> a<00:05:57.289> decent<00:05:57.529> amount<00:05:57.710> here<00:05:58.009> so

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
he does have a decent amount here so

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.379 
he does have a decent amount here so
he's<00:05:58.310> got<00:05:58.460> a<00:05:58.490> little<00:05:58.699> bit<00:05:58.880> more<00:05:59.029> income<00:05:59.360> than

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
get him back into this game a little bit

now<00:06:53.710> and<00:06:54.460> I<00:06:54.669> really<00:06:54.699> do<00:06:55.030> expect<00:06:55.150> y<00:06:55.509> trata<00:06:55.750> GG

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:56.139 
now and I really do expect y trata GG

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:59.010 
now and I really do expect y trata GG
any<00:06:56.379> second<00:06:56.800> here<00:06:56.830> there's<00:06:57.580> the<00:06:57.789> GG<00:06:58.180> so<00:06:58.750> it

00:06:59.010 --> 00:06:59.020 
any second here there's the GG so it

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.270 
any second here there's the GG so it
looks<00:06:59.050> like<00:06:59.319> white<00:06:59.590> raw<00:06:59.770> winning<00:07:00.129> this

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
looks like white raw winning this

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.980 
looks like white raw winning this
matchup<00:07:00.550> against<00:07:01.060> cloud<00:07:01.389> and<00:07:01.569> I<00:07:01.629> believe<00:07:01.870> this

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990
