00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.880
 today we are going to prepare corn soup for 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:14.150
 that we need grains of corn 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.320
 garlic onion epazote pepper and lime 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.240
 We started by putting the tomatoes in the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.610
 boiling water this only for a point 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.500
 to remove the skin but if 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.500
 like you can skip this step 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.000
 Now in a pan with oil 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:37.090
 hot let's fry the onion and the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.040
 garlic that are finely chopped and the 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.420
 let's fry for 2 minutes 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.420
 moving constantly 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.370
 today we are going to add the grains of 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.850
 corn and let's let this cool 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.850
 for about 5 minutes at medium temperature 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.380
 remember that the training box is 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.680
 found in the complete list of 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.680
 ingredients 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.080
 and now we put the tomatoes that the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.080
 I had chopped cubes 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.030
 two 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.180
 Y 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.580
 we add pepper and a little salt 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.710
 to 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.320
 ah 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.399
 and we let this cool down until 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.229
 the tomatoes melt is close to 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.229
 about 10 the average temperature 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.000
 since it happened this time we are going to 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.240
 put the chicken or beef broth and if not 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.830
 they came to the broth they can use water and 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.990
 let's let all this iron for 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.030
 another 15 minutes or until the corn 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.310
 is cooked last we are going to 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.190
