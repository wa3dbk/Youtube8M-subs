00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.880 
design from in the cage out of the cage
and<00:03:26.210> also<00:03:26.840> it's<00:03:27.020> going<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.260> help<00:03:27.410> make<00:03:27.680> that

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
and also it's going to help make that

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.950 
and also it's going to help make that
transition<00:03:28.460> in<00:03:28.850> great<00:03:29.120> where<00:03:29.420> we<00:03:29.540> go<00:03:29.720> from

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
transition in great where we go from

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.710 
transition in great where we go from
three<00:03:30.620> feet<00:03:30.890> higher<00:03:31.190> down<00:03:32.000> here<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.510> three

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
three feet higher down here to three

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.870 
three feet higher down here to three
feet<00:03:32.930> lower<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.680> now<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:33.860> can<00:03:34.160> taper<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.640> grade

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
feet lower so now I can taper the grade

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.940 
feet lower so now I can taper the grade
around<00:03:35.210> this<00:03:35.450> Boulder<00:03:35.960> and<00:03:36.410> that's<00:03:36.620> going<00:03:36.830> to

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
around this Boulder and that's going to

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.620 
around this Boulder and that's going to
retain<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.460> dirt<00:03:37.700> instead<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.300> having<00:03:38.480> to

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
retain the dirt instead of having to

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.630 
retain the dirt instead of having to
want<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.900> wash<00:03:39.080> right<00:03:39.590> into<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.130> cage<00:03:40.340> right

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
want to wash right into the cage right

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.320 
want to wash right into the cage right

mortar raked back and using a brown dye
in<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:07.969> mortar<00:04:08.299> so<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.659> mortar<00:04:08.989> matches<00:04:09.379> the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530
