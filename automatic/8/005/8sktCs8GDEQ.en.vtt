00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770 

okay<00:00:00.960> for<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.860> parody<00:00:02.280> case<00:00:02.520> where<00:00:02.850> you<00:00:03.149> have

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
okay for this parody case where you have

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.190 
okay for this parody case where you have
the<00:00:04.319> adjacent<00:00:04.770> swap<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.250> that's<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.670> and

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
the adjacent swap and that's it and

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.960 
the adjacent swap and that's it and
everything<00:00:07.200> else<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.500> solved<00:00:07.859> what<00:00:08.820> would

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
everything else is solved what would

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.530 
everything else is solved what would
happen<00:00:09.120> if<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.630> solve<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:14.089> is<00:00:15.089> you'd<00:00:15.389> be

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
happen if you solve that is you'd be

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.560 
happen if you solve that is you'd be
stuck<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.080> parity<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:17.609> don't<00:00:18.510> know

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
stuck with this parity and I don't know

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.269 
stuck with this parity and I don't know
how<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.750> go<00:00:18.930> directly<00:00:19.199> from<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.010> solve

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
how to go directly from this to solve

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.790 
how to go directly from this to solve
state<00:00:20.609> so<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.570> go<00:00:22.260> back<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:25.050> adjacent<00:00:25.320> slaw

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
state so I go back to the adjacent slaw

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.479 
state so I go back to the adjacent slaw
and<00:00:28.550> what<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> figured<00:00:30.570> works<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:32.399> you

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and what I figured works is what you

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.770 
and what I figured works is what you
have<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.090> get<00:00:33.239> both<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
have to do is you have to get both of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.139 
have to do is you have to get both of
these<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.649> same<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.820> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:35.969> switch

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
these the same so you going to switch

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.850 
these the same so you going to switch
that<00:00:36.390> top<00:00:37.110> center<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.190> top<00:00:38.640> center<00:00:39.860> so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
that top center with that top center so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.470 
that top center with that top center so
you<00:00:40.920> try<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.879> you're<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> do<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.420> going

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
you try what you're going to do is going

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.410 
you try what you're going to do is going
to<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.780> adjacent<00:00:43.410> SWA<00:00:44.329> adjacent<00:00:45.329> edges

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
to do the adjacent SWA adjacent edges

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.459 
to do the adjacent SWA adjacent edges
along<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:47.090> just<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.210> layer<00:00:48.450> this<00:00:48.989> top<00:00:49.289> layer

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
along for just this layer this top layer

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.850 
along for just this layer this top layer
is<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> say<00:00:50.010> fixed<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.350> do<00:00:52.350> our<00:00:54.860> middle

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
is going to say fixed so do our middle

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.990 
is going to say fixed so do our middle
you<00:00:56.070> are<00:00:56.510> w<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.420> YouTube<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:01.500> are<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you are w are you to YouTube you are you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.929 
you are w are you to YouTube you are you
I<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:04.159> you're<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.369> want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.729> that

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
I and you're going to want to do that

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:13.870 
I and you're going to want to do that

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
twice so are you are you are you two are

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
twice so are you are you are you two are
you<00:01:14.880> two<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.330> are<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.590> thank<00:01:19.770> at

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you two are you are you are so thank at

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.920 
you two are you are you are so thank at
that<00:01:20.130> from<00:01:20.970> there<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> adjacent

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that from there you just to the adjacent

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.130 
that from there you just to the adjacent
keep<00:01:22.259> swap<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.770> both<00:01:22.979> layers<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.640> are<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.750> or

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
keep swap with both layers so are you or

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.830 
keep swap with both layers so are you or
are<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.350> are<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.310> two<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.270> two<00:01:27.479> too<00:01:27.600> far

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
are you are you two are you two too far

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.670 
are you are you two are you two too far
to<00:01:28.140> par<00:01:29.299> and<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:32.070> last<00:01:32.280> case<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.530> front<00:01:34.530> to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
to par and the last case is a front to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.649 
to par and the last case is a front to
back<00:01:34.890> parody<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.299> if<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.540> were<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> solve<00:01:37.140> it

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
back parody so if you were to solve it

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.700 
back parody so if you were to solve it
maybe<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:43.040> what<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> do

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
maybe with this and what you have to do

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.870 
maybe with this and what you have to do
let's<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.509> parody

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.290 

and<00:01:53.080> then<00:01:54.080> do<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.410> adjacent<00:01:54.890> switch<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:56.120> is

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
and then do the adjacent switch this is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:05.380 
and then do the adjacent switch this is
the<00:01:56.390> fastest<00:01:56.750> way<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:56.960> know<00:01:57.170> so<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:05.030> now<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:05.180> have

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
the fastest way I know so so now I have

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.330 
the fastest way I know so so now I have
this<00:02:05.540> I'm<00:02:06.050> going<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.440> solve<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.830> parody<00:02:07.160> like

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
this I'm going to solve the parody like

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:34.840 
this I'm going to solve the parody like
you<00:02:07.430> did<00:02:07.580> before<00:02:07.730> so<00:02:31.570> um<00:02:33.160> no<00:02:34.160> no<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.460> way<00:02:34.790> to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
you did before so um no no this way to

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.880 
you did before so um no no this way to
solve<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.330> probably<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.080> most<00:02:36.380> efficient<00:02:36.860> way

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
solve it probably the most efficient way

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.370 
solve it probably the most efficient way
this<00:02:37.220> is<00:02:37.340> just<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:38.360> way<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.540> figured<00:02:39.080> out<00:02:39.230> how

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
this is just the way I figured out how

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:48.730 
this is just the way I figured out how
to<00:02:39.440> solve<00:02:39.710> it<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:42.310> yeah<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:47.050> comment<00:02:48.050> rate<00:02:48.350> and
