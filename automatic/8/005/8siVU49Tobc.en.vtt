00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 and personal books plus one video 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.130
 here's chubby and this time guys like 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.929
 You saw the title of the video, I'm 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.790
 here to talk about the seconds in 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.340
 team that seemed to cast 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.619
 people Saturday they advanced 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.810
 morning and I said I wanted to ask 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.970
 Sorry for not having this video 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.330
 that a little earlier I was 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.590
 agreed before the snicks only I 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.990
 I went to sleep late 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.910
 There the cortez and I will not do the team 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.009
 Do you want to make a pope video? 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.690
 there is 10 o'clock in the morning and zippy who 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.870
 I did not leave, I said I 'm going to take a nap 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.200
 I woke up and woke up two and a half 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.250
 pm 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.070
 unfortunately this must have happened 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.260
 with you sometime your normal life 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.820
 forgive me but anyway the trick 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.100
 to talk about this second example 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.480
 supercell pixel launched and my 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.370
 opinion on it 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.739
 you should know by now you should have 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.449
 seen on other channels but you still 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.000
 Did not see, then let me give you this 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.059
 the second novelty of the team kilo 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.479
 supercell threw is talking now that 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.360
 will be possible to modify the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.460
 emblems of the clans and to make an emblem well 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.860
 different from what we have today 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.960
 and besides if you notice or I go 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.909
 put the image on the screen and I will give 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.430
 amplified for you to see if you 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.189
 notice below have some emblems that 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.710
 they are locked it 's written down there 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.799
 the following you need to occupy the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.759
 your clan to unlock these 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.280
 badges 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.070
 ie they did not say they just 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.780
 said they will be able to manipulate and 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.150
 modify these clan badges 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.159
 they did not say it but it is already explicit 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.000
 in the image that we will have a level 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.100
 of clans now and what this will be 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.189
 for us one and what this has of relevance 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.990
 for first people I do not know how it goes 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.030
 be the pair on those levels what you will 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.520
 have to do without for a parent level but 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.670
 probably now a field as per 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.680
 example bt is the brazil tim will have sim 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.869
 level and you will be able to 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.399
 to differentiate this brazil tim from any 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.009
 another done then you will be able 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.709
 differentiate them not only by the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.209
 tag now also by level and also né 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.440
 you can join a club that has 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.420
 a higher level 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.790
 this is a championship to the strongest mind 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.560
 I finally found a new mechanic for 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.870
 The game was in need of news. 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.550
 even clan levels 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.050
 although they did not say 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.970
 explicit in the image 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.140
 and another thing they said there that the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.460
 majority of the southern tuber left pass 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.970
 unnoticed is that it is also written 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.040
 What is now for you to put the troops 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.470
 clan castle will not be possible 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.930
 but put the troops in clan castle 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.360
 when you're attacking over 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.520
 decorative objects 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.950
 so it means that if you let 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.050
 values ​​around the south of your village 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.360
 You will not be able to put the troop 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.580
 of the castle clan on top of these trees 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.610
 This I do not know why day of the 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.830
 have done this but should have 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.180
 some reason they did it 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.130
 Why does not this influence 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.980
 practically nothing comes 0 1% of the cases goes 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.020
 need to put the clan strife into 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.320
 where would a tree stand? 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.160
 anyway its something they put 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.959
 extra 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.320
 forum it was inclusive is enrolled 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.060
 forum is exclusive exclusive of the forum eu 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.250
 I play bringing to you that maybe 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.590
 may have gone unnoticed by others 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.430
 videos you have seen and having these 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.590
 updates and links in mind already that 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.570
 list you should have seen in the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.790
 clash of cancer to five tips or in my 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.130
 group is that list that joão 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.410
 cheerleader put what he said 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.920
 that he saw there in the apple store he had 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.800
 leaked really into the same apple store 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.390
 had leaked they put there in guiana 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.090
 in the game description in the updates 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.780
 recently they put it that it would 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.269
 new on there in the story itself 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.660
 put in advance and then Victor went to 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.070
 shot a strip a photo a screenshot and 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.860
 placed there in the group 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.140
 if you want to see more detail 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.019
 that you have in this picture and will probably 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.370
 other nicks that will leave tomorrow there 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.230
 including has already warned that 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.239
 probably not the video tomorrow either 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.940
 Are you going to leave early? 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.310
 likely to repeat the information 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.979
 why get up early on Sunday? 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.340
 sucking those channels on Saturday I 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.780
 I arrived 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.730
 wake up early but then I gave silliness of 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.340
 to sleep again for two in the afternoon 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.600
 But on Sunday, I'm going to wake up early. It's not 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:40.470
 So unfortunately the news that you 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.060
 they will be little delayed but at last I 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.130
 I think you like that kind of 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.470
 video because I asked you wanted 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.910
 see just chopped the swan videos pix 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.370
 my impressions what I have to say 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.100
 about that and you said that it's okay 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.000
 How would you like it if you did not 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:00.060
 one with all finally to know what 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.520
 other nicks I'll just talk some here 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.680
 it was written nothing cannon 13 was 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.360
 clan badge writing was written 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.729
 of the field level even though they do not 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.650
 on the board written there and 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.930
 it will probably be the snic in the morning 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.760
 but they did not even have the image but 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.260
 many people who did not notice and are 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.389
 also written that it will now have a 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.340
 tool so you do not have to leave 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.560
 of your field when you have a war 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.060
 You do not want to participate, just you. 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.400
 and deactivate that tool that you 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.340
 is not going to be at war and his clan 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.570
 I'm going to look for this, this is great. 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.639
 This is very good, old man. 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.850
 so there is really made for superficial 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.190
 we in addition have three other things 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.740
 that was written on the na in the photo that the 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.450
 joão victor took it if you want to see the 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.160
 clash of england link that is here 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.660
 in the description run there and have a look 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.729
 in other links 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.610
 tomorrow I'm here again on this blog 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.590
 sensual pajamas with the bed untidy 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.139
 with the room gone 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.570
 at the weekend to talk about the 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.160
 new links that will leave tomorrow tomorrow 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.419
 It's going to leave and I'm here to talk to you. 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.270
 You and my first impressions. 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.370
 It's already before finishing this video 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.010
 Who does not know today I made two videos in 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.260
 one day in 2000 and another and another 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.360
 normal normal videos left here on the channel 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.130
 Anyway, like I said blogs do not replace 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.410
 normal videos the clash 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.360
 so for those who did not have a video for 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.760
 week in the video had only a week and 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.830
 a live two videos in a day is a 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.840
 extraordinary thing then if you 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.910
 You want to know what other video I'm going to leave? 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.849
 here in the description and I'll leave it here 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.349
 screen for who is watching by the pc 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.810
 Because who's watching on the cell phone? 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.520
 only if it is by the description even then 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.620

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.400
 What are you doing there for another video? 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.439
 if this other video is what you know 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.439
 is the maximum level of the clash of titans 

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:50.849
 Have you seen the guy with the maximum level of 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:52.949
 250 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.840
 Do you know how far you can get in 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:58.439
 level and you know you have to do 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.020
 to get on that giant level a guy 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:03.599
 has recently reached the highest level of 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.219
 clash of clans and I talked about this video 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:07.500

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:10.439

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.680
 highest level of clash of kansas click on the 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:18.449

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.520
 Bizarre that up the wrong side 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:22.530

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.090
 talking about which high level of clash of 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.830

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:36.349
 You said a big hug of the blue whiting. 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.349
