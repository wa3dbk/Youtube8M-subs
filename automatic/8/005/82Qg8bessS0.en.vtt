the<00:05:30.570> parts<00:05:31.570> and<00:05:31.690> pieces<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:31.990> try<00:05:32.200> to<00:05:32.260> determine

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
the parts and pieces to try to determine

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.960 
the parts and pieces to try to determine
what<00:05:32.770> happened<00:05:33.100> like<00:05:33.220> I<00:05:33.310> said<00:05:33.490> I<00:05:33.520> had<00:05:33.700> a<00:05:33.730> wheel

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
what happened like I said I had a wheel

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.750 
what happened like I said I had a wheel
fall<00:05:34.210> off<00:05:34.390> and<00:05:34.690> Gary<00:05:35.560> ended<00:05:35.860> years<00:05:36.100> ago<00:05:36.280> we

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
fall off and Gary ended years ago we

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.520 
fall off and Gary ended years ago we
never<00:05:36.970> did<00:05:37.180> really<00:05:37.420> determine<00:05:37.960> what<00:05:38.110> happened

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
never did really determine what happened

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.830 
never did really determine what happened
because<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:39.160> sheared<00:05:39.550> all<00:05:39.730> the<00:05:39.940> the<00:05:40.360> studs<00:05:40.660> and

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
because it sheared all the the studs and

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.870 
because it sheared all the the studs and
we<00:05:40.900> had<00:05:41.050> titanium<00:05:41.470> wheel<00:05:41.830> studs<00:05:42.190> on<00:05:42.460> there<00:05:42.730> but

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
we had titanium wheel studs on there but

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.910 
we had titanium wheel studs on there but
we<00:05:42.940> also<00:05:43.090> had<00:05:43.300> a<00:05:43.330> spacer<00:05:43.870> in<00:05:43.900> there<00:05:44.170> and<00:05:44.320> so<00:05:44.800> we

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
we also had a spacer in there and so we

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.130 
we also had a spacer in there and so we
didn't<00:05:45.160> know<00:05:45.250> if<00:05:45.340> it<00:05:45.400> was<00:05:45.550> that<00:05:45.790> the<00:05:46.140> titanium

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
didn't know if it was that the titanium

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.140 
didn't know if it was that the titanium
studs<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.650> sheared<00:05:47.950> or<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:48.730> spacer<00:05:49.000> plate

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
studs it sheared or the spacer plate

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.810 
studs it sheared or the spacer plate

never run titanium wheel studs after

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.100 
never run titanium wheel studs after
laughs<00:05:53.920> but<00:05:54.360> sometimes<00:05:55.360> it's<00:05:55.750> just<00:05:55.840> hard<00:05:55.930> to

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
laughs but sometimes it's just hard to

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.040 
laughs but sometimes it's just hard to
figure<00:05:56.440> out<00:05:56.560> exactly<00:05:56.740> what<00:05:57.160> happened<00:05:58.050> well

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
figure out exactly what happened well

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.750 
figure out exactly what happened well
one<00:05:59.260> more<00:05:59.470> time<00:05:59.770> let's<00:06:00.100> look<00:06:00.160> at<00:06:00.430> it<00:06:00.580> see<00:06:00.730> if

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
one more time let's look at it see if

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.060 
one more time let's look at it see if

right now
what<00:06:32.950> the<00:06:33.100> crew<00:06:33.430> thinks<00:06:33.670> happened<00:06:34.030> is<00:06:34.480> the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
what the crew thinks happened is the

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.930 
what the crew thinks happened is the
stud<00:06:35.020> sheared<00:06:35.380> off<00:06:35.560> on<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:35.860> right<00:06:36.190> side<00:06:36.550> first

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
stud sheared off on the right side first

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.790 
stud sheared off on the right side first
and<00:06:37.210> then<00:06:37.300> whenever<00:06:37.930> the<00:06:38.200> impact<00:06:38.620> and

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
and then whenever the impact and

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.410 
and then whenever the impact and
everything<00:06:39.100> starting<00:06:39.370> the<00:06:39.490> left<00:06:40.090> started

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
everything starting the left started

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.640 
everything starting the left started
spinning<00:06:40.600> wildly<00:06:40.900> out<00:06:41.200> of<00:06:41.230> control<00:06:41.320> it

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
sheared off the other side because all

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.940 
sheared off the other side because all
of<00:06:43.150> the<00:06:43.360> studs<00:06:43.630> are<00:06:43.810> gone<00:06:44.020> on<00:06:44.260> both<00:06:44.740> rear
