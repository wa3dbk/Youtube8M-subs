00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
it doesn't go down a certain skills but

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.100 
it doesn't go down a certain skills but
there's<00:00:37.250> padding<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.390> see<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.629> here

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
there's padding you can see that here

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.130 
there's padding you can see that here
padding<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:44.399> there's<00:00:45.149> no<00:00:45.390> padding<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.899> hook

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
padding and there's no padding the hook

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.279 
padding and there's no padding the hook
so<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.820> dr.<00:00:47.969> ball<00:00:48.270> comes<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.719> it

so and this is dr. ball comes with it
comes<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:50.010> an<00:00:50.160> actual<00:00:50.550> basketball

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
comes with like an actual basketball

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.060 
comes with like an actual basketball
type<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:52.680> one's<00:00:52.980> better<00:00:53.510> because<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> one

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
type this one's better because the one

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
type this one's better because the one
comes<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:56.870> it's<00:00:57.870> hard<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> grip<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:59.059> cuz<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
comes with it's hard to grip I cuz a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.510 
comes with it's hard to grip I cuz a
bunch<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.390> oil<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.050> stuff<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.340> it's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
bunch of oil and stuff on it and it's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.179 
bunch of oil and stuff on it and it's
hard<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.940> grip<00:01:03.260> it's<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.409> little<00:01:04.710> bigger<00:01:04.949> than

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
hard to grip it's a little bigger than

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:15.590 
hard to grip it's a little bigger than
this<00:01:06.260> it's<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:08.630> probably<00:01:09.979> I'd<00:01:10.979> say<00:01:14.330> like<00:01:15.330> a
