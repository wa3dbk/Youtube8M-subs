00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.730
 Good day my ladies and gentlemen new 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.590
 strong snowfalls are ahead of us 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.650
 that's why they were already in advance 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.350
 Information released before storm 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.610
 namely, it concerns primarily the 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.650
 West Germany 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.420
 the current weather situation sees 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.150
 as follows from a low pressure area 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.519
 over france is gradually picking up 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.259
 Germany over and will be in front of everyone 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.239
 tomorrow in these regions 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.210
 cause problems here you can see that 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.090
 again, like in time lapse, this deep 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.790
 in our area spills over the exact 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.960
 zugbahn can only be relatively 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.700
 calculate in the short term but something like that 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.730
 it would look safe then 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.170
 also the cloud prediction movie shows it 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.969
 the precipitation reaches 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.780
 in the second half of the night on the 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.980
 west over and over the course of the day 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.160
 the precipitation also in the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.230
 eastern areas but the quantities 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.850
 which we expect will certainly be 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.709
 primarily in the west significantly 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.869
 be ten to 20 centimeters of fresh snow 

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:13.119
 they are quite conceivable and im 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.200
 connection with strong refreshing 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.310
 wind can also cause snowdrifts 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.609
 come 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.499
 so if they plan to go tomorrow 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.509
 which take place in these areas 

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:25.929
 inquire best before or 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.490
 times at www weather danger point de there 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:31.240
 you get the current ones 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.279
 Information the map is likely tomorrow 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.079
 then look similar in the north and in 

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:37.539
 the middle frosty and over again 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.929
 snowfalls especially here of course that 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.029
 madness bowl in the south it stays mild in 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.310
 the next few days so here's again 

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:47.499
 a look over the current election card 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.039
 as tomorrow certainly look because 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:53.829
 also with regard to the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.169
 snowdrifts in the next few days 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.569
 it stays wintery though 

00:01:56.169 --> 00:02:00.069
 then at the weekend the temperatures 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.779
 but probably go up again 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.419
 what the weather and above all things 

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:07.479
