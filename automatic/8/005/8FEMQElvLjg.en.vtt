00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 In this lesson I will tell you what is 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.590
 primitives and how to work with them 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:14.460
 ok primitive is the simplest three-dimensional 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.490
 cinema 4d object inherent 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 specific settings by primitives 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.910
 is a cube sphere a cone cylinder and so 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.039
 then what are these specific 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.310
 these primitives have settings 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.430
 let's sort it out initially 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.980
 where are all primitives in cinema 4d 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.390
 go to the top toolbar 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.210
 and gave under the blue cube icon we have 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.539
 whole list of objects 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.390
 ok to get on this list we are with you 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.170
 pinch the left mouse button on the icon with 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.329
 cube further without releasing it we translate 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.629
 the cursor on the object we need let it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.090
 there will be a cube object next we hover 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.480
 release the left mouse button thereby 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.689
 see that the primitive object cube fit 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.640
 in our project we see it by 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.479
 the characteristic outline of the club itself in 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.700
 window in and port as well as by list 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.520
 manager of the list of objects, we see that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.189
 here came the cube object let's 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.409
 let's put one more primitive 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.570
 move our camera a little to the right with 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.150
 using camera movement tools 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.240
 our port and then again 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.400
 go to the window with primitives clamp 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.000
 left mouse button and let's put 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.340
 here is the object that it will be a cone we see 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.110
 that the objects primitives appear all in 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.659
 zero coordinates that is in the very 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.390
 center of composition let's move 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.250
 object cone we turn again to 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.729
 top toolbar just to the left 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.079
 then take the tool by moving 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.110
 move by clicking the left mouse button 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.310
 on it and let's move a little along the z axis 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.329
 she have blue 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.460
 slightly up we see you left down in 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.360
 our viewport window and we see 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.360
 display 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.950
 our micro axis is for those who have forgotten 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.830
 what color is what power and where 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.160
 is in 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.480
 and where is the bottom we see that rotating the axis camera 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.060
 rotates the same way ok go further 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.610
 talk about the specific settings they 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.660
 are right in the attribute manager 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.580
 an object that we already know from here 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.650
 speak the first lesson interface 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.590
 that he is in the lower right 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.920
 interface to display 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.800
 exactly the parameters of the object of which you are 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.010
 want must highlight initially 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.970
 the object we need is done this either 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.780
 by clicking on the port on one of the objects 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.959
 either by clicking 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.950
 on the object in directly in the manager 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.280
 list of objects 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.420
 for example, I want to select a cube and 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.810
 edit it specific 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.510
 settings in attribute managers I click 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.390
 left click on the club object and we 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.060
 see as attributes of our cube right away 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.970
 appears in this meiji we see 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.090
 tab object object coordinates common 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.019
 total funk detail about all these tabs 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.489
 I once sorted out and will also tell you in super 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.800
 course on cinema 4d 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:25.269
 but now weâ€™ll touch the tab 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.470
 object and so here we have all these 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.620
 options 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.250
 easily changed with the left mouse button either 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.170
 data entry instead of but with digital 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.860
 keyboards of course instead of data 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.160
 values 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.230
 How to change the parameters of the mouse question 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.280
 simply adjustable by these 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.040
 small arrows 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.030
 we need the dimensions of our cube because we 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.100
 see here the parameter 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.150
 size x size y-axis i.e. height 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.450
 we clamp the left mouse button well, just 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.310
 pull either up or down and size in z 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.780
 i.e. width 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.510
 also we see there is an extra 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.850
 specific parameter like chamfer by clicking 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.680
 on which the corners of our cube are completely 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.409
 are cut are made rounded 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.420
 let's see what specific 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.909
 setting the object has a cone we 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.389
 click on it with the left mouse button not 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.190
 means in a perspective tissue immediately 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.280
 see how our parameters are displayed 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.080
 cone and here we see the radius from above 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.350
 let's hold down or about the mouse button and 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.070
 let's play with the settings further radius 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.190
 below we can generally make of kamus 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.039
 cylinder 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.120
 further we can adjust the height all 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.310
 we can notice 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.259
 regulated in centimeters to 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.389
 keep and proportion accordingly 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.949
 sides of each object if we suddenly 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.370
 we make for example a room 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.229
 then the bed can not be 5000 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.060
 centimeters though well yes of course they 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.419
 maybe 5000 centimeters she will 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.789
 much less is to ensure that everyone 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.160
 the numbers were reliable then we can 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.710
 adjust the number of segments by 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.380
 the height of what a segment is and what they are 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:07.009
 different from polygons we are completely 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.960
 disassembled in the head by modeling in 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.169
 our super course on cinema 4d 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.349
 I will only say that the segments are one 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.510
 primitive okey 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.010
 also we can disable let's 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.530
 let's move a little up with 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.440
 top tools also we can 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.289
 turn off the covers i.e. top and bottom 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.630
 our object, he did not know what cases 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.310
 it may be necessary 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.520
 repeating all these parameters is easy 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.250
 change the left mouse button or enter 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.400
 data from the keyboard number in this way 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.259
 we fully control our primitive 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.270
 combining this control with control in 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.080
 space using three basic 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.570
 of tools 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.820
 a and reminders is in the top left 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.220
 top toolbar and so 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.889
 combining these two ways of changing 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.919
 objects we get a complete set for 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:00.650
 create your own objects on this 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.570
 we all proceed to the next lesson in 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.949
 which I will talk about special 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.470
 objects which are called deformer and 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.690
 of course there besides the deformer in 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.340
 more additional objects in general 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.380
 speaking we'll talk about deformations 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.380
 primitive let's start
