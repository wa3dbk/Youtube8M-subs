00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.780 

Carola<00:00:16.380> asks<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> question<00:00:17.190> about<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.580> cell

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
Carola asks the question about the cell

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.910 
Carola asks the question about the cell
membrane<00:00:18.300> he<00:00:18.420> says<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:19.380> because<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.890> my

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
membrane he says that because in my

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.950 
membrane he says that because in my
biology<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.910> belief<00:00:21.119> book<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.660> talked<00:00:21.900> about

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
biology of belief book I talked about

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.050 
biology of belief book I talked about
the<00:00:22.200> cell<00:00:22.410> membrane<00:00:22.800> as<00:00:22.950> the<00:00:23.070> brain<00:00:23.310> he<00:00:23.850> was

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the cell membrane as the brain he was

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.240 
the cell membrane as the brain he was
also<00:00:24.270> interested<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:25.200> what<00:00:25.410> does<00:00:25.950> the<00:00:26.040> cell

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
also interested in what does the cell

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.429 
also interested in what does the cell
membrane<00:00:26.700> use<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.360> protect<00:00:27.750> itself<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.260> well

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
membrane use to protect itself as well

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.250 
membrane use to protect itself as well
so<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.490> not<00:00:29.610> just<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:30.260> mechanism

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
so that it's not just a mechanism

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.950 
so that it's not just a mechanism
designed<00:00:31.980> for<00:00:32.449> neurological<00:00:33.449> activity<00:00:33.570> of

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
designed for neurological activity of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.960 
designed for neurological activity of
the<00:00:34.080> cell<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.830> it's<00:00:34.980> also<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.460> equivalent<00:00:35.910> of

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
the cell but it's also the equivalent of

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.420 
the cell but it's also the equivalent of
a<00:00:36.059> skin<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.080> cell<00:00:37.260> membrane<00:00:37.770> has<00:00:37.980> both<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
a skin so the cell membrane has both the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.060 
a skin so the cell membrane has both the
skins<00:00:38.790> protective<00:00:39.420> function<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.620> nervous

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
skins protective function and a nervous

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.490 
skins protective function and a nervous
systems<00:00:41.550> control<00:00:41.970> function<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.960> question<00:00:43.350> is

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
systems control function the question is

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.860 
systems control function the question is
well<00:00:43.680> how<00:00:44.070> does<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> protect<00:00:44.760> itself<00:00:45.090> well

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
well how does the protect itself well

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.410 
well how does the protect itself well
number<00:00:46.050> one<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.650> the<00:00:47.430> surface<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.000> our<00:00:48.120> cells

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
number one on the surface of our cells

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.750 
number one on the surface of our cells
there's<00:00:48.720> a<00:00:48.780> forest<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.530> miniature<00:00:50.010> forest<00:00:50.550> of

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
there's a forest a miniature forest of

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.420 
there's a forest a miniature forest of
polysaccharide<00:00:51.690> sugars<00:00:52.229> and<00:00:52.470> so<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.159> you<00:00:53.309> were

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
polysaccharide sugars and so if you were

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.460 
polysaccharide sugars and so if you were
very<00:00:53.670> very<00:00:54.180> small<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.809> could<00:00:54.930> walk<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
very very small and could walk on the

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.689 
very very small and could walk on the
surface<00:00:55.650> of<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.040> cell<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.339> would<00:00:56.400> be<00:00:56.519> like

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
surface of your cell it would be like

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.270 
surface of your cell it would be like
walking<00:00:56.940> through<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.540> forest<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.589> sugar<00:00:58.890> trees

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
walking through a forest of sugar trees

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.610 
walking through a forest of sugar trees
and<00:00:59.580> the<00:00:59.640> sugar<00:00:59.879> trees<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.720> have

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and the sugar trees actually have

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
and the sugar trees actually have
electrical<00:01:02.370> charges<00:01:02.909> attached<00:01:03.269> to<00:01:03.540> them

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
electrical charges attached to them

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.680 
electrical charges attached to them
mainly<00:01:04.589> negative<00:01:05.100> charges<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.270> sugars

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
mainly negative charges on these sugars

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.260 
mainly negative charges on these sugars
which<00:01:07.260> repels<00:01:07.710> positive<00:01:08.640> particles<00:01:09.120> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
which repels positive particles and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.460 
which repels positive particles and
keeps<00:01:09.479> them<00:01:09.690> from<00:01:09.810> getting<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> surface

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
keeps them from getting to the surface

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.100 
keeps them from getting to the surface
so<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:11.010> aspect<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.060> protection<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.690> just<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
so one aspect of protection is just the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.460 
so one aspect of protection is just the
charge<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> surface<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.729> prevents

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
charge of the surface that prevents

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.539 
charge of the surface that prevents
molecules<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.680> coming<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.159> close<00:01:17.369> proximity

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
molecules from coming in close proximity

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.210 
molecules from coming in close proximity
to<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.240> cell<00:01:18.480> membrane<00:01:18.510> but<00:01:19.260> there<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.100> other

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
to the cell membrane but there are other

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.950 
to the cell membrane but there are other
ways<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.640> sell<00:01:20.820> protects<00:01:21.300> itself<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:21.930> are

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
ways to sell protects itself there are

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.620 
ways to sell protects itself there are
receptors<00:01:22.800> that<00:01:23.040> recognize<00:01:23.360> things<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.510> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
receptors that recognize things in the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.060 
receptors that recognize things in the
environment<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.260> are<00:01:25.380> toxic<00:01:25.710> or

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
environment that are toxic or

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.250 
environment that are toxic or
threatening<00:01:26.550> and<00:01:26.730> these<00:01:27.150> receptors<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.960> bind

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
threatening and these receptors can bind

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.090 
threatening and these receptors can bind
and<00:01:28.680> negate<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.610> influence<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.390> these

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
and negate the influence of these

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.620 
and negate the influence of these
environmental<00:01:32.100> problems<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:33.120> that's<00:01:33.330> another

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
environmental problems so that's another

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.140 
environmental problems so that's another
way<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.870> protection<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.310> basically<00:01:35.910> we

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
way of protection and so basically we

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.720 
way of protection and so basically we
can<00:01:36.270> say<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.780> sugars<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.310> surface

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
can say that the sugars on the surface

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.490 
can say that the sugars on the surface
which<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.180> actually<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.810> layer<00:01:40.080> is<00:01:40.290> called

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
which is actually that layer is called

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.570 
which is actually that layer is called
the<00:01:41.130> glycocalyx<00:01:42.290> glyco<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.440> sugar<00:01:43.680> Kaling's

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
the glycocalyx glyco is sugar Kaling's

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.850 
the glycocalyx glyco is sugar Kaling's
is<00:01:44.730> code<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.600> surface<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.140> every<00:01:46.320> cell<00:01:46.650> is

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
is code on the surface of every cell is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.830 
is code on the surface of every cell is
a<00:01:46.890> sugar<00:01:47.160> coat<00:01:47.490> which<00:01:47.700> acts<00:01:47.940> as<00:01:48.120> an<00:01:48.270> insulator

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
a sugar coat which acts as an insulator

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.710 
a sugar coat which acts as an insulator
and<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.560> filter<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.550> protects<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> surface

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and a filter that protects the surface

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.480 
and a filter that protects the surface
of<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:51.990> cell<00:01:52.200> from<00:01:52.350> being<00:01:52.620> bombarded<00:01:52.890> by

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
of the cell from being bombarded by

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.300 
of the cell from being bombarded by
stuff<00:01:54.420> from<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> outside<00:01:55.230> there's<00:01:55.860> actually

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
stuff from the outside there's actually

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.240 
stuff from the outside there's actually
a<00:01:56.340> layer<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.909> water<00:01:57.240> around<00:01:58.080> those<00:01:58.380> trees<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a layer of water around those trees and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.920 
a layer of water around those trees and
the<00:01:59.760> significance<00:02:00.270> about<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.690> layer<00:02:00.900> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the significance about that layer of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.649 
the significance about that layer of
water<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.610> called<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> unstirred

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
water is that it's called the unstirred

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.530 
water is that it's called the unstirred
layer<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.890> means<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.400> it's<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.120> a<00:02:06.150> moat

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
layer what it means is it's like a moat

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.690 
layer what it means is it's like a moat

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
neurological function of a cell membrane

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.719 
neurological function of a cell membrane
it's<00:04:20.690> very<00:04:21.049> important<00:04:21.919> to<00:04:22.010> understand<00:04:22.460> that

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
it's very important to understand that

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.420 
it's very important to understand that
again<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.570> cell<00:04:23.780> membrane<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.590> the

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
again the cell membrane is the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.060 
again the cell membrane is the
equivalent<00:04:25.940> of<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.120> skin<00:04:26.389> in<00:04:26.539> a<00:04:26.630> human<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.139> so

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
equivalent of a skin in a human and so

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.680 
equivalent of a skin in a human and so
the<00:04:28.280> functions<00:04:28.639> of<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.880> skin<00:04:29.030> are<00:04:29.419> being

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
the functions of the skin are being

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.350 
the functions of the skin are being
carried<00:04:30.020> out<00:04:30.110> by<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.380> cell<00:04:30.620> membrane<00:04:31.070> and

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
carried out by the cell membrane and

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.730 
carried out by the cell membrane and
also<00:04:32.360> if<00:04:32.660> you<00:04:32.930> understand<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.440> nature<00:04:33.620> of

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
also if you understand the nature of

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.990 
also if you understand the nature of
embryology<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:35.330> nervous<00:04:36.020> system<00:04:36.440> is<00:04:36.620> the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
embryology the nervous system is the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.780 
embryology the nervous system is the

of the embryo that's where the nervous
system<00:04:42.790> comes<00:04:42.970> from<00:04:43.180> so<00:04:43.480> a<00:04:43.720> human<00:04:44.410> has<00:04:45.040> a
