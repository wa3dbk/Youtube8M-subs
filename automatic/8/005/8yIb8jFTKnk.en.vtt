drivers right-hand side one here and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.209 
drivers right-hand side one here and
then<00:00:30.960> I'm<00:00:31.109> going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> go<00:00:31.500> ahead<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.920> install

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
then I'm going to go ahead and install

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.420

the left-hand side one as well and I'm

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.520 
the left-hand side one as well and I'm
going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> document<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.840> process<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.410> how

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
going to document the process of how

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.139 
going to document the process of how
easy<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> originally<00:00:41.010> um<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.850> had

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
easy it is so originally um I had

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.549 
easy it is so originally um I had
anticipated<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.930> being<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.260> lot<00:00:43.379> more

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
anticipated this being a lot more

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.310 
anticipated this being a lot more
difficult<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.610> guess<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.320> 1997

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
difficult because I guess in the 1997

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.220 
difficult because I guess in the 1997
style<00:00:46.590> Jeep<00:00:46.890> Cherokees<00:00:47.780> instead<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.870> having<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
style Jeep Cherokees instead of having a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.410 
style Jeep Cherokees instead of having a
built-in<00:00:49.469> bar<00:00:49.920> back<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.489> there<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> an

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
built-in bar back here there is an

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
built-in bar back here there is an
external<00:00:52.050> bar<00:00:52.379> which<00:00:52.590> requires<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.100> lot<00:00:53.340> more

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
external bar which requires a lot more

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.720 
external bar which requires a lot more
work<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.120> go<00:00:54.539> ahead<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.870> remove<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:56.430> case

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
work to go ahead and remove in this case

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.010 
work to go ahead and remove in this case
though<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> 2000<00:00:57.840> style<00:00:58.559> Jeep<00:00:58.949> Cherokee

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
though in the 2000 style Jeep Cherokee

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.060 
though in the 2000 style Jeep Cherokee
it's<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.590> easy

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
last one off there it's really not that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.499
