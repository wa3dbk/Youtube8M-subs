 your best friends 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.590
 ironies of life and because sometimes 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.440
 the people we love and other wagons are 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.320
 and we can go visit them sometimes it goes more 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.190
 but sometimes we forget 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.370
 we forget that they are in another car 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.280
 and we rarely go and the day we go the seat next door is busy
