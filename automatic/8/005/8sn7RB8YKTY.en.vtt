00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.280
 cuddly 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.309
 now the michaela aries pumuckl 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.110
 Dye hair yourself part 2 in part one 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.960
 I showed how to do the stuff on 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.150
 best on the hairline can apply 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.250
 Now we have the finished color 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.890
 result we can recognize are the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.260
 tip a bit differently than the rest 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.300
 the color was like it was planned 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.070
 but these little lights do not want 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.679
 every time the hair after dyeing 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.610
 That's why I can bleach the whole 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.290
 thick with the directions or with haarkur 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.300
 1 or it strokes quite thick 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.270
 on it so that he also rinses the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.710
 hair color can not go like this 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.200
 Calling one promised so that one 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.090
 couple patrick menz on so that protects 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.550
 my bright strands then during the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.129
 dye and wash hair that the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.320
 just as dark red as the other 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.879
 that now really clean in the skin 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.809
 camera sees the approach now 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.359
 a bit darker out of that is due 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.809
 of the light probably so what 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.549
 from German 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.040
 if I can switch on here now 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.790
 but you can see that is up to the beginning 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.560
 everything is uniform red the approach is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.150
 not as dark as it is now 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.630
 when i see the hair sofa 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.729
 cuddling 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.380
 I'll tell you again how I do that 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.770
 I did the hair color 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:29.240
 So with this reflection c60 I have 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.060
 mixed with 12 percent 12% h2o2 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.640
 why 12 percent would do it with nine 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.189
 percent go because I'm dark blue 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.850
 but I like that hair faster 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.280
 again the color is already losing there 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.490
 the occident chooses it starts at 33 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.380
 percent 6 12 percent earlier there were times 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.960
 18 percent it's banned now though 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.810
 normally it would come to six percent 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.700
 wonderful in my hair color right 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.729
 but I want that hair, the one 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.040
 bit is roughened and thereby the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.210
 red color pigment also faster again 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.970
 you want to lose red you should want 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.430
 as gentle as possible 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.960
 dye if you want to have that durable 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.300
 in between you can always with 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.950
 directly draw the color without h2o2 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.280
 without mixing anything 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.480
 but that has to refresh that again 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.700
 I do not do that because I think that's nice 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.070
 that the hair is the color of jan so 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.020
 that's my starting position for me now 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.160
 next week I'm a bit 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.260
 stringy again the warning 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.910
 I do not just want to say so 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.790
 just the color on it and that 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.560
 as well as on the pack he stands the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.330
 Resolution summarizes your hair yourself 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.220
 you have to be a bit careful 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.150
 get stuck in 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.800
 why if you want to dye lighter and 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.660
 You do not like that and you want 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.520
 then it can turn darker again 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.560
 happen that the hair in the dark 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.200
 then turn green 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.910
 that means you would have to use red before pigment 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.800
 theirs just like me just like that 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.480
 the tint on deleted so with 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.700
 something reddish the hair first 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.440
 puncture and then do it in nature 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.450
 dyeing is a bit complicated then 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.060
 I'm just telling you that she is not 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.519
 thinks is totally easy i suppose 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.450
 hair color gives it on and then becomes 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.709
 that does not like that under me like that 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.580
 namely the next hair color and 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.280
 basic color over it will not work if 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.950
 you 're darker than your hair color is 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.350
 and says that has become too dark for me 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.180
 It is not synonymous that the hair color 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.890
 choose and then stroke 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.080
 just brighter is because 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.670
 Dark colored hair can not be 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.610
 dye more lightly 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.850
 but they would then by a 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.549
 timetable for withdrawal with LIGHTENING 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.660
 get brighter again that's called 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.760
 dry hair wash but that is 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.420
 again a thing he in barber 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.190
 hands should or should be advised 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.959
 So please do not just do something like that 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.130
 grab from the shelf and say something 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.750
 that happens when we do not 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.170
 I like the next hair color 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.610
 and put it over that will not work 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.739
 I have been coloring with this ever since 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.480
 That's why bread is just the color on it 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.370
 I know that I like it 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.620
 You should say but I want to too 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.019
 Let's try something like this is the way over 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.970
 the sounds so if you do not mission 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.010
 must always be the safer than his 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.269
 Hair color used on an intense tint 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.250
 it says where you 2 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.389
 mix with each other or in each other 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.639
 So it always has to screw if two 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.819
 things come together anyway 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.530
 then it's a hair color that's intense 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:32.750
 is obtained and also with a 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.169
 neck out grows on a color space 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.789
 or a cream without occident leaves 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.009
 How to apply a hair cure and fresh 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.069
 the color on the safe way 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.629
 you think what do you want what you want 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.270
 not please ball does not have me now 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.789
 with inquiries too because i give you the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.060
 bad answer by remote diagnosis 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.470
 can 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.409
 then you should already have a hairdresser 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.630
 seek out the advice you can 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.729
 I can only say it's that simple 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.039
 to dye hair yourself if you know 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.419
 which hair color you would like and 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.729
 if you know that you have this hair color 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.409
 do not want to change fundamentally because 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.909
 He can only do that with the hairdresser 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.530
 Maybe I confused you now 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.139
 i hope i have a bit of light in 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.740
 This dark would himself have it 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.960
 You see, you can do it if you want 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.909
 if you just approach with a color 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.639
 A spreadable even the smallest of small 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.620
 Now, by the way, if you like everything 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.810
 no matter which one grabs in nature tone 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.060
 color and you want such a few 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.219
 You can have it on it as soon as possible 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.710
 have the paint applied with a 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:36.650
 little blonding and came to full 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.360
 tender stripes rain camp now has the 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.949
 just paint on the front on the 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.659
 Take the cap and come with it 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.219
 there would only ever be one, then you have 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.680
 so small lights in there but there is also 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.240
 even packs of hair color where that 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.000
 all in one pack is that one 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.909
 So simple becomes courage 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.349
 but only dye yourself carefully 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.270
 if you are sure that he is the color 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:59.060
 also want to have a hair color too 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.159
 Change is not just for you 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.860
 but also for the hairdresser one often 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:06.229
 unpleasant thing because of black 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.029
 blond are the hair then afterwards 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:10.069
 So please a little bit 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.960
 Be careful with something always with you 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.810
 intensely tint the try themselves 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.680
 again out firmly to the brush 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.680
 ready go
