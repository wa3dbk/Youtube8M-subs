00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
of all can you explain the types of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.049 
of all can you explain the types of
systems<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.780> platinium<00:00:46.289> manufacture<00:00:47.059> yet

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
systems that platinium manufacture yet

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.510 
systems that platinium manufacture yet
and<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.570> platinum<00:00:49.110> hydroponic<00:00:49.710> system

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
and the platinum hydroponic system

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.900 
and the platinum hydroponic system
basically<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.660> quite<00:00:51.809> an<00:00:51.930> extensive<00:00:52.170> range

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
basically it's quite an extensive range

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.490 
basically it's quite an extensive range
and<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.030> touched<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.719> earlier<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and you touched on it earlier there the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.130 
and you touched on it earlier there the
two<00:00:55.710> sort<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.010> min<00:00:56.190> where's<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.789> growing

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
two sort of min where's a growing

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.599 
two sort of min where's a growing
hydroponically<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.410> aeroponic<00:00:58.859> lay<00:00:59.070> this

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
hydroponically and aeroponic lay this

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.729 
hydroponically and aeroponic lay this
system<00:01:00.000> incorporates<00:01:00.809> basically<00:01:01.320> that's<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
system incorporates basically that's the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.070 
system incorporates basically that's the
crux<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.190> system<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.719> there's<00:01:03.719> eight

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
crux of the system and there's eight

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.530 
crux of the system and there's eight
different<00:01:04.320> types<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.360> firstly<00:01:06.360> you've<00:01:06.450> got

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
different types and firstly you've got

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.750 
different types and firstly you've got
the<00:01:06.659> aeroponic<00:01:07.140> type<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.130> we've<00:01:08.580> got<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the aeroponic type which is we've got a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.510 
the aeroponic type which is we've got a
narrow<00:01:09.030> stack<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.659> narrow<00:01:10.350> bra<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.010> an<00:01:11.220> air<00:01:11.369> or

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
narrow stack a narrow bra and an air or

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.460 
narrow stack a narrow bra and an air or
top<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.390> put<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.659> hydroponic<00:01:13.049> style

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
top then you put your hydroponic style

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.410 
top then you put your hydroponic style
which<00:01:13.979> basically<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.790> other<00:01:14.909> five<00:01:15.180> you've

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
which basically is the other five you've

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.940 
which basically is the other five you've
got<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.570> hydrograph<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.439> single<00:01:16.740> plant

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
got the hydrograph for a single plant

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
got the hydrograph for a single plant
system<00:01:17.340> hydrastar<00:01:20.090> hydrochloric<00:01:21.090> for

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
system hydrastar hydrochloric for

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.980 
system hydrastar hydrochloric for
basically<00:01:22.049> within<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.070> system<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> sole

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
basically within the system as a sole

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.320 
basically within the system as a sole
platinum<00:01:24.990> recover<00:01:25.560> both<00:01:26.159> angles<00:01:26.490> that's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
platinum recover both angles that's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.090 
platinum recover both angles that's
quite<00:01:27.630> an<00:01:27.720> extensive<00:01:27.990> range<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> mean<00:01:28.950> could

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
quite an extensive range so I mean could

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.200 
quite an extensive range so I mean could
you<00:01:29.189> say<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.400> there's<00:01:29.729> something<00:01:29.939> for

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
you say that there's something for

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.569 
you say that there's something for
everybody<00:01:30.420> yeah<00:01:31.290> yeah<00:01:31.530> definitely<00:01:32.070> within

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
everybody yeah yeah definitely within

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.580 
everybody yeah yeah definitely within
the<00:01:33.090> modular<00:01:33.509> system<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> whole<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.380> think

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the modular system as a whole I think

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.350 
the modular system as a whole I think
there's<00:01:34.770> something<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.119> absolute

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
there's something there for the absolute

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.719 
there's something there for the absolute
beginner<00:01:36.570> which<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> single<00:01:38.009> plot<00:01:38.189> Hydra

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
beginner which is a single plot Hydra

beginner which is a single plot Hydra
draw<00:01:39.000> system<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.689> which<00:01:40.500> basically<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
draw system and which basically as a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.910 
draw system and which basically as a
system<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.880> sort<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.270> feeds<00:01:42.840> very<00:01:43.380> pump<00:01:43.740> as

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
system that sort of feeds very pump as

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.889 
system that sort of feeds very pump as
opposed<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.399> hand<00:01:44.640> feeding<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.479> plant<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
opposed to hand feeding one plant to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.139 
opposed to hand feeding one plant to
look<00:01:46.110> after<00:01:46.290> right<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.549> aeroponic

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
look after right up to the aeroponic

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.330 
look after right up to the aeroponic
arrow<00:01:48.390> top<00:01:48.750> system<00:01:49.140> which<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:50.159> bit

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
arrow top system which is a little bit

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.210 
arrow top system which is a little bit
more<00:01:50.460> tricky<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.939> use<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.799> probably

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
more tricky to use and it's probably

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.280 
more tricky to use and it's probably
what<00:01:53.549> alien<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.299> people<00:01:54.630> used<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
what alien to what people used to in

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.709 
what alien to what people used to in
household<00:01:56.219> plants<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:56.880> yet<00:01:57.090> that's<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
household plants but yet that's a the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.109 
household plants but yet that's a the
range<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.380> plutonium<00:01:58.860> from<00:01:59.399> beginner<00:01:59.759> right

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
range of plutonium from beginner right

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.660 
range of plutonium from beginner right
the<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.299> through<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.540> expert<00:02:01.040> so<00:02:02.040> what<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.640> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the way through to expert so what is it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
the way through to expert so what is it
that<00:02:02.880> makes<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.299> Plutonian<00:02:03.750> systems

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that makes the Plutonian systems

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.170 
that makes the Plutonian systems
different<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:05.670> already<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
different to that that's already on the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.479 
different to that that's already on the
market<00:02:06.530> okay<00:02:07.530> yeah<00:02:07.740> there's<00:02:08.220> quite<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> few

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
market okay yeah there's quite a few

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.790 
market okay yeah there's quite a few
things<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.720> first<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.170> what<00:02:10.379> would<00:02:10.530> says

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
things the first one what would says

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.979 
things the first one what would says
it's<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.610> brand<00:02:11.849> new<00:02:11.970> design<00:02:12.120> system<00:02:12.720> quite<00:02:12.959> a

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
it's a brand new design system quite a

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.750 
it's a brand new design system quite a
lot<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> systems

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
lot of the systems

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.250 
lot of the systems
similar<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.180> have<00:02:14.299> been<00:02:14.450> out<00:02:14.569> there<00:02:14.599> been

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
similar that have been out there been

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.780 
similar that have been out there been
out<00:02:15.379> there<00:02:15.530> quite<00:02:15.799> quite<00:02:16.129> a<00:02:16.159> while<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:16.610> so

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
out there quite quite a while now so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.880 
out there quite quite a while now so
this<00:02:16.909> is<00:02:17.120> quite<00:02:17.870> an<00:02:17.959> up-to-date<00:02:18.200> version<00:02:18.409> as<00:02:18.860> a

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
this is quite an up-to-date version as a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.890 
this is quite an up-to-date version as a
few<00:02:19.129> nice<00:02:19.670> little<00:02:19.970> quirky<00:02:20.269> details<00:02:20.689> and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
few nice little quirky details and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.360 
few nice little quirky details and
they're<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.230> viewing<00:02:21.530> panel<00:02:21.860> which

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
they're like the viewing panel which

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.949 
they're like the viewing panel which
helps<00:02:22.730> when<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:22.970> system<00:02:23.120> startup<00:02:23.510> going<00:02:23.810> in

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
helps when the system startup going in

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.690 
helps when the system startup going in
these<00:02:24.409> Kansas<00:02:24.829> systems<00:02:25.159> if<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.340> get<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.489> bit

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
these Kansas systems if you get a bit

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.640 
these Kansas systems if you get a bit
busy<00:02:25.849> but<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.540> can<00:02:26.659> sort<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.079> the<00:02:27.230> family<00:02:27.530> off

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
busy but you can sort it the family off

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.030 
busy but you can sort it the family off
get<00:02:28.189> inside<00:02:28.489> see<00:02:28.909> what<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.239> level<00:02:29.599> so<00:02:30.409> just<00:02:30.980> a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
get inside see what a level so just a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.610 
get inside see what a level so just a
pump<00:02:31.310> if<00:02:31.400> required<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.269> basically<00:02:32.480> fill<00:02:33.379> and

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
pump if required and basically fill and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.729 
pump if required and basically fill and
you<00:02:33.980> know<00:02:34.099> check<00:02:34.519> your<00:02:34.610> nutrient<00:02:34.970> solution

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
you know check your nutrient solution

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.530 
you know check your nutrient solution
another<00:02:36.739> sort<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.310> one<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.239> biggest

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
another sort of one of the biggest

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.300 
another sort of one of the biggest
benefits<00:02:39.019> of<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.170> system<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.799> it<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.280> a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
benefits of the system is is it is a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.300 
benefits of the system is is it is a
modular<00:02:40.760> system<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.810> there's<00:02:42.079> quite<00:02:42.379> a<00:02:42.409> varied

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
modular system so there's quite a varied

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.550 
modular system so there's quite a varied
amount<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.670> types<00:02:43.939> of<00:02:44.150> systems<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:45.409> more

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
amount of types of systems but more

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.500 
amount of types of systems but more
importantly<00:02:46.099> we've<00:02:46.459> been<00:02:46.670> sort<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.299> in<00:02:47.420> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
importantly we've been sort of in the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.849 
importantly we've been sort of in the
game<00:02:47.690> quite<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.989> while<00:02:48.230> now<00:02:48.260> there's<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.650> lot<00:02:48.829> of

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
game quite a while now there's a lot of

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.190 
game quite a while now there's a lot of
pencils<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:50.000> happened<00:02:50.359> and<00:02:50.810> this<00:02:50.930> system

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
pencils have happened and this system

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.690 
pencils have happened and this system
predominately<00:02:51.859> on<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.069> first<00:02:52.310> path<00:02:52.549> at<00:02:52.639> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
predominately on the first path at the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.270 
predominately on the first path at the
launch<00:02:52.940> has<00:02:53.269> got<00:02:54.049> systems<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.650> fit<00:02:54.889> more

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
launch has got systems that fit more

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.059 
launch has got systems that fit more
sizes<00:02:55.730> intense<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:56.209> out<00:02:56.359> there<00:02:56.599> so<00:02:56.780> 45<00:02:57.650> 40

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
sizes intense it's out there so 45 40

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.849 
sizes intense it's out there so 45 40
centimeter<00:02:58.700> 60<00:02:59.180> bat<00:02:59.299> six<00:02:59.569> there<00:02:59.780> 82<00:03:00.349> x<00:03:00.470> 18

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
meter by meter 1.2 x 1.2 and they're all

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.710 
meter by meter 1.2 x 1.2 and they're all
nice<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.190> square<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.549> i<00:03:04.639> said<00:03:04.790> modular<00:03:05.239> and

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
nice and square like i said modular and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.349 
nice and square like i said modular and
if<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.049> tensile<00:03:06.349> of<00:03:06.440> way<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:06.980> yeah<00:03:07.400> exam<00:03:07.849> it

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
if it the tensile of way so yeah exam it

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.490 
if it the tensile of way so yeah exam it
covers<00:03:08.690> from<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.870> best<00:03:09.109> live<00:03:09.319> on<00:03:09.409> the

covers from the best live on the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.869 
covers from the best live on the
beginner<00:03:09.769> right<00:03:10.129> through<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.489> expert

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
beginner right through to the expert

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.809 
beginner right through to the expert
okay<00:03:11.810> Matt<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.440> would<00:03:12.799> you<00:03:12.920> argue<00:03:13.129> that<00:03:13.579> and

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
okay Matt so would you argue that and

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.369 
okay Matt so would you argue that and
the<00:03:14.000> plutonium<00:03:14.450> systems<00:03:14.840> give<00:03:15.049> you<00:03:15.139> more

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
the plutonium systems give you more

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.129 
the plutonium systems give you more
control<00:03:15.409> over<00:03:16.099> your<00:03:16.370> grill<00:03:16.670> yep<00:03:17.480> control

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
control over your grill yep control

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:20.409 
control over your grill yep control
definitely<00:03:18.650> which<00:03:18.739> is<00:03:18.889> very<00:03:19.099> important<00:03:19.669> once

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
definitely which is very important once

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.050 
definitely which is very important once
you're<00:03:20.569> growing<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.199> also<00:03:21.560> flexibility<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:23.030> a

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
you're growing and also flexibility is a

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.839 
you're growing and also flexibility is a
key<00:03:23.269> point<00:03:23.480> I'd<00:03:23.660> like<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.810> put<00:03:24.049> in<00:03:24.169> there<00:03:24.349> and

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
key point I'd like to put in there and

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.069 
key point I'd like to put in there and
flexibility<00:03:25.849> being<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.510> system's<00:03:26.930> you

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
flexibility being the system's you

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.259 
flexibility being the system's you
basically<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:28.639> know<00:03:28.730> you've<00:03:28.940> got<00:03:28.970> eight

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
basically you know you've got eight

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.750 
basically you know you've got eight
different<00:03:29.540> styles<00:03:29.989> of<00:03:30.049> system<00:03:30.440> in<00:03:31.340> terms<00:03:31.400> of

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
different styles of system in terms of

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.009 
different styles of system in terms of
size<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.239> 40<00:03:32.690> by<00:03:32.810> 40<00:03:33.139> 60<00:03:33.709> by<00:03:33.889> 60<00:03:34.280> 80<00:03:34.879> x<00:03:35.269> 80<00:03:35.449> meter

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
size in 40 by 40 60 by 60 80 x 80 meter

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.559 
size in 40 by 40 60 by 60 80 x 80 meter
by<00:03:36.260> meter<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.769> a<00:03:36.799> 1.2<00:03:37.370> x<00:03:37.579> 1<00:03:37.790> x<00:03:37.910> 2<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.510> that

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
by meter and a 1.2 x 1 x 2 and that

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.869 
by meter and a 1.2 x 1 x 2 and that
centimeters<00:03:39.349> and<00:03:39.500> that<00:03:40.040> square<00:03:40.370> modular

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
centimeters and that square modular

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.849 
centimeters and that square modular
systems<00:03:41.269> because<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:42.109> matter<00:03:42.290> tents<00:03:42.590> have

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
systems because it matter tents have

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.890 
systems because it matter tents have
sort<00:03:43.129> of<00:03:43.160> been<00:03:43.220> used<00:03:43.549> in<00:03:43.760> people<00:03:44.090> because<00:03:44.780> of

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
sort of been used in people because of

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.449 
sort of been used in people because of
the<00:03:44.989> space<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.410> at<00:03:45.530> premium<00:03:45.889> people<00:03:46.280> green

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
the space is at premium people green

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.699 
the space is at premium people green
sense<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.449> we've<00:03:47.629> sort<00:03:47.900> of<00:03:47.930> bestest<00:03:48.500> first

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
sense so we've sort of bestest first

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.439 
sense so we've sort of bestest first
module<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.190> first<00:03:49.430> launch<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.000> plutonium

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:50.449 
module and first launch of the plutonium

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.509 
module and first launch of the plutonium
is<00:03:50.629> to<00:03:51.139> fit<00:03:51.349> within<00:03:51.530> those<00:03:51.769> parameters<00:03:51.980> and

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
is to fit within those parameters and

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.300 
is to fit within those parameters and
yeah<00:03:53.419> the<00:03:53.540> flexibility<00:03:54.169> again<00:03:54.410> is<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:55.129> took

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
yeah the flexibility again is it took

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.740 
yeah the flexibility again is it took
Stan<00:03:55.489> earlier<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:55.970> we've<00:03:56.090> got<00:03:56.209> aeroponics

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
Stan earlier that we've got aeroponics

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.780 
Stan earlier that we've got aeroponics
and<00:03:56.870> hydroponics<00:03:57.470> really<00:03:58.280> that's<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.549> choice

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
and hydroponics really that's a choice

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.330 
and hydroponics really that's a choice
I'd<00:03:59.389> japonicus<00:03:59.930> non<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.650> simplest<00:04:01.099> sort<00:04:01.280> of

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
I'd japonicus non the simplest sort of

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.189 
I'd japonicus non the simplest sort of
systems<00:04:01.699> and<00:04:02.269> made<00:04:02.480> before<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.840> beginners

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.199 
systems and made before the beginners

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.990 
systems and made before the beginners
the<00:04:03.319> aeroponic<00:04:03.829> a<00:04:03.980> little<00:04:04.489> bit<00:04:04.579> more<00:04:04.760> tricky

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
the aeroponic a little bit more tricky

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.300 
the aeroponic a little bit more tricky
to<00:04:05.269> get<00:04:05.389> your<00:04:05.569> head<00:04:05.690> round<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.230> up<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:07.010> deliver

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
to get your head round and up to deliver

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.800 
to get your head round and up to deliver
basically<00:04:07.849> that's<00:04:08.060> maybe<00:04:08.269> for<00:04:08.449> the<00:04:08.480> expert

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
basically that's maybe for the expert

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.809 
basically that's maybe for the expert
but<00:04:09.319> this<00:04:09.440> system<00:04:09.829> sort<00:04:09.979> of<00:04:10.069> combines<00:04:10.459> above

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
but this system sort of combines above

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.089 
but this system sort of combines above
you<00:04:11.569> can<00:04:11.720> basically<00:04:12.019> and<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.799> one<00:04:12.919> of<00:04:13.040> the

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
you can basically and this is one of the

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.129 
you can basically and this is one of the
points<00:04:13.879> of<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.419> mean<00:04:14.690> is<00:04:14.930> the

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
points of the mean is the

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.080 
points of the mean is the
flexibilities<00:04:15.829> you<00:04:16.250> can<00:04:16.400> actually<00:04:16.639> jump<00:04:16.880> from

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
flexibilities you can actually jump from

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.029 
flexibilities you can actually jump from
one<00:04:17.209> system<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.599> the<00:04:17.750> other<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:18.709> you've<00:04:18.919> got

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
one system to the other so you've got

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.189 
one system to the other so you've got
the<00:04:19.130> standard<00:04:19.549> what<00:04:20.239> people<00:04:20.599> will<00:04:20.690> probably

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
the standard what people will probably

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.629 
the standard what people will probably
get<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.440> red<00:04:21.560> round<00:04:21.799> in<00:04:21.950> terms<00:04:22.190> of<00:04:22.310> feeding

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
get the red round in terms of feeding

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.950 
get the red round in terms of feeding
the<00:04:22.729> plant<00:04:22.969> instead<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.360> hand<00:04:23.539> feed<00:04:23.719> in<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
the plant instead of hand feed in the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.110 
the plant instead of hand feed in the
house<00:04:24.139> plant<00:04:24.469> you<00:04:25.099> can<00:04:25.280> basically<00:04:25.520> setting<00:04:25.969> up

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
house plant you can basically setting up

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.820 
house plant you can basically setting up
the<00:04:26.210> system<00:04:26.570> that

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
the system that

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.950 
the system that
feed<00:04:27.189> it<00:04:27.220> on<00:04:27.729> itself<00:04:28.060> doing<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.509> radiation

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
feed it on itself doing the radiation

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.270 
feed it on itself doing the radiation
system<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.409> then<00:04:29.740> you've<00:04:29.860> got<00:04:29.889> one's

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
system and then you've got one's

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.610 
system and then you've got one's
basically<00:04:30.759> brought<00:04:30.970> Magnus<00:04:31.780> oil<00:04:31.990> which<00:04:32.590> is

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
basically brought Magnus oil which is

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.950 
basically brought Magnus oil which is
you<00:04:32.979> know<00:04:33.039> aeroponic<00:04:33.639> hydroponics<00:04:34.509> combined

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
you know aeroponic hydroponics combined

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.260 
you know aeroponic hydroponics combined
together<00:04:35.610> okay<00:04:36.610> well<00:04:36.729> that<00:04:36.819> all<00:04:36.939> sounds<00:04:37.120> very

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
together okay well that all sounds very

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.089 
together okay well that all sounds very
interesting<00:04:37.629> but<00:04:38.080> someone<00:04:38.620> like<00:04:38.740> me<00:04:38.889> it's

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
interesting but someone like me it's

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.490 
interesting but someone like me it's
also<00:04:39.219> quite<00:04:39.460> confusing<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.689> why<00:04:41.259> have<00:04:41.409> you

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
also quite confusing and why have you

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.399 
also quite confusing and why have you
got<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:41.919> many<00:04:42.069> different<00:04:42.370> systems<00:04:42.629> okay<00:04:43.629> yet

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
got so many different systems okay yet

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.869 
got so many different systems okay yet
there's<00:04:44.590> quite<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.860> lot<00:04:45.009> of<00:04:45.069> systems<00:04:45.400> in<00:04:45.669> there

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:45.879 
there's quite a lot of systems in there

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.339 
there's quite a lot of systems in there
and<00:04:46.030> basically<00:04:46.180> what<00:04:46.750> we're<00:04:46.900> trying<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.169> do<00:04:47.289> is

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
and basically what we're trying to do is

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.200 
and basically what we're trying to do is
reach<00:04:47.560> out<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:48.069> each<00:04:48.280> different<00:04:48.699> level<00:04:49.120> of

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
reach out to each different level of

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.209 
reach out to each different level of
growth<00:04:49.419> from<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.229> beginner<00:04:50.500> right<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.099> the

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:51.219 
growth from the beginner right to the

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:53.939 
growth from the beginner right to the
expert<00:04:51.639> and<00:04:51.909> also<00:04:52.629> in<00:04:53.020> terms<00:04:53.229> of<00:04:53.409> the<00:04:53.530> systems

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
expert and also in terms of the systems

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.950 
expert and also in terms of the systems
people<00:04:54.699> are<00:04:54.819> favorable<00:04:55.330> methods<00:04:55.689> that<00:04:55.810> the

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
people are favorable methods that the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.110 
people are favorable methods that the
use<00:04:56.080> so<00:04:56.710> yeah<00:04:56.889> I<00:04:56.919> take<00:04:57.430> your<00:04:57.520> point<00:04:57.669> you<00:04:57.849> can<00:04:58.000> be

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
use so yeah I take your point you can be

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.809 
use so yeah I take your point you can be
a<00:04:58.150> little<00:04:58.389> bit<00:04:58.569> confusing<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.289> quite<00:05:00.250> simply

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
a little bit confusing and quite simply

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.550 
a little bit confusing and quite simply
and<00:05:00.969> the<00:05:01.330> best<00:05:01.539> way<00:05:01.599> to<00:05:01.750> sort<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.139> break<00:05:02.409> it

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
and the best way to sort of break it

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.709 
and the best way to sort of break it
down<00:05:02.710> is<00:05:02.949> you<00:05:03.520> basically<00:05:03.699> you<00:05:04.300> choose<00:05:04.569> your

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719 
down is you basically you choose your

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.649 
down is you basically you choose your

do<00:05:07.750> with<00:05:07.780> them<00:05:08.020> what<00:05:08.139> space<00:05:08.440> you've<00:05:08.620> got<00:05:08.800> to

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
do with them what space you've got to

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.559 
do with them what space you've got to
grow<00:05:09.129> and<00:05:09.669> once<00:05:09.849> you<00:05:09.969> sort<00:05:10.150> of<00:05:10.240> got<00:05:10.419> your

is it a dripper standard River which is
quite<00:05:16.409> relatively<00:05:17.409> easy<00:05:17.560> or<00:05:17.889> is<00:05:18.069> it<00:05:18.159> into<00:05:18.310> a

little bit more technical aeroponic and

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.749 
little bit more technical aeroponic and
then<00:05:20.319> we've<00:05:20.409> got<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.590> few<00:05:20.830> systems<00:05:21.190> that<00:05:21.520> sort

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 
then we've got a few systems that sort

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.610 
then we've got a few systems that sort

a one plant system and I think once you

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.769 
a one plant system and I think once you
get<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.460> multi<00:06:00.909> site<00:06:01.120> so<00:06:01.419> you're<00:06:01.509> getting<00:06:01.599> a

get to multi site so you're getting a

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.689

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
little bit more technical but once you

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:04.709 
little bit more technical but once you

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
principle of hydroponics I've growing

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.579 
principle of hydroponics I've growing
into<00:06:06.969> the<00:06:07.240> sort<00:06:07.569> of<00:06:07.599> one<00:06:07.839> plant<00:06:08.139> system<00:06:08.500> which

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:08.589 
into the sort of one plant system which

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.800 
into the sort of one plant system which
is<00:06:08.710> algebra<00:06:09.250> and<00:06:09.699> then<00:06:10.150> you<00:06:10.270> can<00:06:10.419> build<00:06:10.599> from

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
is algebra and then you can build from

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.360 
is algebra and then you can build from
there<00:06:11.020> and<00:06:11.229> like<00:06:11.409> i<00:06:11.440> said<00:06:11.589> the<00:06:11.740> flexibility<00:06:12.339> of

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
there and like i said the flexibility of

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.820 
there and like i said the flexibility of
the<00:06:12.430> system<00:06:12.819> would<00:06:13.240> let<00:06:13.479> you<00:06:13.599> build<00:06:13.779> if<00:06:14.650> you

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
the system would let you build if you

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.230 
the system would let you build if you
wanted<00:06:15.069> to<00:06:15.129> go<00:06:15.250> then<00:06:15.550> in<00:06:15.669> two<00:06:15.819> straight

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
wanted to go then in two straight

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.019 
wanted to go then in two straight
hydroponics<00:06:16.839> or<00:06:17.020> aeroponics<00:06:17.680> so<00:06:18.190> what<00:06:18.610> sorts

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:19.029 
hydroponics or aeroponics so what sorts

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:20.670 
hydroponics or aeroponics so what sorts
of<00:06:19.120> plants<00:06:19.539> does<00:06:19.750> the<00:06:19.839> floridian<00:06:20.289> sister<00:06:20.589> and

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
of plants does the floridian sister and

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.610 
of plants does the floridian sister and
cater<00:06:20.889> for<00:06:21.629> again<00:06:22.629> you've<00:06:22.900> got<00:06:23.169> quite<00:06:23.349> a<00:06:23.409> range

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
cater for again you've got quite a range

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.140 
cater for again you've got quite a range
to<00:06:23.800> go<00:06:23.919> out<00:06:23.979> because<00:06:24.279> of<00:06:24.400> the<00:06:24.460> flexibility<00:06:25.089> of

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
to go out because of the flexibility of

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.180 
to go out because of the flexibility of
the<00:06:25.270> system<00:06:25.690> you've<00:06:25.900> got<00:06:26.169> the<00:06:26.379> high<00:06:26.800> just<00:06:27.069> on

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
the system you've got the high just on

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.189 
the system you've got the high just on
and<00:06:27.339> Evan<00:06:27.580> floor<00:06:27.879> which<00:06:28.360> are<00:06:28.479> basically<00:06:28.659> grown

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
ideal then you've got the stair range

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:40.390 
ideal then you've got the stair range
and<00:06:37.810> stab<00:06:38.080> being<00:06:38.409> 6.4<00:06:39.339> liter<00:06:39.370> pots

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
and stab being 6.4 liter pots

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.820 
and stab being 6.4 liter pots

is the medium sized pot and then that's

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.499 
is the medium sized pot and then that's
like<00:06:42.889> it<00:06:43.160> is<00:06:43.280> in<00:06:43.400> between<00:06:43.759> and<00:06:44.000> then<00:06:44.389> you've
