00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the ABS mark free I've done a video

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.040 
the ABS mark free I've done a video
knees<00:00:17.070> before<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.510> just<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.750> slightly

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
knees before but this is just a slightly

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.940 
knees before but this is just a slightly
updated<00:00:19.260> one<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.520> I'll<00:00:20.790> just<00:00:21.029> be<00:00:21.180> showing<00:00:21.210> you

updated one and I'll just be showing you

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.050 
updated one and I'll just be showing you
the<00:00:22.950> actual<00:00:23.070> lock<00:00:23.310> itself<00:00:23.580> from<00:00:23.790> one<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.029> two

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the actual lock itself from one of two

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.839 
the actual lock itself from one of two
techniques<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:24.900> use<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.290> these<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
techniques that you can use on these and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.060 
techniques that you can use on these and
generally<00:00:26.849> when<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.090> pick<00:00:27.300> these<00:00:27.419> locks<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.529> just

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
generally when I pick these locks I just

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.150 
generally when I pick these locks I just
have<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> mixture<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:30.200> Spike<00:00:31.200> picks<00:00:31.470> etc<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.130> I

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
have a mixture of Spike picks etc that I

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.620 
have a mixture of Spike picks etc that I
use<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.640> I'll<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.850> show<00:00:32.970> you<00:00:33.000> one<00:00:33.270> two<00:00:33.480> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
use so I'll just show you one two of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.500 
use so I'll just show you one two of
them<00:00:34.250> okay<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> slightly<00:00:36.270> different

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
them okay this is slightly different

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.049 
them okay this is slightly different
picks<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.870> tension<00:00:40.260> tools<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.640> bit<00:00:41.940> of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
picks and tension tools and bit of

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.090 
picks and tension tools and bit of
spring<00:00:42.360> steel<00:00:42.510> etc<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.320> make<00:00:43.500> sense<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
spring steel etc that make sense and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.290 
spring steel etc that make sense and
I'll<00:00:44.880> show<00:00:45.060> you<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> action<00:00:45.570> lock<00:00:47.300> so

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
I'll show you the action lock so

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.120 
I'll show you the action lock so
literally<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.320> few<00:00:49.350> different<00:00:49.890> picks

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
literally just a few different picks

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.940 
literally just a few different picks
there<00:00:50.400> and<00:00:51.200> generally<00:00:52.200> fine<00:00:52.470> as<00:00:52.620> well<00:00:52.740> just

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
there and generally fine as well just

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.060 
there and generally fine as well just
depending<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.520> job<00:00:53.730> situation<00:00:55.070> some

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
depending on the job situation some

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.980 
depending on the job situation some
Peaks<00:00:56.280> work<00:00:56.550> better<00:00:57.140> than<00:00:58.140> other<00:00:58.380> picks<00:00:59.990> but

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
Peaks work better than other picks but

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.450 
Peaks work better than other picks but
we'll<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.470> how<00:01:01.560> we<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.860> on<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.220> lock

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
we'll see how we get on with this lock

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.429 
we'll see how we get on with this lock
now<00:01:03.210> obviously<00:01:03.630> with<00:01:03.750> these<00:01:03.930> locks<00:01:04.170> they're

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
now obviously with these locks they're

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.389 
now obviously with these locks they're
the<00:01:04.559> mark<00:01:04.769> free<00:01:04.979> IDs<00:01:05.840> we<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.049> deal<00:01:07.399> also

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
the mark free IDs we have to deal also

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.429 
the mark free IDs we have to deal also
from<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> picking<00:01:08.909> point<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> view<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:10.200> fact

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
from a picking point of view with fact

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.080 
from a picking point of view with fact
they<00:01:10.560> put<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> magnetic<00:01:11.130> pin<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:11.850> so

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
they put a magnetic pin in there so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.999 
they put a magnetic pin in there so
somewhere<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> key<00:01:12.869> I'll<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.770> grab<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
somewhere on the key I'll just grab a

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.240 
somewhere on the key I'll just grab a
key<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.810> they'll<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> magnetic<00:01:16.380> pin<00:01:16.830> just

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
key here they'll be a magnetic pin just

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.980 
key here they'll be a magnetic pin just
to<00:01:17.370> bring<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.850> interview<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.479> case<00:01:18.780> on

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
to bring that interview in this case on

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.649 
to bring that interview in this case on
this<00:01:19.110> lot<00:01:19.440> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:20.220> see<00:01:20.370> it's<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.880> fifth

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
this lot you can see it's on the fifth

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.510 
this lot you can see it's on the fifth
pin<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> could<00:01:23.430> be

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
pin how you get it but it could be

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.070 
pin how you get it but it could be
anywhere<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:23.940> there<00:01:24.500> okay<00:01:25.880> also<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.570> lock<00:01:27.780> has

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
anywhere on there okay also the lock has

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.820 
anywhere on there okay also the lock has
a<00:01:28.440> row<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.490> trap<00:01:29.850> pins<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:31.020> each<00:01:31.320> side<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
a row of trap pins on each side of the

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.399 
a row of trap pins on each side of the
plug<00:01:32.010> we've<00:01:32.250> got<00:01:32.370> free<00:01:32.640> trappings<00:01:33.299> if<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.229> just

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
plug we've got free trappings if I just

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.460 
plug we've got free trappings if I just
zoom<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.950> hopefully<00:01:35.900> you'll<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:36.930> able<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.229> see

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
zoom in hopefully you'll be able to see

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.200 
zoom in hopefully you'll be able to see
them

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
them

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
them
okay<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> underside<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.619> plug

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
okay just on the underside of the plug

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.420 
okay just on the underside of the plug
he's<00:01:41.909> bringing<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.210> back<00:01:42.479> into<00:01:42.720> focus

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
he's bringing that back into focus

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.340 
he's bringing that back into focus
hopefully<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.820> free<00:01:45.570> trap<00:01:45.900> pins

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
hopefully you can see free trap pins

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.030 
hopefully you can see free trap pins
you've<00:01:46.860> got<00:01:47.010> one<00:01:47.220> two<00:01:48.140> three<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.710> got<00:01:49.860> that

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you've got one two three and we got that

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.830 
you've got one two three and we got that
on<00:01:50.159> each<00:01:50.280> side<00:01:50.580> of<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.850> plug<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.420> they're

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
on each side of the plug and they're

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.420 
on each side of the plug and they're
obviously<00:01:52.110> they're<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.040> when<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> lock

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
obviously they're just so when the lock

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.399 
obviously they're just so when the lock
is<00:01:53.460> actually<00:01:53.880> picked<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.960> plug<00:01:55.140> will<00:01:55.290> only

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
is actually picked the plug will only

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.460 
is actually picked the plug will only
rotate<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.070> far<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.610> lock<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:58.290> once

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
rotate so far then lock up and the once

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.990 
rotate so far then lock up and the once
a<00:01:58.560> lot<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.860> picked<00:01:59.100> air<00:01:59.310> they're<00:01:59.520> not<00:01:59.670> too<00:01:59.820> hard

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
a lot is picked air they're not too hard

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.230 
a lot is picked air they're not too hard
to<00:02:00.119> deal<00:02:00.360> with<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.979> obviously<00:02:02.970> this<00:02:03.119> was

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to deal with and and obviously this was

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.670 
to deal with and and obviously this was
picked<00:02:03.390> outside<00:02:03.900> someone<00:02:04.229> didn't<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.500> what

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
picked outside someone didn't know what

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310 
picked outside someone didn't know what
they<00:02:04.770> were<00:02:04.830> doing<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:06.960> wouldn't<00:02:07.259> be

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
they were doing you then wouldn't be

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.839 
they were doing you then wouldn't be
able<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> get<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.740> key<00:02:07.920> back<00:02:08.129> into<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.640> lock

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
able to get the key back into the lock

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.210 
able to get the key back into the lock
okay

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
okay

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.630 
okay
also<00:02:11.220> from<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.819> external<00:02:12.569> side<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.080> rack

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
also from the external side of the rack

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.000 
also from the external side of the rack
once<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.730> lock<00:02:14.879> is<00:02:15.000> actually<00:02:15.299> picked<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.010> if

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
once a lock is actually picked and if

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.409 
once a lock is actually picked and if
you're<00:02:17.159> just<00:02:17.189> using<00:02:17.459> your<00:02:17.670> basic<00:02:17.760> Spade<00:02:18.150> picks

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:18.419 
you're just using your basic Spade picks

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:21.530 
you're just using your basic Spade picks
it<00:02:18.569> won't<00:02:18.749> pick<00:02:18.930> up<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.230> cam<00:02:19.519> okay<00:02:20.540> so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
it won't pick up the cam okay so

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.890 
it won't pick up the cam okay so
normally<00:02:22.019> it'd<00:02:22.859> be<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.129> tip<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.519> key

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
normally it'd be the tip of the key

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.289 
normally it'd be the tip of the key
the<00:02:24.900> extra<00:02:25.140> tip<00:02:25.519> when<00:02:26.519> that<00:02:26.670> goes<00:02:26.849> into<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
the extra tip when that goes into the

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.190 
the extra tip when that goes into the
lock<00:02:27.540> as<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.409> goes<00:02:28.530> through<00:02:28.969> it<00:02:29.969> now<00:02:30.480> engages

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
lock as it goes through it now engages

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.470 
lock as it goes through it now engages
into<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.590> cam<00:02:31.799> ie<00:02:32.219> to<00:02:32.579> turn<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.060> when<00:02:33.359> you're

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
into the cam ie to turn but when you're

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.280 
into the cam ie to turn but when you're
picking<00:02:33.749> the<00:02:33.840> lock

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
picking the lock

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.080 
picking the lock
you<00:02:34.889> haven't<00:02:35.099> got<00:02:35.219> anything<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.639> there<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.939> do

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
you haven't got anything in there to do

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.239 
you haven't got anything in there to do
that<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.780> then<00:02:36.989> have<00:02:37.439> to<00:02:37.469> pick<00:02:37.739> up<00:02:37.889> the<00:02:38.010> can

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:38.249 
that you then have to pick up the can

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:40.420 
that you then have to pick up the can
once<00:02:39.060> you've<00:02:39.239> got<00:02:39.389> the<00:02:39.689> actual<00:02:39.810> pins<00:02:40.139> baked

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
once you've got the actual pins baked

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.709 
once you've got the actual pins baked
okay<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:41.609> hopefully<00:02:41.879> we'll<00:02:42.060> make<00:02:42.209> sense

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
okay but hopefully we'll make sense

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.920 
okay but hopefully we'll make sense
okay<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.090> just<00:02:45.090> what<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.269> picking<00:02:45.569> point<00:02:45.780> of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
okay so just what a picking point of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.229 
okay so just what a picking point of
view<00:02:46.400> okay<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.489> first<00:02:47.670> thing<00:02:47.879> I'm<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.180> to

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
view okay the first thing I'm going to

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.979 
view okay the first thing I'm going to
show<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.450> is<00:02:49.139> on<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.040> lot<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.549> this<00:02:50.760> where<00:02:51.150> we

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
show you is on a lot like this where we

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.229 
show you is on a lot like this where we
know<00:02:52.200> where<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.189> actual<00:02:53.430> magnetic<00:02:53.909> pin<00:02:54.090> is

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
know where the actual magnetic pin is

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.179 
know where the actual magnetic pin is
and<00:02:54.540> we<00:02:55.079> know<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.469> it's<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.739> fifth<00:02:55.950> pin

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
and we know that it's the fifth pin

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.309 
and we know that it's the fifth pin
because<00:02:56.489> if<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.909> the<00:02:57.120> fifth<00:02:57.329> pin<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:58.139> might

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
because if it is the fifth pin we might

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.830 
because if it is the fifth pin we might
stick<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:59.010> lot<00:02:59.879> easier<00:03:00.269> because<00:03:00.480> all<00:03:00.689> I've

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
stick in a lot easier because all I've

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.580 
stick in a lot easier because all I've
done<00:03:01.019> here<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:02.310> adapter<00:03:02.849> key<00:03:03.139> okay<00:03:04.139> see<00:03:04.439> I've

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
done here is adapter key okay see I've

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.209 
done here is adapter key okay see I've
cut<00:03:04.859> off<00:03:04.980> all<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.180> way<00:03:06.299> down<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.199> offer<00:03:07.919> the

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
cut off all the way down so offer the

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.129 
cut off all the way down so offer the
Keyblade<00:03:08.669> all<00:03:09.120> I've<00:03:09.359> done<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.569> left<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.930> tip

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
Keyblade all I've done is left the tip

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.509 
Keyblade all I've done is left the tip
of<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.349> key<00:03:10.530> okay<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.879> then<00:03:12.569> magnetic<00:03:12.989> pin

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
of the key okay and then magnetic pin

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.789 
of the key okay and then magnetic pin
okay<00:03:14.519> what<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.510> allowed<00:03:15.780> me<00:03:15.959> do<00:03:16.109> is<00:03:16.169> to<00:03:16.409> do

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
okay what that allowed me do is to do

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.399 
okay what that allowed me do is to do
two<00:03:17.069> jobs<00:03:17.099> that<00:03:17.939> I'd<00:03:18.060> normally<00:03:18.239> have<00:03:18.599> to<00:03:18.750> do<00:03:18.900> in

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
two jobs that I'd normally have to do in

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.679 
two jobs that I'd normally have to do in
a<00:03:19.530> different<00:03:19.859> way<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.310> is<00:03:20.519> firstly<00:03:21.090> to

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
a different way and that is firstly to

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.159 
a different way and that is firstly to
pick<00:03:21.840> up<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.109> cam<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:23.219> secondly<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:24.049> to<00:03:25.049> get

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
pick up the cam and secondly and to get

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.379 
pick up the cam and secondly and to get
straight<00:03:25.439> on<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.859> magnetic<00:03:26.219> pin<00:03:26.609> so<00:03:27.329> all

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
straight on to that magnetic pin so all

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.059 
straight on to that magnetic pin so all
I'm<00:03:27.569> going<00:03:27.689> to<00:03:27.750> do<00:03:27.930> I'm<00:03:28.439> just<00:03:28.500> going<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.769> cert

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
I'm going to do I'm just going to cert

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.369 
I'm going to do I'm just going to cert
that<00:03:29.250> all<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.549> way<00:03:29.669> into<00:03:30.629> the<00:03:30.750> lock<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.199> you

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
that all the way into the lock and you

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.449 
that all the way into the lock and you
can<00:03:31.470> see<00:03:31.699> how<00:03:32.699> it<00:03:33.120> goes<00:03:33.389> off<00:03:33.599> on<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:33.840> pin<00:03:34.109> side

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
can see how it goes off on the pin side

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.539 
can see how it goes off on the pin side
so<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.729> now<00:03:36.150> stops<00:03:36.859> now<00:03:37.859> what<00:03:38.040> they<00:03:38.189> are<00:03:38.220> down

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
so that now stops now what they are down

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.879 
so that now stops now what they are down
will<00:03:38.699> it<00:03:38.790> do<00:03:38.909> now<00:03:39.239> I<00:03:39.449> just<00:03:40.199> swing<00:03:40.439> the<00:03:40.560> camera

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
will it do now I just swing the camera

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.679 
will it do now I just swing the camera
around<00:03:41.750> that<00:03:42.750> will<00:03:42.870> then<00:03:43.019> allow<00:03:43.290> me<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.769> go<00:03:43.949> in

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
around that will then allow me to go in

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.159 
around that will then allow me to go in
with<00:03:45.689> a<00:03:45.720> pick<00:03:47.180> down<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.389> side<00:03:48.599> of<00:03:48.629> that<00:03:48.840> key

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
with a pick down the side of that key

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.469 
with a pick down the side of that key
and<00:03:49.470> start<00:03:49.949> and<00:03:50.099> pick<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.370> lock<00:03:50.400> what<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.209> have

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
and start and pick the lock what I have

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.229 
and start and pick the lock what I have
to<00:03:51.659> do<00:03:51.810> however<00:03:52.379> is<00:03:52.650> make<00:03:52.829> sure<00:03:52.889> that<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.849> key

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
to do however is make sure that that key

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.699 
to do however is make sure that that key
is<00:03:54.509> pushed<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.959> don't<00:03:55.139> if<00:03:55.199> you<00:03:55.319> see<00:03:55.530> if<00:03:55.620> I

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
is pushed in I don't if you see if I

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.219 
is pushed in I don't if you see if I
push<00:03:55.949> it<00:03:56.159> and<00:03:56.340> let<00:03:56.729> go<00:03:56.939> he<00:03:57.329> springs<00:03:57.720> back<00:03:57.930> out

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
push it and let go he springs back out

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.890 
push it and let go he springs back out
so<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:58.859> just<00:03:58.889> need<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.340> make<00:03:59.459> sure<00:03:59.790> that<00:04:00.720> when

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
so I just need to make sure that when

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.949 
so I just need to make sure that when
I'm<00:04:00.989> picking<00:04:01.549> they<00:04:02.549> engages<00:04:03.209> into<00:04:03.509> that<00:04:03.629> cam

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
I'm picking they engages into that cam

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.740 
I'm picking they engages into that cam
okay<00:04:04.799> so<00:04:05.699> this<00:04:06.060> I'm<00:04:06.239> just<00:04:06.329> going<00:04:06.479> to<00:04:06.569> use<00:04:06.719> a

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
okay so this I'm just going to use a

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.009 
okay so this I'm just going to use a
basic<00:04:07.019> little<00:04:07.799> Spade<00:04:08.069> pick<00:04:08.359> so<00:04:09.359> I'm<00:04:09.810> just

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
basic little Spade pick so I'm just

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.949 
basic little Spade pick so I'm just
going<00:04:10.199> to<00:04:10.259> push<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.680> key<00:04:10.829> in<00:04:11.540> apply<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.569> bit<00:04:12.840> of

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
going to push the key in apply a bit of

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.979 
going to push the key in apply a bit of
slight<00:04:13.229> rotation<00:04:14.329> start<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.419> go<00:04:15.569> into<00:04:15.780> the

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
slight rotation start to go into the

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.020 
slight rotation start to go into the
lock<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.650> start<00:04:17.009> to<00:04:17.130> pick<00:04:17.310> these<00:04:17.489> pins<00:04:17.820> and

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
lock and start to pick these pins and

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.939 
lock and start to pick these pins and
I'm<00:04:18.090> just<00:04:18.239> picking<00:04:18.419> it<00:04:18.599> in<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.780> way<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:19.799> we

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
I'm just picking it in a way that we

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.100 
I'm just picking it in a way that we
pick<00:04:20.219> any<00:04:20.400> traditional<00:04:23.090> dip<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.270> dimple<00:04:24.930> tight

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
pick any traditional dip a dimple tight

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.740 
pick any traditional dip a dimple tight
lock<00:04:25.349> so<00:04:25.969> just<00:04:26.969> feeling<00:04:27.360> for<00:04:27.539> the<00:04:27.599> bound<00:04:27.870> pins

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
lock so just feeling for the bound pins

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.600 
lock so just feeling for the bound pins
okay<00:04:30.750> sometimes<00:04:31.469> the<00:04:31.590> bound<00:04:31.800> pins<00:04:32.099> is<00:04:32.279> quite

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
okay sometimes the bound pins is quite

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.379 
okay sometimes the bound pins is quite
hard<00:04:32.849> to<00:04:32.909> get<00:04:33.090> over<00:04:34.340> into<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.520> last<00:04:35.820> pin<00:04:36.120> there

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
hard to get over into the last pin there

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.100 
hard to get over into the last pin there
so

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
so

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.610 
so
see<00:04:37.290> how<00:04:37.500> that<00:04:37.560> is<00:04:38.060> jumped<00:04:39.060> quite<00:04:39.330> away<00:04:39.630> okay

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
see how that is jumped quite away okay

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.660 
see how that is jumped quite away okay
so<00:04:41.780> why<00:04:42.780> now<00:04:42.990> need<00:04:43.200> to<00:04:43.230> do<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:44.100> just<00:04:44.340> get<00:04:44.490> rid<00:04:44.610> of

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
so why now need to do is just get rid of

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.530 
so why now need to do is just get rid of
them<00:04:44.910> trap<00:04:45.240> pins<00:04:45.540> so<00:04:46.320> all<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.470> do<00:04:46.590> is<00:04:46.770> go<00:04:47.070> in<00:04:47.540> and

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
them trap pins so all I do is go in and

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.880 
them trap pins so all I do is go in and
what<00:04:48.750> we<00:04:48.840> doing<00:04:49.050> will<00:04:49.140> attract<00:04:49.440> pins<00:04:49.740> again

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
what we doing will attract pins again

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.130 
what we doing will attract pins again
with<00:04:50.220> depressing<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:52.800> pins<00:04:53.390> okay<00:04:54.390> again

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
with depressing the pins okay again

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.120 
with depressing the pins okay again
getting<00:04:55.920> into<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.340> trap<00:04:56.610> pins<00:04:57.680> so<00:04:58.680> just<00:04:58.950> need

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
getting into the trap pins so just need

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.720 
getting into the trap pins so just need
to<00:04:59.250> depress<00:04:59.700> and<00:05:00.090> trap<00:05:00.930> pins<00:05:01.200> out<00:05:01.350> away

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
to depress and trap pins out away

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.990 
to depress and trap pins out away
there's<00:05:02.730> nice<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.270> light<00:05:04.640> okay<00:05:05.640> you<00:05:05.700> can<00:05:05.880> see

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
there's nice and light okay you can see

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.960 
there's nice and light okay you can see
it<00:05:06.090> now<00:05:06.240> starting<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.720> rotate<00:05:07.730> trap<00:05:08.730> pins

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
it now starting to rotate trap pins

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.110 
it now starting to rotate trap pins
engage<00:05:09.330> again<00:05:11.390> this<00:05:12.390> engage<00:05:12.780> them<00:05:13.050> trap<00:05:13.350> pins

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
engage again this engage them trap pins

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
engage again this engage them trap pins
disengage<00:05:15.120> the<00:05:15.270> trap<00:05:15.480> pins<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.840> just<00:05:16.020> stay

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
disengage the trap pins you just stay

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.630 
disengage the trap pins you just stay
nice<00:05:16.320> and<00:05:16.380> light<00:05:16.800> on<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:16.980> tension<00:05:17.430> all<00:05:17.520> I'm

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
nice and light on the tension all I'm

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.170 
nice and light on the tension all I'm
doing<00:05:17.850> is<00:05:17.940> gently<00:05:18.860> teasing<00:05:19.860> down<00:05:20.100> on<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:20.940> pins

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
doing is gently teasing down on the pins

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.350 
doing is gently teasing down on the pins
where<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.480> trap<00:05:21.720> pins<00:05:21.990> are<00:05:22.770> engaged<00:05:23.190> okay<00:05:24.120> and

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
where the trap pins are engaged okay and

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.940 
where the trap pins are engaged okay and
eventually<00:05:24.780> you<00:05:24.870> get<00:05:24.990> that<00:05:25.110> full<00:05:25.380> rotation

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
eventually you get that full rotation

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.500 
eventually you get that full rotation
plug<00:05:26.370> okay

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
plug okay

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.540 
plug okay
now<00:05:27.930> the<00:05:27.990> key<00:05:28.200> won't<00:05:28.350> come<00:05:28.590> out<00:05:28.800> because<00:05:29.370> it's

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
now the key won't come out because it's

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.600 
now the key won't come out because it's
caught<00:05:29.730> behind<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.150> pins<00:05:31.070> so<00:05:32.070> get<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.430> key

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
caught behind the pins so get the key

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
caught behind the pins so get the key
out<00:05:32.640> I<00:05:33.090> just<00:05:34.050> insert<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.820> thin<00:05:35.820> tension<00:05:36.360> to<00:05:36.480> all

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
out I just insert a thin tension to all

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.210 
out I just insert a thin tension to all
the<00:05:36.780> way<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.140> back<00:05:37.320> of<00:05:37.470> a<00:05:37.530> lot<00:05:37.680> feed<00:05:37.950> press

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
the way to the back of a lot feed press

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.780 
the way to the back of a lot feed press
all<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.520> pins<00:05:39.770> so<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:40.830> can<00:05:41.160> start<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.490> pull<00:05:41.640> out

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
all the pins so I can start to pull out

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.290 
all the pins so I can start to pull out
that<00:05:41.820> key<00:05:42.240> I<00:05:43.340> can<00:05:44.340> just<00:05:44.550> depressing<00:05:44.940> all<00:05:45.180> the

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
that key I can just depressing all the

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.820 
that key I can just depressing all the
pins<00:05:45.590> and<00:05:46.590> then<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:46.800> key<00:05:46.950> comes<00:05:47.280> out<00:05:47.520> okay<00:05:48.830> so

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
pins and then the key comes out okay so

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.620 
pins and then the key comes out okay so
that's<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.160> first<00:05:50.370> way<00:05:50.610> that<00:05:51.270> we<00:05:51.360> can<00:05:51.510> pick

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
that's the first way that we can pick

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.890 
that's the first way that we can pick
these<00:05:51.840> locks<00:05:52.080> if<00:05:52.950> the<00:05:53.520> magnetic<00:05:53.850> pin<00:05:54.240> is<00:05:54.630> the

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
these locks if the magnetic pin is the

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.550 
these locks if the magnetic pin is the
fifth<00:05:55.170> pin<00:05:55.440> okay<00:05:56.130> nice<00:05:56.340> and<00:05:56.370> easy<00:05:56.580> to<00:05:56.850> identify

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
fifth pin okay nice and easy to identify

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.810 
fifth pin okay nice and easy to identify
where<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.680> pin<00:05:58.860> is<00:05:59.010> because<00:05:59.250> when<00:05:59.370> you<00:05:59.460> go<00:05:59.610> in

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
where the pin is because when you go in

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.190 
where the pin is because when you go in
you<00:06:00.210> can<00:06:00.330> actually<00:06:00.450> feel<00:06:00.780> the<00:06:00.930> spring

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
you can actually feel the spring

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.290 
you can actually feel the spring
resistance<00:06:01.740> of<00:06:01.980> the<00:06:02.100> standard<00:06:02.520> pins<00:06:02.730> if

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
resistance of the standard pins if

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.450 
resistance of the standard pins if
there's<00:06:03.510> no<00:06:03.630> pin<00:06:03.900> there<00:06:04.170> ie<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.800> magnetic<00:06:05.250> pin

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
there's no pin there ie the magnetic pin

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.450 
there's no pin there ie the magnetic pin
that's<00:06:06.360> where<00:06:06.570> you<00:06:06.660> know<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.980> position<00:06:08.340> of

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
that's where you know the position of
