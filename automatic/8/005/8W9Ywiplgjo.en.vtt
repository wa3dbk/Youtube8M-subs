00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello friends, I'm Jorge de Ferrol, yo 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.099
 I present these two products of 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.170
 Swedish manufacturer tasting manufacturer 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.210
 specialized in material and this is the 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.539
 minibus forte the liquid we have it in 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.330
 10 milliliters and a greater capacity of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.930
 100 milliliters this is a water treatment plant 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.030
 and stabilized from lauro 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.350
 the contaminated water of the two are more 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.350
 frequent diseases in the 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.150
 Travellers 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.480
 we can find diseases 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.090
 infectious in the tube and they give problems 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.840
 like diarrhea anger fever 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.270
 typhoid gardens or amoebas is a 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.440
 problems in the liver 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.210
 these are transmitted by the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.220
 microorganisms with these products 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.220
 let's be sure that we will 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.710
 eliminate those bacteria including from 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.350
 those protozoa in some cases since 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.720
 They carry chlorine ions directions 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.970
 silver 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.340
 the chlorine will totally eliminate the 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.840
 virus and with the silver ions what 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.610
 we would do is stabilize the water 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.780
 approximately for about six months 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.080
 for example , we are going to use it 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 both to disinfect water since 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.480
 many of we go to another country and it serves 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.490
 let's see 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.070
 let's drink from the river including the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.840
 same in the same water pipe that 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.850
 We believe that it is made drinkable as 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.270
 pathogens that we're used to 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.280
 they can also disinfect the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.290
 tap or river water inclusive 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.630
 also what our advisors with 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.400
 pots pans today where we are going to give 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.030
 they feed me 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.120
 for example to disinfect the water 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.910
 water with about three drops 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.460
 We would add to a liter of water to a 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.380
 room temperature after this 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.150
 exciting process that we have after 20 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.290
 minutes we'll test the water if you have a 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.930
 feeling a bit of chlorine is that 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.290
 has really eliminated all those silvers 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.100
 if we see that you do not have that feeling of 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.140
 chlorine 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.550
 we would have to repeat the process of the already 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.500
 that there is a lot of virus concentration 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.780
 good as you said it would be the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.780
 smallest model from my liters 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.150
 It is very small and quickly use 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.390
 customers would be for larger quantities 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.430
 of 100 milliliters with this purify and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.310
 We have approximately 100 liters of water 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.990
 and with this milliliter of water as has 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.110
 commented eliminate already completely with 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.270
 virus and and we have silver stabilizer 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.040
 to keep that water for six 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.040
 months thank you equally
