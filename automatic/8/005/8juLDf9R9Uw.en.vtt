over the different types of volumes I'm

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.329 
over the different types of volumes I'm
going<00:00:10.580> to<00:00:10.730> show<00:00:10.910> you<00:00:10.970> how<00:00:11.300> to<00:00:11.690> use<00:00:11.959> them<00:00:12.530> the

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:13.339 
going to show you how to use them the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.390 
going to show you how to use them the
different<00:00:13.730> types<00:00:13.910> of<00:00:14.089> volumes<00:00:14.480> are<00:00:14.719> and<00:00:15.400> i'm

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
different types of volumes are and i'm

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.580 
different types of volumes are and i'm
going<00:00:16.730> to<00:00:16.789> i'm<00:00:17.090> going<00:00:17.120> to<00:00:17.480> show<00:00:17.690> an<00:00:17.750> example<00:00:18.110> of

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
going to i'm going to show an example of

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.780 
going to i'm going to show an example of
how<00:00:18.950> they<00:00:19.190> are<00:00:19.250> used<00:00:19.750> so<00:00:20.750> i'm<00:00:21.080> just<00:00:21.110> going<00:00:21.470> to

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
how they are used so i'm just going to

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.610 
how they are used so i'm just going to
close<00:00:22.790> this<00:00:22.850> quickly<00:00:23.390> just<00:00:24.260> going<00:00:24.440> to<00:00:24.500> use<00:00:24.590> a

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
close this quickly just going to use a

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.000 
close this quickly just going to use a
blank<00:00:24.920> map<00:00:25.240> and<00:00:26.240> i'm<00:00:26.420> going<00:00:26.660> to<00:00:26.840> i'm<00:00:27.590> going<00:00:27.650> to

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
blank map and i'm going to i'm going to

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.860 
blank map and i'm going to i'm going to
start<00:00:28.520> off<00:00:28.670> with<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.120> very<00:00:30.020> first<00:00:30.430> volumes<00:00:31.870> so

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
start off with the very first volumes so

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.099 
start off with the very first volumes so
you<00:00:33.500> got<00:00:33.649> your<00:00:33.680> volumes<00:00:34.160> here<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.149> first<00:00:35.960> of

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
you got your volumes here so first of

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.910 
you got your volumes here so first of
all<00:00:36.199> I'm<00:00:36.410> gonna<00:00:36.710> go<00:00:36.980> with<00:00:37.489> water<00:00:38.030> volume<00:00:38.920> so

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
all I'm gonna go with water volume so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.910 
all I'm gonna go with water volume so
let's<00:00:40.129> just<00:00:41.140> move<00:00:42.140> this<00:00:42.350> out<00:00:42.589> here<00:00:44.260> yes<00:00:45.670> no

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.660 

they're<00:00:49.550> too<00:00:49.670> big<00:00:49.850> block<00:00:50.559> CSG<00:00:51.559> ad

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
they're too big block CSG ad

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.829 
they're too big block CSG ad
make<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:56.329> move<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> bit<00:00:59.839> CSG

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
make a little one and move up a bit CSG

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.609 
make a little one and move up a bit CSG
subtract<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.729> I<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.750> hole<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.199> here

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
subtract so I now have a hole in here

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.670 
subtract so I now have a hole in here
and<00:01:05.420> I<00:01:06.420> put<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> down

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.150 

right<00:01:10.370> click<00:01:10.640> volume<00:01:11.000> water<00:01:11.780> volume<00:01:12.380> so

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
right click volume water volume so

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.100 
right click volume water volume so
basically<00:01:13.520> what<00:01:13.790> water<00:01:14.030> volume<00:01:14.480> does<00:01:14.720> it

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
basically what water volume does it

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.730 
basically what water volume does it
makes<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.800> volume<00:01:16.220> at<00:01:16.940> which<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:18.050> can<00:01:18.230> swim<00:01:18.560> in

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
makes a volume at which you can swim in

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.950 
makes a volume at which you can swim in
it's<00:01:19.280> like<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.610> area<00:01:20.000> where<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.300> can<00:01:20.600> flow

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
it's like the area where you can flow

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.100 
it's like the area where you can flow
and<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:21.800> have<00:01:22.010> like<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.280> little<00:01:22.700> water<00:01:23.479> splash

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
and you have like a little water splash

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.670 
and you have like a little water splash
sound<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:25.160> as<00:01:25.550> you<00:01:25.700> see<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.210> am<00:01:27.050> swimming

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
sound and as you see I am swimming

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.160 
sound and as you see I am swimming
around<00:01:28.040> in<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:29.800> so<00:01:30.800> for<00:01:31.670> now<00:01:31.700> I'm<00:01:32.270> just<00:01:32.330> going

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
around in it so for now I'm just going

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.730 
around in it so for now I'm just going
to<00:01:34.030> remove<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.090> volume<00:01:35.630> there's<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.410> slime

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
to remove the volume there's the slime

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.100 
to remove the volume there's the slime
volume<00:01:37.250> which<00:01:37.940> basic<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.510> bit<00:01:38.840> like<00:01:38.990> the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
volume which basic is a bit like the

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.859 
volume which basic is a bit like the
water<00:01:39.320> volume<00:01:39.830> but<00:01:40.130> when<00:01:40.790> when<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:41.420> stay<00:01:41.720> in

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
water volume but when when you stay in

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.600 
water volume but when when you stay in
there<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.320> damages<00:01:43.160> you<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:45.160> it<00:01:46.160> slows<00:01:46.430> you

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
there it damages you and it slows you

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.600 
there it damages you and it slows you
down<00:01:47.380> it's<00:01:48.380> not<00:01:48.530> going<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:48.770> damage<00:01:48.920> me<00:01:49.280> for<00:01:49.460> now

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
down it's not going to damage me for now

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.060 
down it's not going to damage me for now
because<00:01:49.910> I<00:01:50.270> am<00:01:50.300> I'm<00:01:50.720> going<00:01:51.050> like<00:01:51.229> def<00:01:51.560> match<00:01:51.800> or

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
because I am I'm going like def match or

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.770 
because I am I'm going like def match or
anything<00:01:52.399> my<00:01:52.520> loan<00:01:54.369> it's<00:01:55.369> gonna<00:01:55.610> undo<00:01:56.509> add

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
anything my loan it's gonna undo add

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.060 
anything my loan it's gonna undo add
volume<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:58.460> then<00:01:59.030> there's<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.720> lava<00:02:00.410> volume

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
volume and then there's the lava volume

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.900 
volume and then there's the lava volume
as<00:02:01.250> well<00:02:01.280> which<00:02:02.090> also<00:02:02.479> damages<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.610> as<00:02:04.610> you'll

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
as well which also damages you as you'll

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.600 
as well which also damages you as you'll
see<00:02:05.390> here<00:02:05.600> explain

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.550 

and<00:02:10.610> you<00:02:11.180> go<00:02:11.330> really<00:02:11.600> slowly<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:14.230> it's<00:02:15.230> killed

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
and you go really slowly and it's killed

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.760 
and you go really slowly and it's killed
me<00:02:16.300> there<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.420> go<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:18.110> kills<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.620> lot

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
me there you go that kills you a lot

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.430 
me there you go that kills you a lot
faster<00:02:19.000> than<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.270> standard<00:02:20.870> slime<00:02:21.170> volume

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
faster than the standard slime volume

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.260 
faster than the standard slime volume
okay<00:02:24.440> well<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:24.830> we<00:02:24.950> got<00:02:25.160> kills<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:26.000> volume

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
okay well so we got kills that volume

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.690 
okay well so we got kills that volume
which<00:02:26.570> will<00:02:26.690> kill<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.140> as<00:02:27.500> soon<00:02:28.160> as<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.490> touch

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
which will kill you as soon as you touch

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.210 
which will kill you as soon as you touch
it<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.610> then<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.630> got<00:02:32.810> your<00:02:32.840> dead<00:02:33.220> that's

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
it and then you got your dead that's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.510 
it and then you got your dead that's
like<00:02:34.430> making<00:02:34.640> def<00:02:35.270> barriers<00:02:35.840> etc<00:02:39.370> I'm<00:02:40.370> only

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
like making def barriers etc I'm only

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.300 
like making def barriers etc I'm only
going<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.850> go<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.860> volumes<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:43.040> really

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
going to go of the volumes you really

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.910 
going to go of the volumes you really
need<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.490> now<00:02:44.300> also<00:02:44.600> crowd<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.200> volume<00:02:45.500> so

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
need to now also crowd to volume so

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.070 
need to now also crowd to volume so
let's<00:02:46.070> say<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.310> going<00:02:46.760> through<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.120> small<00:02:47.360> area

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
let's say you going through a small area

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.770 
let's say you going through a small area
it's<00:02:49.070> going<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.670> as<00:02:49.940> soon<00:02:50.000> as<00:02:50.240> you<00:02:50.330> go<00:02:50.510> where

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
it's going to as soon as you go where

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.660 
it's going to as soon as you go where
it's<00:02:50.990> going<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.340> automatically<00:02:52.340> make<00:02:52.640> you

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
it's going to automatically make you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:05.960 
it's going to automatically make you
crouch<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:55.930> there<00:02:56.930> we<00:02:57.020> go

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.120 

okay<00:03:06.570> since<00:03:06.960> make<00:03:07.230> sure<00:03:07.380> there's<00:03:07.530> no<00:03:07.710> actors

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
okay since make sure there's no actors

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.880 
okay since make sure there's no actors
here<00:03:08.310> now<00:03:09.650> okay<00:03:10.650> let's<00:03:10.980> bear<00:03:12.080> what<00:03:13.080> volumes<00:03:13.650> is

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
here now okay let's bear what volumes is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.470 
here now okay let's bear what volumes is
there<00:03:14.420> there's<00:03:15.420> an<00:03:16.200> a.1<00:03:16.560> post<00:03:16.860> proper

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
there there's an a.1 post proper

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.170 
there there's an a.1 post proper
post-process<00:03:18.480> volume<00:03:18.930> which<00:03:19.770> basically<00:03:20.280> and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
post-process volume which basically and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.900 
post-process volume which basically and
it<00:03:21.390> lets<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.750> do<00:03:22.050> like<00:03:22.890> blurring<00:03:23.220> effects<00:03:23.730> for

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
it lets you do like blurring effects for

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.470 
it lets you do like blurring effects for
example<00:03:24.110> so<00:03:25.110> let<00:03:25.380> me<00:03:25.680> just<00:03:26.030> move<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.450> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
example so let me just move this to the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.850 
example so let me just move this to the
side<00:03:27.570> quickly<00:03:29.510> move<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.780> down<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.620> don't

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
side quickly move this down you don't

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.380 
side quickly move this down you don't
need<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.040> at<00:03:32.340> all<00:03:32.490> and<00:03:33.740> target<00:03:34.740> this<00:03:35.390> post

process<00:03:36.840> volume<00:03:38.150> settings<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.740> then<00:03:40.740> if<00:03:41.190> you

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
process volume settings and then if you

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.940 
process volume settings and then if you
go<00:03:41.700> find<00:03:42.680> out<00:03:43.680> enable<00:03:44.430> DOF<00:03:45.090> here<00:03:45.900> which<00:03:46.800> is

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
go find out enable DOF here which is

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.050 
go find out enable DOF here which is
depth<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.459> field<00:03:49.160> max<00:03:50.160> mere<00:03:50.520> let's<00:03:50.790> set<00:03:51.030> that

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
depth of field max mere let's set that

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.949 
depth of field max mere let's set that
tight<00:03:51.709> 995<00:03:52.709> for<00:03:53.160> example<00:03:53.610> 95<00:03:56.000> press<00:03:57.000> play<00:03:57.690> and

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
tight 995 for example 95 press play and

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:07.070 
tight 995 for example 95 press play and
wait<00:04:00.959> sorry<00:04:01.470> i<00:04:01.740> missed<00:04:02.490> something<00:04:02.550> out<00:04:02.940> there

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.010 

and<00:04:08.080> there<00:04:08.740> we<00:04:08.830> have<00:04:08.860> it<00:04:09.010> we've<00:04:09.460> got<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:10.090> nice

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
and there we have it we've got a nice

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.040 
and there we have it we've got a nice
blur<00:04:11.440> effect<00:04:11.800> as<00:04:12.010> if<00:04:12.040> we<00:04:12.310> were<00:04:12.490> underwater<00:04:13.090> or

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
blur effect as if we were underwater or

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.220 
blur effect as if we were underwater or
you<00:04:14.320> changed<00:04:14.680> five<00:04:15.330> or<00:04:16.330> even<00:04:16.390> a<00:04:16.630> thousand

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
you changed five or even a thousand

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.400 
you changed five or even a thousand
eight<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:20.440> there<00:04:20.800> we<00:04:20.890> go<00:04:21.990> it's<00:04:22.990> just<00:04:23.200> nice<00:04:23.380> to

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
eight and there we go it's just nice to

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.830 
eight and there we go it's just nice to
go<00:04:23.650> on<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.950> war<00:04:24.130> effect

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.390 

just<00:04:29.470> going<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.710> delete<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.040> different

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
just going to delete the different

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.290 
just going to delete the different
volumes<00:04:30.790> there

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.890 

and<00:04:35.419> put<00:04:36.169> my<00:04:36.289> builder<00:04:36.680> brush<00:04:36.919> back<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.840> ok<00:04:38.840> so

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
and put my builder brush back in ok so

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.899 
and put my builder brush back in ok so
what<00:04:39.289> volumes<00:04:39.830> we<00:04:40.009> got<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.639> it's<00:04:40.789> going

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:40.909 
what volumes we got and it's going

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:44.529 
what volumes we got and it's going
together<00:04:41.030> no<00:04:41.750> one's<00:04:42.639> okay<00:04:43.639> so<00:04:43.699> we<00:04:44.120> got<00:04:44.300> a

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
together no one's okay so we got a

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.070 
together no one's okay so we got a
ladder<00:04:45.020> volumes<00:04:45.590> so<00:04:46.069> let's<00:04:46.879> just<00:04:46.970> change<00:04:47.900> the

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
ladder volumes so let's just change the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.990 
ladder volumes so let's just change the
size<00:04:48.440> of<00:04:48.830> my<00:04:49.490> PSP<00:04:49.970> brushed<00:04:50.419> quickly<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:52.000> put

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
size of my PSP brushed quickly and put

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.830 
size of my PSP brushed quickly and put
it<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.389> side<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:54.259> my<00:04:54.560> CS<00:04:55.270> 360<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:56.539> then

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
it to the side of my CS 360 and then

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.010 
it to the side of my CS 360 and then
press<00:04:57.139> add<00:04:58.539> find<00:04:59.539> it<00:05:00.849> ladder<00:05:01.849> volume<00:05:02.419> okay

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
press add find it ladder volume okay

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.240 
press add find it ladder volume okay
press<00:05:03.560> play<00:05:05.169> basically<00:05:06.169> if<00:05:06.349> you<00:05:06.500> have<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.949> like

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
press play basically if you have a like

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.270 
press play basically if you have a like
and<00:05:07.550> find<00:05:08.120> yourself<00:05:08.690> a<00:05:08.960> ladder<00:05:09.469> static<00:05:10.069> mesh

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
and find yourself a ladder static mesh

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.420 
and find yourself a ladder static mesh
or<00:05:10.460> something<00:05:10.789> like<00:05:10.909> that<00:05:10.969> you<00:05:11.360> can<00:05:12.259> have<00:05:13.069> this

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
or something like that you can have this

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.589 
or something like that you can have this
the<00:05:13.789> ladder<00:05:14.379> then<00:05:15.580> you<00:05:16.580> should<00:05:16.879> be<00:05:17.060> able<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.449> go

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
the ladder then you should be able to go

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.610 
the ladder then you should be able to go
straight<00:05:17.659> up<00:05:18.259> it<00:05:19.090> not<00:05:20.090> too<00:05:20.389> sure<00:05:20.780> why<00:05:21.139> it's<00:05:21.379> not

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
straight up it not too sure why it's not

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.990 
straight up it not too sure why it's not
going<00:05:21.889> up<00:05:22.159> in<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.400> moment

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.700 

smooth<00:05:25.780> that<00:05:26.110> there

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.839 

so<00:05:30.280> no<00:05:30.580> that's<00:05:31.000> a<00:05:31.240> lot<00:05:31.420> of<00:05:31.450> volume<00:05:32.230> there

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:41.550 

press<00:05:36.509> play

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.540 

and<00:05:41.680> you<00:05:42.370> going<00:05:42.669> up<00:05:42.820> it

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
and you going up it

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.600 
and you going up it
there<00:05:45.030> we<00:05:45.150> go<00:05:45.980> so<00:05:46.980> I'm<00:05:47.160> just<00:05:47.280> going<00:05:47.430> to<00:05:47.490> delete

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
there we go so I'm just going to delete

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.040 
there we go so I'm just going to delete
that<00:05:47.790> volume<00:05:48.380> you<00:05:49.380> don't<00:05:49.560> really<00:05:49.680> need<00:05:49.950> it<00:05:50.160> I

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
that volume you don't really need it I

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.120 
that volume you don't really need it I
see<00:05:52.050> what<00:05:52.230> we<00:05:52.470> got<00:05:53.420> we<00:05:54.420> got<00:05:54.450> the<00:05:55.230> gravity

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
see what we got we got the gravity

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.680 
see what we got we got the gravity
volume<00:05:58.160> which<00:05:59.160> basically<00:05:59.790> affects<00:06:00.060> plates

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
volume which basically affects plates

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.680 
volume which basically affects plates
gravity<00:06:01.290> and<00:06:01.890> how<00:06:02.190> high<00:06:02.430> they<00:06:02.700> will<00:06:02.820> jump<00:06:03.060> etc

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
gravity and how high they will jump etc

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.420 
gravity and how high they will jump etc
right<00:06:04.620> now<00:06:04.770> you<00:06:05.130> know<00:06:05.250> just<00:06:06.180> add<00:06:07.430> gravity

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
right now you know just add gravity

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:16.879 
right now you know just add gravity
volume<00:06:08.910> and<00:06:09.830> it's<00:06:10.830> find<00:06:11.370> it<00:06:11.760> if<00:06:11.970> you<00:06:12.150> can<00:06:13.310> no

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.709 

don't<00:06:17.490> know<00:06:17.580> why<00:06:17.699> it<00:06:17.759> just<00:06:17.879> came<00:06:18.330> out<00:06:18.509> there

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:18.719 
don't know why it just came out there

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.950 
don't know why it just came out there
scratchy<00:06:19.199> volume<00:06:19.710> gravity<00:06:20.280> so<00:06:20.939> let's<00:06:21.719> say<00:06:21.900> you

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
scratchy volume gravity so let's say you

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:31.100 
scratchy volume gravity so let's say you
want<00:06:22.409> zero<00:06:23.249> gravity

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.240 

so<00:06:31.740> let's<00:06:32.100> say<00:06:32.280> you're<00:06:32.490> in<00:06:32.580> space<00:06:32.970> or<00:06:34.130> you<00:06:35.130> know

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
so let's say you're in space or you know

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.940 
so let's say you're in space or you know
i'm<00:06:35.430> just<00:06:35.640> going<00:06:35.820> to<00:06:35.850> expand<00:06:36.210> the<00:06:36.950> gravity

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
i'm just going to expand the gravity

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:44.399 
i'm just going to expand the gravity
setting<00:06:38.400> sir

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:44.409 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:54.710 

just<00:06:45.069> so<00:06:45.279> I<00:06:45.309> can<00:06:45.399> actually<00:06:45.699> fly<00:06:45.969> around<00:06:46.149> etc

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.200 

yeah<00:06:55.290> I've<00:06:55.470> bounced<00:06:56.070> away<00:06:56.190> and<00:06:56.670> there's<00:06:56.970> zero

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
yeah I've bounced away and there's zero

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.570 
yeah I've bounced away and there's zero
gravity<00:06:57.540> but<00:06:58.500> when<00:06:58.680> I<00:06:58.710> come<00:06:59.040> out<00:06:59.070> of<00:06:59.220> there

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
gravity but when I come out of there

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.150 
gravity but when I come out of there
I'll<00:07:00.090> just<00:07:00.390> go<00:07:00.540> back<00:07:00.780> down<00:07:00.990> to<00:07:01.230> normal<00:07:01.260> so

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
I'll just go back down to normal so

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.860 
I'll just go back down to normal so
let's<00:07:02.340> say<00:07:02.520> you're<00:07:02.670> doing<00:07:02.880> some<00:07:03.060> cool<00:07:03.330> space

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
let's say you're doing some cool space

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.260 
let's say you're doing some cool space
cutscene<00:07:04.530> or<00:07:04.710> something<00:07:05.040> like<00:07:05.130> that<00:07:05.190> I<00:07:05.550> don't

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
cutscene or something like that I don't

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.980 
cutscene or something like that I don't
know<00:07:06.360> you<00:07:06.450> can<00:07:06.720> use<00:07:06.900> this<00:07:09.170> volume

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:12.990 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.610 

say<00:07:13.620> what<00:07:13.890> other<00:07:14.040> volumes<00:07:14.430> are<00:07:14.730> there<00:07:16.070> um

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.100 

yeah<00:07:20.610> that's<00:07:20.820> basically<00:07:20.970> all<00:07:21.240> the<00:07:21.479> basic

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110 
yeah that's basically all the basic

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.379 
yeah that's basically all the basic
volumes<00:07:22.650> that<00:07:22.830> I<00:07:22.889> wanted<00:07:23.190> to<00:07:23.250> show<00:07:23.490> you<00:07:23.520> so

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:24.389 
volumes that I wanted to show you so

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:26.180 
volumes that I wanted to show you so
