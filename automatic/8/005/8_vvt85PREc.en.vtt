00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
were to have a fully built engine

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.980 
were to have a fully built engine
everything's<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:52.160> know<00:01:52.190> set<00:01:52.550> up<00:01:52.670> on<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:52.990> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.160 
then it might be different as my setup
is<00:01:55.640> now<00:01:55.820> but<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.180> was<00:01:56.330> on<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.540> stock<00:01:56.780> setup

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
is now but this was on the stock setup

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.130 
is now but this was on the stock setup
so<00:01:57.350> quite<00:01:58.040> slow<00:01:58.310> indeed<00:01:58.610> now<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.240> have<00:01:59.720> edited

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
so quite slow indeed now I have edited

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.420 
so quite slow indeed now I have edited
out<00:02:00.290> all<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.650> cutscenes<00:02:01.040> there<00:02:01.250> would<00:02:01.370> have

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
out all the cutscenes there would have

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.500 
out all the cutscenes there would have
been<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.610> cutscene<00:02:01.850> before<00:02:02.270> this<00:02:02.360> mission

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
been a cutscene before this mission

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.960 
been a cutscene before this mission
started<00:02:02.990> but<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.230> generally<00:02:03.590> not<00:02:03.950> been<00:02:04.670> editing

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
started but I generally not been editing

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.469 
started but I generally not been editing
out<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.240> cutscenes<00:02:05.720> from<00:02:06.200> these<00:02:06.380> high<00:02:06.620> seas

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
out the cutscenes from these high seas

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.780 
out the cutscenes from these high seas
Warren<00:02:08.479> because<00:02:09.200> Rockstar<00:02:09.950> isn't<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.310> fan<00:02:10.550> of

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
Warren because Rockstar isn't a fan of

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.100 
Warren because Rockstar isn't a fan of
people<00:02:11.090> putting<00:02:11.270> their<00:02:11.420> cutscenes<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:11.960> on

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
people putting their cutscenes up on

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.100 
people putting their cutscenes up on
YouTube<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.740> -<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.940> feel<00:02:14.270> like<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.600> cutscenes

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
YouTube and - I feel like the cutscenes

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.230 
YouTube and - I feel like the cutscenes
I<00:02:15.380> feel<00:02:15.800> like<00:02:15.950> that's<00:02:16.100> something<00:02:16.490> that<00:02:16.700> people

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
I feel like that's something that people

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.000 
I feel like that's something that people
should<00:02:17.540> really<00:02:17.660> experience<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.860> game

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
should really experience in the game

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.560 
should really experience in the game
like<00:02:19.550> if<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.730> if<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.090> want<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.330> see<00:02:20.420> how<00:02:20.510> the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
like if you if you want to see how the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.150 
like if you if you want to see how the
heist<00:02:20.810> actually<00:02:21.230> plays<00:02:21.470> out<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
heist actually plays out and the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.470 
heist actually plays out and the
dynamics<00:02:22.610> about<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.850> heist<00:02:22.970> plays<00:02:23.270> out

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
dynamics about the heist plays out

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.600 
dynamics about the heist plays out
that's<00:02:24.350> one<00:02:24.590> thing<00:02:24.830> but<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.040> feel<00:02:25.310> like<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
that's one thing but I feel like the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.570 
that's one thing but I feel like the
heists<00:02:25.940> themselves<00:02:26.690> should<00:02:27.320> be<00:02:27.500> kind<00:02:27.800> of<00:02:27.860> nice

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
heists themselves should be kind of nice

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.490 
heists themselves should be kind of nice
themselves<00:02:29.180> but<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.450> cutscenes<00:02:29.930> themselves

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
themselves but the cutscenes themselves

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.730 
themselves but the cutscenes themselves
should<00:02:30.950> kind<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.430> be<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> surprise<00:02:32.780> it's

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
should kind of be be a surprise it's

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.260 
should kind of be be a surprise it's

kind of sequence and from my vantage
point<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.970> mean<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.150> was<00:03:26.269> able<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.450> get<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.600> few

right and then you also had people
coming<00:03:36.790> into<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.120> side<00:03:37.329> so<00:03:37.540> as<00:03:37.629> you<00:03:37.720> can<00:03:37.810> see

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
coming into the side so as you can see

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.289 
coming into the side so as you can see
on<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.200> map<00:03:38.459> left<00:03:39.459> panel<00:03:41.939> there's<00:03:42.939> all<00:03:43.180> these

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
on the map left panel there's all these

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.140 
on the map left panel there's all these
random<00:03:44.049> corners<00:03:44.680> like<00:03:45.489> random<00:03:45.849> building

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
random corners like random building

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.699 
random corners like random building
corners<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:46.540> you're<00:03:46.659> always<00:03:46.810> having<00:03:47.079> you

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
corners that you're always having you

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.740 
corners that you're always having you
can't<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.790> only<00:03:49.030> way<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.239> can<00:03:49.359> really<00:03:49.569> get

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
can't the only way you can really get

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.240 
can't the only way you can really get
around<00:03:49.989> those<00:03:50.170> it's<00:03:50.349> like<00:03:50.530> bouncing<00:03:50.980> grenade

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
around those it's like bouncing grenade

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.339 
around those it's like bouncing grenade
off<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.609> wall<00:03:51.819> and<00:03:52.359> I<00:03:52.689> do<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:52.989> couple<00:03:53.049> of

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
off the wall and I do that a couple of

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.770 
off the wall and I do that a couple of
times<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.829> it<00:03:53.980> works<00:03:54.250> for<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.609> most<00:03:54.790> part<00:03:55.120> but

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
times and it works for the most part but

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.800 
times and it works for the most part but
I<00:03:56.049> would<00:03:56.709> work<00:03:56.890> rather<00:03:57.129> I<00:03:57.549> would<00:03:58.090> rather<00:03:58.420> sushi

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
I would work rather I would rather sushi

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.660 
I would work rather I would rather sushi
as<00:03:59.019> if<00:03:59.140> sitting<00:03:59.470> classic<00:03:59.859> remains<00:04:00.129> I<00:04:00.310> look<00:04:00.549> you

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
as if sitting classic remains I look you

as if sitting classic remains I look you
guys<00:04:00.790> I<00:04:00.849> don't<00:04:01.090> know<00:04:01.209> how<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.390> guys<00:04:01.599> feel

guys I don't know how you guys feel
about<00:04:01.930> that<00:04:02.230> but<00:04:02.409> can't<00:04:03.040> afford<00:04:03.099> you're

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
about that but can't afford you're

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.440 
about that but can't afford you're
sitting<00:04:03.700> there<00:04:03.760> tossing<00:04:04.180> roommates<00:04:04.569> now<00:04:05.260> I

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
sitting there tossing roommates now I

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.720 
sitting there tossing roommates now I
guess<00:04:07.450> influence<00:04:08.379> mission<00:04:08.709> it's<00:04:08.889> not<00:04:09.220> quite

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
guess influence mission it's not quite

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.930 
guess influence mission it's not quite
as<00:04:10.109> in-depth<00:04:11.109> obviously<00:04:11.889> it<00:04:12.010> has<00:04:12.129> a<00:04:12.519> full<00:04:12.790> on

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
as in-depth obviously it has a full on

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.460 
as in-depth obviously it has a full on
ice<00:04:13.209> would<00:04:13.450> be<00:04:13.569> right<00:04:13.840> these<00:04:14.079> are<00:04:14.200> kind<00:04:14.379> of

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
ice would be right these are kind of

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.199 
ice would be right these are kind of
like<00:04:14.709> what<00:04:15.159> I<00:04:15.459> feel<00:04:15.639> like<00:04:15.700> there<00:04:15.940> is<00:04:16.060> they're

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
like what I feel like there is they're

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.659 
like what I feel like there is they're
almost<00:04:16.389> like<00:04:16.600> almost<00:04:17.199> like<00:04:17.350> little<00:04:17.709> they<00:04:18.549> say

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
almost like almost like little they say

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:19.830 
almost like almost like little they say
they're<00:04:18.820> called<00:04:19.030> setups<00:04:19.359> again<00:04:19.570> but<00:04:19.720> they're

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
they're called setups again but they're

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.560 
they're called setups again but they're
basically<00:04:20.500> training<00:04:21.160> missions<00:04:21.609> almost<00:04:21.910> for

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
basically training missions almost for

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.659 
basically training missions almost for
the<00:04:22.900> actual<00:04:23.470> setup<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.949> heist<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.340> mean<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.520> feel

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
the actual setup the heist I mean I feel

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.490 
the actual setup the heist I mean I feel
like<00:04:24.729> you're<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.030> new<00:04:25.240> player<00:04:25.539> then<00:04:26.199> it<00:04:26.289> might

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
like you're a new player then it might

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.640 
like you're a new player then it might
be<00:04:26.530> better<00:04:26.860> for<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:27.699> to<00:04:27.729> play<00:04:28.260> some<00:04:29.260> setup

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
be better for you to play some setup

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.070 
be better for you to play some setup
missions<00:04:29.979> before<00:04:30.190> you<00:04:30.460> do<00:04:30.580> some<00:04:30.789> heists<00:04:31.270> just

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
missions before you do some heists just

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.180 
missions before you do some heists just
because<00:04:32.289> of<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.440> fact<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.800> heists<00:04:33.130> are

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
because of the fact that the heists are

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.040 
because of the fact that the heists are
gonna<00:04:33.280> be<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.460> little<00:04:33.639> bit<00:04:33.849> more<00:04:34.090> like<00:04:35.020> a

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
gonna be a little bit more like a

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.330 
gonna be a little bit more like a
full-on<00:04:35.349> heists<00:04:35.860> are<00:04:35.919> gonna<00:04:36.039> be<00:04:36.160> more

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
full-on heists are gonna be more

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.219 
full-on heists are gonna be more
challenging<00:04:36.910> it's<00:04:37.300> gonna<00:04:37.419> be<00:04:37.570> more<00:04:37.720> going<00:04:37.930> on

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
challenging it's gonna be more going on

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.670 
challenging it's gonna be more going on
before

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
before

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.219 
before
get<00:04:41.250> out<00:04:41.370> of<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.610> as<00:04:41.759> a<00:04:41.790> player<00:04:42.000> but<00:04:42.870> some<00:04:43.139> but

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
I feel like these these set of missions

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.080 
I feel like these these set of missions
really<00:04:47.100> do<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.370> good<00:04:47.520> job<00:04:47.580> of<00:04:47.759> kind<00:04:48.000> of

really do a good job of kind of

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.330 
really do a good job of kind of
introducing<00:04:48.570> players<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.710> concept<00:04:50.250> of

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
introducing players to the concept of

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.400 
introducing players to the concept of
Isis<00:04:50.789> and<00:04:50.970> then<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.720> more<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:52.020> these<00:04:52.139> setups
