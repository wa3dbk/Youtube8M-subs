fingers to zoom back out like I said

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.929 
fingers to zoom back out like I said
this<00:01:07.229> works<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.770> anywhere<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.610> your<00:01:08.640> iOS

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
how to make a more advanced passcode

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.130 
how to make a more advanced passcode
lock<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.180> case<00:01:27.390> instead<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> having<00:01:27.990> this

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
lock in this case instead of having this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.499 
lock in this case instead of having this

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
simple four key pass code you can go

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.170 
simple four key pass code you can go
ahead<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.720> turn<00:01:31.110> off<00:01:31.470> simple<00:01:32.100> passcode<00:01:32.610> stuff

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
ahead and turn off simple passcode stuff

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.510 
ahead and turn off simple passcode stuff
in<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.360> old<00:01:33.540> passcode<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.500> type<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.369> new

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.030 
passcode that could be very well more
difficult<00:01:38.659> 1234<00:01:39.659> that'll<00:01:40.049> go<00:01:40.170> ahead<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.650> just

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
difficult 1234 that'll go ahead and just

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.300 
difficult 1234 that'll go ahead and just
set<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.930> older<00:01:43.470> passcode<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.220> has

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
set it as the older passcode so it has

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.850 
set it as the older passcode so it has
to<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.610> over<00:01:44.909> four<00:01:45.270> characters<00:01:45.840> I'll<00:01:46.500> show<00:01:46.799> you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
to be over four characters I'll show you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.219 
to be over four characters I'll show you
that<00:01:46.950> here<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.990> shutting<00:01:48.990> off<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that here in a bit shutting off the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.710 
that here in a bit shutting off the
device<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.369> guys<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:51.479> four

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
device as you guys can see just four

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.440 
device as you guys can see just four
characters<00:01:52.140> will<00:01:52.680> put<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.950> into<00:01:53.250> regular<00:01:53.520> mode

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
characters will put it into regular mode

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.020 
characters will put it into regular mode
there<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.960> it'll<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.350> two<00:01:55.530> three<00:01:55.740> four<00:01:56.070> but

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
there so it'll be one two three four but

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.069 
there so it'll be one two three four but
if<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.210> go<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.290> decide<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.719> put<00:02:00.960> on

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
a longer passcode like for example Billy

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.679 
a longer passcode like for example Billy
which<00:02:05.310> I'll<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.969> minute<00:02:06.180> which<00:02:06.479> is
