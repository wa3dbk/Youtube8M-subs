 in any weather 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.170
 when a human stands on the side of the road 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.159
 is the yellow marked and if mine 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.549
 danger area is running and it sounds 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.640
 gong and so everyone else is doing well
