he<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.440> dispossessed<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.460> easy<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.629> can't

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
he is dispossessed so easy but you can't

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.810 
he is dispossessed so easy but you can't
catch<00:00:46.050> him<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.469> actually<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:46.980> he<00:00:47.489> is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
catch him to actually do it he is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790 
catch him to actually do it he is
because<00:00:48.120> he<00:00:48.239> takes<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.629> such<00:00:48.899> huge<00:00:49.289> touches

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
because he takes in such huge touches

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010 
because he takes in such huge touches
that<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> fast<00:00:50.730> defender<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.660> would<00:00:51.840> normally

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that a fast defender they would normally

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.750 
that a fast defender they would normally
be<00:00:52.350> able<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.770> swoop<00:00:53.100> in<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.399> take<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
be able to like swoop in and take the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.880 
be able to like swoop in and take the
ball<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.539> guy's<00:00:54.750> quicker<00:00:55.079> than<00:00:55.260> them<00:00:55.469> he

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
ball but this guy's quicker than them he

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.139 
ball but this guy's quicker than them he
reacts<00:00:56.309> quicker<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.670> gets<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:56.969> ball

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
reacts quicker and gets to the ball

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.970 
reacts quicker and gets to the ball
quicker<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.050> defender<00:00:58.469> can't<00:00:58.680> do<00:00:58.829> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
quicker so the defender can't do that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950 
quicker so the defender can't do that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
buys one negative but it does have he

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.529
