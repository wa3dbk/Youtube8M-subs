and I was completely turned off in the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.730 
and I was completely turned off in the
middle<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> desert<00:01:18.180> well<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.290> said<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
middle of a desert well like I said it

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.810 
middle of a desert well like I said it
does<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.100> sometimes

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
does that sometimes

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.730 
does that sometimes
and<00:01:20.970> what<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> found<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.580> basically<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
and what I found out is basically do you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.230 
and what I found out is basically do you
you<00:01:25.740> leave<00:01:25.920> your<00:01:26.100> car<00:01:26.340> running<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.060> know

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you leave your car running and you know

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.550 
you leave your car running and you know
sometimes<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.810> leave<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.140> run<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
sometimes you leave in this run in the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.160 
sometimes you leave in this run in the
store<00:01:28.799> come<00:01:29.310> back<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.060> forth<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.689> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
store come back and so forth and and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.530 
store come back and so forth and and
then<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.250> take<00:01:32.520> off<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.820> drive<00:01:33.000> again<00:01:33.180> and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
then you take off and drive again and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.749 
then you take off and drive again and
then<00:01:33.630> sometimes<00:01:34.049> it'll<00:01:34.290> turn<00:01:34.439> off<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.009> doesn't

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
then sometimes it'll turn off it doesn't

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.360 
then sometimes it'll turn off it doesn't
that<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> me<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.329> three<00:01:36.689> four<00:01:36.930> times

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
that to me like three four times

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.490 
that to me like three four times
but<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> notice<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.690> does<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
but I notice it really does it when it

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.070 
but I notice it really does it when it
gets<00:01:40.650> hot<00:01:40.800> during<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> summer<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.120> have<00:01:42.690> my<00:01:42.840> car

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
gets hot during the summer I have my car

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.480 
gets hot during the summer I have my car
in<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.230> garage<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.800> it<00:01:43.890> doesn't<00:01:44.130> get<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.340> hot

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
in the garage so it doesn't get as hot

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
in the garage so it doesn't get as hot
as<00:01:44.640> much<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.210> used<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.480> but<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.530> goes

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
as much as it used to but when it goes

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.930 
as much as it used to but when it goes
when<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.010> go<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.190> work<00:01:47.370> or<00:01:47.610> something<00:01:47.730> like

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
when you go to work or something like

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.450 
when you go to work or something like
that<00:01:48.030> sometimes<00:01:48.630> they<00:01:48.780> heat<00:01:49.290> screws<00:01:50.250> with<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that sometimes they heat screws with the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.100 
that sometimes they heat screws with the
system<00:01:50.910> just<00:01:51.120> like<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> cold<00:01:51.630> screws<00:01:51.990> with

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
system just like the cold screws with

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.920 
system just like the cold screws with
the<00:01:52.230> system<00:01:52.620> it<00:01:53.160> takes<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.460> lot<00:01:53.640> longer<00:01:54.120> for<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the system it takes a lot longer for you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.450 
the system it takes a lot longer for you
to<00:01:55.110> blow<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.590> there<00:01:55.740> you'll<00:01:55.980> figure<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.310> out

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
to blow in there you'll figure it out

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.940 
to blow in there you'll figure it out
