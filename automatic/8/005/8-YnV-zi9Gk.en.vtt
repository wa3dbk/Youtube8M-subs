00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.210
 that's simon 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.400
 he is a passionate photographer he does 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.200
 great pictures and improves them 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.390
 gladly in post-processing 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.630
 However, he spends too much time with the 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.190
 editing of color correction and 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.619
 contrasts in every single picture 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.720
 luckily there is a solution in 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.600
 Three useful tools available 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.260
 poses ideal contrasts and one 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.029
 ensure consistent color selection 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.899
 simon uses the data colossus of both 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.750
 cube spyder checker or spider check24 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.540
 spyder cube is a reference tool 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.540
 this helps white point exposure and 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.600
 black value set correctly spyder 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.629
 checa and checker 24 allow 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.780
 color corrections for cameras of the spyder 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.059
 With 48 color fields , Checa offers the highest 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.149
 accuracy while checking it 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.579
 24 with its 24 color boxes the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.010
 lighter and more manageable variant for 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.229
 On the way is how it works in three 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.029
 simple steps make you one 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.209
 Reference recording of both checkers 

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:11.130
 or spider checker 24 for corrected 

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:13.469
 Farb analyzes this with the checker 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.079
 software automatically color fields the 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:17.999
 both checker or spider check24 im 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.039
 reference picture and create one 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:21.810
 Color correction setting the on yours 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:24.389
 pictures can be applied 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.579
 for a correct white point contrast 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.709
 balance and black point you can 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.979
 the spyder cube together with both 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:34.289
 checkers at checker 24 or alone 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.609
 Use this recording is called 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.099
 reference for postprocessing 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.409
 used if you have a reference for 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:42.689
 the white balance does not need any 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.729
 you can have two of the cube at hand 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.729
 the gray map on the back of at 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.439
 the checker 24 or the color charts of the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.239
 use at the checker 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.300
 then drive with your shooting 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:54.280
 on 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.070
 if you have your pictures in lightroom or 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.200
 Edit camera click with the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.590
 White point tool on the gray surface 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.970
 of both cube in reference picture this 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.730
 automatically corrects the 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.830
 Color temperature helps the light trap 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.410
 to set them the black value 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.840
 and the chrome ball attached above 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.060
 the pointed lights now copy the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.920
 Settings from the reference picture to all 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.870
 other pictures under the same 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.150
 lighting conditions were made 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.370
 within a few seconds 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.550
 all pictures the right contrast 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.560
 and are perfectly color-corrected use 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.640
 she additionally spyder checker or 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.420
 spider checker 24 for even more precise 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.030
 to obtain color correction 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.110
 thanks to the cube, you will receive the 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.240
 correct white point and newsworthy 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.310
 Now simon is happy for it 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.800
 the cube us at the checker have the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.800
 quality of his recordings improved and 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.870
 the time required for post-processing 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.120
 they experience a considerable reduction
