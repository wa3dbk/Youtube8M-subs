00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:09.650 

I<00:00:07.249> don't<00:00:08.249> see<00:00:08.459> any<00:00:08.610> reason<00:00:08.999> for<00:00:09.030> us<00:00:09.240> not<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.480> be

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
I don't see any reason for us not to be

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.169 
I don't see any reason for us not to be
the<00:00:09.839> fastest<00:00:10.320> here<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:10.919> plan<00:00:11.429> on<00:00:11.459> being<00:00:11.849> first

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
the fastest here I plan on being first

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.289 
the fastest here I plan on being first
and<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.599> plan<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.349> breaking<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:14.579> lap<00:00:14.849> record

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
and I plan on breaking that lap record

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.679 
and I plan on breaking that lap record
and<00:00:15.509> that's<00:00:16.349> really<00:00:16.710> why<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> became

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.460 

being<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:25.029> racer<00:00:26.029> you<00:00:26.269> have<00:00:26.990> a<00:00:27.019> contradiction

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
being a racer you have a contradiction

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.300 
being a racer you have a contradiction
with<00:00:28.369> yourself<00:00:28.939> as<00:00:29.509> a<00:00:29.689> human<00:00:30.050> obvious<00:00:30.859> I<00:00:31.039> come

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
with yourself as a human obvious I come

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.910 
with yourself as a human obvious I come
here<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:31.699> I<00:00:31.759> come<00:00:32.599> for<00:00:32.840> one<00:00:33.019> reason<00:00:33.230> I<00:00:33.530> expect

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
here and I come for one reason I expect

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.970 
here and I come for one reason I expect
to<00:00:34.040> win<00:00:34.190> it<00:00:34.730> gets<00:00:34.940> scary<00:00:35.360> when<00:00:35.930> that<00:00:36.440> theory

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
to win it gets scary when that theory

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.459 
to win it gets scary when that theory
overwhelms<00:00:37.879> the<00:00:38.059> human<00:00:38.480> part<00:00:38.750> of<00:00:38.870> yourself

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
overwhelms the human part of yourself

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.069 
overwhelms the human part of yourself
which<00:00:39.860> is<00:00:39.890> you<00:00:40.850> know<00:00:40.940> nothing<00:00:41.420> else<00:00:41.570> matters

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
which is you know nothing else matters

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.180 
which is you know nothing else matters
you<00:00:43.750> have<00:00:44.750> your<00:00:44.960> conscience<00:00:45.409> just<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.739> tad<00:00:45.920> a

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
you have your conscience just a tad a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.220 
you have your conscience just a tad a
tug<00:00:46.489> of<00:00:46.519> war<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:47.149> the<00:00:47.269> problem<00:00:47.659> is<00:00:47.839> with<00:00:48.199> a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
tug of war but the problem is with a

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.439 
tug of war but the problem is with a
racer<00:00:48.739> as<00:00:49.399> soon<00:00:49.610> as<00:00:49.729> you<00:00:49.790> put<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.030> helmet<00:00:50.360> on

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.229 
racer as soon as you put the helmet on
and<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:51.170> visor<00:00:51.320> goes<00:00:51.710> down<00:00:51.979> that<00:00:52.760> stuff<00:00:53.000> turns

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
and the visor goes down that stuff turns

and the visor goes down that stuff turns
out<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:53.780> know<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:53.930> try<00:00:54.290> and<00:00:54.379> prepare<00:00:54.500> as<00:00:54.829> good

you get one shot you know it's it's a

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.640 
you get one shot you know it's it's a

race track speeds that you don't really

match you better respect the mountain
you<00:02:00.390> know<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.050> bite<00:02:01.260> you

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.830 

boom<00:02:13.709> can't<00:02:14.430> believe<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.909> especially<00:02:15.120> after<00:02:15.629> a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
boom can't believe it especially after a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.410 
boom can't believe it especially after a
couple<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.650> speed<00:02:17.310> bumps<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.730> road<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
couple of speed bumps in the road and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.330 
couple of speed bumps in the road and
how<00:02:18.540> things<00:02:18.750> turned<00:02:18.989> out<00:02:19.140> pretty<00:02:19.709> excited

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
how things turned out pretty excited

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.160 
how things turned out pretty excited
it's<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.760> probably<00:02:21.480> take<00:02:21.659> a<00:02:21.690> little<00:02:21.900> bit<00:02:22.019> to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
it's a probably take a little bit to

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.990 
it's a probably take a little bit to
sink<00:02:22.409> in<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.920> definitely<00:02:23.459> got<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.610> couple<00:02:23.849> of

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
sink in but definitely got a couple of
