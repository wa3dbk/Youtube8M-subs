00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:17.310
 in this position she is you on your high 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.740
 the agent is a good thing with 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.630
 You are here today to earn one more 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:36.000
 geek kitchen and today's theme is 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:38.309
 leader always asks for something 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.329
 divergent then do not make today that the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.250
 longing cake 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.719
 for those who do not know the area it sweepstake 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.090
 will be quickly on the first 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.559
 training and they mention the goal quickly 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 saying that the best chocolate cake 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.600
 that exists so we solved it 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.309
 make our own version of the cake 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.620
 chocolate notes that it will be the best year 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.199
 I did not even see that we went from class to people. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.329
 He decided to get into it anyway. 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.090
 also wants to know what your function is 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.460
 I'm frank I'm from the city then 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.990
 neither lack staff here nor know 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.229
 So, actually, let's start there. 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.220
 football we will need a draft 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.220
 and unsalted butter 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.250
 two cups sugar 6 eggs but there 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.790
 You will separate the clear from the window. 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.520
 in contrast to handling six more eggs 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.800
 we will need to separate the clear in the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.119
 yolk six cups of wheat flour 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:40.030
 without leavening 6 tablespoons of 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:44.220
 chocolate or chocolate powder 2 cup 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:49.030
 of milk and 2 teaspoons of yeast 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:55.050
 We're going to vote for butter. 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:58.600
 then sugar and it's a game 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.950
 now I think put or chocolate in 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.790
 powder 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.790
 the flour and the milk 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.480
 now that the mass is practically 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.480
 Ready, it's only you put the yeast 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.110
 I 'm about to beat the egg whites in the snow. 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.810
 We've already put the dough in another 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.610
 Container so now it's just people 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.610
 incorporate whites into snow 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.460
 We put the shapes together. 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.430
 chose in this format here that it is a 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.320
 little lower and smaller because 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.970
 so we can stack a goal 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.580
 on top of the other it gets louder and 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.380
 a lot there we counted on daisy 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.970
 chocolate powder - may not be in the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.770
 way you think it's best 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.840
 now just put the dough in here 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.870
 to bake for about 30 to 40 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.870
 minutes 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.640
 the stuff we'll need three 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.680
 milk chocolate bars 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.870
 you can be grossly not even 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.849
 worry about cutting corners and two 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.500
 cream puppies 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.890
 now we will try the chocolate with 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.269
 milk cream 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.500
 now it's just you stirring until chocolate 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.120
 to melt a non-focal spot 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.510
 forget to let the fire down and not 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.510
 burn 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.750
 now xote has already melted you're going 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.700
 continue the fire until it thickens 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.240
 since the filling can not be too 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.240
 soft 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.730
 in this part is good the brigadeiro even in the 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.590
 when it came time to put the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.450
 that it was already obvious now that 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.760
 It's already starting to fill the cake so I 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.499
 I gave the first one here and it's just 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.109
 put coverage on top and then 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:18.850
 interleaving map and fill filling 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.739
 enter the dough and become one more 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.960
 peek I'll do various sectors with 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.710
 fork and there it's just there it was randomly 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.710
 same 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.340
 The exchange of coverage will 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.420
 need a medium chocolate bar 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.010
 bitter and a box of sour cream 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.450
 and now just repeat that same 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.550
 process that we used to do the 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.320
 stuffing only now we can leave 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.660
 a texture a little more ball 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.260
 now we look at the cause still warm 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.260
 principle 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.860
 now we are going to tell this template here 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.480
 join I'll make it available to you 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.480
 the short download link 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.650
 now with the mold is cut together is 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.650
 we just put on the goal 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.750
 prepare people will use this is yours 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.940
 glue and choosing the orange color you 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.940
 find it here in any party shop 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.650
 I will fill our goals in the race. 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.650
 Look at the football 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.280
 the choice of joao paulo ii to take a 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.650
 little more rock it how much more 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.150
 can make you look cooler 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.130
 Moses told anyone here that I hope 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.900
 that you enjoyed if you are 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.030
 a divergent suggestion or some other 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.950
 recipe you want to talk about here 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.780
 low if you liked serving ours 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:36.110
 It's complicated for you and it's also complicated. 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.110
 have enrolled in enem already
