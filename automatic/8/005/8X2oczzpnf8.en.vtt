 spam check that lin is valid 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.580
 choose a victim 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:34.020
 total let's say for example i want 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.360
 I want to attack this player 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.239
 attack but want to know if it is under it 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.879
 cream of other generals or not like this 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.890
 make everything very simple i start him 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.890
 throw a clap at one unit 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.719
 now see the most basic chip 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.920
 starting to throw in crepe and watch 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.840
 but by 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 Writes this location can not accept 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.420
 more reinforcements we know that limit 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.820
 to reinforcements 15 generals but 15 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.130
 marshals respectively plus 4 mine 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.159
 which I sent and that on it now 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.229
 worth 11 marshals reinforcements that is 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.080
 you can learn from the alliance like this 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.970
 hank game cove yes there carto which 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.710
 try to rank yourself 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.189
 how much reinforcement costs on them 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:32.700
 how many marshals worth chip 2 look 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.479
 chip 2 is now these first come back though 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.130
 not necessarily a trick is what 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.049
 let's say you want to attack the alliance 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.939
 hoo player there or player want 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.130
 attack and don't want to at the moment 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.170
 the attacks he sketched himself reinforcements there 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.720
 Well, or its alliance there strengthened do 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.820
 as follows from the cartoon 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.430
 underlined cartoon throws so 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.310
 Already reinforcement him about how many allows 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.380
 there how many 15 marshals still something but not 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.780
 spirits and ghosts and some 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.479
 infantrymen who barely drags 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.610
 and as long as these troops go to 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.340
 his reinforcement limit that is 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.150
 flow there hours 2 3 there for how long 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.430
 they are coming 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.260
 but you cannot support yourself by some 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.829
 you can fuck him in full 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.909
 the program 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:22.980
 that is, there will be only he and he and you or 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.840
 let's say your alliance and and one player 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.780
 because he doesnâ€™t support himself 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.030
 can well that the limit is considered from the moment 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.819
 send according to the cartoon 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.530
 why are you screaming because then 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.750
 Unfortunately, the game does not allow us here 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.739
 look strong and you can't 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.609
 attack before throwing up with and 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:46.079
 attacking the basics of such a small thing 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.299
 works well against alliance vy 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:52.739
 players for but you look falcon 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:56.129
 marshals are already holding and while your go 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:59.159
 troops he will not be able to attack in 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.189
 the command center has a tick to take 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.200
 and reinforcements are not from his but how 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:09.930
 rule of water and shut off because 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.629
 that they themselves shortage carto that's not 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.889
 turn off accordingly and this tick 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:20.040
 and you can easily so about spam 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.660
 the only negative is necessary here namul 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.430
 those pump the general staff 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.650
 up to 15 catching such things up 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.049
 with spam i mean because if 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.000
 you throw him 14 reinforcements date 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:38.989
 according to one general, he is already 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.500
 can put it there so now 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.810
 do 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.690
 In principle, such a system is very 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.299
 Cool topic, in principle, I have long known 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.250
 here once again made sure that it works 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.930
 here we are now just before your eyes 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.629
 checked the show it costs one of 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.790
 generals reinforcements respectively those 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.889
 troops that you just don't you owe 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.799
 consider that they are not just troops they 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.409
 troops with runes and possible steep and 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.599
 must count their strength in general 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.489
 all good game good mood 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.709
 positive with you was Alexei 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.709
 he is crazy life yet
