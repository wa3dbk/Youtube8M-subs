because<00:01:08.509> that's<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.869> first<00:01:09.439> measure<00:01:09.710> that

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
because that's the first measure that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.870 
because that's the first measure that
has<00:01:10.009> something<00:01:10.250> played<00:01:10.610> is<00:01:10.820> 1<00:01:11.479> 2<00:01:12.020> 3<00:01:12.850> flam<00:01:13.850> on

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
measure 4 is a crash so 1 2 3 2 3 4

measure 5 1 2 the sticking I like to use

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:29.709 
measure 5 1 2 the sticking I like to use
a<00:01:28.100> couple<00:01:28.460> ways<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:28.789> can<00:01:28.939> do<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:29.119> but<00:01:29.479> I<00:01:29.689> like

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
a couple ways you can do this but I like

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.599 
a couple ways you can do this but I like
to<00:01:30.049> do<00:01:30.170> 2<00:01:30.380> rights<00:01:30.679> in<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.979> row<00:01:31.130> when<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.340> get<00:01:31.490> to

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
to do 2 rights in a row when I get to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:40.090 
to do 2 rights in a row when I get to
the<00:01:31.729> middle<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.600> low<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.829> then<00:01:39.829> there's

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
the middle and the low and then there's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.300 
the middle and the low and then there's
a<00:01:40.159> crash<00:01:40.460> on<00:01:40.749> measure<00:01:41.749> 6<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.499> a<00:01:42.679> little<00:01:43.130> left

a crash on measure 6 and a little left
stick<00:01:43.639> an<00:01:44.630> alternative<00:01:45.289> way<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.469> do<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:45.920> is

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
stick an alternative way to do that is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.859 
stick an alternative way to do that is
just<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.639> alternate<00:01:47.509> your<00:01:47.539> sticking<00:01:47.929> so<00:01:51.850> right

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
just to alternate your sticking so right

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.959 
just to alternate your sticking so right
measure<00:01:53.869> 7<00:01:54.380> we<00:01:54.709> just<00:01:54.979> have<00:01:55.100> some<00:01:55.310> sixteenth

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
measure 7 we just have some sixteenth

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.889 
measure 7 we just have some sixteenth
notes<00:01:56.209> one<00:01:56.539> two<00:01:58.359> what's<00:01:59.359> difficult<00:01:59.569> about

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
notes one two what's difficult about

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.520 
notes one two what's difficult about
that<00:02:00.079> is<00:02:00.709> you've<00:02:00.920> got<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.159> come<00:02:01.310> out<00:02:01.429> of<00:02:02.530> and

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
that is you've got to come out of and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.800 
that is you've got to come out of and
you've<00:02:03.649> got<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.799> crash<00:02:04.100> right<00:02:04.549> on<00:02:04.819> count<00:02:05.329> one<00:02:05.630> of

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
you've got a crash right on count one of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.620 
you've got a crash right on count one of
measure<00:02:05.990> eight<00:02:07.030> you've<00:02:08.030> got<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.270> come<00:02:08.450> out<00:02:08.600> of

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
measure eight you've got to come out of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.140 
measure eight you've got to come out of
that<00:02:08.780> with<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.800> eighth<00:02:09.979> notes

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.089 

there<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.299> a<00:02:17.329> slight<00:02:17.810> crescendo<00:02:18.470> on<00:02:18.590> measure<00:02:18.799> 8

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
there is a slight crescendo on measure 8

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.130 
there is a slight crescendo on measure 8
so<00:02:19.310> you're<00:02:22.000> gradually<00:02:23.110> increasing<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
so you're gradually increasing the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:32.289 
so you're gradually increasing the
volume<00:02:24.409> I<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.890> measure<00:02:31.099> 8<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.819> ends<00:02:32.180> the

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
volume I like measure 8 that it ends the

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.630 
volume I like measure 8 that it ends the
fill<00:02:32.510> right<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:32.840> there<00:02:33.400> because<00:02:34.400> throughout

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
fill right in there because throughout

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.339 
fill right in there because throughout
the<00:02:34.819> song<00:02:39.609> it's<00:02:40.609> very<00:02:41.209> syncopated<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.140> even

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
the song it's very syncopated and even

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.140

in the outro if you watch that lesson
there's<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.450> lot<00:02:44.659> of<00:02:44.810> syncopation<00:02:45.470> in<00:02:45.590> there<00:02:45.769> so

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
there's a lot of syncopation in there so

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.740 
there's a lot of syncopation in there so
the<00:02:46.250> intro<00:02:46.579> kind<00:02:46.879> of<00:02:46.970> gives<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.120> little<00:02:47.299> hint<00:02:47.569> as

that<00:03:29.780> maybe<00:03:30.410> when<00:03:30.620> you're<00:03:30.769> writing<00:03:31.040> your<00:03:31.280> own

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
that maybe when you're writing your own

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.699 
that maybe when you're writing your own
stuff<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:32.090> can<00:03:32.239> think<00:03:32.449> back<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:32.959> or<00:03:33.230> when

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
stuff you can think back to this or when

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:34.780 
stuff you can think back to this or when
you're<00:03:33.829> playing<00:03:33.980> your<00:03:34.160> grooves<00:03:34.400> you<00:03:34.579> can<00:03:34.699> say

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
you're playing your grooves you can say

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.180 
you're playing your grooves you can say
hey<00:03:34.940> remember<00:03:35.269> how<00:03:35.389> they<00:03:35.660> did<00:03:35.810> that<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:36.190> the

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
hey remember how they did that in the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.890 
hey remember how they did that in the
rock<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.519> roll<00:03:37.639> band<00:03:37.879> and<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.510> could<00:03:38.660> try<00:03:38.810> it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
rock and roll band and you could try it

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.080 
rock and roll band and you could try it
out<00:03:39.109> so<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.769> course<00:03:39.919> you<00:03:40.129> probably<00:03:40.430> noticed<00:03:40.819> in

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
out so of course you probably noticed in

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.740 
out so of course you probably noticed in
the<00:03:41.269> intro<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.720> drums<00:03:42.199> do<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.560> technique<00:03:42.980> of

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
the intro the drums do a technique of

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.789 
the intro the drums do a technique of
leaving<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.870> first<00:03:45.049> half<00:03:45.319> of<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.560> measure

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
leaving the first half of the measure

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.610 
leaving the first half of the measure
with<00:03:46.280> rests<00:03:46.849> and<00:03:47.060> then<00:03:47.329> filling<00:03:48.139> on<00:03:48.319> the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
with rests and then filling on the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.619 
with rests and then filling on the
second<00:03:49.069> half<00:03:49.250> with<00:03:49.699> a<00:03:49.730> crash<00:03:50.060> on<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.449> count

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
second half with a crash on the count

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.189 
second half with a crash on the count
one<00:03:50.930> so<00:03:51.230> at<00:03:51.500> measure<00:03:51.709> 3<00:03:52.099> which<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.090> do<00:03:53.389> a<00:03:53.419> 4<00:03:53.810> with

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
one so at measure 3 which is do a 4 with

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.470 
one so at measure 3 which is do a 4 with
the<00:03:54.319> fill<00:03:54.560> it's<00:03:54.949> just<00:03:55.129> a<00:03:55.190> quarter<00:03:55.519> note<00:03:55.669> when

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
the fill it's just a quarter note when

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.750 
the fill it's just a quarter note when
you<00:03:56.569> get<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.900> measure<00:03:57.319> 5<00:03:57.680> now<00:03:58.400> we've<00:03:58.609> got

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
you get to measure 5 now we've got

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.990 
you get to measure 5 now we've got
eighth<00:03:59.000> notes<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:01.220> can<00:04:01.370> see<00:04:01.430> it's<00:04:01.579> gradually

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
eighth notes you can see it's gradually

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.670 
eighth notes you can see it's gradually
progressing<00:04:02.599> there<00:04:02.810> now<00:04:03.260> when<00:04:03.409> you<00:04:03.470> get<00:04:03.560> to

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
progressing there now when you get to

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.930 
progressing there now when you get to
measure<00:04:03.859> seven<00:04:04.400> we've<00:04:04.639> got<00:04:04.849> sixteenth<00:04:05.389> notes

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
measure seven we've got sixteenth notes

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.910 
measure seven we've got sixteenth notes
so<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:07.840> got<00:04:07.960> even<00:04:07.990> more<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.560> progression

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
so you got even more of a progression

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.580 
so you got even more of a progression
and<00:04:09.220> then<00:04:09.760> at<00:04:10.030> measure<00:04:10.600> 8<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:11.080> course<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:11.500> have

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
and then at measure 8 of course you have

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.230 
and then at measure 8 of course you have
a<00:04:11.650> full<00:04:11.890> measure<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.430> eighth<00:04:12.580> notes<00:04:12.910> and

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
a full measure of the eighth notes and

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.330 
a full measure of the eighth notes and
then<00:04:13.360> into<00:04:13.600> sixteenth<00:04:14.080> notes<00:04:14.320> so<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:14.950> can<00:04:15.100> use

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
then into sixteenth notes so you can use

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.610 
then into sixteenth notes so you can use
that<00:04:15.790> technique<00:04:16.269> of<00:04:16.540> starting<00:04:16.959> with<00:04:17.080> simpler

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
that technique of starting with simpler

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.620 
that technique of starting with simpler
notes<00:04:17.830> quarter<00:04:18.250> notes<00:04:18.370> then<00:04:19.239> moving<00:04:19.480> to

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
notes quarter notes then moving to

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.690 
notes quarter notes then moving to
eighth<00:04:20.019> notes<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.799> gradually<00:04:21.190> build<00:04:21.430> that

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
eighth notes to gradually build that

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.850 
eighth notes to gradually build that
progression<00:04:22.210> than<00:04:22.360> sixteenth<00:04:22.810> notes<00:04:23.080> or<00:04:23.680> you

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
progression than sixteenth notes or you

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.170 
progression than sixteenth notes or you
could<00:04:24.010> even<00:04:24.100> go<00:04:24.310> from<00:04:24.490> eighth<00:04:24.670> notes<00:04:24.940> state

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
could even go from eighth notes state

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.060 
could even go from eighth notes state
note<00:04:25.450> triplets<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:26.230> sixteenth<00:04:26.680> notes<00:04:26.950> to

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
note triplets to sixteenth notes to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.680 
note triplets to sixteenth notes to
sixteenth<00:04:27.460> note<00:04:27.640> triplets<00:04:28.000> of<00:04:28.090> thirty-second

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
sixteenth note triplets of thirty-second

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.270 
sixteenth note triplets of thirty-second
notes<00:04:28.870> there's<00:04:29.440> all<00:04:29.620> kinds<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:29.980> different

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
notes there's all kinds of different

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.250 
notes there's all kinds of different
options<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:31.030> finally<00:04:31.450> I<00:04:31.600> already<00:04:31.870> talked<00:04:32.110> a

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
options and finally I already talked a

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.290 
options and finally I already talked a
little<00:04:32.380> bit<00:04:32.560> about<00:04:32.740> measure<00:04:32.980> 9<00:04:33.310> ending<00:04:33.940> the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
little bit about measure 9 ending the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.250 
little bit about measure 9 ending the
fill<00:04:34.810> on<00:04:35.140> the<00:04:35.650> end<00:04:38.730> really<00:04:39.730> cool<00:04:39.940> technique<00:04:40.480> a

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
fill on the end really cool technique a

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.950
