what<00:00:15.610> what<00:00:16.420> made<00:00:16.600> you<00:00:16.750> become<00:00:16.900> interested<00:00:17.230> in

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
what what made you become interested in

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.780 
what what made you become interested in
writing<00:00:18.160> and<00:00:18.520> how<00:00:18.730> it<00:00:18.940> is<00:00:19.210> therapeutic<00:00:19.510> I<00:00:20.790> got

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
writing and how it is therapeutic I got

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.940 
writing and how it is therapeutic I got
into<00:00:22.029> this<00:00:22.150> research<00:00:22.510> just<00:00:22.869> backwards<00:00:23.410> so

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
into this research just backwards so

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.260 
into this research just backwards so
that<00:00:23.980> I<00:00:25.860> discovered<00:00:26.860> years<00:00:27.070> ago<00:00:27.189> by<00:00:27.670> accident

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
that I discovered years ago by accident

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.930 
that I discovered years ago by accident
that<00:00:28.330> having<00:00:28.930> early<00:00:29.470> traumatic<00:00:29.980> experiences

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
that having early traumatic experiences

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.960 
that having early traumatic experiences
was<00:00:31.570> associated<00:00:32.080> with<00:00:32.290> higher<00:00:33.190> illness<00:00:33.790> rates

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
was associated with higher illness rates

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.060 
was associated with higher illness rates
especially<00:00:34.840> people<00:00:35.020> had<00:00:35.320> traumatic

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
especially people had traumatic

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.060 
especially people had traumatic
experiences<00:00:36.580> that<00:00:36.699> they<00:00:36.910> kept<00:00:37.180> secret<00:00:38.070> which

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
experiences that they kept secret which

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.070 
experiences that they kept secret which
led<00:00:39.309> me<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.610> question<00:00:39.940> of<00:00:40.300> what<00:00:40.480> if<00:00:40.900> you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
led me to the question of what if you

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.170 
led me to the question of what if you
ask<00:00:41.290> people<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:41.739> tell<00:00:42.340> their<00:00:42.580> secrets<00:00:42.820> with

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
ask people to tell their secrets with

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.990 
ask people to tell their secrets with
their<00:00:43.449> health<00:00:43.660> improved<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:45.730> what<00:00:45.970> I

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
their health improved and so what I

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.600 
their health improved and so what I
ended<00:00:46.090> up<00:00:46.329> doing<00:00:46.600> was<00:00:46.720> a<00:00:46.750> study<00:00:47.110> 30<00:00:48.100> years<00:00:48.370> ago

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
ended up doing was a study 30 years ago

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.550 
ended up doing was a study 30 years ago
where<00:00:48.880> we<00:00:48.970> brought<00:00:49.329> feelin's<00:00:49.720> laboratory<00:00:50.260> and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
where we brought feelin's laboratory and

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.069 
where we brought feelin's laboratory and
half<00:00:50.770> of<00:00:50.950> them<00:00:51.100> write<00:00:51.340> about<00:00:51.610> a<00:00:51.910> major<00:00:52.510> trauma

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
half of them write about a major trauma

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.470 
half of them write about a major trauma
they<00:00:53.470> had<00:00:53.590> kept<00:00:53.829> secret<00:00:54.280> versus<00:00:54.760> had<00:00:55.239> them

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
they had kept secret versus had them

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.080 
they had kept secret versus had them
write<00:00:55.720> about<00:00:55.960> superficial<00:00:56.440> topics<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.700> found

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
write about superficial topics and found

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.940 
write about superficial topics and found
that<00:00:58.450> writing<00:00:58.780> about<00:00:58.930> traumas<00:00:59.590> was

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
that writing about traumas was

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.100 
that writing about traumas was
associated<00:01:00.550> with<00:01:00.670> health<00:01:00.850> improvements<00:01:01.690> and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
associated with health improvements and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.439 
associated with health improvements and
that<00:01:02.829> kind<00:01:03.130> of<00:01:03.160> led<00:01:03.399> me<00:01:03.430> down<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:04.000> path<00:01:04.030> I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
that kind of led me down the path I

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.109 
that kind of led me down the path I
followed<00:01:04.960> over<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.259> last<00:01:05.410> 20<00:01:05.770> years<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.910> what

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
followed over the last 20 years and what

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.990 
followed over the last 20 years and what
kind<00:01:07.330> of<00:01:07.390> health<00:01:07.600> improvements<00:01:08.200> did<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:08.470> see

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
kind of health improvements did you see

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.300 
kind of health improvements did you see
in<00:01:10.000> our<00:01:10.149> first<00:01:10.450> studies<00:01:10.840> we<00:01:11.110> got<00:01:11.890> permission

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
in our first studies we got permission

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.550 
in our first studies we got permission
from<00:01:12.550> students<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.330> get<00:01:13.479> access<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.259> their

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
from students to get access to their

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.740 
from students to get access to their
student<00:01:14.890> health<00:01:15.070> records<00:01:15.550> and<00:01:16.300> we<00:01:16.390> found<00:01:16.570> that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
student health records and we found that

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.120 
student health records and we found that
people<00:01:16.899> went<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.409> student<00:01:17.770> health<00:01:17.950> center

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
people went to the student health center

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.700 
people went to the student health center
at<00:01:18.700> about<00:01:19.000> half<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.299> rights<00:01:19.750> as<00:01:20.200> people<00:01:20.409> in

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
at about half the rights as people in

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.170 
at about half the rights as people in
our<00:01:20.830> control<00:01:21.220> conditions<00:01:21.670> after<00:01:22.060> it's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
our control conditions after it's

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.780 
our control conditions after it's
writing<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:23.770> did<00:01:23.979> in<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.460> years<00:01:24.610> that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
writing they did in the years that

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.210 
writing they did in the years that
followed<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.390> looked<00:01:26.140> at<00:01:26.229> other<00:01:26.380> measures<00:01:26.680> and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
followed we looked at other measures and

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.370 
followed we looked at other measures and
other<00:01:27.340> labs<00:01:27.729> have<00:01:28.119> so<00:01:28.479> we<00:01:28.689> started<00:01:28.990> looking<00:01:29.080> at

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
other labs have so we started looking at

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.350 
other labs have so we started looking at
markers<00:01:29.890> of<00:01:30.040> immune<00:01:30.340> function<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.090> we<00:01:31.210> would

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
markers of immune function so we would

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.200 
markers of immune function so we would
draw<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.630> blood<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.409> in<00:01:32.650> our<00:01:32.770> studies<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:34.090> then

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
draw a blood and in our studies and then

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.910 
draw a blood and in our studies and then
later<00:01:34.390> other<00:01:34.659> people<00:01:35.170> started<00:01:35.530> looking<00:01:35.799> at

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
later other people started looking at

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.110 
later other people started looking at
all<00:01:36.130> kinds<00:01:36.159> of<00:01:36.670> things<00:01:36.939> looking<00:01:37.360> at

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
all kinds of things looking at

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.510 
all kinds of things looking at
cd4<00:01:40.120> counts<00:01:40.990> or<00:01:41.110> white<00:01:41.410> blood<00:01:41.650> cell<00:01:42.040> counts

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
cd4 counts or white blood cell counts

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.730 
cd4 counts or white blood cell counts
and<00:01:42.670> markers<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.210> aggression<00:01:43.750> aggressiveness

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
and markers of aggression aggressiveness

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.340 
and markers of aggression aggressiveness
of<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:44.920> immune<00:01:45.250> system<00:01:45.280> among<00:01:45.880> people<00:01:46.350> with

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
of the immune system among people with

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.540 
of the immune system among people with
AIDS<00:01:47.620> other<00:01:48.580> people<00:01:49.000> looked<00:01:49.240> at<00:01:50.550> various

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
AIDS other people looked at various

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.790 
AIDS other people looked at various
biological<00:01:51.970> markers<00:01:52.780> as<00:01:53.610> arthritis<00:01:54.780> cancer

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
biological markers as arthritis cancer

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.650 
biological markers as arthritis cancer
so<00:01:56.800> there<00:01:56.920> probably<00:01:56.980> been<00:01:57.490> now<00:01:57.850> over<00:01:58.270> 200

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
so there probably been now over 200

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.950 
so there probably been now over 200
studies<00:01:58.990> done<00:01:59.260> looking<00:01:59.680> at<00:01:59.770> writing<00:02:00.040> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
studies done looking at writing and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.200 
studies done looking at writing and
maybe<00:02:01.980> 10<00:02:02.980> to<00:02:03.070> 20<00:02:03.340> percent<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.730> those<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.060> look

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
maybe 10 to 20 percent of those to look

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.720 
maybe 10 to 20 percent of those to look
at<00:02:04.360> various<00:02:04.750> health<00:02:05.050> measures<00:02:05.610> along<00:02:06.610> the

this kind of relates to that it really

it does it's and this raises a really

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.420 
it does it's and this raises a really

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
interesting question of when people talk

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.990 
interesting question of when people talk
about<00:02:18.460> traumatic<00:02:19.000> experience<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:21.000> website

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
about traumatic experience and a website

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.140 
about traumatic experience and a website
like<00:02:22.360> PostSecret<00:02:23.170> calm<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:24.150> interesting

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
like PostSecret calm is interesting

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.630 
like PostSecret calm is interesting
because<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.930> lot<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:27.010> people<00:02:27.190> are<00:02:27.370> writing

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
because a lot of the people are writing

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.040 
because a lot of the people are writing
about<00:02:27.820> things<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.270> they<00:02:28.540> can't<00:02:28.810> tell

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
about things that they can't tell

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.990 
about things that they can't tell
anybody<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.130> many<00:02:30.310> ways<00:02:30.490> that's<00:02:30.700> what<00:02:30.790> our

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
anybody and in many ways that's what our

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.540 
anybody and in many ways that's what our
research<00:02:31.390> was<00:02:31.810> when<00:02:32.110> we<00:02:32.200> started<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.830> which

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
research was when we started it which

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.310 
research was when we started it which
was<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.940> opportunity<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.840> write<00:02:35.050> about

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
was this opportunity to write about

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.830 
was this opportunity to write about
upsetting<00:02:35.800> experiences<00:02:36.670> we<00:02:37.510> had<00:02:37.660> people

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
upsetting experiences we had people

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.800 
upsetting experiences we had people
write<00:02:38.170> for<00:02:38.670> three<00:02:39.670> or<00:02:39.850> four<00:02:39.880> days<00:02:40.480> depending

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
write for three or four days depending

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.680 
write for three or four days depending
on<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.290> study<00:02:41.560> for<00:02:42.040> 15<00:02:42.550> maybe<00:02:42.850> 20<00:02:42.970> minutes<00:02:43.420> of

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
on this study for 15 maybe 20 minutes of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.590 
on this study for 15 maybe 20 minutes of
time<00:02:43.870> on<00:02:44.680> each<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:45.040> those<00:02:45.130> days<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:46.330> was

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
time on each of those days and that was

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.360 
time on each of those days and that was
also<00:02:47.080> we<00:02:47.170> didn't<00:02:47.410> have<00:02:47.530> people<00:02:47.680> write<00:02:48.010> forever

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
also we didn't have people write forever

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.699 
also we didn't have people write forever
it<00:02:48.550> was<00:02:48.670> just<00:02:48.820> a<00:02:48.970> fixed<00:02:49.720> amount<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.170> time<00:02:50.230> what

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
it was just a fixed amount of time what

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.640 
it was just a fixed amount of time what
did<00:02:50.830> he<00:02:50.920> find<00:02:51.130> out<00:02:51.280> about<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.090> study<00:02:52.360> what<00:02:52.660> did

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
did he find out about the study what did

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.090 
did he find out about the study what did
it<00:02:53.770> help<00:02:54.070> people<00:02:54.250> mostly<00:02:54.760> were

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
it help people mostly were

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.380 
it help people mostly were
overwhelmingly<00:02:57.100> people<00:02:57.489> say<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.209> has

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
overwhelmingly people say that it has

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.920 
overwhelmingly people say that it has
been<00:02:58.630> but<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:59.110> beneficial

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
been but it's beneficial

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.640 
been but it's beneficial
virtually<00:03:01.829> nobody<00:03:02.010> says<00:03:02.519> it's<00:03:02.760> bad<00:03:03.500> so<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
virtually nobody says it's bad so it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.759 
virtually nobody says it's bad so it
seems<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.459> method<00:03:06.269> that's<00:03:06.420> very<00:03:07.290> simple

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
seems to be a method that's very simple

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.880 
seems to be a method that's very simple
and<00:03:08.120> people<00:03:09.120> find<00:03:09.450> benefit<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.319> think<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.709> gives

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
and people find benefit I think it gives

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.399 
and people find benefit I think it gives
them<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.220> opportunity<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:12.120> kind<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.110> stand

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
them the opportunity to kind of stand

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.929 
them the opportunity to kind of stand
back<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.819> where<00:03:15.000> they<00:03:15.150> are<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:15.510> life<00:03:15.540> and

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
back and see where they are in life and

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.550 
back and see where they are in life and
kind<00:03:17.939> of<00:03:18.000> put<00:03:18.329> things<00:03:18.569> together<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.379> may

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
kind of put things together that may

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.710 
kind of put things together that may
have<00:03:19.680> been<00:03:19.859> really<00:03:20.340> complex<00:03:20.730> as<00:03:21.030> most<00:03:21.299> traumas

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
have been really complex as most traumas

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.069 
have been really complex as most traumas
are<00:03:22.819> kind<00:03:23.819> of<00:03:23.879> before<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.269> turn<00:03:24.840> on<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
are kind of before I turn on the

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.559 
are kind of before I turn on the
recorder<00:03:25.530> we<00:03:25.709> were<00:03:25.859> talking<00:03:26.280> about<00:03:26.540> how<00:03:27.540> I

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
recorder we were talking about how I

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.599 
recorder we were talking about how I
suggest<00:03:28.109> that<00:03:28.439> maybe<00:03:28.680> highly<00:03:29.400> creative

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
suggest that maybe highly creative

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.449 
suggest that maybe highly creative
people<00:03:30.180> often<00:03:30.510> had<00:03:30.750> traumatic<00:03:31.500> experiences

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
people often had traumatic experiences

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.309 
people often had traumatic experiences
what<00:03:33.209> do<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:33.359> think<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.629> that<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.139> not

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
what do you think of that is that not

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.440 
what do you think of that is that not
quite<00:03:34.590> right

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
quite right

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.180 
quite right
first<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.569> all<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.290> whole<00:03:37.470> concept<00:03:38.099> of

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
first of all the I the whole concept of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.849 
first of all the I the whole concept of
creativity<00:03:38.879> is<00:03:38.970> some<00:03:39.180> kind<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.599> is<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.290> very

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
creativity is some kind of a is a very

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.149 
creativity is some kind of a is a very
difficult<00:03:41.129> one<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.790> grasp<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:43.590> there<00:03:43.889> have

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
difficult one to grasp and there have

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.640 
difficult one to grasp and there have
been<00:03:44.190> some<00:03:44.519> arguments<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.470> highly<00:03:46.470> creative

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
been some arguments that highly creative

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.979 
been some arguments that highly creative
people<00:03:46.859> have<00:03:47.250> had<00:03:47.459> really<00:03:48.389> tortured

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
people have had really tortured

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.699 
people have had really tortured
childhoods<00:03:49.980> things<00:03:50.400> like<00:03:50.609> that<00:03:51.049> but<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.290> don't

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
childhoods things like that but I don't

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.789 
childhoods things like that but I don't
know<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.280> any<00:03:53.720> strong<00:03:54.720> research<00:03:55.230> to<00:03:55.590> suggest

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
know of any strong research to suggest

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.280 
know of any strong research to suggest
that<00:03:56.250> creativity<00:03:56.819> is<00:03:57.150> in<00:03:57.180> fact<00:03:57.599> related<00:03:58.109> to

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
that creativity is in fact related to

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.520 
that creativity is in fact related to
having<00:03:58.590> traumatic<00:03:59.459> childhoods<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.269> fact<00:04:00.569> as<00:04:01.109> I

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
having traumatic childhoods in fact as I

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.569 
having traumatic childhoods in fact as I
recall<00:04:02.329> some<00:04:03.329> of<00:04:03.389> the<00:04:03.720> most<00:04:04.579> certainly

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
recall some of the most certainly

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.720 
recall some of the most certainly
successful<00:04:06.540> productive<00:04:06.989> people<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.949> I<00:04:08.459> think

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
successful productive people and I think

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.689 
successful productive people and I think
that<00:04:08.910> often<00:04:09.209> Cove<00:04:09.569> areas<00:04:09.989> with<00:04:10.430> creativity

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
that often Cove areas with creativity

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.589 
that often Cove areas with creativity
often<00:04:12.569> have<00:04:12.750> had<00:04:13.400> surprisingly<00:04:14.599> or

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
often have had surprisingly or

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.360 
often have had surprisingly or
reasonably<00:04:16.289> happy<00:04:16.500> childhood<00:04:17.039> that's<00:04:17.250> as

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
reasonably happy childhood that's as

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.819 
reasonably happy childhood that's as
opposed<00:04:17.699> to<00:04:17.820> tortured<00:04:18.449> in<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.470> grand<00:04:19.709> scheme
