00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.059
 generally in the large structure 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.830
 like the one from belgrano always those that 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.330
 they play in a first place are the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.880
 players who are not taken by them 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.880
 into account in water categories 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.030
 analyze together with another group of 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.970
 collaborators that we should 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.030
 we should enhance that category the 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.730
 decision was to bring begin to attract 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.430
 outstanding players of the league begin 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.460
 all of zero start all with this 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.930
 new hope and to win the job and 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 have between what was in Belgrano and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.809
 what came from outside to see how it 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.809
 I could assemble this equipment 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.130
 we are the team that we 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:06.790
 we pretended and we wanted and we thought 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:08.500
 that was the team like these guys that 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.270
 they came from outside they saw with so many 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.360
 desire and so much illusion of being in the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.580
 club and that they infected the rest of their 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.040
 companions and already began to live as 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.270
 a different team than I had 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.820
 seen in previous years we live here 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.119
 a belgrano and the first thing you try 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.100
 form the group our slave spirit 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.740
 smaller though I like the station and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.460
 we feel like who says the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.460
 best in the world 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.789
 the first day I can not believe it 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.420
 I looked like that look at the big point if I 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.420
 I have them 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.920
 I'm fine this week's file 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.620
 before the tournament that was for visas 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.240
 surely we talk to the guys from 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.020
 that the decision of have to take 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.020
 you stay 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.579
 to 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.319
 ah
