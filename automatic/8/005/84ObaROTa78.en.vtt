00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:05.569
Hi guys.

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:06.569
This is Max Tapper again for Howcast.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.000
What I am going to do today is answer a question,
"How do I get an awesome chest workout?"

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.470
Okay cool, let us start from this; very importantly,
your first exercise you choose should always

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.420
be the one that you can lift the most amount
of weight.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.220
That is either going to be a dumbbell press
or a barbell press like this.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.453
Our second exercise that we are going to choose
is going to be something that is going to

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:27.130
fatigue our muscles even more.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.670
You can use something even lighter and go
for more reps.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.280
Our third exercise we choose is going to be
something that is more of a burn down, which

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.310
is going to get to the deeper muscle fibers
and really fatigue that muscle.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.690
A very important thing here is going to be
the rep range.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.100
Depending on what you are trying to achieve,
we are going to choose a certain rep range

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.350
to get that result.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.460
Now if it is (?) or if it is aesthetics like
changing or shaping your body, 10 to 12 is

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.629
always going to be that sweet spot.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.360
That is a place that I love to stay at.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.410
So, we are going to have 12 reps of our barbell
press, then we are going to go into a dumbbell

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.559
press on an incline bench for 12 reps and
then pushups on the floor for 12 reps or as

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.330
many as you can so you burn out.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.920
You got it?

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:17.249
Alright, let us go.

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:20.540
Alright guys, now the second exercise we are
going to do is going to be an incline dumbbell

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.540
fly.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.420
Now obviously we just had to grab this incline
bench and slide it over so you will still

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.659
see the bench I was using before, but this
is what it is going to look like.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.229
Grab some weights that you can control.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.770
Again, grab some weights that you can control.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.759
Too heavy of a fly is going to damage your
shoulder capsule and we do not want that.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:51.270
I am going to lean back, extend our arms up,
slow on the way out to the side, pause, and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.590
in.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.450
Squeeze and in.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.270
Remember, we are going to stop these dumbbells
right over our shoulders.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.899
We are not going to bring them in towards
the chest.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.850
The minute you do that your muscles release.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:15.419
Slow on the way out, and in, pause.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.820
Now for the third exercise; it is going to
be burn out pushups.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.860
We are going to knock these out until you
cannot do them anymore.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.131
Very important, if you get to the last exercise
and you need to do 20 to 30 pushups, that

00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:29.500
means that you did not choose the right weights
for your first two exercises.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.300
There is going to be a lot of trial and error,
that is completely fine, but what we have

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.450
to do is to really find that sweet spot in
terms of the weight and rep range that targets

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.910
those muscles perfectly, fatigues at 12 so
by the time we get to our third exercise we

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.910
are completely done.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.860
There is no reason to have to do more than
20 pushups at the very end.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.230
Alright guys, so get out there, have a good
time, be safe, and enjoy yourself.
