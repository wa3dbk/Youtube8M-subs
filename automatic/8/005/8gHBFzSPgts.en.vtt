00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.920
 Now at this point and that 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.730
 twirled the pedal to pierce and 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.910
 then we give a schedule and then we need 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.910
 go 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.950
 it is convenient that you further need to jump 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.619
 according to older people let's say 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.880
 or uphill if it is more convenient to ride 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.580
 on the electric you won't rake at all 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.059
 we are exactly analytical then need gasoline 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.190
 necessary rights to the driver's personal store 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.580
 correspondingly less expenses 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 economically and environmentally friendly 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 engine is drive 1 on the front 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.699
 the wheel 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.350
 so here is this brushless motor what 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.110
 compiled list is fixed right in 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.940
 wheel and take away some wire already 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 on gas hooks or power cable 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.070
 how they fortified further go she 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.140
 ready emulator connects here 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.260
 three batteries at 12 volts 36 volts and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.220
 12 amp hour capacity do everything here 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.020
 is in one handbag 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.210
 I need this bike for this purpose 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.570
 so that you could drive to work 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.299
 summer cottage 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.729
 Conveniently, there are no costs as springs 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.729
 special and no physical pixels 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.469
 7 to the village have to go 30 kilometers I 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.149
 quietly before God Krishna asks he 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.390
 rides with the speed of a man 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.380
 I mean, you are driving Kevin out of it 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.380
 here 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.770
 the way the male was clear 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.080
 that feeling 2,440 at the end how much she 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.080
 accelerate to 60 ma 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.999
 she is
