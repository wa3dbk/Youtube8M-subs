00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
get into this I have to give a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.200 
get into this I have to give a
disclaimer<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.500> see<00:00:38.370> people<00:00:38.489> get<00:00:38.699> inflamed<00:00:39.000> all

disclaimer I see people get inflamed all
the<00:00:39.300> time<00:00:39.449> because<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.170> does

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the time because of this this does

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.630 
the time because of this this does
involve<00:00:40.589> the<00:00:40.739> auction<00:00:41.040> house<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.339> selling
