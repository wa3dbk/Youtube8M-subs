00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:11.059
 Hello guys here such here 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.059
 it turned out and I am funny shpaklevochka 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.590
 changed again 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.580
 know the finish 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:35.010
 used extra ski cross Toskigi 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:42.030
 such here dye again it's all economy 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:54.680
 option is the same skin of the floor of the Kirov 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:54.680
 On the part of only the Institute so here Makar 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.000
 please don't judge me harshly I don't know 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.280
 something happened so how are you 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.070
 I asked for a wish to do something 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.049
 original 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.140
 again so that it is cheap and 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.630
 angrily 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:33.180
 here it came out me done so far 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:34.950
 using putty and dyes say 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.820
 so again it is very strong 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.820
 a budget option 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:02:15.950
 but this looks something like this to not shine 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:20.270
 see how we besteht here see all 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.440
 It seems that only 500 garbage turns out 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:29.450
 really make very cheap 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:35.420
 I will honestly tell the skills not by 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:40.640
 there is no mine between this one 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:47.440
 composition this experiment did it 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.440
 first time just like what 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:02.570
 it turns out in this here's the thing 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:09.320
 just here as if to a separate small 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:12.680
 abalone commands and will also be glued a 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:17.600
 brisk such there oh I decided to falcon 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:23.049
 so that's something like that to make a ceiling 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.049
 there is already one piece to the noise 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.430
 exist here and reading 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:43.290
 the networks have become good to me too the first time 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:45.489
 missed the circles of years budget options 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.700
 it turns out you can make your own 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.700
 by hands 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.360
 I want to say that putty is not at all 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.310
 I can 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:05.709
 but I never did that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:11.819
 I will try to do this the first time 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:19.269
 This is the highest some kind of cool 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:22.800
 composition who likes to like 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:28.360
 comment who are interested ask 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.720
 who does not like is not required to put 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.990
 dislikes 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.039
 although this no one is safe all 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.039
