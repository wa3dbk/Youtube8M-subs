science technology for me it's a very
modern<00:00:20.320> way<00:00:20.560> of<00:00:20.590> working<00:00:21.190> I<00:00:21.490> like<00:00:21.789> the<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.180> way

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
some other planet so I think this suit

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.760 
some other planet so I think this suit
the<00:01:11.770> idea<00:01:12.130> like<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.180> very<00:01:13.390> very<00:01:13.840> intensely

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
the idea like a very very intensely

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.880 
the idea like a very very intensely
man-made<00:01:15.400> element<00:01:16.380> combining<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.500> fusing

whether<00:01:18.070> just<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.610> most<00:01:18.880> natural<00:01:19.330> element<00:01:19.689> of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
whether just the most natural element of

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.850 
whether just the most natural element of
the<00:01:20.140> breath<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.830> was<00:01:21.159> really<00:01:21.490> interesting

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the breath that was really interesting

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.039 
the breath that was really interesting
when<00:01:23.860> I<00:01:23.920> first<00:01:24.280> got<00:01:25.000> my<00:01:25.150> hands<00:01:25.479> on<00:01:25.600> an<00:01:25.720> Edison

when I first got my hands on an Edison
ship<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.560> was<00:01:26.650> surprised<00:01:27.189> at<00:01:27.430> how<00:01:27.580> small<00:01:28.000> it<00:01:28.150> was

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.490 

that's<00:01:45.210> what<00:01:45.330> fascinated<00:01:45.780> me<00:01:46.020> about<00:01:46.050> this

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that's what fascinated me about this

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.900 
that's what fascinated me about this
kind<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.770> wearable<00:01:47.100> tech<00:01:47.280> stuff<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.700> that

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
kind of wearable tech stuff is that

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.170 
kind of wearable tech stuff is that
something<00:01:48.570> completely<00:01:49.380> man-made<00:01:49.620> could<00:01:50.520> at

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
something completely man-made could at

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.530 
something completely man-made could at
once<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:52.220> supernatural<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.370> so<00:01:53.940> natural<00:01:54.420> he

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
once be supernatural and so natural he

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.090 
once be supernatural and so natural he
had<00:01:54.690> both<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.050> those<00:01:55.290> elements<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.010> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
had both of those elements but at the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.520 
had both of those elements but at the
same<00:01:56.250> time<00:01:56.810> technically<00:01:57.810> speaking<00:01:58.080> it<00:01:58.410> was

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
same time technically speaking it was

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.650 
same time technically speaking it was
this<00:01:58.710> man-made<00:01:59.370> you<00:02:00.030> know<00:02:00.150> device<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:03.420> size

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
this man-made you know device the size

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.210 
this man-made you know device the size
of<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:03.930> chip<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.530> getting<00:02:04.770> smaller<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
of the chip is just getting smaller and

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.740 
of the chip is just getting smaller and
smaller<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.850> more<00:02:05.970> powerful<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.630> more

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
smaller and more powerful and more

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.240 
smaller and more powerful and more
accessible<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:07.650> you<00:02:07.950> know<00:02:08.070> that's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
accessible so I think you know that's

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.420 
accessible so I think you know that's
great<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.850> enhance<00:02:09.330> creativity<00:02:10.310> wherever<00:02:11.310> you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
great to enhance creativity wherever you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.910 
great to enhance creativity wherever you
might<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.690> true<00:02:12.690> creativity<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.410> guess<00:02:13.680> is

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
might be true creativity I guess is

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.770 
might be true creativity I guess is
pushing<00:02:14.520> yourself<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.120> pushing<00:02:15.450> your<00:02:15.600> art

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
pushing yourself and pushing your art

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.070 
pushing yourself and pushing your art
form<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.230> being<00:02:16.800> able<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.480> output<00:02:18.480> your<00:02:18.510> ideas

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
form and being able to output your ideas

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.170 
form and being able to output your ideas
and<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.620> often<00:02:20.460> like<00:02:20.700> when<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:20.940> have<00:02:21.030> been

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and and often like when you have been

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.430 
and and often like when you have been
truly<00:02:21.420> creative<00:02:21.870> you've<00:02:21.960> never<00:02:22.140> seen<00:02:22.380> that

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
truly creative you've never seen that

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.080 
truly creative you've never seen that
before<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.100> think<00:02:23.160> technology<00:02:23.670> is

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
before and I think technology is

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.290 
before and I think technology is
becoming<00:02:24.390> more<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:24.930> more<00:02:25.760> what<00:02:26.760> facilitates

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
becoming more and more what facilitates

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.330 
becoming more and more what facilitates
that<00:02:27.570> growth<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.200> know<00:02:28.320> when<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.590> can't<00:02:28.860> do

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
that growth you know when we can't do

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.560 
that growth you know when we can't do
something<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.760> hasn't<00:02:29.910> done<00:02:30.150> before<00:02:30.450> we

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
something that hasn't done before we

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.120 
something that hasn't done before we
look<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.870> technology<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.470> figure<00:02:31.740> out<00:02:31.830> how<00:02:32.010> it

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
look to technology to figure out how it

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.020 
look to technology to figure out how it
can<00:02:32.250> happen<00:02:32.430> next

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
can happen next

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.940 
can happen next
being<00:02:33.810> out<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.900> work<00:02:34.140> with<00:02:34.320> technology<00:02:34.860> is

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
being out of work with technology is

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.920 
being out of work with technology is
being<00:02:35.160> able<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.370> see<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.640> possibilities<00:02:36.390> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
being able to see the possibilities and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.840 
being able to see the possibilities and
it<00:02:37.050> might<00:02:37.230> not<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.410> what<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.070> says<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.640> box

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
it might not be what it says on the box

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.820 
it might not be what it says on the box
more<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.630> more<00:02:39.810> we're<00:02:40.020> able<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.410> do<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.680> as<00:02:40.800> a

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
more and more we're able to do it as a

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.070 
more and more we're able to do it as a
technology<00:02:41.790> will<00:02:41.940> continue<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.540> grow<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
technology will continue to grow and

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.420 
technology will continue to grow and
it's<00:02:43.350> important<00:02:43.740> that<00:02:43.770> we<00:02:43.860> play<00:02:44.130> with<00:02:44.310> it

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
it's important that we play with it

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.820 
it's important that we play with it
there's<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.270> template<00:02:45.660> for<00:02:45.900> art<00:02:46.200> science<00:02:46.500> and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
there's a template for art science and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.949 
there's a template for art science and
technology<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.640> collaboration<00:02:48.480> will<00:02:48.630> always

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
technology the collaboration will always

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.080 
technology the collaboration will always
be<00:02:49.200> there<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.620> learn<00:02:50.010> more<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.520> muddy<00:02:50.760> more

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
be there and learn more and muddy more

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.420 
be there and learn more and muddy more
and<00:02:51.320> you<00:02:52.320> know<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.709> that's<00:02:52.800> what<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.040> hope<00:02:53.190> you

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
and you know and that's what I hope you

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.580 
and you know and that's what I hope you
two<00:02:54.180> years<00:02:54.390> time<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.900> know
