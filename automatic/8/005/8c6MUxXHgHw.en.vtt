 cultivation of medicinal plants in the 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.630
 area of ​​greater neck a company 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.250
 family of villarrica came to settle 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.260
 what's behind then came the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.180
 many committees formation many 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.820
 farmers and at this time we have 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.110
 with about 25 producers of plants 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.670
 medicinal all 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.190
 prayed by the company offers the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.010
 advising the accompaniment and 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.500
 then also people started to 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.530
 dedicate to medicinal plants makes 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.930
 about five years that the company is being 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.900
 consolidated practically here in this in 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.760
 this site of which greater the company in 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.470
 the district of independence 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.720
 department of guairá to which items 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.240
 previously the producers 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.100
 from the area the sugar cane always 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.680
 was preponderant in the area was the 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.450
 pretty girl growing area also 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.420
 the cane is with more problems like 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.239
 we know the issue of prices the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.010
 harvest that always gets harder 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.590
 this the staff that do not want more 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.810
 harvest for certain sums of money the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.720
 costs of the ton of cane that 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.060
 is that they were compressed and well that 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.560
 it made people also dedicate themselves to 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.350
 this medicinal item and to the item also 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.570
 this from spices like oregano 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.310
 that we also have in the area and good 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.690
 that made people leave a 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.030
 little bit 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.280
 the sugar cane without neglecting him 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.800
 we always say without neglecting the corn 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.480
 the cassava on the other the villa 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.340

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.500
 the inhabitants of the area that was 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.650
 working on the harvest of the rose 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.650
 mosqueta 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.400
 important 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:38.850
 is memory juices because despite 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.850
 the failures of the listeners 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:47.190
 of 70,000 in montevideo juan 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.190
 that is the question 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.840
 teacher 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:20.920
