and what I noticed yesterday when I was
trading<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> picked<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.520> quite<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> few

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
trading was that I picked up quite a few

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.360 
trading was that I picked up quite a few
surgery<00:00:33.390> round<00:00:33.660> masses<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.170> right<00:00:35.130> wing-back

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
surgery round masses in right wing-back

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.340 
surgery round masses in right wing-back
and<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.480> they<00:00:36.630> were<00:00:36.690> also<00:00:36.899> five<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> back

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and that they were also five the back

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.990 
and that they were also five the back
row<00:00:37.530> missions<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.040> regardless<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.730> i

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
row missions but regardless of that i

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360 
row missions but regardless of that i
noticed<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.660> i<00:00:39.899> would<00:00:40.290> pick<00:00:40.469> them<00:00:40.620> up<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
noticed that i would pick them up in a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.970 
noticed that i would pick them up in a
different<00:00:41.700> position<00:00:41.969> other<00:00:42.510> than<00:00:42.770> right<00:00:43.770> back

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
different position other than right back

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.850 
different position other than right back
so<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:44.940> i<00:00:44.969> did<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.239> i<00:00:45.480> thought<00:00:45.989> hey<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.739> know

with the person a couple hours before

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.400 
with the person a couple hours before
because<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.940> never<00:02:27.120> know<00:02:27.270> could<00:02:28.140> crash<00:02:28.380> at

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410

and yeah it was a productive day really
of<00:03:26.010> trading<00:03:26.580> even<00:03:26.970> though<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:27.510> didn't<00:03:27.750> have

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
of trading even though I didn't have

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.300 
of trading even though I didn't have
long<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.110> spend<00:03:28.440> at<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:28.769> yeah<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.100> is<00:03:29.280> a

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
long to spend at it so yeah this is a

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.949 
long to spend at it so yeah this is a
good<00:03:29.489> technique<00:03:29.700> overall<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:30.750> what<00:03:30.870> I've

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
good technique overall but what I've

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.080 
good technique overall but what I've
done<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.380> popped<00:03:31.680> all<00:03:31.860> them<00:03:32.250> up<00:03:32.430> into<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
done is I popped all them up into the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.400 
done is I popped all them up into the
tray<00:03:33.269> apart<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.870> see<00:03:34.019> here<00:03:34.260> that

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
tray apart and you can see here that

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.009 
tray apart and you can see here that
they<00:03:34.920> all<00:03:35.130> sold<00:03:35.489> within<00:03:35.850> i<00:03:36.239> think<00:03:36.600> was<00:03:36.720> three

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
they all sold within i think was three

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.840 
they all sold within i think was three
hours<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.440> took<00:03:37.560> for<00:03:37.800> all<00:03:37.860> them<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.160> sell<00:03:38.340> but

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
hours it took for all them to sell but

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.009 
hours it took for all them to sell but
yeah<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.060> can<00:03:39.180> see<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.330> prices<00:03:39.660> they're

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
yeah you can see the prices they're

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.160 
yeah you can see the prices they're
probably<00:03:40.620> my<00:03:41.070> best<00:03:41.400> cell<00:03:41.880> was<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.870> schneider

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
probably my best cell was the schneider

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.990 
probably my best cell was the schneider
here<00:03:43.560> for<00:03:43.980> thirty<00:03:44.160> thousand<00:03:44.580> i<00:03:44.640> picked<00:03:44.850> him<00:03:44.970> up

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
here for thirty thousand i picked him up

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.350 
here for thirty thousand i picked him up
for<00:03:45.209> 20k<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.350> again<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.709> was<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:46.860> massive<00:03:47.549> that

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
for 20k so again that was a massive that

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.699 
for 20k so again that was a massive that
was<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> massive<00:03:48.989> pick<00:03:49.170> up<00:03:49.320> there<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:49.620> yeah

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
was a massive pick up there but yeah

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.110 
was a massive pick up there but yeah
that's<00:03:49.920> pretty<00:03:50.160> much<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.430> for<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.790> at

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
that's pretty much it for this at

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.509 
that's pretty much it for this at
training<00:03:51.510> technique<00:03:52.080> you<00:03:52.560> can<00:03:52.590> see<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:52.890> i<00:03:53.100> am

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
training technique you can see that i am

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.240 
training technique you can see that i am
adapting<00:03:54.299> as<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:55.049> episodes<00:03:55.500> go<00:03:55.650> on<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:56.070> i'm
