00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
the M 200 intervention the SRR 61 is

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.999 
the M 200 intervention the SRR 61 is
counted<00:00:12.840> by<00:00:12.990> many<00:00:13.200> as<00:00:13.410> one<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.769> best

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009

bolt-action<00:00:14.610> snipers<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.299> game

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
bolt-action snipers in the game

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.240 
bolt-action snipers in the game
so<00:00:15.960> let's<00:00:16.139> jump<00:00:16.350> straight<00:00:16.500> into<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> stats

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
so let's jump straight into the stats

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.090 
so let's jump straight into the stats
and<00:00:17.430> figure<00:00:17.670> out<00:00:17.789> why<00:00:18.289> along<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> m98b

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and figure out why along with the m98b

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.700 
and figure out why along with the m98b
in<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> 338<00:00:21.240> recon<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.080> interventions

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
in the 338 recon the interventions

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.500 
in the 338 recon the interventions
damage<00:00:23.039> model<00:00:23.369> starts<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> hundred<00:00:23.910> damage

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.179 
damage model starts at a hundred damage
which<00:00:24.750> starts<00:00:25.109> dropping<00:00:25.350> off<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.830> twelve

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
which starts dropping off at twelve

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.070 
which starts dropping off at twelve
point<00:00:26.460> five<00:00:26.640> meters<00:00:27.119> until<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.750> reaches<00:00:28.050> its

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
point five meters until it reaches its

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.470 
point five meters until it reaches its
minimum<00:00:28.590> damage<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:29.130> 59<00:00:29.730> at<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.150> hundred<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
minimum damage of 59 at one hundred and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.870 
minimum damage of 59 at one hundred and
fifty<00:00:30.750> meters<00:00:30.949> all<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.189> other<00:00:32.309> bolt-action

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
fifty meters all the other bolt-action

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.700 
fifty meters all the other bolt-action
sniper<00:00:32.910> rifles<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.780> Recon<00:00:34.170> class<00:00:34.320> reach

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
sniper rifles in the Recon class reach

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.530 
sniper rifles in the Recon class reach
their<00:00:34.950> minimum<00:00:35.250> damage<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> hundred<00:00:36.090> meters

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
their minimum damage at a hundred meters

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.690 
their minimum damage at a hundred meters
so<00:00:36.960> having<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.290> extra<00:00:37.829> reach<00:00:38.040> will<00:00:38.309> result

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
so having this extra reach will result

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.729 
so having this extra reach will result

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.310 
these weapons should really only be used
when<00:04:41.730> you're<00:04:41.850> expecting<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.480> engage<00:04:42.810> targets

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
when you're expecting to engage targets

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.320 
when you're expecting to engage targets
are<00:04:43.470> greater<00:04:43.770> than<00:04:43.890> 200<00:04:44.490> meters<00:04:44.790> because<00:04:45.150> this

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
are greater than 200 meters because this

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.850 
are greater than 200 meters because this
is<00:04:45.630> where<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.930> lower<00:04:46.110> bullet<00:04:46.470> drop<00:04:46.680> will

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
is where the lower bullet drop will

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.310 
is where the lower bullet drop will
become<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.130> huge<00:04:47.400> advantage<00:04:47.810> all<00:04:48.810> of<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.170> other

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
become a huge advantage all of the other

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.990 
become a huge advantage all of the other
bolt<00:04:49.590> actions<00:04:50.040> are<00:04:50.220> more<00:04:50.340> than<00:04:50.490> capable<00:04:50.700> of

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
bolt actions are more than capable of

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.820 
bolt actions are more than capable of
hitting<00:04:51.180> targets<00:04:51.690> at<00:04:51.840> under<00:04:52.110> this<00:04:52.260> range<00:04:52.530> and

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
hitting targets at under this range and

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.650 
hitting targets at under this range and
are<00:04:53.220> also<00:04:53.340> better<00:04:53.670> suited<00:04:53.970> for<00:04:54.090> more<00:04:54.390> closer

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
are also better suited for more closer

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.930 
are also better suited for more closer
range<00:04:54.990> targets<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:56.040> they're<00:04:56.220> really<00:04:56.520> probably

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
range targets so they're really probably

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.000 
range targets so they're really probably
better<00:04:57.150> choices<00:04:57.480> for<00:04:57.810> ranges<00:04:58.200> within<00:04:58.380> 50<00:04:58.860> to

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
better choices for ranges within 50 to

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.580 
better choices for ranges within 50 to
150<00:04:59.610> meters<00:05:00.020> just<00:05:01.020> remember<00:05:01.410> though<00:05:01.560> that

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
150 meters just remember though that

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.200 
150 meters just remember though that
while<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.070> intervention<00:05:02.640> will<00:05:02.700> make<00:05:02.910> hitting

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
while the intervention will make hitting

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.180 
while the intervention will make hitting
long-range<00:05:03.570> targets<00:05:04.050> easier<00:05:04.410> it's<00:05:04.860> not<00:05:05.040> going

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
long-range targets easier it's not going

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.890 
long-range targets easier it's not going
to<00:05:05.250> make<00:05:05.370> you<00:05:05.550> a<00:05:05.580> better<00:05:05.790> sniper<00:05:05.970> so<00:05:06.480> don't<00:05:06.810> be

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
to make you a better sniper so don't be

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.330 
to make you a better sniper so don't be
surprised<00:05:07.320> if<00:05:07.500> you're<00:05:07.650> missing<00:05:07.920> nine<00:05:08.130> out<00:05:08.310> of

ten shots at ranges over 200 meters to
begin<00:05:11.250> with<00:05:11.430> you'll<00:05:11.850> need<00:05:12.060> a<00:05:12.090> lot<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.330> practice

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
begin with you'll need a lot of practice

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
you do start learning these long range

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.870 
you do start learning these long range
headshots<00:05:16.800> though<00:05:17.070> I'm<00:05:17.310> sure<00:05:17.550> you'll<00:05:17.730> have<00:05:17.850> a

nothing<00:05:19.740> quite<00:05:19.860> as<00:05:19.980> rewarding<00:05:20.550> as<00:05:20.670> locking

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
nothing quite as rewarding as locking

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.640 
nothing quite as rewarding as locking
down<00:05:21.150> an<00:05:21.330> enemy<00:05:21.480> team<00:05:21.870> with<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.080> bolt-action
