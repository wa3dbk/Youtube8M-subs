so<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.329> why<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.540> example<00:00:42.900> we<00:00:43.739> were<00:00:43.860> on

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
so that is why for example we were on

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.500 
so that is why for example we were on
the<00:00:44.129> North<00:00:44.340> Face<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.879> tour<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.239> last
