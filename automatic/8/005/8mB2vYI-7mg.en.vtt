00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
charger if you look at the Challenger we

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.540 
charger if you look at the Challenger we
were<00:00:36.289> very<00:00:36.500> careful<00:00:36.920> to<00:00:37.190> make<00:00:37.429> an

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
were very careful to make an

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.160 
were very careful to make an
evolutionary<00:00:38.329> change<00:00:38.629> on<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:38.870> exterior

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
evolutionary change on the exterior

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.849 
evolutionary change on the exterior
design

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
design

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.799 
design
well<00:00:40.190> we<00:00:40.309> flipped<00:00:40.609> that<00:00:40.730> script<00:00:41.210> on<00:00:41.449> the

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
well we flipped that script on the

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.299 
well we flipped that script on the
charger<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:42.410> we<00:00:42.710> actually<00:00:42.920> went<00:00:43.249> very

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
charger and we actually went very

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.279 
charger and we actually went very
aggressive<00:00:44.089> with<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.329> exterior<00:00:44.629> design<00:00:44.929> and

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
aggressive with the exterior design and

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.790 
aggressive with the exterior design and
changed<00:00:45.949> almost<00:00:46.339> every<00:00:46.760> panel<00:00:47.149> my<00:00:47.749> goal<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.440> I

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
changed almost every panel my goal and I

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.470 
changed almost every panel my goal and I
think<00:00:49.010> our<00:00:49.129> designers<00:00:49.670> goals<00:00:49.940> were<00:00:50.179> to<00:00:50.239> make

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
think our designers goals were to make

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.319 
think our designers goals were to make
the<00:00:50.629> car<00:00:50.839> more<00:00:51.050> sculptural<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.039> I'd<00:00:52.940> like<00:00:53.179> to

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
the car more sculptural and I'd like to

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.630 
the car more sculptural and I'd like to
say<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.629> words<00:00:53.780> sinuous<00:00:54.409> which<00:00:54.710> is<00:00:54.980> basically

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
say the words sinuous which is basically

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.700 
say the words sinuous which is basically
put<00:00:55.850> more<00:00:56.059> curves<00:00:56.420> in<00:00:56.659> it<00:00:56.780> today's<00:00:57.170> car<00:00:57.499> is

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
put more curves in it today's car is

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.599 
put more curves in it today's car is
very<00:00:58.010> curvy<00:00:58.550> we<00:00:59.420> were<00:00:59.510> able<00:00:59.659> to<00:01:00.609> exaggerate

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
very curvy we were able to exaggerate

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.759 
very curvy we were able to exaggerate
some<00:01:01.879> of<00:01:01.999> the<00:01:02.059> curves<00:01:02.359> on<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.170> the

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
some of the curves on the the

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.860 
some of the curves on the the
coke-bottle<00:01:04.010> styling<00:01:04.610> if<00:01:04.970> you<00:01:05.089> will<00:01:05.300> from<00:01:05.780> a

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
coke-bottle styling if you will from a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.200 
coke-bottle styling if you will from a
side<00:01:06.080> view<00:01:06.110> of<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.530> car<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.040> then<00:01:07.790> on<00:01:08.090> the

hood<00:01:08.420> especially<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:09.290> went<00:01:09.560> away<00:01:09.650> from<00:01:10.040> the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
hood especially we went away from the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.310 
hood especially we went away from the
predominantly<00:01:11.000> high<00:01:11.330> central<00:01:11.870> mounted

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
of an even brow on it so the car

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.390 
of an even brow on it so the car
actually<00:01:17.720> almost<00:01:17.990> has<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> more<00:01:18.860> muscle<00:01:19.220> car

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.840 
of chargers so from our entry price
point<00:02:14.690> all<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> way<00:02:14.960> on<00:02:15.170> up<00:02:15.310> big<00:02:16.310> gauges<00:02:16.730> so

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
point all the way on up big gauges so

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.330 
point all the way on up big gauges so
we've<00:02:16.970> got<00:02:17.120> two<00:02:17.330> large<00:02:17.780> big<00:02:18.170> big<00:02:18.770> radial

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.730 
gauges and then the other technology
piece<00:02:21.320> is<00:02:21.590> our<00:02:21.830> 8.4<00:02:22.670> inch<00:02:22.700> touchscreen<00:02:23.740> but

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
piece is our 8.4 inch touchscreen but

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.350 
piece is our 8.4 inch touchscreen but
also<00:02:25.040> one<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.340> things<00:02:25.460> that's<00:02:25.700> new<00:02:25.970> for

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
also one of the things that's new for

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.630 
also one of the things that's new for
for<00:02:26.840> charger<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.440> our<00:02:27.800> performance<00:02:28.250> pages

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
for charger is our performance pages

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.660 
for charger is our performance pages
which<00:02:29.360> used<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.960> be<00:02:30.110> an<00:02:30.200> only<00:02:30.380> SRT<00:02:31.070> exclusive
