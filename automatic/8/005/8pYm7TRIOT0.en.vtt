 Well, here I am reading with this 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.130
 device to the kindle white paper that is 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.190
 a pretty electronic ink book 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.480
 versatile and quite practical I'm going to 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.680
 teaching has some characteristics 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.199
 quite interesting for whoever 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.029
 especially like to carry books and read 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.029
 read read and nothing else to read 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 as you can see is an ink reader 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.260
 electronic as many of those that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.480
 there is quite comfortable and practical 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.970
 for the eyes it does not tire 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.989
 nothing because the screen is not bright 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.800
 and not only do we have the possibility of 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.790
 read the books that we have inside the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.829
 device as we can see in these 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:07.549
 moments but we can also access 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.640
 outside of what is the device to the 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:14.270
 that is, we can buy books with 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.799
 for example a tablet of another type already 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.039
 be it orroid or an ipad we can 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.500
 buy books at the amazon store 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.659
 those books will be stored in 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.240
 the cloud so that whenever 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.520
 we want to recover them 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.310
 we will be able to read inside this 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:46.009
 device because it has the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:47.899
 wifi connection quality thanks to the 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.630
 wifi connection we can also access from 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.640
 Direct way to the Amazon store and 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.430
 buy a book buy a book or 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 look for something that interests us 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.740
 in that store instantly does not matter where 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.290

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.830
 Wi-Fi connection other things that we 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.200
 You may be interested in this book 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.690
 electronic is that it contains a browser 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.270
 experimental internet is not 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.890
 got everything and that's what we're 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.430
 used to see for example in the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.620
 tablets but to be a device 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.840
 electronic ink is already good for us because 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.340
 allows us for example to access the 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.040
 news 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.750

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.080
 good lets us get out of the way 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.400

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.790

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.670
