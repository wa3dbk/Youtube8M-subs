00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 today decided to write a review of this 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.750
 toys for children like living sand 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.059
 here are many asking the question and what is it 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.099
 in general is and how it looks like it 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.670
 to the touch 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:21.000
 here and here I wanted to show what it is 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.789
 This is certainly hard to explain 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.949
 try to tell the maximum how 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.439
 he looks right here with us now 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.150
 container 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.239
 one and a half kilograms you set 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.309
 sand here that is well here so 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.050
 looks like one and a half kilogram many 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.870
 ask how much does it say that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.530
 one and a half kilograms that is by itself 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.230
 living sand is such a mass it is very 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.719
 nice to touch and want straight 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.480
 constantly touch knead there do different 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.899
 different things from him ie you can 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.250
 separate divide as you like and he 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.159
 takes any form here but 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.290
 while it is also easy to crumble 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:13.340
 Here that is, I always explain to people 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.659
 what is it like dough 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.810
 with cotton that's something like that 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.780
 there is a very nice and soft thing which 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.170
 practically does not stick to hands 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.750
 there are some elements but mostly not 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.250
 stick to your hands here and he is very good 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.890
 holds the form that is we can from it 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.280
 there is anything to drink and he basically 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.649
 not crumbled me too asked a question 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.649
 what is it possible there to blind the castle from him and 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.229
 anything well I certainly haven't tried but 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.420
 I think that you can blind him 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.989
 Generally anything, that is, he will lie 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.459
 hold any shape of any height and 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:02:02.030
 difficulty here is the day kids really like 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:04.329
 play with him because I will show you 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.709
 molds 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.709
 that's how it keeps its shape 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.540
 we have a form of a turtle that is well here 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.359
 the mold turned out and here it is dense 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.319
 that is, it is not directly falling apart when 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:39.140
 pressed of course he splits here 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:40.299
 once again, that is to say , so incomprehensible 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.370
 weight 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.799
 which is very hard to explain and with 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.189
 something concrete to compare practically 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.709
 impossible that is it and wanga really 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:03:00.290
 feel here we still have a mold 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:03:06.579
 stars that is here it keeps 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:10.220
 principle dense pretty strong 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.470
 Well, well, in principle, living sand 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.010
 you can blind anything at all that is 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.010
 he keeps his shape he doesn't fall apart and 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.859
 I repeat once again that very pleasant on 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.440
 touch and it is very convenient to collect 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.169
 if there somewhere 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:34.489
 waking up something you just take 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:38.750
 a piece of sand and a hedgehog here you collect 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:42.799
 fine these are all the pieces small he on 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:48.280
 collects itself like a magnet that is 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.280
 clean it too is very simple here 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.859
 that is, when the child starts to do 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.549
 some form of it then its just not 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.719
 tear off this sand and he can sit 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.230
 for hours 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:07.250
 as they say to dream with it 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.760
 here it comes in three 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:14.060
 kinds of 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:16.359
 this is 750 grams and a half kilograms and 4 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.579
 kilogram here I repeat that 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.430
 Now the form we poured out exactly 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.400
 one and a half kilo set 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.690
 here you can see how much it is 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:33.020
 about here he comes in such 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:38.380
 Packages, that is, this set of 750 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:42.740
 gram here its completeness goes 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:47.240
 instruction goes a few paddles and 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:49.940
 knocks 3 blades and a roller 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.039
 vpis this center but he is here 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.229
 is in vacuum packaging i.e. 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:58.970
 when you open it he will increase 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:02.570
 this is two and a half times this is a conflict 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:09.889
 one and a half pound and a half in this 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:12.949
 set 750 750 grams that's basically 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.979
 in the same box it is only written that 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.590
 one and a half kilograms is set and a half 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:22.909
 Kirovka Poltava and a half kilogram and 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:25.970
 he has such a briquette without a shovel 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.620
 some pure sand goes and that's it 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.530
 also only increase somewhere in 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.150
 one and a half to two times after unpacking 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:38.560
 have he gets air and and 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:41.570
 becomes twice the composition 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.530
 composition of the most lively sand it goes itself 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:48.259
 sand and ground with a shell rock plus 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.240
 Organic oils are completely all 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.460
 natural eco- friendly and 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.729
 safe meaning your baby can 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.729
 play 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:02.889
 with this this game without any problems and 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.320
 it will be completely harmless well in 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:10.870
 Basically, all that we are at the moment 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:14.080
 we can say about living sand 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.050
 that living sand in general is a new thing on 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.160
 the Russian market and literally there for three months 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.229
 back we just had well all those 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:28.210
 customers who bought sand from us 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:31.690
 very happy and they are not children very well in 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:35.039
 he is played here is the bulk says 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.039
 that the child does not tear
