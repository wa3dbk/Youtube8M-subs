00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
we're all safer we're ready to begin if

we're all safer we're ready to begin if
we<00:00:40.230> flip<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> MacBook<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:41.820> can

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
we flip the MacBook over so that we can

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.880 
we flip the MacBook over so that we can
see<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> bottom<00:00:42.570> panel<00:00:42.719> you'll<00:00:43.469> see<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
see the bottom panel you'll see that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.650 
see the bottom panel you'll see that
there<00:00:44.010> are<00:00:44.040> 10<00:00:44.370> screws<00:00:44.670> keeping<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.420> place

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
there are 10 screws keeping it in place

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
there are 10 screws keeping it in place
to<00:00:46.200> remove<00:00:46.500> them<00:00:46.710> you'll<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> Phillips

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
to remove them you'll need a Phillips

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.670 
to remove them you'll need a Phillips
number<00:00:47.730> double<00:00:48.180> zero<00:00:48.210> screwdriver<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.469> three

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
number double zero screwdriver the three

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.319 
number double zero screwdriver the three
screws<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> top<00:00:50.250> rates<00:00:50.670> are<00:00:50.850> considerably

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
screws on the top rates are considerably

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.240 
screws on the top rates are considerably
longer<00:00:51.600> than<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.899> rest<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> good<00:00:53.190> idea

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
longer than the rest so it's a good idea

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.189 
longer than the rest so it's a good idea
to<00:00:53.730> lay<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.910> screws<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.449> around<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> muffler

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
to lay the screws out around the muffler

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.130 
to lay the screws out around the muffler
so<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.980> don't<00:00:56.129> mix<00:00:56.309> them<00:00:56.430> off<00:00:56.809> remove<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
so you don't mix them off remove all of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.810 
so you don't mix them off remove all of
the<00:00:58.260> screws<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:58.739> simply<00:00:59.100> lift<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> panel<00:00:59.670> up

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the screws then simply lift the panel up

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.690 
the screws then simply lift the panel up
to<00:01:00.210> reveal<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> MacBooks<00:01:01.020> internal

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.130 

the<00:01:05.700> round<00:01:05.940> can<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.330> found<00:01:06.540> near<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> center

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the round can be found near the center

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
the round can be found near the center
right<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> MacBook<00:01:08.060> which<00:01:09.060> will<00:01:09.300> be
