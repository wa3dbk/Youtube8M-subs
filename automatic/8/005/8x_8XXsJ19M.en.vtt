the<00:01:59.060> way<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.480> top<00:01:59.690> because<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.410> lapel

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
the way to the top because the lapel

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.880 
the way to the top because the lapel
sticks<00:02:01.070> over<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.550> card<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:02.680> want<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.740> make<00:02:03.860> sure

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
sticks over the card I want to make sure

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.390 
sticks over the card I want to make sure
that<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.730> edges<00:02:05.210> are<00:02:06.080> secured<00:02:06.560> really<00:02:07.220> well

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
that the edges are secured really well

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.480 
that the edges are secured really well
so<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.670> use<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.850> little<00:02:07.970> glue<00:02:08.180> pen<00:02:08.479> as<00:02:08.600> well<00:02:09.490> so

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
so I use a little glue pen as well so

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.760

put<00:02:11.210> that<00:02:11.360> up<00:02:11.450> at<00:02:11.570> the<00:02:11.600> top<00:02:11.690> as<00:02:12.320> I<00:02:12.470> mentioned

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
put that up at the top as I mentioned

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.740 
put that up at the top as I mentioned

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
before leaving room for the lapels and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.090
