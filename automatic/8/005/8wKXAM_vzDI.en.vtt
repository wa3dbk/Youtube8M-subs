00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
newcomers I am carnage to the Creator

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.890 
newcomers I am carnage to the Creator
and<00:00:10.129> today<00:00:11.029> I'm<00:00:11.299> gonna<00:00:11.389> be<00:00:11.510> showing<00:00:11.539> you<00:00:11.869> guys

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
and today I'm gonna be showing you guys

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.769 
and today I'm gonna be showing you guys
something<00:00:12.320> absolutely<00:00:12.949> awesome<00:00:13.549> this<00:00:14.420> is<00:00:14.600> how

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:14.779 
something absolutely awesome this is how

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.260 
something absolutely awesome this is how
you<00:00:14.840> can<00:00:15.109> actually<00:00:15.320> put<00:00:15.740> any<00:00:16.010> slab<00:00:16.460> on<00:00:16.730> top<00:00:17.090> of

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
you can actually put any slab on top of

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.900 
you can actually put any slab on top of
any<00:00:17.509> other<00:00:17.900> slab<00:00:18.349> so<00:00:18.890> basically<00:00:19.369> you<00:00:19.580> can<00:00:19.730> have

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
any other slab so basically you can have

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.599 
any other slab so basically you can have
a<00:00:19.939> full<00:00:20.480> block<00:00:20.929> that<00:00:21.499> looks<00:00:21.800> like<00:00:22.009> it<00:00:22.160> is<00:00:22.249> made

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
a full block that looks like it is made

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.480 
a full block that looks like it is made
out<00:00:22.820> of<00:00:22.880> two<00:00:23.330> different<00:00:23.689> slabs<00:00:24.230> now<00:00:24.859> this<00:00:25.249> is

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
out of two different slabs now this is

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.269 
out of two different slabs now this is
actually<00:00:25.699> a<00:00:25.999> very<00:00:26.599> interesting<00:00:27.439> trick<00:00:27.740> it's

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
actually a very interesting trick it's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.550 
actually a very interesting trick it's
not<00:00:28.699> like<00:00:29.300> a<00:00:29.329> glitch<00:00:29.779> or<00:00:29.929> anything<00:00:30.259> these<00:00:30.409> are

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
not like a glitch or anything these are

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.790 
not like a glitch or anything these are
not<00:00:30.710> actually<00:00:31.609> blocks<00:00:32.029> but<00:00:32.720> basically<00:00:33.020> the

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
not actually blocks but basically the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.560 
not actually blocks but basically the
way<00:00:34.010> this<00:00:34.220> works<00:00:34.490> is<00:00:34.700> if<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.060> want<00:00:35.300> to<00:00:35.420> have

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
way this works is if you want to have

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.750 
way this works is if you want to have
this<00:00:35.780> kind<00:00:35.990> of<00:00:36.140> effect<00:00:36.290> you're<00:00:37.100> going<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.610> have

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
this kind of effect you're going to have

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.670 
this kind of effect you're going to have
to<00:00:37.970> build<00:00:38.270> a<00:00:38.360> whole<00:00:38.600> map<00:00:38.930> kind<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.410> based

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
to build a whole map kind of based

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.980 
to build a whole map kind of based
around<00:00:39.950> this<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:40.640> for<00:00:41.210> example<00:00:41.330> what<00:00:41.870> you

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
around this so for example what you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.840 
around this so for example what you
start<00:00:42.260> out<00:00:42.380> with<00:00:42.530> is<00:00:42.590> you<00:00:42.920> start<00:00:43.370> out<00:00:43.640> with

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
start out with is you start out with

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.940 
start out with is you start out with
actual<00:00:44.300> slabs<00:00:44.630> here<00:00:44.900> so<00:00:45.350> if<00:00:45.470> we<00:00:45.620> were<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:45.710> grab

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
actual slabs here so if we were to grab

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.160 
actual slabs here so if we were to grab
a<00:00:46.220> normal<00:00:46.640> life<00:00:46.790> let's<00:00:47.030> grab<00:00:47.300> let's<00:00:47.930> just<00:00:48.050> say

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
a normal life let's grab let's just say

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.540 
a normal life let's grab let's just say
our<00:00:48.200> silverfish<00:00:48.830> skull<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.190> I<00:00:49.250> was<00:00:49.370> messing

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
our silverfish skull and I was messing

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.390 
our silverfish skull and I was messing
around<00:00:49.700> with<00:00:49.940> earlier<00:00:50.230> as<00:00:51.230> you<00:00:51.440> can<00:00:51.530> tell<00:00:51.590> this

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
around with earlier as you can tell this

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.360 
around with earlier as you can tell this
is<00:00:52.700> just<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.150> slab<00:00:53.510> this<00:00:53.810> is<00:00:53.990> not<00:00:54.290> even<00:00:55.010> with<00:00:55.250> an

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
is just a slab this is not even with an

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.370 
is just a slab this is not even with an
actual<00:00:55.820> block<00:00:56.150> however<00:00:56.750> if<00:00:56.990> you<00:00:57.110> were<00:00:57.200> to

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
actual block however if you were to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.790 
actual block however if you were to
build<00:00:57.680> an<00:00:57.860> entire<00:00:58.460> like<00:00:59.450> map<00:00:59.840> made<00:01:00.320> out<00:01:00.620> of

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
build an entire like map made out of

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.100 
build an entire like map made out of
slabs<00:01:01.130> no<00:01:01.700> one<00:01:01.850> would<00:01:02.000> ever<00:01:02.060> know<00:01:02.450> that<00:01:02.900> this

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
slabs no one would ever know that this

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.719 
slabs no one would ever know that this
is<00:01:03.350> actually<00:01:03.560> slabs<00:01:04.100> they<00:01:04.280> would<00:01:04.430> think<00:01:04.610> it's

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
is actually slabs they would think it's

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.060 
is actually slabs they would think it's
actually<00:01:04.909> playing<00:01:05.329> or<00:01:05.479> whatever<00:01:05.689> but<00:01:06.320> anyways

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
actually playing or whatever but anyways

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.489 
actually playing or whatever but anyways
the<00:01:07.700> way<00:01:07.909> this<00:01:08.179> is<00:01:08.390> really<00:01:08.749> really<00:01:09.109> really

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:09.499 
the way this is really really really

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.889 
the way this is really really really
cool<00:01:09.859> is<00:01:10.249> that<00:01:10.310> what<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:10.909> can<00:01:11.030> actually<00:01:11.179> do<00:01:11.600> is

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
cool is that what you can actually do is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.749 
cool is that what you can actually do is
you<00:01:12.020> can<00:01:12.170> break<00:01:12.560> one<00:01:12.799> of<00:01:12.829> these<00:01:13.070> slabs<00:01:13.340> and

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
you can break one of these slabs and

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.700 
you can break one of these slabs and
then<00:01:13.909> you<00:01:13.969> can<00:01:14.090> place<00:01:14.390> let's<00:01:14.719> say<00:01:15.049> let's<00:01:15.560> say

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
then you can place let's say let's say

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.499 
then you can place let's say let's say
we<00:01:15.770> wanted<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:15.979> use<00:01:16.039> quartz<00:01:16.609> we<00:01:17.030> can<00:01:17.179> actually

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
we wanted to use quartz we can actually

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.700 
we wanted to use quartz we can actually
put<00:01:17.689> it<00:01:17.780> like<00:01:17.899> that<00:01:17.929> and<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.409> looks<00:01:18.590> like

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
put it like that and that looks like

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.469 
put it like that and that looks like
it's<00:01:18.859> just<00:01:19.039> one<00:01:19.369> slab<00:01:19.700> sitting<00:01:20.060> on<00:01:20.179> the<00:01:20.270> ground

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
it's just one slab sitting on the ground

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.779 
it's just one slab sitting on the ground
and<00:01:20.780> then<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.289> can<00:01:21.439> put<00:01:21.590> any<00:01:21.829> other<00:01:22.219> block<00:01:22.609> on

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
and then you can put any other block on

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.489 
and then you can put any other block on
top<00:01:22.819> of<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:23.210> now<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:23.689> reason<00:01:23.929> this<00:01:24.200> works

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
top of this now the reason this works

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.919 
top of this now the reason this works
again<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.130> because<00:01:25.280> you're<00:01:25.640> not<00:01:25.909> actually<00:01:26.270> in

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
again is because you're not actually in

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.840 
again is because you're not actually in
level<00:01:27.319> with<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.069> you're<00:01:28.189> not<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.549> level

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
level with this so you're not in level

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.279 
level with this so you're not in level
with<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:29.030> normal<00:01:29.329> block<00:01:29.509> therefore<00:01:30.139> you're

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
with the normal block therefore you're

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.899 
with the normal block therefore you're
not<00:01:30.439> actually<00:01:30.710> trying<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:31.100> put<00:01:31.280> slabs<00:01:31.579> on<00:01:31.819> the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
not actually trying to put slabs on the

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.270 
not actually trying to put slabs on the
exact<00:01:32.270> same<00:01:32.509> block<00:01:32.689> but<00:01:33.350> nonetheless<00:01:33.649> I<00:01:34.100> just

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
exact same block but nonetheless I just

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.739 
exact same block but nonetheless I just
thought<00:01:34.399> this<00:01:34.579> trick<00:01:34.819> was<00:01:34.999> really<00:01:35.509> really

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
thought this trick was really really

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:37.510 
thought this trick was really really
cool<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:36.319> it<00:01:36.499> gives<00:01:36.679> you<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.799> nice<00:01:37.159> visual

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
cool and it gives you a nice visual

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.309 
cool and it gives you a nice visual
effect<00:01:37.999> that<00:01:38.149> otherwise<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.869> normally

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
effect that otherwise you normally

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.230 
effect that otherwise you normally
wouldn't<00:01:39.499> see<00:01:39.679> in<00:01:39.950> maps<00:01:40.159> I<00:01:40.429> think<00:01:40.909> it<00:01:40.999> would<00:01:41.119> be

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
wouldn't see in maps I think it would be
