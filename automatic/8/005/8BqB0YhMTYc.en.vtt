00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
what was happening there I mean now that

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.160 
what was happening there I mean now that
the<00:00:38.820> puck<00:00:39.030> could<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:39.390> lit<00:00:39.629> him<00:00:39.719> up<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the puck could just lit him up and

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
the puck could just lit him up and
there's<00:00:40.410> really<00:00:40.530> no<00:00:40.680> other<00:00:40.710> way<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> put<00:00:41.040> it

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
