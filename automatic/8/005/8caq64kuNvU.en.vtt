00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.769 
again and today we're going to take a
look<00:00:22.160> at<00:00:22.310> a<00:00:22.340> two-player<00:00:22.880> abstract<00:00:23.450> called

look at a two-player abstract called

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.900 
look at a two-player abstract called
Fibonacci<00:00:24.470> now<00:00:24.890> this<00:00:25.099> has<00:00:25.279> nothing<00:00:25.670> to<00:00:25.699> do

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
Fibonacci now this has nothing to do

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.109 
Fibonacci now this has nothing to do

going to be a two-player abstract in

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:33.970 
going to be a two-player abstract in
which<00:00:33.110> you're<00:00:33.260> moving<00:00:33.530> around<00:00:33.620> different

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.740 
which you're moving around different
types<00:00:34.160> of<00:00:34.460> pieces<00:00:34.850> in<00:00:35.059> order<00:00:35.449> to<00:00:35.540> try<00:00:35.720> and

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
types of pieces in order to try and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.330 
types of pieces in order to try and
completely<00:00:36.170> surround<00:00:36.500> your<00:00:36.710> opponents<00:00:37.129> main

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
completely surround your opponents main

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.549 
completely surround your opponents main
piece<00:00:37.699> real<00:00:38.629> quick<00:00:38.870> we'll<00:00:39.019> take<00:00:39.170> a<00:00:39.199> look<00:00:39.440> at

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
piece real quick we'll take a look at

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.560 
piece real quick we'll take a look at
what's<00:00:39.890> inside<00:00:40.309> this<00:00:40.550> box<00:00:40.610> and<00:00:41.150> how<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.300> game

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
what's inside this box and how the game

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.299 
what's inside this box and how the game
plays<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.170> then<00:00:42.650> we'll<00:00:42.769> come<00:00:42.920> back<00:00:42.949> here<00:00:43.100> and

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
plays and then we'll come back here and

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.750 
plays and then we'll come back here and
we'll<00:00:43.400> get<00:00:43.519> my<00:00:43.610> final<00:00:43.970> thoughts<00:00:44.180> on<00:00:44.390> Fibonacci

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
we'll get my final thoughts on Fibonacci

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.979 
we'll get my final thoughts on Fibonacci
so<00:00:46.760> here<00:00:46.970> you<00:00:47.059> can<00:00:47.180> see<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.480> set<00:00:47.690> up<00:00:47.780> for

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
so here you can see the set up for

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.600 
so here you can see the set up for
Fibonacci<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:48.800> is<00:00:48.949> a<00:00:48.980> two-player

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
Fibonacci and this is a two-player

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.130 
Fibonacci and this is a two-player
abstract<00:00:50.269> in<00:00:50.420> which<00:00:50.539> players<00:00:50.780> are<00:00:50.870> going<00:00:51.050> to

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
abstract in which players are going to

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.750 
abstract in which players are going to
be<00:00:51.200> moving<00:00:51.710> different<00:00:52.070> pieces<00:00:52.250> around<00:00:52.520> the

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
be moving different pieces around the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.940 
be moving different pieces around the
board<00:00:52.820> in<00:00:53.270> order<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.989> try<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.410> surround<00:00:54.590> their

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
board in order to try and surround their

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.380 
board in order to try and surround their
opponents<00:00:55.340> main<00:00:55.550> piece<00:00:55.910> which<00:00:56.120> looks<00:00:56.329> like

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
opponents main piece which looks like

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.689 
opponents main piece which looks like
this<00:00:56.570> radioactive<00:00:57.289> symbol<00:00:57.500> sign<00:00:57.860> here<00:00:58.100> this

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
this radioactive symbol sign here this

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.400 
this radioactive symbol sign here this
is<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.940> only<00:00:59.090> piece<00:00:59.329> that<00:00:59.600> cannot<00:00:59.960> move<00:01:00.199> on

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
is the only piece that cannot move on

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.939 
is the only piece that cannot move on
its<00:01:00.590> own

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
its own

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.680 
its own
now<00:01:01.520> you're<00:01:01.699> going<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:02.030> move<00:01:02.149> pieces<00:01:02.420> by

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
now you're going to move pieces by

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.630 
now you're going to move pieces by
taking<00:01:03.079> actions<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.739> at<00:01:04.039> the<00:01:04.160> beginning<00:01:04.250> of

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
taking actions and at the beginning of

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.800 
taking actions and at the beginning of
the<00:01:04.729> game<00:01:04.879> each<00:01:05.059> player<00:01:05.330> is<00:01:05.420> going<00:01:05.539> to<00:01:05.660> have<00:01:05.750> a

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
the game each player is going to have a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.420 
the game each player is going to have a
different<00:01:06.080> number<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.380> actions<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:07.009> first

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
different number of actions the first

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.800 
different number of actions the first
player<00:01:07.640> will<00:01:07.789> get<00:01:07.910> one<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.300> then<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.479> second

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
player will get one and then the second

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.840 
player will get one and then the second
player<00:01:08.960> will<00:01:09.680> get<00:01:09.800> to<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.460> first<00:01:10.610> player

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
player will get to the first player

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.460 
player will get to the first player
again<00:01:11.030> will<00:01:11.180> get<00:01:11.270> three<00:01:11.570> until<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.110> count<00:01:12.320> up

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
again will get three until you count up

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.749 
again will get three until you count up
to<00:01:12.649> six<00:01:12.979> in<00:01:13.160> this<00:01:13.310> manner

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
to six in this manner

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.340 
to six in this manner
at<00:01:14.060> which<00:01:14.180> point<00:01:14.210> everyone<00:01:14.840> will<00:01:14.960> get<00:01:15.080> six

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
at which point everyone will get six

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.830 
at which point everyone will get six
actions<00:01:15.740> on<00:01:15.890> their<00:01:16.100> turn<00:01:16.340> an<00:01:16.720> action<00:01:17.720> is

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
actions on their turn an action is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.279 
actions on their turn an action is
simply<00:01:18.140> moving<00:01:18.440> a<00:01:18.830> piece<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.030> let's<00:01:20.990> say<00:01:21.170> we

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
simply moving a piece and let's say we

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.390 
simply moving a piece and let's say we
start<00:01:21.530> with<00:01:21.560> red<00:01:21.860> you're<00:01:22.039> going<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.280> have

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
start with red you're going to have

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.830 
start with red you're going to have
three<00:01:22.759> different<00:01:22.790> types<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.330> pieces<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.689> have

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
three different types of pieces you have

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.749 
three different types of pieces you have
support<00:01:24.259> pieces<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:24.830> have<00:01:24.860> strike<00:01:25.310> pieces

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
support pieces you have strike pieces

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.749 
support pieces you have strike pieces
and<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.900> have<00:01:27.080> your<00:01:27.380> main<00:01:27.590> piece<00:01:27.979> all<00:01:28.700> of

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
and you have your main piece all of

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.580 
and you have your main piece all of
these<00:01:29.180> pieces<00:01:29.420> move<00:01:29.780> in<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:29.960> same<00:01:30.110> way<00:01:30.170> except

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
these pieces move in the same way except

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.109 
these pieces move in the same way except
for<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.740> main<00:01:30.920> piece<00:01:31.220> which<00:01:31.430> can't<00:01:31.759> move<00:01:31.939> at

for the main piece which can't move at
all<00:01:32.240> but<00:01:32.509> taking<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.470> movement<00:01:33.680> action<00:01:34.100> allows

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
all but taking a movement action allows

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.679 
all but taking a movement action allows
you<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:34.490> move<00:01:34.579> one<00:01:34.820> piece<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.210> any<00:01:35.390> of<00:01:35.540> its

connected group of like pieces you can
move<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.310> piece<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.640> anywhere<00:01:41.060> along<00:01:41.479> that

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
move that piece to anywhere along that

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.749 
move that piece to anywhere along that
connected<00:01:42.409> group<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:42.860> for<00:01:43.310> example<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.700> could

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
connected group so for example I could

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.550 
connected group so for example I could
move<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.119> piece<00:01:44.329> to<00:01:44.479> any<00:01:44.659> of<00:01:44.930> these<00:01:45.020> spaces

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
move this piece to any of these spaces

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.859 
move this piece to any of these spaces
around<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:46.610> connected<00:01:47.090> group<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.659> I<00:01:47.720> could

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
around this connected group and I could

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.630 
around this connected group and I could
even<00:01:48.049> move<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.500> my<00:01:48.619> own<00:01:48.770> support<00:01:49.159> pair<00:01:49.399> my

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
even move it to my own support pair my

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.969 
even move it to my own support pair my
own<00:01:49.759> main<00:01:50.119> piece<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.899> switch<00:01:51.170> positions<00:01:51.439> with

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
own main piece to switch positions with

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.539 
own main piece to switch positions with
my<00:01:52.159> main<00:01:52.369> piece<00:01:52.960> but<00:01:53.960> let's<00:01:54.170> say<00:01:54.409> I<00:01:54.619> move<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.399> up

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
my main piece but let's say I move it up

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.370 
my main piece but let's say I move it up
to<00:01:55.759> here<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.060> that's<00:01:56.180> my<00:01:56.450> action<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.049> now

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
to here and that's my action and now

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.440 
to here and that's my action and now
Green<00:01:57.770> gets<00:01:57.979> two<00:01:58.280> actions<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.909> they're<00:01:59.270> going

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
Green gets two actions and they're going

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.090 
Green gets two actions and they're going
to<00:01:59.600> move<00:01:59.810> likewise<00:02:00.560> they're<00:02:00.799> going<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.979> move

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
to move likewise they're going to move

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.160 
to move likewise they're going to move
two<00:02:01.280> pieces<00:02:01.640> along<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.030> group<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.659> move<00:02:02.840> start

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
two pieces along the group to move start

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.069 
two pieces along the group to move start
moving<00:02:03.409> towards<00:02:03.740> my<00:02:04.070> main<00:02:04.340> piece<00:02:04.670> now<00:02:05.540> you

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
moving towards my main piece now you

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.389 
moving towards my main piece now you
also<00:02:06.259> have<00:02:06.409> these<00:02:06.590> support<00:02:06.860> pieces<00:02:07.219> and<00:02:07.340> they

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
also have these support pieces and they

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.009 
also have these support pieces and they
move<00:02:07.579> in<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.790> same<00:02:07.820> way<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:08.479> Reds<00:02:08.720> turn

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
move in the same way and it's Reds turn

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.719 
move in the same way and it's Reds turn
now<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.709> maybe<00:02:09.920> they're<00:02:10.250> going<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.579> move

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
now so maybe they're going to move

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.699 
now so maybe they're going to move
pieces<00:02:10.970> along<00:02:11.360> this<00:02:11.540> group<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:11.989> order<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.500> try

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
pieces along this group in order to try

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.270 
pieces along this group in order to try
and<00:02:12.739> extend<00:02:13.130> out<00:02:13.540> towards<00:02:14.540> green<00:02:15.019> and<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:16.100> is

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
and extend out towards green and this is

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.380 
and extend out towards green and this is
important<00:02:16.700> because<00:02:16.730> eventually<00:02:17.269> you're

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
important because eventually you're

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.280 
important because eventually you're
going<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.570> get<00:02:17.720> into<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> spot<00:02:18.049> where<00:02:18.200> you're

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
going to get into a spot where you're

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.539 
going to get into a spot where you're
going<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.500> be<00:02:18.590> interacting<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.250> now<00:02:19.340> it's

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
going to be interacting and now it's

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.000 
going to be interacting and now it's
greens<00:02:19.850> turn<00:02:20.150> I'm<00:02:20.780> green<00:02:21.049> maybe<00:02:21.260> extends<00:02:21.860> out

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
greens turn I'm green maybe extends out

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.620 
greens turn I'm green maybe extends out
further<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.519> little<00:02:22.760> bit<00:02:22.910> here<00:02:23.150> they<00:02:23.299> move<00:02:23.450> this

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
further a little bit here they move this

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.170 
further a little bit here they move this
piece<00:02:23.870> here<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.769> they<00:02:25.130> move<00:02:25.310> these<00:02:25.549> pieces<00:02:25.790> up

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
piece here and they move these pieces up

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.340 
piece here and they move these pieces up
to<00:02:26.570> get<00:02:26.720> closer<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.350> red<00:02:28.780> but<00:02:29.780> now<00:02:29.900> it's<00:02:30.109> Reds

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
to get closer to red but now it's Reds

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.300 
to get closer to red but now it's Reds
turn<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.799> they're<00:02:30.889> going<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.070> try<00:02:31.280> and

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
turn and they're going to try and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.210 
turn and they're going to try and
separate<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:31.970> group

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
separate this group

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.040 
separate this group
and<00:02:32.310> also<00:02:32.460> try<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.360> get<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.570> a<00:02:33.630> position<00:02:33.750> where

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
and also try and get to a position where

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.360 
and also try and get to a position where
they<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.230> get<00:02:34.350> their<00:02:34.500> pieces<00:02:34.770> closer<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
they can get their pieces closer to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.310 
they can get their pieces closer to
their<00:02:35.490> opponent<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.050> objective<00:02:37.050> being<00:02:37.230> to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
their opponent the objective being to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.950 
their opponent the objective being to
get<00:02:37.890> your<00:02:38.010> strike<00:02:38.400> pieces<00:02:38.880> next<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.780> your

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
get your strike pieces next to your

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.100 
get your strike pieces next to your
opponent's<00:02:40.380> main<00:02:40.680> piece<00:02:41.210> so<00:02:42.210> right<00:02:42.930> now

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
opponent's main piece so right now

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.420 
opponent's main piece so right now
they're<00:02:43.320> not<00:02:43.350> doing<00:02:43.710> so<00:02:43.830> hot<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:44.100> that<00:02:44.220> manner

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
they're not doing so hot in that manner

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.890 
they're not doing so hot in that manner
they<00:02:44.580> want<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.820> get<00:02:44.910> these<00:02:45.030> strike<00:02:45.330> pieces<00:02:45.720> up

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
they want to get these strike pieces up

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.080 
they want to get these strike pieces up
there<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.430> they're<00:02:47.580> going<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.790> trying

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
there and so they're going to be trying

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.520 
there and so they're going to be trying
to<00:02:48.210> do<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.510> by<00:02:48.690> moving<00:02:48.900> them<00:02:49.170> up<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.350> little

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
to do that by moving them up a little

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.050 
to do that by moving them up a little
bit<00:02:49.680> more<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.010> they<00:02:50.130> get<00:02:50.250> five<00:02:50.490> moves<00:02:50.850> this

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
bit more so they get five moves this

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.620 
bit more so they get five moves this
time<00:02:51.300> two<00:02:51.770> three<00:02:52.770> at<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.910> point<00:02:54.240> they<00:02:54.480> can

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
time two three at this point they can

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.060 
time two three at this point they can
actually<00:02:54.780> start<00:02:54.960> moving<00:02:55.470> pieces<00:02:55.680> that

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
actually start moving pieces that

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.890 
actually start moving pieces that
replace<00:02:56.490> their<00:02:56.820> opponent's<00:02:57.300> pieces<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.810> if

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
replace their opponent's pieces so if

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.420 
replace their opponent's pieces so if
they<00:02:58.050> move<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.470> piece<00:02:58.710> all<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.160> way<00:02:59.190> along

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
they move this piece all the way along

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.400 
they move this piece all the way along
this<00:02:59.610> group<00:02:59.820> this<00:03:00.480> spot<00:03:00.720> held<00:03:00.990> by<00:03:01.140> green

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
this group this spot held by green

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.410 
this group this spot held by green
strike<00:03:01.740> piece<00:03:01.980> they<00:03:02.610> would<00:03:02.760> replace<00:03:03.000> Green

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
strike piece they would replace Green

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.790 
strike piece they would replace Green
straight<00:03:03.720> piece<00:03:03.870> which<00:03:04.080> would<00:03:04.170> go<00:03:04.350> all<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
straight piece which would go all the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.170 
straight piece which would go all the
way<00:03:04.830> back<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> end<00:03:05.490> now<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:05.880> isn't<00:03:06.060> a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
way back to the end now this isn't a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.060 
way back to the end now this isn't a
great<00:03:06.390> move<00:03:06.600> because<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.530> can<00:03:07.650> see<00:03:07.860> here

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
great move because you can see here

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.520 
great move because you can see here
we've<00:03:08.490> now<00:03:08.730> got<00:03:09.000> our<00:03:09.240> piece<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.050> green

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
we've now got our piece with a green

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.920 
we've now got our piece with a green
strike<00:03:10.860> piece<00:03:11.100> next<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.850> green<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.630> one

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
strike piece next to it and green is one

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.440 
strike piece next to it and green is one
well<00:03:13.890> one<00:03:14.160> six<00:03:14.520> technically<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.330> way

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
well one six technically of the way

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.940 
well one six technically of the way
towards<00:03:16.110> winning<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.440> game<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:16.770> in<00:03:16.830> this

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
towards winning the game but in this

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.199 
towards winning the game but in this
case<00:03:17.160> if<00:03:17.340> they<00:03:17.430> completely<00:03:17.760> surrounded<00:03:18.090> our

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
case if they completely surrounded our

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.080 
case if they completely surrounded our
piece<00:03:18.390> there's<00:03:18.600> nothing<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:18.930> could<00:03:19.080> do<00:03:19.230> but<00:03:20.090> in

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
piece there's nothing we could do but in

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.520 
piece there's nothing we could do but in
addition<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.570> this<00:03:21.660> if<00:03:21.840> they<00:03:21.959> got<00:03:22.110> their<00:03:22.320> green

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
addition to this if they got their green

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.140 
addition to this if they got their green
piece<00:03:22.770> next<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.190> our<00:03:23.340> main<00:03:23.580> piece<00:03:23.820> we<00:03:24.000> would

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
piece next to our main piece we would

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.780 
piece next to our main piece we would
lose<00:03:24.480> an<00:03:24.750> action<00:03:25.110> on<00:03:25.230> future<00:03:25.620> turns<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.190> if<00:03:26.430> we

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
lose an action on future turns so if we

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.070 
lose an action on future turns so if we
were<00:03:26.910> supposed<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.240> have<00:03:27.390> six<00:03:27.690> we<00:03:27.870> would<00:03:27.990> now

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
were supposed to have six we would now

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.810 
were supposed to have six we would now
only<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.560> five<00:03:28.830> because<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.340> strike<00:03:29.580> piece

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
only have five because the strike piece

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.420 
only have five because the strike piece
is<00:03:30.000> next<00:03:30.240> to<00:03:30.330> our<00:03:30.450> piece<00:03:30.770> we<00:03:31.770> can<00:03:31.890> remedy<00:03:32.220> this

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
is next to our piece we can remedy this

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.880 
is next to our piece we can remedy this
by<00:03:33.030> moving<00:03:33.300> one<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.630> our<00:03:33.720> pieces<00:03:34.080> all<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.470> way

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
by moving one of our pieces all the way

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.729 
by moving one of our pieces all the way
back<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.670> swap<00:03:35.940> with<00:03:36.510> our<00:03:36.660> start<00:03:36.930> piece<00:03:37.110> now<00:03:37.290> we

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
back to swap with our start piece now we

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.160 
back to swap with our start piece now we
still<00:03:38.070> have<00:03:38.340> one<00:03:38.790> piece<00:03:39.030> next<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.600> but<00:03:39.840> it's

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
still have one piece next to it but it's

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.110 
still have one piece next to it but it's
no<00:03:40.380> longer<00:03:40.590> blocked<00:03:41.280> in<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.610> corner<00:03:41.970> a

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
no longer blocked in that corner a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.720 
no longer blocked in that corner a
little<00:03:42.570> bit<00:03:42.660> easier<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.500> move<00:03:43.920> out<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:44.489> get

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
little bit easier to move out and get

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.420 
little bit easier to move out and get
around<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:46.230> objective<00:03:46.680> here<00:03:46.800> as<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.070> said<00:03:47.130> is

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
around the objective here as I said is

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.130 
around the objective here as I said is
to<00:03:47.459> get<00:03:47.640> all<00:03:47.820> six<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.360> your<00:03:48.480> strike<00:03:48.780> pieces

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
to get all six of your strike pieces

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.479 
to get all six of your strike pieces
next<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.500> your<00:03:49.650> opponent's<00:03:50.040> piece<00:03:50.190> through

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
next to your opponent's piece through

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.460 
next to your opponent's piece through
clever<00:03:50.790> maneuvering<00:03:51.330> swapping<00:03:52.170> up<00:03:52.320> the

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
clever maneuvering swapping up the

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.110 
clever maneuvering swapping up the
pieces<00:03:52.709> so<00:03:52.890> maybe<00:03:53.190> red<00:03:53.459> moves<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:53.850> piece

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
pieces so maybe red moves this piece

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.040 
pieces so maybe red moves this piece
here<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.540> they<00:03:55.050> can<00:03:55.230> swap<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:55.769> out<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.160> their

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
here and they can swap this out to their

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.660 
here and they can swap this out to their
they<00:03:58.050> can<00:03:58.230> move<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.590> up<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:59.010> here<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.400> and

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
they can move this up to here and and

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.490 
they can move this up to here and and
they'll<00:04:00.030> start<00:04:00.269> moving<00:04:00.450> these<00:04:00.750> pieces<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.380> get

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
they'll start moving these pieces to get

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.750 
they'll start moving these pieces to get
closer<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:01.890> closer<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.340> their<00:04:02.459> opponent's

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
closer and closer to their opponent's

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.250 
closer and closer to their opponent's
piece<00:04:02.910> until<00:04:03.239> they<00:04:03.360> surround<00:04:03.720> their<00:04:03.930> opponent

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
piece until they surround their opponent

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.199 
piece until they surround their opponent
with<00:04:04.350> all<00:04:04.530> six<00:04:04.860> strike<00:04:05.130> pieces<00:04:05.549> winning<00:04:06.090> the

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
with all six strike pieces winning the

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.759 
with all six strike pieces winning the
game<00:04:06.420> well<00:04:07.019> there<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.260> have<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.739> is

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
game well there you have it that is

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
lot to say about it but not so much that

lot to say about it but not so much that
I<00:04:13.769> can<00:04:14.130> really<00:04:14.310> explain<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:14.940> game<00:04:15.299> very<00:04:15.720> well

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
I can really explain the game very well

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.039 
description it's a hard game to describe
because<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:21.030> have<00:04:21.209> three<00:04:21.570> different<00:04:21.690> types

causing<00:04:43.140> chaos<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.560> allowing<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:43.890> to

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
causing chaos and allowing you to

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.350 
causing chaos and allowing you to
transport<00:04:44.280> pieces<00:04:44.669> from<00:04:44.820> one<00:04:44.970> place<00:04:45.180> to<00:04:45.330> the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
transport pieces from one place to the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.070 
transport pieces from one place to the
other<00:04:45.450> we

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
other we

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.390 
other we
you<00:04:46.139> can<00:04:46.229> also<00:04:46.409> be<00:04:46.710> done<00:04:46.860> with<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:47.039> strike

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
you can also be done with the strike

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.790 
you can also be done with the strike
pieces<00:04:47.849> so<00:04:48.120> they're<00:04:48.629> kind<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.139> neutral<00:04:49.409> type

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
pieces so they're kind of a neutral type

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.950 
pieces so they're kind of a neutral type
of<00:04:49.949> piece<00:04:50.159> with<00:04:50.370> no<00:04:50.400> direct<00:04:51.210> function<00:04:51.509> but<00:04:51.840> can

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
of piece with no direct function but can

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.140 
of piece with no direct function but can
be<00:04:52.129> multi-use<00:04:53.129> in<00:04:53.310> terms<00:04:53.520> of<00:04:53.669> moving<00:04:53.849> stuff

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
be multi-use in terms of moving stuff

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.159 
be multi-use in terms of moving stuff
around<00:04:54.500> now<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.560> game<00:04:55.919> is<00:04:56.189> not<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.419> easy<00:04:57.810> in

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
around now the game is not that easy in

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.170 
around now the game is not that easy in
terms<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.710> strategy<00:04:59.159> I<00:04:59.189> enjoy<00:04:59.610> it<00:04:59.789> quite<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.060> bit

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
terms of strategy I enjoy it quite a bit

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.629 
terms of strategy I enjoy it quite a bit
because<00:05:00.509> it's<00:05:00.930> not<00:05:01.110> easy<00:05:01.349> but<00:05:01.979> with<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:02.550> know

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
because it's not easy but with you know

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.580 
because it's not easy but with you know
a<00:05:02.669> couple<00:05:02.729> games<00:05:03.180> in<00:05:03.509> we're<00:05:04.080> not<00:05:04.289> entirely

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
a couple games in we're not entirely

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.800 
a couple games in we're not entirely
sure<00:05:04.770> what<00:05:05.189> the<00:05:05.250> optimal<00:05:06.150> strategy<00:05:06.569> for<00:05:06.719> the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
sure what the optimal strategy for the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.480 
sure what the optimal strategy for the
game<00:05:06.960> is<00:05:07.229> it's<00:05:07.680> obvious<00:05:08.099> that<00:05:08.129> you<00:05:08.280> need<00:05:08.370> to

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
game is it's obvious that you need to

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.770 
game is it's obvious that you need to
move<00:05:08.610> from<00:05:08.789> one<00:05:08.969> side<00:05:09.150> of<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.360> board<00:05:09.599> to<00:05:09.750> the

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
move from one side of the board to the

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.570 
move from one side of the board to the
other<00:05:10.020> in<00:05:10.620> order<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.889> get<00:05:11.069> closer<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.430> your

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
other in order to get closer to your

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.249 
other in order to get closer to your
opponent<00:05:11.969> but<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.180> best<00:05:12.389> way<00:05:12.569> of<00:05:12.599> doing<00:05:12.930> so<00:05:13.110> is

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
opponent but the best way of doing so is

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.409 
opponent but the best way of doing so is
not<00:05:13.409> always<00:05:13.620> clear<00:05:13.949> and<00:05:14.819> it<00:05:14.939> involves<00:05:15.300> a<00:05:15.389> lot

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
not always clear and it involves a lot

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.540 
not always clear and it involves a lot
of<00:05:15.900> moving<00:05:16.139> pieces<00:05:16.409> from<00:05:16.740> one<00:05:16.979> end<00:05:17.189> of<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.370> group

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
of moving pieces from one end of a group

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.339 
of moving pieces from one end of a group
to<00:05:17.580> another<00:05:17.909> and<00:05:18.659> separating<00:05:19.229> your

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
to another and separating your

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.290 
to another and separating your
opponent's<00:05:19.830> pieces<00:05:20.009> from<00:05:20.340> their<00:05:20.550> groups<00:05:20.879> so

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
opponent's pieces from their groups so

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.629 
opponent's pieces from their groups so
that<00:05:21.330> they<00:05:21.569> can't<00:05:21.840> do<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.110> same<00:05:22.319> thing

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
that they can't do the same thing

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.159 
that they can't do the same thing
overall<00:05:23.639> I<00:05:23.789> can<00:05:23.940> say<00:05:24.090> that<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:24.449> enjoy<00:05:24.719> Fibonacci

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
overall I can say that I enjoy Fibonacci

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.779 
overall I can say that I enjoy Fibonacci
quite<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.560> bit<00:05:25.800> I<00:05:25.979> think<00:05:26.280> it's<00:05:26.550> something<00:05:26.699> that

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
quite a bit I think it's something that

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.339 
quite a bit I think it's something that
we're<00:05:26.940> gonna<00:05:27.060> hold<00:05:27.240> on<00:05:27.449> to<00:05:27.539> it<00:05:27.629> for<00:05:27.870> a<00:05:27.900> while<00:05:28.110> as

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
we're gonna hold on to it for a while as

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.589 
we're gonna hold on to it for a while as
abstract<00:05:28.800> lovers<00:05:29.370> and<00:05:29.969> it's<00:05:30.120> a<00:05:30.180> game<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.389> I

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
abstract lovers and it's a game that I

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.240

can't<00:05:32.789> really<00:05:32.940> explain<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.389> strategy<00:05:33.750> to<00:05:33.900> you

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
can't really explain the strategy to you
