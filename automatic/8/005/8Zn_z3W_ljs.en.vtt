00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.700
 friends of minecraft 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.700
 I present you 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.660
 the first the first downloadable map 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.880
 for my channel 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.090
 and here we have the race track for 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.010
 the cars mod that good I'm not going to put 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.680
 a link where you download but good 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.970
 It is not mine 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.240
 I do not know yet where it will draw but 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.070
 good where those things cost me a 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.830
 whole afternoon to do the whole track 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.840
 whole and good to design good this does not 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.900
 it cost me so much but it is cool mena if 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.910
 the spectators and everything with a VIP box 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.129
 there's a transparent VIP box here 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.930
 crystal that can see the race from 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.090
 closer and apart they have a zoo for 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.570
 children because there are children there are children 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.570
 where there were children look look at children 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 children 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.840
 but good taking advantage of the book of 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.990
 invoke villagers has left kids children 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.160
 children 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.170
 they go to the zoo and it starts to rain go 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.400
 what should you do to stop it from raining 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.270
 make good day let's give a 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.270
 ride in the car 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.530
 to a return to the track so you can see 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.530
 the route 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.479
 and if someone has a server or 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.270
 something or if someone wants to play with me and 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.799
 has a vital being of these even though 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.080
 never and good ever and usually does not see me 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.750
 ok since I connect the internet to 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.009
 through wi-fi so sometimes those of 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.310
 stream and go slow 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.800
 well there you see a little the case is not 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.020
 do the graphs of the part of the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.970
 entity behind but good I have a little 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.510
 of the fact of cant asia and in 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.310
 the speed of the car 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.650
 and good the difficulty of the race 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.310
 would be for example playing 2 in the 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.430
 curves because I've seen that karma is 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.659
 pretty solid the car then 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.579
 one does not pass over 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.040
 to a block you pass over but if they are 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.400
 two 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.340
 high I mean good and has given the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.319
 back already 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.939
 the triumphant 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.220
 so I'm going to see it from another point of 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:16.110
 sight come one more lap 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.700
 and you will have here below the description in 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.700
 the map download link 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.810
 I will upload it I do not know what servel upload it 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.830
 because I will make an account in some 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.340
 green of his life like this 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.340
 start climbing 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.420
 it's a bit difficult but good that's the 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.970
 grace then because playing several 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.360
 several people have tried it 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.610
 but good with two minecraft because no 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.100
 opening 22 minecraft launcher 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.460
 Y 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.470
 and I've tried 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.700
 crash into another car and everything and it's 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.380
 pretty solid then it's hard 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.410
 dodge and you can only overtake in 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.480
 the straight lines the curves are very narrow 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.550
 has its difficulty because I have thought 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.700
 that only straight lines would not be funny 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.709
 because all cars run the same 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.390
 there had to be curves not only the curve 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.270
 normal is because it's quite easy 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.030
 thanks to these without thinking turn the 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.840
 good camera see you in the next 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.819
 video ask me maps for mods I'm going to 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.330
 I'm thinking of designing in design 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.240
 Some more 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.850
 if you want me to make more maps for the 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.140
 mod cars I'm thinking of making a map 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.140
 cross 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.420
 because he has discovered one thing I'm not going 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.400
 to teach in this other on this straight 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.569
 is what happens if there is 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.900
 I will place these obstacles here 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:56.930
 yes yes there is a 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.930
 a block goes over it jumps 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.510
 to do it more slowly see if it looks 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.510
 best 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.540
 is 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:12.080
 I will see from this angle 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.709
 space and it's like it goes over now 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.709
 reverse 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.060
 so he could make ups and downs 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.060
 that I did not know how the track says 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.319
 and since I did not know 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.389
 as I did not do anything then then it gives me 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:33.770
 If so, I could make a map of 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:36.770
 cross but beautiful and good that will be my 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.629
 next map for now if I see that it has 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.419
 very welcome and good you put in the 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:44.300
 comments if you want and if I see that you 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.889
 I like it, I do more, I do not have any 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.740
 problem 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.509
 and well I 'm going to leave the car here 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.689
 prepared the map I'll leave it such 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:57.769
 which leave the car prepared with 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:59.959
 with gasoline in case you have to have the 

00:04:57.769 --> 00:05:02.539
 license to operate I have placed nothing 

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:05.479
 otherwise on the map although I have more 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.020
 mods so that it does not fail to fail 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.330
 missing mods 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.280
 usually happens but good is a flat extra 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.060
 and does not have any resources that are 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.750

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.199
