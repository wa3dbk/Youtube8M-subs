00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.010
 Talking staff here is Charlie and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.599
 bringing another video and the son and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.620
 chemistry today let's talk about the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.110
 champion drive 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.380
 the executioner of ours then we go to the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.380
 video 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.660
 the event is a very mechanical break 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.000
 legal on account of his ability 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.100
 revolution of the axes allows 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.260
 it from extremely basic attacks 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.210
 and if you can not master this 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.000
 likely to perform 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.550
 champion will fall by half 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.260
 starting with your passive ligth drive 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.420
 when the dragon can take its 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.500
 ax revolution kill troops or 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.840
 writers 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.610
 he accumulates duration of his fans and when 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.640
 kills someone as an enemy all this 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.530
 worship is converted into your own 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.360
 revolution of the axes and with certainty 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.180
 most interesting skill on android 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.220
 so it activates it will continue 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.710
 while you attack troops the content 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.240
 enemies if drops or does not attack 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.729
 no one for a period skill is 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.260
 disabled if you already have a key in the 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.330
 hand you can take this skill 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.960
 again to stay with two axes 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.030
 at the same time adrenaline as soon as you 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.770
 is to use to come to gain speed of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.720
 attack and movement for a short period 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.540
 if you can follow the evolution 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.200
 of axes every time she can fall 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.210
 the recharge time of adrenaline zeroed 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.579
 leaves the front as the name itself says 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.380
 as soon as activated it makes the man hit and 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.390
 to the side in case the physical and 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.399
 slowness for a short time 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.859
 this ability serves as control of 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.429
 group may stop before the cataract and 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:49.960
 who, and lastly, his last 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.789
 death of the 'king of games' and the two 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.740
 axes in the direction in which 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.600
 causing physical damage that's how we're going 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.270
 reach the enemy or re-activate 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.280
 she was coming back to you 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.469
 we will start with the following 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.840
 axes revolution skills 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.789
 then out of the way and I pito that 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.950
 put another point in the revolution of 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.660
 axes before putting adrenaline 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.090
 but your choice remains 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.030
 then we will maximize the revolution of 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.520
 axes adrenaline and by fixed from the front 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.550
 also your choice gives priority 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.890
 to the front or adrenaline for the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.260
 educator spells we will put flash 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.480
 cure the flash barrier if you 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.210
 of the bush had no enemy as its headquarters and 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.370
 eni to build start with blade 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.500
 dhoran on a bridge of life and 30 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.780
 totem of surveillance on the first turn 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.830
 have to come back with a pickaxe or 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.680
 bf sword 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.629
 case back in third with 11 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.969
 improving to have more support nor the 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.650
 own spy ball tank and 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.549
 remember to always come back composed 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.430
 beyond 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.489
 mean the end of the bearing being secured 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.239
 infinite grams of static card zac 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.879
 Finally deaf and starved for blood ab 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.950
 drive or standardize this way because it is 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.569
 which I like the most but invents the orders 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.609
 of the item depending on the game 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.650
 assuming you need more wins 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.689
 you prioritize blood-thirsty 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.579
 You need armor penetration. 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.500
 do the latest studies soon 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.720
 this does not stop you from making the line 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.180
 ghost of a top place prefer 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.400
 withdraw you can also use the dancer 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.950
 ghost in place of the stadium knife 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.439
 there is your school and the items 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.150
 defensive facilitating is not curious case 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.079
 have understood the team a lot 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.569
 adversary 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.879
 there were banshee angel guardian and how 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.370
 I always say if it's easy to play and 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.650
 realize debt and dani make the sea 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.450
 it would be too much for 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.329
 account of its slowness after 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.219
 base attack always watch the game 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.340
 will choose the best defensive item 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:49.409
 to the usual streets next 9 mark of 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.659
 attacking nine weeks of life 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.489
 being able to vary with armor four 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.290
 groups of attack speed and five 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.359
 groups of magic resistance can 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.760
 also change for all resistance 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.430
 two magical quintessence of course 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.290
 life and a tcs of armor you can 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.819
 vary the deficiencies as you wish 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.769
 putting more giving instead of theft 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.959
 life or by removing armor and 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.030
 put on armor to be born in the test until 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.489
 find one that had grille for 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:19.739
 talents use 2190 shown in the image 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.479
 at the beginning of the game just shape and try 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.270
 always do this with the revolution of 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.440
 active axes and trying not to lose them 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.970
 not at all 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.220
 an interesting thing about missions 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.250
 axes is that it will fall to where 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.440
 You walk then forever to know where 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.780
 she will fall from a basic attack with her 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.030
 activated and to the side you want 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.800
 before the 7th attack on the enemy troop 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.900
 or m champion 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.509
 so you'll always know where it will go 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.699
 fall very careful not to get carried away 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.130
 with its damage to go up already takes us 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.630
 the initials in taking up troops 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.150
 always waiting to be 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.790
 opportunity for you 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.550
 an ally gang or even some 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.020
 Enemy mistakes of the half-game case 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.300
 You have managed to do everything. 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.640
 Maybe you'll already be right 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.530
 very strong and often at this time 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.570
 You're almost finished with the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.850
 lenny and depending on the move you 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.100
 manages to deal with great enemies 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.860
 only with the help of your support or many 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.660
 times against two opponents but 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.430
 be very careful not to kill yourself 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.020
 always be aware that your 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.010
 opponents have to keep from dying 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.470
 all the time 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.050
 use your tool to help in the exchange of 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.300
 damage or to kill enemies that 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.830
 be far away and help in a fight that 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.960
 You will not arrive in time. 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.630
 at the end of the game is one of the most 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.250
 difficult to play but if you master the 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.410
 revolutions ax this positioning 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.360
 turn out to be very right 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.310
 always stay behind the team see if the 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.800
 enemy team has a lot of group control 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.750
 and hope they spend some that focus 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.760
 on your team instead of you because you do not 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.420
 has an escape method unless the 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.730
 flash 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.180
 If it gets caught it will be very easy so stay 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.100
 There's always personal time, so this is it. 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.470
 I hope you enjoyed it if you liked it. 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.150
 Your like your favorite and give a 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.440
 pass on the channel to check the 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.550
 new series 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.550
 Thank you and bye, bye.
