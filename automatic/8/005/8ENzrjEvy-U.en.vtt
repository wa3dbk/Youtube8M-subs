00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.540
 thanks to all this 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:21.480
 it happened on earth next Sunday 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.970
 a week to adapt to the schedule of 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.430
 there and the first one should be 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.980
 incorporated dialogue to the training of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.330
 preseason with the team to go the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:39.260
 nervous sunday 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:43.400
 very comfortable to everyone but ready to 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.610
 have are great because this trip that 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.100
 had now to know the environment of 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.080
 team served him rather more with 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.070
 experience going to see the end of the 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.000
 champions 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.670
 as a reference for him and then the people 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.620
 such a reflective expectation with its 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.930
 performance in the team that I already chose the 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.540
 cost of the senior team already talked to him 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.220
 He told him it was not by chance that he has 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.710
 come to the team but from the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.740
 member states for two years has a 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 I would like to study with your technique that 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.619
 composing his field mission and that is 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.800
 we are expectant and happy 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.800
 because coming from the wind is main 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.200
 of the environment and to tell you those words 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.780
 to him and already in three months he wants and 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.159
 start working with him a joy 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.259
 for us and for him 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.999
 when I arrive I want to work hard and only 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.659
 do what you can to get to the first 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:50.569
 team that is with the first 19 not 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.909
 you train hard and in no year 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:57.479
 I want to be with the first one playing a 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.840
 study and orders is not always what 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.780
 I have told him he is not 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.780
 chance and now the only thing is already there 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.610
 that he has to work hard and 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.470
 demonstrate why they have called 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.760
 because there are a lot of people that maybe 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.110
 think about why 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.550
 chance but as the technician told you 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.720
 I always tell him he is not 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.340
 chance 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.430
 if you do not know what is it they have been 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.140
 following and right now the most important thing 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.590
 that well in his career that is this 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.300
 work hard to earn your position and then 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.880
 Who knows, they also told him 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.090
 that next year the champions will 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.980
 to ascend also pity youth 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.080
 also more youth teams are going to 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.460
 enjoy the champions was also going to 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.060
 have champion of youth champions 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.870
 way also in order if it is clear pure 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.910
 pure sacrifice of part of the sea that 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.770
 all because you imagine the age of 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.590
 14 and a half years he has left 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.750
 practically from the house having been 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.630
 united thanks to them also that what 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.240
 have had 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.910
 in in the high performance thing of 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.920
 they for two years are also 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.530
 also thanks the USA federation 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.450
 because they too are part of what 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.970
 that I'm not also achieving because 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.760
 that's because they have also been given to 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.700
 know in several countries of euros 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.280
 because it's not just a state environment 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.959
 pending we want to fix there's also 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.110
 teams of england equipment 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.840
 france were also reporting and 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.849
 asking for him and if he never me 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.990
 called the United States no matter what 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.140
 start them law 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.050
 close these as I have always 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.750
 said the east 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.430
 and he is willing to start that 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.300
 Once there has not been an approach with the 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.940
 federation of savior still have never 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:55.180
 asked for him but this as he says 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.890
 that if the USA stops calling him and the 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.110
 savior the door is open so that 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.710
 can represent the savior because as 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.250
 he says with likes of the argument 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.380
 told that always juniors also for 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.480
 this we because we had the tube not 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.180
 trained with the senior team when the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:17.200
 hard cup last year because I imagine 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.299
 who lives that they had knowledge 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.930
 of him but that was the only approach 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.520
 that they have had towards him but as you 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.160
 I say we have the door 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.560
 open and as he says of the us not what 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.340
 call again because you are willing to 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.930
 put the shirt and time to be 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.750
 Pending to be always asking 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.600
 what you are doing in the future and 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.290

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.920
 you already have september the whole life of the 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.750
 peoples presents the turn of the press 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:58.080
 I imagine that too many many 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:05:01.050
 to walk pending I think it would be for 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.870
 that everyone knew him as to know the 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.340
 public news about the former player of 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.550
 misfortunes for the interview thank you 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.550

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.670
 to be aware of us and after 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.070
 no future that the same state united 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:24.360
