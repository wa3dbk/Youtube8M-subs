00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
let you know how much surface you need

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.529 
let you know how much surface you need
to<00:01:49.439> take<00:01:49.649> off<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.819> don't<00:01:50.970> want<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.179> take<00:01:51.329> too

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
to take off you don't want to take too

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:52.969 
to take off you don't want to take too
much<00:01:51.689> off<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.229> don't<00:01:52.380> want<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.560> take<00:01:52.739> too

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
much off and don't want to take too

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.490 
much off and don't want to take too
little<00:01:53.159> because<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:53.909> that'll<00:01:54.149> deep<00:01:55.140> spit

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
little because then that'll deep spit

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.210 
little because then that'll deep spit
dia<00:01:56.539> it'll<00:01:57.539> affect<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.229> flow<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:59.009> won't

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
dia it'll affect the flow it won't

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.010 
dia it'll affect the flow it won't
actually<00:01:59.489> flow<00:02:00.000> near<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.420> good<00:02:00.599> it'll<00:02:00.929> be

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
actually flow near as good it'll be

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.039 
actually flow near as good it'll be
defective<00:02:01.319> so<00:02:02.220> what<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> shot<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:03.509> defective

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
defective so what I shot was defective

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.460 
defective so what I shot was defective
for<00:02:04.200> some<00:02:04.409> ring<00:02:04.970> it<00:02:05.970> will<00:02:06.239> impede<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.319> flow

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
for some ring it will impede the flow

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.710 
for some ring it will impede the flow
it'll<00:02:07.979> actually<00:02:08.130> just<00:02:08.340> be<00:02:09.030> totally<00:02:09.479> pointless

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it'll actually just be totally pointless

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.890 
it'll actually just be totally pointless
to<00:02:09.929> play<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.079> b-series<00:02:10.470> drawn<00:02:11.329> and<00:02:12.329> of<00:02:12.630> course

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
to play the b-series drawn and of course

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.229 
to play the b-series drawn and of course
you<00:02:13.110> can't<00:02:13.319> really<00:02:13.500> see<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.769> too<00:02:14.010> much<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:15.030> on

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
you can't really see it too much but on

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.940 
you can't really see it too much but on
here<00:02:16.010> there's<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.489> mark<00:02:17.879> because<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.299> made<00:02:18.510> as<00:02:18.950> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
here there's a mark because I made as to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.710 
here there's a mark because I made as to
how<00:02:20.069> much<00:02:20.250> surface<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.879> need<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.120> actually<00:02:21.299> take

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
how much surface I need to actually take

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.229 
how much surface I need to actually take
off<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> go<00:02:23.370> just<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.700> hair<00:02:23.940> past

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
off I'm going to go just a hair past

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.650 
off I'm going to go just a hair past
that<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.829> actually<00:02:26.329> mates<00:02:27.329> right

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
that so that it actually mates right

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.440 
that so that it actually mates right
just<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.739> little<00:02:28.769> bit<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:30.120> will<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.420> that

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
just a little bit and I will do that

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.250 
just a little bit and I will do that
with<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.019> Dremel<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:32.430> will<00:02:32.609> add<00:02:33.389> that<00:02:33.420> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
with the Dremel and I will add that to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.819 
with the Dremel and I will add that to
this<00:02:34.680> video<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.519> let<00:02:36.329> me<00:02:36.420> do<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.870> I'll

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
this video so let me do that and I'll

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.220 
this video so let me do that and I'll
get<00:02:37.920> back<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.340> alright<00:02:39.060> guys<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.480> just<00:02:39.810> did

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
get back to you alright guys I just did

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.509 
get back to you alright guys I just did
the<00:02:41.030> porting<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.900> Dremel<00:02:43.230> well<00:02:44.069> more

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
the porting with the Dremel well more

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.129 
the porting with the Dremel well more
like<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> screw<00:02:46.069> driver<00:02:47.069> thing<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:48.359> uh<00:02:48.389> this<00:02:48.930> is

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
like a screw driver thing but uh this is

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.680 
like a screw driver thing but uh this is
what<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.319> used<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.920> used<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.190> stone<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:51.359> took<00:02:51.540> off

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
what I used I used a stone just took off

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.449 
what I used I used a stone just took off
excess<00:02:52.139> a<00:02:52.200> little<00:02:52.590> bit<00:02:52.709> at<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:52.889> time<00:02:53.130> when<00:02:53.340> all

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
excess a little bit at a time when all

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.280 
excess a little bit at a time when all
the<00:02:53.489> way<00:02:53.639> around<00:02:53.880> in<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.060> circle<00:02:54.299> it's<00:02:55.109> pretty

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
the way around in a circle it's pretty

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.589 
the way around in a circle it's pretty
simple<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:56.639> don't<00:02:56.790> take<00:02:56.970> too<00:02:57.000> much<00:02:57.329> off

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
simple just don't take too much off

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.300 
simple just don't take too much off
because<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:57.900> could<00:02:58.230> also<00:02:58.349> impede<00:02:58.769> flow<00:02:59.069> and

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
because that could also impede flow and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.920 
because that could also impede flow and
volumetric<00:02:59.849> efficiency<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.599> what<00:03:00.780> we're

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
volumetric efficiency is what we're

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.440 
volumetric efficiency is what we're
wanting<00:03:01.440> here<00:03:01.880> okay<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:02.940> can<00:03:03.150> look<00:03:03.299> inside

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
wanting here okay you can look inside

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.819 
wanting here okay you can look inside
there<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.560> see<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:04.980> there's<00:03:05.190> no<00:03:05.450> step<00:03:06.450> up

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
there you see that there's no step up

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.460 
there you see that there's no step up
like<00:03:07.829> there<00:03:08.010> was<00:03:08.220> before<00:03:08.669> it's<00:03:09.540> all<00:03:09.870> smooth

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
like there was before it's all smooth

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.509 
like there was before it's all smooth
and<00:03:11.630> it's<00:03:12.630> all<00:03:12.690> straight<00:03:13.109> through<00:03:13.519> pretty

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
and it's all straight through pretty

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.460 
and it's all straight through pretty
much<00:03:14.700> perfect<00:03:15.269> as<00:03:15.450> good<00:03:15.900> as<00:03:15.959> it's<00:03:16.109> gonna<00:03:16.169> get

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
much perfect as good as it's gonna get

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.860 
much perfect as good as it's gonna get
without<00:03:17.099> a<00:03:17.280> machine<00:03:17.669> shop<00:03:17.970> but<00:03:18.630> um

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
without a machine shop but um

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.330 
without a machine shop but um
that's<00:03:20.739> not<00:03:20.920> supposed<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.250> happen<00:03:21.930> anyways<00:03:22.930> uh

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
that's not supposed to happen anyways uh

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.280 
that's not supposed to happen anyways uh
you<00:03:24.340> can<00:03:24.550> take<00:03:24.819> it<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.180> Machine<00:03:25.480> show<00:03:25.720> they

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
you can take it to the Machine show they

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.750 
you can take it to the Machine show they
could<00:03:26.440> probably<00:03:26.620> figure<00:03:27.190> something<00:03:27.700> out

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
could probably figure something out

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.610 
could probably figure something out
before<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.090> make<00:03:28.150> maybe<00:03:28.569> bore<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.290> don't

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
before you make maybe bore it I don't

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.890 
before you make maybe bore it I don't
know<00:03:29.709> but<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:30.670> can<00:03:30.700> also<00:03:31.000> use<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.300> motorcycle

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
know but you can also use a motorcycle

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.020 
know but you can also use a motorcycle
cylinder<00:03:32.769> hone<00:03:32.950> I've<00:03:33.160> heard<00:03:33.640> that<00:03:33.819> they're

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
cylinder hone I've heard that they're

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.140 
cylinder hone I've heard that they're
about<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.629> same<00:03:34.780> size<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.379> it'll<00:03:36.280> expand<00:03:36.790> and

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
about the same size and it'll expand and

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.020 
about the same size and it'll expand and
slowly<00:03:37.569> take<00:03:37.870> off<00:03:38.049> perfect<00:03:38.709> amounts<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.340> it

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
slowly take off perfect amounts and it

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.970 
slowly take off perfect amounts and it
takes<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.330> while<00:03:40.360> while<00:03:41.260> from<00:03:41.560> what<00:03:41.680> I've<00:03:41.799> read

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
takes a while while from what I've read

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.559 
takes a while while from what I've read
and<00:03:42.040> heard<00:03:42.610> but<00:03:43.390> it's<00:03:43.750> pretty<00:03:44.019> easy<00:03:44.140> to<00:03:44.349> do

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
and heard but it's pretty easy to do

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.420 
and heard but it's pretty easy to do
afterwards<00:03:46.569> I<00:03:46.660> used<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:46.959> flapper<00:03:47.230> wheel<00:03:47.590> it's

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
afterwards I used a flapper wheel it's

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.250 
afterwards I used a flapper wheel it's
just<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.940> kind<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.180> smooth<00:03:49.510> up<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.870> area

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
just to kind of smooth up this area

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.690 
just to kind of smooth up this area
right<00:03:50.440> here<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:53.110> side<00:03:53.590> on<00:03:53.739> this<00:03:54.400> I'm

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
right here and this side on this I'm

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.100 
right here and this side on this I'm
going<00:03:54.819> to<00:03:54.880> about<00:03:55.269> to<00:03:55.420> use<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.630> flapper<00:03:55.870> wheel

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
going to about to use the flapper wheel

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.390 
going to about to use the flapper wheel
just<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.380> kind<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.620> smooth<00:03:56.860> it<00:03:56.980> out<00:03:57.069> just<00:03:57.250> a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
just to kind of smooth it out just a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.650 
just to kind of smooth it out just a
little<00:03:57.430> bit<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:57.940> don't<00:03:57.970> want<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.269> get<00:03:58.329> it<00:03:58.480> too

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
little bit you don't want to get it too

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.890 
little bit you don't want to get it too
smooth<00:03:58.989> when<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.410> mess<00:04:00.280> with<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.579> flow<00:04:00.900> while

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
smooth when you mess with the flow while

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.390 
smooth when you mess with the flow while
it's<00:04:02.110> been<00:04:02.260> off<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.620> cleaned<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.069> up<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.280> little

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
it's been off I cleaned it up a little

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.509 
it's been off I cleaned it up a little
bit<00:04:03.640> clean<00:04:04.120> each<00:04:04.269> each<00:04:04.989> intake<00:04:05.410> port<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.010> the

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
bit clean each each intake port and the

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:07.949 
bit clean each each intake port and the
inside<00:04:06.879> of<00:04:07.000> cleaned<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.329> out<00:04:07.420> after<00:04:07.780> I<00:04:07.840> got

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
inside of cleaned it out after I got

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.220 
inside of cleaned it out after I got
metal<00:04:08.230> shavings<00:04:08.440> in<00:04:08.769> it<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.540> yeah<00:04:10.540> so<00:04:10.900> there

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
metal shavings in it and yeah so there

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.479 
metal shavings in it and yeah so there
it<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.519> be<00:04:12.519> serious<00:04:12.760> throttle<00:04:13.269> wanna<00:04:14.370> get<00:04:15.370> it

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
it is be serious throttle wanna get it

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.330 
it is be serious throttle wanna get it
on<00:04:15.610> there<00:04:16.200> series<00:04:17.200> throttle<00:04:17.560> on<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.739> D<00:04:17.979> series

you<00:04:22.210> don't<00:04:22.270> want<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.539> get<00:04:22.600> yourself<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:22.990> new

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
you don't want to get yourself a new

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.810 
you don't want to get yourself a new
intake<00:04:23.500> gasket<00:04:24.010> because<00:04:24.220> you're<00:04:24.639> going<00:04:24.760> to

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
intake gasket because you're going to

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.629 
intake gasket because you're going to
need<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.440> read<00:04:26.440> gasket<00:04:26.950> that<00:04:27.160> I'm<00:04:27.400> going<00:04:27.610> to

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
need to read gasket that I'm going to

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.909 
need to read gasket that I'm going to
put<00:04:27.820> a<00:04:27.850> little<00:04:28.030> gasket<00:04:28.600> sealer<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.139> always<00:04:29.650> do

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
put a little gasket sealer I always do

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.820 
put a little gasket sealer I always do
just<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.340> have<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.520> extra<00:04:30.880> added<00:04:31.450> safety

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
just to have that extra added safety

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.529 
just to have that extra added safety
it's<00:04:32.830> not<00:04:32.979> necessary<00:04:33.520> but<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:34.060> know<00:04:34.180> I'd

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
it's not necessary but you know I'd

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.900 
it's not necessary but you know I'd
rather<00:04:34.720> be<00:04:35.050> safe<00:04:35.229> than<00:04:35.260> sorry<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.950> it<00:04:36.760> always

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
rather be safe than sorry and it always

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.700 
rather be safe than sorry and it always
seems<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.330> work<00:04:37.419> well<00:04:37.690> whenever<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.169> do<00:04:38.229> gasket

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
seems to work well whenever I do gasket

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.190 
seems to work well whenever I do gasket
sealer<00:04:38.979> in<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.430> new<00:04:39.550> manifold<00:04:40.030> gasket<00:04:40.599> just

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
sealer in a new manifold gasket just

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.529 
sealer in a new manifold gasket just
like<00:04:41.349> double<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.680> protection<00:04:42.120> but<00:04:43.120> that's

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
like double the protection but that's

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.120 
like double the protection but that's
pretty<00:04:43.690> much<00:04:43.810> it<00:04:43.930> bolts<00:04:44.470> everything<00:04:44.770> back<00:04:44.919> up

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
pretty much it bolts everything back up

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.320 
pretty much it bolts everything back up
you're<00:04:45.310> going<00:04:45.400> to<00:04:45.460> have<00:04:45.520> to<00:04:45.789> go<00:04:45.880> out<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.030> get<00:04:46.300> a

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
you're going to have to go out and get a

you're going to have to go out and get a
new<00:04:46.510> intake<00:04:46.810> gasket<00:04:47.320> which<00:04:47.530> I've<00:04:47.680> already<00:04:47.950> got

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
new intake gasket which I've already got

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.600 
new intake gasket which I've already got
one<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:49.110> they're<00:04:50.110> like<00:04:50.800> four<00:04:51.099> dollars<00:04:51.250> I

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
one and they're like four dollars I

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.740 
one and they're like four dollars I

with<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.930> non-vtec<00:04:56.320> motor<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.979> they're<00:04:57.220> like

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
three ninety-nine and it's pretty cheap
