00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.430
 hello my name is natalya 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.240
 bolshakova i mostar tsumami kanzashi 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.790
 tsenami kanzashi 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.309
 This is a Japanese technique of folding colors 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.599
 of satin ribbons than today we are with you 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.490
 We are going to do decoration of this technique here 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.500
 such a hairpin and for this we 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.220
 the following materials will be required 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 this is a satin ribbon of two colors white 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.390
 blue thread stamens pin glue 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.550
 The first step is to cut the tape 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.850
 necessary for one petal in 5 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.719
 cut off 8 centimeters now we have them 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.390
 cut these points that we measure 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.800
 now we do the same with white 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.410
 ribbon 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.079
 we should have this much 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.489
 petals 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:00.149
 take 1 petal turn to itself 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.899
 seamy side and fold on 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.329
 the middle 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.880
 on thong it is desirable that you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.439
 we are here right angle 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.619
 channel 100 degrees and further this tip 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.110
 we put up and we end on top 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.810
 triangle and bow 1 petal ready 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.420
 that's how it looks like from the front 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.670
 Udary rear view 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.710
 now we will string these 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.899
 petals on a string 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.659
 insert the corner into the edge on a little bit 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:41.369
 closer to the middle of doing so that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:44.539
 midpoint was a line and output with 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.490
 of the other edge that is such a stitch we 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.619
 pave so that we have in the future 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.009
 when the grid turned out 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.569
 the fold is exactly centered the same thing we 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.569
 do with the rest of the petals 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.530
 after we imposed everything 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.280
 we got the petals on a string 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.060
 such here 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.220
 rope petal now we collect 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.190
 flower 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:18.910
 gently tightening the petals and tying 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.610
 a bundle of debt do not need the same 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.810
 most we do with the second flower 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.380
 and we should have 2 identical 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.830
 asv 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.459
 one white 2 head now we need 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.600
 to decorate 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.160
 top white flower with stamens and 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.750
 decorate the middle for this to us 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.550
 required through the stamens 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.830
 we cut stamens for this we take one 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.750
 we fold the video in half and somewhere 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.430
 about in the middle we cut off the tail 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.480
 we get two separate small 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.370
 stamens we take one stamen and we lower 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.820
 tail right there 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.060
 Now that the larva we put at the center of 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.840
 thread after we pasted all 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.940
 Th you one flower we got here 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.829
 such mastic we take again blood and 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.200
 we put a small flower in the center 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.920
 a little bit 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.959
 Now we put our middle in exactly 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.730
 center the flower and press down a little 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:33.680
 now we have to connect 20 . 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.569
 in one so that between the white petals 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.680
 looked through the blue but we take with you 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:47.340
 hot gun drip droplet to the center 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:50.250
 paper and flowers quick cent movement 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.319
 from the day from the center and now the most 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.870
 interesting so that the flower does not look 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:57.560
 flat we immediately press on 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.890
 the middle and the petals rise 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.239
 now we have to glue our little flower 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.690
 on the basis we again use 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:13.500
 hot smear pin and immediately 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.060
 do we apply a flower now we 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.010
 make it very beautiful 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.740
 split 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.680
 law point this flower need to apply 

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:27.100
 not only here for example you can in this 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.250
 different color and fasten these flowers on 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.300
 The basis of the bezel with you was Natalia badge 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.420
 whom I address success in your 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.420
 creative work
