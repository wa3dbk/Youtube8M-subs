the<00:00:19.400> maybe<00:00:20.510> most<00:00:21.680> powerful<00:00:22.680> new<00:00:23.189> function

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the maybe most powerful new function

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.890 
the maybe most powerful new function
problem<00:00:24.300> cinema<00:00:24.660> 4d<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.560> 16<00:00:26.400> yes<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
problem cinema 4d are 16 yes it's just a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.550 
problem cinema 4d are 16 yes it's just a
little<00:00:28.189> function<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.490> new<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.199> think

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
little function a new one but I think

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.200 
little function a new one but I think
it's<00:00:32.009> very<00:00:32.700> cool<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.329> use<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.579> yeah<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.820> may

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it's very cool to use and yeah you may

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.799 
it's very cool to use and yeah you may
be<00:00:36.270> sort<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> new<00:00:37.380> interface<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:38.809> this

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
be sort on the new interface is this

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.260 
be sort on the new interface is this
tiny<00:00:40.350> button<00:00:40.860> yeah<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:43.129> viewport

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
tiny button yeah it's it's a viewport

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.299 
tiny button yeah it's it's a viewport
soloing<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.629> function<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.100> means

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
soloing a function so and that means

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.900 
soloing a function so and that means
then<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.420> select<00:00:49.350> an<00:00:49.500> object<00:00:51.620> go<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> views<00:00:53.640> so

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
then I select an object go to views so

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.490 
then I select an object go to views so
little<00:00:54.180> signal<00:00:55.670> just<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:57.270> object<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.230> left

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
little signal just this object is left

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.830 
little signal just this object is left
on<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> scene<00:00:59.039> and<00:01:00.109> every<00:01:01.109> other<00:01:01.410> object<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
on the scene and every other object and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.510 
on the scene and every other object and
something<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.170> hidden<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:06.180> show<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
something is hidden so and I show you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.500 
something is hidden so and I show you
how<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.670> works<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.510> complex<00:01:10.260> scene<00:01:11.510> for

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
how this works on a complex scene for

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.640 
how this works on a complex scene for
example<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.990> match<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.259> convex

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
example so this is a match but convex

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.380 
example so this is a match but convex
seem<00:01:16.830> okay<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:18.810> see<00:01:20.509> there's<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:23.119> forest<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
seem okay and you see there's a forest a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.840 
seem okay and you see there's a forest a
car<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:25.080> fly<00:01:25.590> huh<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.220> some<00:01:27.119> stuff<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.770> my

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
car a fly huh and some stuff and my

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.880 
car a fly huh and some stuff and my
framerate<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.540> 15<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:32.600> now<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.659> example<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
framerate is at 15 so now for example I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
framerate is at 15 so now for example I
have<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.840> we<00:01:37.520> create<00:01:38.520> an<00:01:38.759> animation<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
have to we create an animation in the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.929 
have to we create an animation in the
scene<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:41.369> past

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
scene and and past

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.620 
scene and and past
okay<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.470> latest<00:01:43.799> versions<00:01:44.420> when<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
okay and the latest versions when I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.990 
okay and the latest versions when I
speed<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.110> my<00:01:46.259> scene<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.130> maybe<00:01:47.670> switch

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
speed up my scene I have to maybe switch

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.840 
speed up my scene I have to maybe switch
off<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.750> forest<00:01:49.500> yeah<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.210> faster

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
off the forest yeah now it's it's faster

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.160 
off the forest yeah now it's it's faster
yeah<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.270> fast<00:01:54.689> enough<00:01:55.579> and<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:57.750> switch

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
yeah but not fast enough and I switch

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.120 
yeah but not fast enough and I switch
off<00:01:58.350> something<00:01:58.740> more<00:01:59.960> layering<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.500> staff<00:02:01.829> or

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
off something more layering the staff or

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.819 
off something more layering the staff or
something<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.899> lauren<00:02:03.899> zima<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.439> me<00:02:04.560> there

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
something and lauren zima for me there

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.600 
something and lauren zima for me there
is<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.340> very<00:02:05.640> very<00:02:05.729> fast<00:02:06.270> solution<00:02:06.960> with<00:02:07.610> solo

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
is a very very fast solution with solo

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.040 
is a very very fast solution with solo
switching

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
switching

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.390 
switching
just<00:02:10.320> things<00:02:10.800> for<00:02:11.070> example<00:02:11.520> when<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> hit<00:02:13.400> just

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
just things for example when I hit just

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.390 
just things for example when I hit just
the<00:02:14.520> car<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.560> go<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:19.440> plot<00:02:19.680> solo<00:02:20.010> here<00:02:20.370> a

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
the car and go to you plot solo here a

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.030 
the car and go to you plot solo here a
key<00:02:20.670> because<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> car<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:22.320> enough<00:02:22.940> Hiroki<00:02:23.940> I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
key because the car is enough Hiroki I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.000 
key because the car is enough Hiroki I
know<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.720> car<00:02:27.960> on<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.500> screen<00:02:28.770> and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
know if just the car on the screen and

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.860 
know if just the car on the screen and
can<00:02:29.250> animate<00:02:29.730> them<00:02:30.710> and<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.910> see<00:02:33.120> my<00:02:33.300> my

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
can animate them and you see my my

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.180 
can animate them and you see my my
report<00:02:34.410> speed<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.430> now<00:02:36.560> yeah<00:02:37.560> three<00:02:38.160> times

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
report speed is now yeah three times

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.160 
report speed is now yeah three times
more<00:02:38.820> than<00:02:39.800> with<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.920> whole<00:02:41.100> team<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:42.170> yeah

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
more than with the whole team and yeah

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.650 
more than with the whole team and yeah
it's<00:02:43.350> just<00:02:43.500> great<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.700> same<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.150> with<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
it's just great and the same is with the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.460 
it's just great and the same is with the
environment<00:02:46.080> yeah<00:02:46.560> when<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:46.950> switched<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.490> off

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
environment yeah when I switched to off

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.220 
environment yeah when I switched to off
and<00:02:49.580> on<00:02:50.870> there's<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:52.230> environment<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.220> now

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
and on there's just environment and now

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.370 
and on there's just environment and now
you<00:02:55.230> maybe<00:02:55.530> think<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.910> switching<00:02:57.690> on

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
you maybe think a this switching on

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.640 
you maybe think a this switching on
office<00:02:59.130> strange<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.630> yes<00:03:00.900> there<00:03:01.500> are<00:03:01.530> some

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
office strange and yes there are some

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.810 
office strange and yes there are some
more<00:03:03.920> fluid<00:03:04.920> anyway<00:03:05.930> when<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.820> activate

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
more fluid anyway when you activate

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.330 
more fluid anyway when you activate
viewports<00:03:09.390> oral<00:03:09.660> selection<00:03:10.350> then<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.980> just

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
viewports oral selection then you just

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.490 
viewports oral selection then you just
have<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.450> objects<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:16.940> select<00:03:18.200> right<00:03:19.200> in

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
have the objects you select right in

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:27.500 
have the objects you select right in
your<00:03:21.650> object<00:03:22.650> manager<00:03:23.370> like<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.440> so<00:03:26.390> so<00:03:27.390> on

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
your object manager like this so so on

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.190 
your object manager like this so so on
and<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.050> is<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.430> very<00:03:29.430> great<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:30.750> looks<00:03:30.900> easy

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
and this is a very great it looks easy

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.100 
and this is a very great it looks easy
and<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:32.550> don't<00:03:32.910> know<00:03:33.120> why<00:03:33.300> we're<00:03:33.510> having<00:03:33.900> this

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
and I don't know why we're having this

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.210 
and I don't know why we're having this
before<00:03:35.360> it's<00:03:36.360> it's<00:03:36.570> very<00:03:36.630> easy<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.500> switch

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
before it's it's very easy to switch

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.150 
before it's it's very easy to switch
between<00:03:38.250> single<00:03:39.209> objects<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.080> have<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.920> full

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
between single objects and have the full

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.670 
between single objects and have the full
frame<00:03:41.610> rate<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:42.000> your<00:03:44.030> viewport<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.780> animate

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
frame rate of your viewport to animate

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.520 
frame rate of your viewport to animate
them<00:03:47.120> because<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:48.780> very<00:03:48.900> important<00:03:49.440> when

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
them because it's very important when

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.960 
them because it's very important when
you<00:03:49.680> doing<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.550> movie<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.590> 25<00:03:52.590> or<00:03:52.860> 30<00:03:53.220> frames<00:03:53.820> per

second and you part as just 50 frames a
second<00:03:58.650> or<00:03:58.709> something

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
second or something

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.050

you<00:04:00.450> always<00:04:00.660> have<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.050> pre<00:04:01.860> render<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.430> to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.330 

control<00:04:06.060> if<00:04:06.269> everything<00:04:06.959> is<00:04:07.230> okay<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:07.920> when

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
control if everything is okay and when

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.660 
control if everything is okay and when
you<00:04:08.430> have<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.820> higher<00:04:09.800> frame<00:04:10.800> rate<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.220> you

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
you have the higher frame rate in you

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.820 
you have the higher frame rate in you
you<00:04:12.180> port<00:04:12.480> you<00:04:12.630> can<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:13.019> everything<00:04:13.530> in<00:04:13.650> real

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
you port you can do everything in real

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.310 
you port you can do everything in real
time<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.400> saves<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.390> course<00:04:15.840> time

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
time and this saves of course time

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.039 
time and this saves of course time
because<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:16.950> happen<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.660> program<00:04:18.660> nothing's

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
because you happen to program nothing's

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.229 
because you happen to program nothing's
or<00:04:19.350> something<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.340> just<00:04:20.549> great<00:04:20.789> yeah

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
or something and it's just great yeah

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.480 
or something and it's just great yeah
and

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
and

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.490 
and
little<00:04:22.759> tiny<00:04:22.970> function<00:04:23.449> or<00:04:23.630> when<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.289> ask

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
little tiny function or when you ask

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.700 
little tiny function or when you ask
yourself<00:04:25.509> there<00:04:26.509> are<00:04:26.660> just<00:04:26.900> two<00:04:27.289> options

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710

hierarchy and in most cases in my case
as<00:04:35.449> I<00:04:35.990> work<00:04:36.710> of<00:04:36.860> hierarchies<00:04:37.400> yeah

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
as I work of hierarchies yeah

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.999 
as I work of hierarchies yeah
because<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.569> really<00:04:38.900> like<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.080> put<00:04:39.590> some

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
because I really like to put some

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.770 
because I really like to put some
objects<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.610> uncivil<00:04:41.000> objects<00:04:41.539> and<00:04:41.660> then

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
objects and uncivil objects and then

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.529 
objects and uncivil objects and then
animators<00:04:42.289> who<00:04:42.440> are<00:04:42.560> object<00:04:43.009> this<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.789> a<00:04:44.090> very

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
animators who are object this is a very

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.439 
animators who are object this is a very
flexible<00:04:44.810> way<00:04:45.199> to<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:46.550> change<00:04:46.789> the<00:04:47.030> things

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
flexible way to to change the things

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.080 
flexible way to to change the things
after<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.590> animate<00:04:48.979> there's<00:04:49.400> your<00:04:49.550> object

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
after you animate there's your object

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.810 
after you animate there's your object
with<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.569> things<00:04:50.780> in<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.889> and<00:04:53.620> so<00:04:54.620> yeah<00:04:55.250> em<00:04:55.520> and

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
with the things in it and so yeah em and

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
with the things in it and so yeah em and
it's<00:04:56.120> yeah<00:04:58.300> switch<00:04:59.300> on<00:04:59.599> and<00:04:59.840> off<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:01.840> enable

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
it's yeah switch on and off and enable

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.770 
it's yeah switch on and off and enable
this<00:05:03.110> selection<00:05:03.949> function<00:05:04.430> or<00:05:04.729> not<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.419> I

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
this selection function or not and I

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.140 
this selection function or not and I
like<00:05:06.259> this<00:05:06.440> yeah<00:05:07.039> it'd<00:05:07.280> be<00:05:07.669> great

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
like this yeah it'd be great

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.529 
like this yeah it'd be great
you<00:05:08.750> see<00:05:09.099> forest<00:05:10.099> flyer<00:05:10.840> car<00:05:13.300> it's<00:05:14.300> great

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
you see forest flyer car it's great

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.120 
you see forest flyer car it's great
alright<00:05:15.409> okay

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
alright okay

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.879 
alright okay
it's<00:05:16.849> just<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.210> tiny<00:05:17.599> thing<00:05:17.960> but<00:05:17.990> but<00:05:18.440> very<00:05:18.740> very

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
it's just a tiny thing but but very very

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.260 
it's just a tiny thing but but very very
powerful<00:05:19.520> when<00:05:19.669> you're<00:05:19.759> working<00:05:20.150> with

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
powerful when you're working with

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.749 
powerful when you're working with
complex<00:05:20.509> scenes<00:05:21.020> imagine<00:05:22.009> you<00:05:22.430> will<00:05:22.610> have

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:22.759 
complex scenes imagine you will have

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:29.770 
complex scenes imagine you will have
some<00:05:26.169> architecture<00:05:27.169> scenes<00:05:27.830> with<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.780> whole

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
some architecture scenes with a whole

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.589 
some architecture scenes with a whole
city<00:05:30.169> in<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:30.530> background<00:05:30.740> you<00:05:31.370> just<00:05:31.729> animate

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
city in the background you just animate

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.149 
city in the background you just animate
a<00:05:32.900> little<00:05:33.530> butterfly<00:05:34.250> in<00:05:34.280> foreground<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:36.039> in<00:05:37.039> a

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
a little butterfly in foreground so in a

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.939 
a little butterfly in foreground so in a
concept<00:05:37.550> to<00:05:37.729> switch<00:05:38.060> of<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.300> things<00:05:38.690> and

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
concept to switch of the things and

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.189 
concept to switch of the things and
anomaly<00:05:39.949> and<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:40.340> I<00:05:40.789> don't<00:05:41.210> know<00:05:41.419> if<00:05:41.570> you<00:05:41.870> know

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
anomaly and and I don't know if you know

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.520 
anomaly and and I don't know if you know
when<00:05:42.860> you<00:05:43.009> for<00:05:43.250> example<00:05:44.259> didn't<00:05:45.259> have<00:05:45.380> this

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
when you for example didn't have this

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.060 
when you for example didn't have this
function<00:05:45.979> and<00:05:46.360> in<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:47.419> past<00:05:47.659> you<00:05:47.870> can<00:05:48.169> make

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
function and in the past you can make

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.430 
function and in the past you can make
the<00:05:49.400> forest<00:05:49.820> invisible<00:05:50.599> yeah

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
the forest invisible yeah

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.439 
the forest invisible yeah
but<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:53.360> instance<00:05:54.349> scene<00:05:54.860> -<00:05:55.009> the<00:05:55.250> forest<00:05:55.729> in

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
but the instance scene - the forest in

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.070 
but the instance scene - the forest in
his<00:05:57.430> calculation<00:05:58.430> in<00:05:58.490> Turkey<00:05:58.820> so<00:05:59.360> it<00:05:59.690> still

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
his calculation in Turkey so it still

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.020 
his calculation in Turkey so it still
needs<00:06:00.469> some<00:06:01.900> frame<00:06:02.900> right<00:06:03.110> you<00:06:03.320> see<00:06:03.500> here<00:06:04.159> it's

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
needs some frame right you see here it's
