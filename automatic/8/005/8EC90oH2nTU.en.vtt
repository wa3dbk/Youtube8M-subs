00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
the previous custom maps that I had

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
played where there was kind of those

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.770 
played where there was kind of those
like<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.710> path<00:03:11.100> like<00:03:11.460> maybe<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.790> gravel<00:03:12.270> path<00:03:12.480> or

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
and it just goes off into random

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.320 
and it just goes off into random

didn't<00:03:45.510> intend<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:46.230> instant<00:03:47.040> death<00:03:47.190> because

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
didn't intend it's instant death because

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.470 
didn't intend it's instant death because
I<00:03:47.940> don't<00:03:48.270> want<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.900> don't<00:03:49.560> want<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:49.770> to<00:03:49.800> ruin

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
I don't want it I don't want it to ruin

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.470 
I don't want it I don't want it to ruin
the<00:03:51.480> flow<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.830> map<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:53.970> was<00:03:54.270> going<00:03:54.420> to

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
the flow of the map so I was going to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.570 
the flow of the map so I was going to
put<00:03:54.600> water<00:03:54.750> at<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.020> very<00:03:55.260> bottom<00:03:55.470> but<00:03:55.950> then

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
put water at the very bottom but then

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.430 
put water at the very bottom but then
I'm<00:03:56.700> like<00:03:56.730> well<00:03:57.240> if<00:03:57.420> somebody<00:03:57.600> falls<00:03:57.900> off<00:03:58.170> then

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
I'm like well if somebody falls off then

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.020 
I'm like well if somebody falls off then
they'll<00:03:58.590> survive<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.370> don't<00:03:59.550> want<00:03:59.730> them<00:03:59.910> to

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
they'll survive and I don't want them to

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.250 
they'll survive and I don't want them to
survive<00:04:00.209> because<00:04:00.660> then<00:04:00.870> there's<00:04:01.020> going<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.230> be

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
survive because then there's going to be

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.590 
survive because then there's going to be
just<00:04:01.470> trapped<00:04:01.800> on<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.070> bottom<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:03.209> I'll<00:04:03.570> just

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
just trapped on the bottom so I'll just

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600 
just trapped on the bottom so I'll just
I'll<00:04:04.020> just<00:04:04.080> remove<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.560> all<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:05.040> then<00:04:05.160> they<00:04:05.310> go

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
I'll just remove it all and then they go

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.020 
I'll just remove it all and then they go
into<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.880> void<00:04:06.290> as<00:04:07.290> far<00:04:07.560> as<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.860> name<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.520> had

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
into the void as far as the name I had

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.300 
into the void as far as the name I had
like<00:04:09.240> five<00:04:09.720> different<00:04:09.959> names<00:04:10.410> for<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.860> map<00:04:11.100> I

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
like five different names for the map I

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.100 
like five different names for the map I
can't<00:04:11.640> even<00:04:11.760> remember<00:04:11.880> what<00:04:12.450> they<00:04:12.600> were<00:04:12.630> I

playing castlevania on Nintendo and

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.190 
playing castlevania on Nintendo and
Castlevania<00:05:05.250> had<00:05:05.550> a<00:05:06.770> very<00:05:08.630> very<00:05:09.630> strict

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200

Castlevania had a very very strict
design<00:05:10.950> philosophy<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:11.820> had<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.720> really

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
design philosophy it had a really

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.430 
design philosophy it had a really
awesome<00:05:13.560> flow<00:05:14.330> where<00:05:15.330> items<00:05:15.990> were<00:05:16.140> placed

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
awesome flow where items were placed

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.200 
awesome flow where items were placed
very<00:05:16.650> strategically<00:05:17.310> monsters<00:05:17.880> will<00:05:18.030> place

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
very strategically monsters will place

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.300 
very strategically monsters will place
very<00:05:18.450> strategically<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:19.380> it<00:05:19.620> was<00:05:19.740> extremely

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
very strategically and it was extremely

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.230 
very strategically and it was extremely
hard<00:05:21.979> Egoraptor<00:05:22.979> actually<00:05:23.550> did<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.790> really

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
hard Egoraptor actually did a really

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.390 
hard Egoraptor actually did a really
really<00:05:24.330> good<00:05:24.570> review<00:05:25.139> out<00:05:25.290> of<00:05:25.410> it<00:05:25.560> it's<00:05:26.280> a

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
really good review out of it it's a

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.659 
really good review out of it it's a
little<00:05:26.610> crap<00:05:27.180> not<00:05:27.660> graphic<00:05:27.870> but<00:05:28.260> he<00:05:29.040> swears<00:05:29.520> a

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
little crap not graphic but he swears a

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.180 
little crap not graphic but he swears a
little<00:05:29.850> bit<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.410> people<00:05:31.410> should<00:05:31.440> be<00:05:31.650> aware<00:05:32.010> of

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
little bit so people should be aware of

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.530 
little bit so people should be aware of
that<00:05:32.430> but<00:05:33.800> so<00:05:34.800> I<00:05:34.860> try<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.250> follow<00:05:35.729> that<00:05:36.000> design

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
that but so I try to follow that design

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.420 
that but so I try to follow that design
philosophy<00:05:37.020> I<00:05:37.050> wanted<00:05:37.410> everything<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:37.800> flow

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
philosophy I wanted everything to flow

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.950 
philosophy I wanted everything to flow
really<00:05:38.820> well<00:05:39.000> and<00:05:39.270> I<00:05:39.510> want<00:05:39.690> it<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:39.780> be<00:05:39.870> very

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
really well and I want it to be very

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.230 
really well and I want it to be very
very<00:05:40.290> hard<00:05:40.800> so<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.250> sequel<00:05:41.640> is<00:05:41.850> actually

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
very hard so the sequel is actually

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.990 
very hard so the sequel is actually
going<00:05:42.360> to<00:05:42.450> ramp<00:05:42.720> up<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.650> difficulty<00:05:44.070> just<00:05:44.850> a

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
going to ramp up the difficulty just a

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.090 
going to ramp up the difficulty just a
little<00:05:45.240> bit<00:05:45.390> for<00:05:46.380> the<00:05:46.410> simple<00:05:46.770> reason<00:05:46.800> that

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
little bit for the simple reason that

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.219 
little bit for the simple reason that
there's<00:05:47.490> more<00:05:47.700> stuff<00:05:48.150> in<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.690> game<00:05:48.870> there's

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
potions there's enchantments things like

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.670 
potions there's enchantments things like
that<00:05:51.720> and<00:05:52.500> also<00:05:52.770> there's<00:05:53.070> there's<00:05:53.370> more<00:05:53.610> you

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
that and also there's there's more you

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.779 
that and also there's there's more you
utilities<00:05:55.680> that<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:55.919> get<00:05:56.190> to<00:05:56.220> use<00:05:56.490> as<00:05:56.760> a

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
utilities that I get to use as a

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.040 
utilities that I get to use as a
mapmaker<00:05:57.090> and<00:05:58.610> so<00:05:59.610> it's<00:06:00.330> it's<00:06:00.660> going<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:00.900> be

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
mapmaker and so it's it's going to be

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.860 
mapmaker and so it's it's going to be
about<00:06:01.410> twice<00:06:01.860> as<00:06:02.100> big<00:06:02.419> it's<00:06:03.419> going<00:06:03.690> to<00:06:03.720> be<00:06:03.840> a

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
about twice as big it's going to be a

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.670 
about twice as big it's going to be a
little<00:06:04.200> bit<00:06:04.410> more<00:06:04.560> difficult<00:06:04.850> but<00:06:06.500> it's<00:06:07.500> not

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
little bit more difficult but it's not

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.080 
little bit more difficult but it's not
going<00:06:07.800> to<00:06:07.890> be<00:06:07.979> to<00:06:08.130> the<00:06:08.160> point<00:06:08.400> of<00:06:08.640> utter

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
going to be to the point of utter

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.270 
going to be to the point of utter
frustration<00:06:09.360> it<00:06:09.960> will<00:06:10.200> be<00:06:10.350> beatable<00:06:10.650> but<00:06:10.979> it

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
frustration it will be beatable but it

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.860 
frustration it will be beatable but it
will<00:06:11.520> give<00:06:11.729> the<00:06:11.760> player<00:06:12.090> a<00:06:12.120> real<00:06:12.510> sense<00:06:12.780> of
