00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.710 
with um a case anyways I didn't think it
wouldn't<00:01:52.920> matter<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.700> before<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> had<00:01:54.360> chains

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
wouldn't matter and before I had chains

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.469 
wouldn't matter and before I had chains
sticking<00:01:55.140> out<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.530> like<00:01:55.860> um<00:01:56.159> my<00:01:56.640> 3ds<00:01:57.149> like

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
sticking out of like um my 3ds like

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.450 
sticking out of like um my 3ds like
keychains<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.049> stuff<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:59.009> got<00:01:59.159> too<00:01:59.280> heavy

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
keychains and stuff I just got too heavy

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.550 
keychains and stuff I just got too heavy
so<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.790> took<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.090> off<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:01.320> trying

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so I took it off and when I was trying

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.440 
so I took it off and when I was trying
to<00:02:01.619> record<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.280> cause<00:02:02.460> too<00:02:02.700> much<00:02:02.850> noise<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.390> I

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to record it cause too much noise so I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.840 
to record it cause too much noise so I
took<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.810> off<00:02:04.130> but<00:02:05.130> I'm<00:02:05.280> trying<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.549> take<00:02:05.700> off

but yeah I bought my 3ds

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.580 
but yeah I bought my 3ds
one<00:02:13.470> day<00:02:14.600> because<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> couldn't<00:02:16.080> find<00:02:16.350> I

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
one day because I couldn't find I

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.680 
one day because I couldn't find I
thought<00:02:16.920> they<00:02:17.130> sold<00:02:17.610> out<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.060> stores<00:02:18.330> but

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
thought they sold out in the stores but

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.860 
thought they sold out in the stores but
unfortunately<00:02:19.320> after<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.740> fought<00:02:20.160> my<00:02:20.480> 3ds<00:02:21.480> I

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
unfortunately after I fought my 3ds I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.570 
unfortunately after I fought my 3ds I
found<00:02:22.080> out<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.410> they<00:02:22.590> did<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:23.070> it<00:02:23.310> at<00:02:23.520> a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
found out that they did have it at a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.030 
found out that they did have it at a
store<00:02:23.970> nearby<00:02:24.180> me<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.650> could<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:25.890> been

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
store nearby me and it could have been

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.530 
store nearby me and it could have been
cheaper<00:02:26.520> because<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.820> bought<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.240> think

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
cheaper because I bought this I think

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.650 
cheaper because I bought this I think
$20<00:02:28.290> more<00:02:28.740> -<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.670> okay<00:02:30.000> because<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.240> really<00:02:30.480> like

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
$20 more - is okay because I really like

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.280 
$20 more - is okay because I really like
this<00:02:30.810> case

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
this case

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.640 
this case
so<00:02:31.530> without<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:33.060> case<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.690> how<00:02:33.900> -<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.590> know

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so without the case is how - I know

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.860 
so without the case is how - I know
three<00:02:34.920> days<00:02:35.010> looks<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.550> I<00:02:35.730> totally<00:02:36.540> forgot
