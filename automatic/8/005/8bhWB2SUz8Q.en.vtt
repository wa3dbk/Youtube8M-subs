here<00:00:07.680> we're<00:00:08.389> doing<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.599> clicker<00:00:09.930> placement

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
here we're doing a clicker placement

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.040 
here we're doing a clicker placement
national<00:00:11.900> 5:7<00:00:12.410> fall

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.050 
national 5:7 fall

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.049 
national 5:7 fall
I<00:00:14.080> show<00:00:14.410> you<00:00:14.470> in<00:00:14.560> a<00:00:14.620> minute<00:00:14.790> didn't<00:00:15.790> tell<00:00:15.970> you

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
I show you in a minute didn't tell you

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.260 
I show you in a minute didn't tell you
about<00:00:16.120> all<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:16.720> copper<00:00:16.900> plates<00:00:17.200> very<00:00:17.380> well

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
about all the copper plates very well

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.230 
about all the copper plates very well
but<00:00:19.270> problems<00:00:19.840> are<00:00:20.050> if<00:00:20.200> you<00:00:20.320> look<00:00:20.470> on<00:00:20.680> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
but problems are if you look on the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.810 
but problems are if you look on the
flywheel<00:00:22.240> here<00:00:23.070> if<00:00:24.070> you<00:00:24.220> can<00:00:24.369> see<00:00:24.400> it<00:00:24.670> up

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
flywheel here if you can see it up

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.470 
flywheel here if you can see it up
there's<00:00:25.029> a<00:00:25.619> crack<00:00:26.619> in<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:27.040> flywheel<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
there's a crack in the flywheel and

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.960 
there's a crack in the flywheel and
their<00:00:28.630> crack<00:00:28.840> here<00:00:29.050> as<00:00:29.290> well<00:00:29.700> so<00:00:30.700> I'll<00:00:30.820> think

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
their crack here as well so I'll think

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.260 
their crack here as well so I'll think
it<00:00:31.060> bit<00:00:31.210> trip<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.570> breakers<00:00:31.990> and<00:00:32.190> a<00:00:33.270> new

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
it bit trip to the breakers and a new

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.340 
it bit trip to the breakers and a new
flywheel<00:00:35.550> back<00:00:36.550> in<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:36.820> workshop<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:38.140> is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
flywheel back in the workshop this is

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.639 
flywheel back in the workshop this is
the<00:00:38.530> coach<00:00:39.340> plate<00:00:39.640> that<00:00:39.850> came<00:00:40.030> after<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.649> five

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
the coach plate that came after the five

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.680 
the coach plate that came after the five
seven<00:00:41.860> four<00:00:42.630> still<00:00:44.940> still<00:00:45.940> pretty<00:00:45.970> good<00:00:46.390> still

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
seven four still still pretty good still

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.020 
seven four still still pretty good still
on<00:00:46.870> you<00:00:47.140> it's<00:00:48.039> a<00:00:48.070> nice<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.460> tight<00:00:48.699> this<00:00:49.449> is<00:00:49.600> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
on you it's a nice and tight this is the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.979 
on you it's a nice and tight this is the
the<00:00:52.350> gold<00:00:53.350> plate<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.980> clock<00:00:54.329> come<00:00:55.329> out<00:00:55.539> and

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
the gold plate the clock come out and

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.549 
the gold plate the clock come out and
problem<00:00:56.350> with<00:00:56.469> this<00:00:56.559> is<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:59.730> leaders<00:01:00.730> are<00:01:00.850> on

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
problem with this is the leaders are on

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.130 
problem with this is the leaders are on
some<00:01:02.559> reason<00:01:03.039> this<00:01:03.460> one's<00:01:03.760> higher<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.989> it's

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
some reason this one's higher and it's

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.250 
some reason this one's higher and it's
almost<00:01:05.530> warm<00:01:06.400> through<00:01:06.820> so<00:01:07.690> it's<00:01:07.870> not<00:01:08.050> being

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
almost warm through so it's not being

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.760 
almost warm through so it's not being
adjusted<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:10.180> should<00:01:10.450> all<00:01:10.570> be<00:01:10.600> level<00:01:11.020> but

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
adjusted they should all be level but

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.710 
adjusted they should all be level but
obviously<00:01:12.040> they're<00:01:12.220> not<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:13.240> that's<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.510> bit<00:01:13.630> of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
obviously they're not so that's a bit of

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.560 
obviously they're not so that's a bit of
adjustment<00:01:13.810> there<00:01:14.320> that<00:01:14.470> needs<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:15.540> quite<00:01:16.540> a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
adjustment there that needs a quite a

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.200 
adjustment there that needs a quite a
bit<00:01:16.780> of<00:01:16.840> adjustment<00:01:17.200> there<00:01:17.500> that<00:01:17.680> needs

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
bit of adjustment there that needs

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.980 
bit of adjustment there that needs
sorting<00:01:19.210> out<00:01:21.270> we'll<00:01:22.270> probably<00:01:22.390> see<00:01:22.630> there's

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
sorting out we'll probably see there's

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.660 
sorting out we'll probably see there's
like<00:01:23.820> between<00:01:24.820> these<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:28.360> probably<00:01:28.720> Oh<00:01:28.750> God

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
like between these just probably Oh God

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.340 
like between these just probably Oh God
but<00:01:30.670> our<00:01:30.820> good<00:01:31.360> inch<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.890> in<00:01:33.220> these<00:01:33.370> so<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:35.320> I

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
but our good inch out in these so that I

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.040 
but our good inch out in these so that I
need<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.620> be<00:01:35.740> rectified<00:01:36.510> so<00:01:37.510> I<00:01:37.540> think<00:01:37.600> we'll<00:01:37.930> be

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
need to be rectified so I think we'll be

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.020 
need to be rectified so I think we'll be
going<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.380> breakers<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.400> second<00:01:39.940> and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
going to the breakers in a second and

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.590 
going to the breakers in a second and
flywheel<00:01:40.570> good<00:01:41.470> place<00:01:41.620> one<00:01:41.830> that's<00:01:42.010> cracked

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
flywheel good place one that's cracked

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.110 
flywheel good place one that's cracked
maybe<00:01:43.600> see<00:01:43.870> if<00:01:43.990> we<00:01:44.110> can<00:01:44.230> get<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.760> your<00:01:45.760> second

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
maybe see if we can get a your second

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.610 
maybe see if we can get a your second
uncover<00:01:46.450> plate<00:01:46.720> or<00:01:48.330> at<00:01:49.330> least<00:01:49.570> some<00:01:50.440> more

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
uncover plate or at least some more

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.820 
uncover plate or at least some more
levers<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.330> maybe<00:01:52.330> get<00:01:52.540> some<00:01:52.570> new<00:01:52.870> Springs<00:01:53.230> to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
levers and maybe get some new Springs to

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.010 
levers and maybe get some new Springs to
go<00:01:53.980> in<00:01:54.100> as<00:01:54.220> well<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.420> we'll<00:01:55.570> see<00:01:55.720> how<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.930> all

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
go in as well and we'll see how it all

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.980 
go in as well and we'll see how it all
pans<00:01:56.650> out
