00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.550
 of the mini ipad so the new tablet 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.170
 of apple in 7.9 format pushes this 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.310
 tablet in fact we will see together the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.169
 technical characteristics 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.029
 so she is available in two 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.470
 versions so be black and slates we 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.900
 this is the version we have here 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.369
 you see the back is slate or 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.880
 then in white and silver 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.140
 so there is the wifi version and another 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.390
 wi-fi + 3g version 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.200
 every time we can have a model 16 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.510
 32 or 64 giga on the dimensions 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.680
 of this table is so high it 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.989
 exactly 200 mm wide 134 7 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.690
 mm and in depth it only makes 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.430
 7.2 mm so I do not know if it makes good 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.620
 the camera but had really very very 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.250
 fine as a tablet at the weight level 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.010
 so the wifi version it is 308 g and 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.440
 the wi-fi version + 3g 312 grams so 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.160
 there really is a difference is minimal 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.289
 between the wi fi version and 3g so the 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.970
 tablet she obviously ships the 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.690
 wifi network just to connect to the wifi has 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.429
 bgn and bluetooth 4.0 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.259
 regarding the touch screen so that's 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.390
 exactly the same screen as for the ipad 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.310
 2 there's no retina display of 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.830
 unfortunately so obviously we will have 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.810
 the right to an ipad mini retina by six 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.990
 month in my opinion so here is a screen 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.780
 in fact a classic led screen of 7.9 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.550
 inches with ps technology so that's 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.369
 the same techno that were used to 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.830
 the ipad 2 the resolution ditto it's like 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.039
 for ipad 2 we have the right to 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.729
 1024 by 768 pixels with a density of 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:49.550
 163 dpi the processor the same as the ipad 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.080
 2 so a processor a5 bicoeur damage 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.670
 we do not have the right to the new 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.250
 processors like for the new ipad 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.729
 but hey we feel we 'll stick to that 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.590
 but to finally say the speed the 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.420
 the ipad 2 still turns out well it's 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.160
 a good tablet 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.620
 about the webcam so we have a 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.710
 webcam here so apple call it the 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.970
 the facetime camera webcam so that's it 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.130
 the facetime hd 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.110
 the resolution actually when we take 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.380
 photos with the facetime camera 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.750
 we have a resolution of 1.2 megapixels and 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.320
 when recording with the camera 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.090
 facetime 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:30.410
 we have a 720p HD video resolution 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:34.310
 behind we have here a device 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.610
 photo / video back so that apple 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.430
 call the the isight camera so 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.530
 the photo resolution and 5 megapixel 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.400
 and resolution when you take 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.670
 videos so that's a hd resolution in 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.670
 1080p 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.410
 so concerning the battery it's a 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.050
 Lithium polymer battery after 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.810
 apple the autonomy so in use 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.520
 wifi goes up to 10 hours which is 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.560
 quite correct we did the test 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.200
 we realized that between 8 and 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.050
 9 am and our skis and ski approaches in 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.220
 makes the version wi-fi + 3g and finally 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.780
 so I'm showing you I'm doing you a 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.970
 last trick so as usual 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.220
 for apple apple tablets 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.590
 here we have the main button so if we 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.250
 long press one accesses directly to 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.890
 thierry if we double click there I'll 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.810
 to leave if we double click we access the 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.760
 multitasking 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.739
 we will see just below here there is the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.140
 lightning connector so this is the 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.840
 connector to charge his tablet or 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.370
 synchronize it with his pc so here we 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.250
 put the connector back to lightning and the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.290
 exit usb2 there is the right to two 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.120
 speakers the sound restitution and to 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.320
 its excellent we will see then when 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.900
 we'll do the audio test on the side here on 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.420
 to volume management no longer occupies - 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.100
 there we have a button either for the look is 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.170
 in fact the automatic rotation of 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.320
 the screen is to mute the sound for 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.560
 put in off in fact the the are all in 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.780
 top 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.709
 here we have the button to turn off and 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.300
 turn on the tablet 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:12.020
 here we have the microphone and finally we have 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.570
 so a 3.5mm jack input for 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.209
 add a headset an earphone actually 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.299
 to listen to music or video is 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.010
 on the side here we have nothing at all so 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.080
 that's it for the features 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.580
 techniques of the ipad mini which is well 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.240
 provided and that looks a lot like 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.240
 ipad 2
