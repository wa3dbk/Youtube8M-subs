free<00:00:04.440> weights<00:00:04.680> versus<00:00:05.069> machines<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.670> what<00:00:06.150> is

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
free weights versus machines and what is

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.639 
free weights versus machines and what is
better<00:00:06.390> for<00:00:06.480> fat<00:00:06.810> loss<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.230> what<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.500> better

is actually pretty simple guys what's

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.189 
is actually pretty simple guys what's
better<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.990> what<00:00:16.379> works<00:00:16.880> what<00:00:17.880> works<00:00:18.660> that's

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
better is what works what works that's

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.170 
better is what works what works that's
the<00:00:19.350> interaction<00:00:19.890> guys<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.279> don't<00:00:20.760> care<00:00:20.970> what

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the interaction guys I don't care what

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.460 
the interaction guys I don't care what
it<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.330> as<00:00:21.390> long<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.720> gets<00:00:21.930> results<00:00:22.199> that's

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
it is as long as gets results that's

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.590 
it is as long as gets results that's
what<00:00:22.650> matters<00:00:23.010> let's<00:00:23.730> get<00:00:23.910> after<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.240> so

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
what matters let's get after it so

things both work the only rule I have

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.710 
things both work the only rule I have
for<00:00:26.609> weight<00:00:26.730> training<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:27.269> building<00:00:27.570> myself

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
for weight training for building myself

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.330 
for weight training for building myself
or<00:00:27.960> anybody<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.250> have

or anybody that is that you have to have

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.279 
or anybody that is that you have to have
progression<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.510> progressing<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:31.140> your

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
progression are you progressing on your

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.900 
progression are you progressing on your
cardio<00:00:31.650> are<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.980> lifting<00:00:32.219> heavier<00:00:32.669> weights

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
cardio are you lifting heavier weights

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.370 
cardio are you lifting heavier weights
this<00:00:33.059> week<00:00:33.239> than<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.510> were<00:00:33.630> last<00:00:33.660> week<00:00:33.960> that

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
is all i care about i care about nothing

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.860 
is all i care about i care about nothing
else<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.899> guys<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.739> what<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:37.920> love<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:39.030> get

else so guys do what you love but get

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.229 
else so guys do what you love but get
stronger<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> get<00:00:41.280> stronger<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.940> it's

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
stronger but to get stronger and it's

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.090 
stronger but to get stronger and it's
easier<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.870> stronger<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.500> free<00:00:43.980> weights

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
easier to get stronger with free weights

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.319 
easier to get stronger with free weights
so<00:00:44.250> we<00:00:44.340> talked<00:00:44.489> about<00:00:44.579> progression<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> one

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
so we talked about progression and one

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.729 
so we talked about progression and one
of<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> biggest<00:00:45.719> waste<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.170> progression

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
of the biggest waste of progression

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.410 
of the biggest waste of progression
these<00:00:46.890> strength<00:00:47.280> increases<00:00:47.789> whether<00:00:48.270> you're

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
these strength increases whether you're

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.330 
these strength increases whether you're
adding<00:00:48.600> more<00:00:48.809> weight<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.320> bar<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
adding more weight to the bar or are you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.700 
adding more weight to the bar or are you
doing<00:00:50.640> extra<00:00:51.000> wet<00:00:51.180> wrap<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:52.110> best<00:00:52.379> way<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> do

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
doing extra wet wrap the best way to do

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.959 
doing extra wet wrap the best way to do
that<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.039> fruit<00:00:53.340> free<00:00:53.610> weights<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.910> can

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that is with fruit free weights you can

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.729 
that is with fruit free weights you can
get<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> whole<00:00:54.449> lot<00:00:54.480> stronger<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> deadlift

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
get a whole lot stronger on the deadlift

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.490 
get a whole lot stronger on the deadlift
then<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.910> hammer<00:00:57.270> shrug<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.870> example

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
then you can a hammer shrug for example

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.470 
then you can a hammer shrug for example
but<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> train<00:00:59.940> what<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> want<00:01:00.420> to

routine<00:01:06.630> i<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.830> accept<00:01:07.979> enjoy

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
routine i don't have to accept enjoy

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.250 
routine i don't have to accept enjoy
doing<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.810> times

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
doing it so there's at times

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.289 
doing it so there's at times
specifically<00:01:11.100> later<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.580> your<00:01:11.670> workout<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
specifically later in your workout is

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.300 
specifically later in your workout is
better<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.140> work<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.409> machines<00:01:13.799> since

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
better to work with machines since

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.370 
better to work with machines since
nerely<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:15.030> body's<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.390> toast<00:01:15.750> let's<00:01:16.229> take
