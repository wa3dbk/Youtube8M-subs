00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.670 
come
me<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:02.150> number<00:02:02.420> two<00:02:02.600> was<00:02:02.750> very<00:02:03.049> light<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.560> was

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
me the number two was very light it was

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.740 
me the number two was very light it was
almost<00:02:03.830> reminiscent<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:05.000> number<00:02:05.119> four<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.720> I

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
almost reminiscent of a number four so I

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.840 
almost reminiscent of a number four so I
was<00:02:05.930> like<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.229> know<00:02:06.259> why<00:02:07.250> not<00:02:07.460> go<00:02:07.580> for<00:02:07.610> the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
was like you know why not go for the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.400 
was like you know why not go for the
number<00:02:08.119> one<00:02:08.450> being<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:08.929> let's<00:02:09.110> see<00:02:09.229> how<00:02:09.349> that

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
number one being so let's see how that

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.920 
number one being so let's see how that
is<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:09.979> what<00:02:10.819> makes<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.090> even<00:02:11.209> better<00:02:11.390> is<00:02:11.810> that

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
is and what makes it even better is that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.339 
is and what makes it even better is that

sale this hair is soft it's manageable I
will<00:04:12.560> say<00:04:12.800> though<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.280> I<00:04:13.730> do<00:04:13.970> get<00:04:14.599> a<00:04:14.660> little

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
will say though that I do get a little

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.360 
will say though that I do get a little
bit<00:04:15.170> of<00:04:15.200> shedding<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.650> little<00:04:15.769> bit<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.070> tangling

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
bit of shedding a little bit of tangling

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.720 
bit of shedding a little bit of tangling
however<00:04:17.180> i<00:04:17.480> can<00:04:17.840> say<00:04:18.139> that<00:04:18.410> from<00:04:18.889> experiences

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
however i can say that from experiences

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.480 
however i can say that from experiences
with<00:04:19.970> leaves<00:04:20.299> then<00:04:20.810> every<00:04:21.500> batch<00:04:22.100> that<00:04:22.130> I've

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
with leaves then every batch that I've

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.360 
with leaves then every batch that I've
had<00:04:22.700> has<00:04:23.270> some<00:04:23.960> port<00:04:24.200> of<00:04:24.350> some<00:04:24.770> form<00:04:25.190> of

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
had has some port of some form of

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.850 
had has some port of some form of
shedding<00:04:25.700> or<00:04:26.030> tangling<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.440> think<00:04:27.680> that's

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
shedding or tangling and I think that's

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.620 
shedding or tangling and I think that's
just<00:04:27.950> because<00:04:28.160> it's<00:04:28.460> we've<00:04:28.669> like<00:04:28.970> it's<00:04:29.419> not

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
just because it's we've like it's not

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.510 
just because it's we've like it's not
growing<00:04:29.900> out<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.080> your<00:04:30.139> scalp<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:31.070> is<00:04:31.190> attached

growing out of your scalp it is attached

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.330 
growing out of your scalp it is attached
to<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:31.850> weft<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:32.419> you're<00:04:32.870> going<00:04:33.110> to

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
to the weft so you're going to

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.700 
to the weft so you're going to
experience<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:35.290> it's<00:04:36.290> just<00:04:36.530> that

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
experience that and it's just that

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
sometimes it's worse than others but

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.620
