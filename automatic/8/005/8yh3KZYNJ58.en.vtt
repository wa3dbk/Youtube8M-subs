00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
sometimes you can get away with a

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.840 
sometimes you can get away with a
standard<00:02:40.900> size<00:02:41.200> like<00:02:41.620> today<00:02:42.010> actually<00:02:42.610> this

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
standard size like today actually this

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.630 
standard size like today actually this
is<00:02:43.030> actually<00:02:43.209> happen<00:02:43.780> believe<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.620> that's<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
is actually happen believe that that's a

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.840 
is actually happen believe that that's a
real<00:02:45.910> pain<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.360> ass<00:02:46.510> about<00:02:46.750> these<00:02:47.110> trucks<00:02:47.850> in

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
real pain the ass about these trucks in

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.130 
real pain the ass about these trucks in
the<00:02:48.970> vehicles<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.630> don't<00:02:49.780> know<00:02:49.870> whether<00:02:50.049> to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
the vehicles I don't know whether to

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.229 
the vehicles I don't know whether to
Chevy<00:02:50.560> GMC<00:02:50.829> or<00:02:51.549> even<00:02:52.209> just<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.570> Ford

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
Chevy GMC or even just a Ford

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.650 
Chevy GMC or even just a Ford
there's<00:02:55.239> such<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.450> mishmash<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:56.680> bolts<00:02:57.549> I<00:02:57.730> don't

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
there's such a mishmash of bolts I don't

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.750 
there's such a mishmash of bolts I don't
know<00:02:58.750> whether<00:02:58.900> they're<00:02:59.260> metric<00:03:00.160> or<00:03:00.400> whether

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
know whether they're metric or whether

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.530 
know whether they're metric or whether
they're<00:03:02.010> standard<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:05.940> that's<00:03:06.940> why<00:03:07.120> sometimes

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
they're standard so that's why sometimes

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.560 
they're standard so that's why sometimes
these<00:03:07.900> Fords<00:03:08.260> are<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> bit<00:03:08.560> difficult<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.760> chew

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
these Fords are a bit difficult to chew

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.060 
these Fords are a bit difficult to chew
deal<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:10.810> like<00:03:10.930> yeah<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.470> one<00:03:11.650> here<00:03:11.829> I<00:03:11.980> think

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
deal is like yeah this one here I think

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.460 
deal is like yeah this one here I think
that's<00:03:12.400> metric<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:13.180> doesn't<00:03:13.510> want<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.870> can't

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
that's metric it doesn't want I can't

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.840 
that's metric it doesn't want I can't
get<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:14.680> on<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.829> can't<00:03:15.130> get<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.310> off<00:03:15.430> very<00:03:15.609> easily

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
get it on I can't get it off very easily

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.569 
get it on I can't get it off very easily
so<00:03:16.840> okay<00:03:17.440> now<00:03:17.650> we're<00:03:17.799> going<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> put<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.310> rest

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
so okay now we're going to put the rest

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.460 
so okay now we're going to put the rest
of<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:19.680> air<00:03:20.680> flow<00:03:20.920> crap<00:03:21.340> lon

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
of the air flow crap lon

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.030 
of the air flow crap lon
first<00:03:23.160> before<00:03:23.550> we<00:03:23.760> do<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.510> really<00:03:25.290> want<00:03:25.920> to

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
first before we do that I really want to

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.410 
first before we do that I really want to
go<00:03:26.340> ahead<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.730> reach<00:03:26.940> secure<00:03:27.590> all<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:29.420> want

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
go ahead and reach secure all the I want

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.040 
go ahead and reach secure all the I want
my<00:03:30.510> phone

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
my phone

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.800 
my phone
we<00:03:31.830> secure<00:03:32.520> all<00:03:32.760> my<00:03:33.500> wiring<00:03:34.500> harnesses<00:03:35.280> which

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
we secure all my wiring harnesses which

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.550 
we secure all my wiring harnesses which
was<00:03:36.810> very<00:03:37.080> simple<00:03:37.500> because<00:03:38.780> this<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.960> designed

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
was very simple because this is designed

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.340 
was very simple because this is designed
to<00:03:40.770> be<00:03:40.920> very<00:03:41.070> simple<00:03:41.480> for<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.630> manufacturing

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
to be very simple for the manufacturing

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.230 
to be very simple for the manufacturing
process<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.460> don't<00:03:44.760> believe<00:03:45.060> there<00:03:45.210> was

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
process and I don't believe there was

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.840 
process and I don't believe there was
any<00:03:45.390> others<00:03:45.900> forward<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.680> which<00:03:47.640> there

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
any others forward of that which there

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:55.160 
any others forward of that which there
was<00:03:48.090> not<00:03:51.410> why<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.470> hell<00:03:53.010> am<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:54.480> missing<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:55.140> of

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
was not why the hell am I missing one of

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.060 
was not why the hell am I missing one of
those<00:03:55.700> little<00:03:56.700> doodads<00:03:57.120> up<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.510> there<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:57.690> got

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
those little doodads up in there I got

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:11.990 
those little doodads up in there I got
that<00:03:59.070> one<00:03:59.250> there<00:04:01.850> this<00:04:02.850> guy<00:04:03.090> here<00:04:05.360> I<00:04:11.000> would

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
that one there this guy here I would

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.280 
that one there this guy here I would
think<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.450> other<00:04:12.600> side<00:04:12.690> has<00:04:12.900> these

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
think that the other side has these

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.620 
think that the other side has these
buttons<00:04:13.740> too<00:04:14.040> but<00:04:15.530> probably<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:17.359> gotta<00:04:18.359> put

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
buttons too but probably I gotta put

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.630 
buttons too but probably I gotta put
them<00:04:18.720> up<00:04:18.870> in<00:04:19.019> there<00:04:19.290> Timothy<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.160> think<00:04:20.459> has

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
them up in there Timothy I think has

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.470 
them up in there Timothy I think has
some<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.030> these<00:04:22.850> just<00:04:23.850> these<00:04:24.000> little<00:04:24.150> plastic

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
some of these just these little plastic

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.600 
some of these just these little plastic
push-button<00:04:25.169> things<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.710> whole<00:04:25.890> fastener<00:04:26.430> to

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
push-button things the whole fastener to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.940 
push-button things the whole fastener to
hold<00:04:26.790> things<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.590> there<00:04:28.590> usually<00:04:28.919> a

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
hold things in there usually a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.200 
hold things in there usually a
one-time-use<00:04:29.370> thing<00:04:29.910> but<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:32.610> can<00:04:32.790> probably

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
one-time-use thing but you can probably

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:42.950 
one-time-use thing but you can probably
get<00:04:33.900> away<00:04:33.990> with<00:04:34.140> a<00:04:34.320> couple<00:04:34.530> times<00:04:34.919> here<00:04:41.960> this

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
get away with a couple times here this

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.000 
get away with a couple times here this
fender<00:04:43.500> wells<00:04:43.680> in<00:04:43.950> oh<00:04:44.390> that's<00:04:45.390> him<00:04:45.800> now<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:46.830> just

fender wells in oh that's him now I just

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.230 
fender wells in oh that's him now I just
have<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.450> throw<00:04:48.450> this<00:04:48.660> in<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:50.120> we're<00:04:51.120> gonna

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
have to throw this in and we're gonna

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.469 
have to throw this in and we're gonna
spit<00:04:51.600> this<00:04:51.810> engine<00:04:52.229> up<00:04:52.490> in<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.640> second<00:04:54.180> I<00:04:54.419> just

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
spit this engine up in a second I just

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.240 
spit this engine up in a second I just
gotta<00:04:54.810> get<00:04:54.930> my

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.580 

mass<00:04:58.060> airflow<00:04:58.540> sensor<00:04:59.340> right<00:05:00.360> there<00:05:01.590> so

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
mass airflow sensor right there so

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.490 
mass airflow sensor right there so
that's<00:05:02.770> in<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:04.690> of<00:05:05.110> course<00:05:07.020> stick<00:05:08.020> that<00:05:08.230> in

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
that's in and of course stick that in

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.230 
that's in and of course stick that in
there<00:05:08.710> because<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.160> can<00:05:11.670> this<00:05:12.670> guy<00:05:12.880> here<00:05:13.210> and

there because I can this guy here and
then<00:05:16.500> one<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.800> have<00:05:18.700> a<00:05:18.790> canine<00:05:19.060> filtering<00:05:19.810> this

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
then one I have a canine filtering this

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.260 
then one I have a canine filtering this
thing<00:05:20.170> by<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.410> way<00:05:20.530> to<00:05:20.980> it<00:05:21.640> does<00:05:21.910> increase

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
thing by the way to it does increase

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.060 
thing by the way to it does increase

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
wondered about K&amp;N air filters for

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:50.590 
wondered about K&amp;N air filters for
f-150s<00:05:30.430> they<00:05:30.580> work<00:05:30.760> pretty<00:05:31.000> good

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:06:25.360 

stars<00:05:51.200> that<00:05:51.500> squeak

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.000 

4500<00:06:26.370> rpm<00:06:26.780> so<00:06:27.780> we'll<00:06:28.350> do<00:06:28.440> this<00:06:28.530> he's<00:06:28.710> let<00:06:28.920> it

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
4500 rpm so we'll do this he's let it

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.370 
4500 rpm so we'll do this he's let it
run<00:06:29.190> mass<00:06:30.180> airflow<00:06:30.420> sensor<00:06:30.600> seems<00:06:31.140> to<00:06:31.290> be

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
run mass airflow sensor seems to be

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.270 
run mass airflow sensor seems to be
working<00:06:31.680> properly

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
working properly

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.189 
working properly
I<00:06:33.310> don't<00:06:33.879> hear<00:06:34.060> that<00:06:34.090> ticking<00:06:34.419> noise<00:06:34.719> anymore

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 
I don't hear that ticking noise anymore

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.249 
I don't hear that ticking noise anymore
how<00:06:35.379> about<00:06:35.530> yeah<00:06:35.710> nope<00:06:36.129> that's<00:06:36.669> gone<00:06:37.090> so<00:06:37.719> as

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:38.259 
how about yeah nope that's gone so as

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.350 
how about yeah nope that's gone so as
far<00:06:38.439> as<00:06:38.500> the<00:06:38.650> manifolds<00:06:39.129> are<00:06:39.250> concerned<00:06:39.580> that

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
far as the manifolds are concerned that

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.330 
far as the manifolds are concerned that
jobs<00:06:40.629> done<00:06:41.310> manifold<00:06:42.310> job<00:06:42.550> is<00:06:43.030> complete

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
jobs done manifold job is complete

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.820 
jobs done manifold job is complete
yeah<00:06:45.340> so<00:06:46.180> the<00:06:46.629> next<00:06:46.810> thing<00:06:47.050> I<00:06:47.199> have<00:06:47.229> to<00:06:47.409> do<00:06:47.650> is

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
yeah so the next thing I have to do is

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.010 
yeah so the next thing I have to do is
actually<00:06:48.009> put<00:06:48.370> a<00:06:48.400> tie<00:06:48.610> rod<00:06:48.879> end<00:06:49.120> in<00:06:49.360> on<00:06:49.900> the

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
actually put a tie rod end in on the
