00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.860
 all 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.130
 a nuclear power plant is nuclear fuel 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.039
 and produces electricity and heat it is light 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.140
 the rich mines through a series of concerts 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.540
 exchanger 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.940
 the turbine 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.060
 alternator 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.440
 but the only one that interests us here 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.880
 it is the reactor at the heart of which occurs fission of nuclei 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.900
 these are 235 uranium nuclei obviously asset advisory 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.840
 one way or another little exploded spontaneously he then projects with 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.309
 violence of fragments of different sizes among them a priority 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.769
 amazing journey they can cross the roundabout in this sense the affections 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.970
 lucie moderating their speed with pressurized water in which is 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.540
 dive uranium bars 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.810
 these slowed down neutrons it's a very big nucleus that they meet the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.810
 destabilize causes them to explode 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.940
 the kernels 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.580
 it explodes years the project awaits the return of neutrons that propagates the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.090
 reaction from near to close 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.310
 bezos competition of the explosion and although they lost a tiny part of their 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.310
 base that turned into heat 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.770
 the red heat drives the turbine 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.420
 which drives an alternator he manufactured electricity and energy 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.720
 here we are
