00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 but he does not know the ingredients for 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.299
 this dessert of guanábana and mamey and what 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.050
 it seems to them if we go straight to see the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.429
 ingredients so that at home taking 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:18.000
 male 2 cups of water 2 cups of sugar 2 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.029
 pieces of mamey only the pulp an envelope 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.580
 of grenetine hydrated in a quarter of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.430
 cup of water and dissolved mesh Mary and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.500
 a cup of cream to beat and almost almost 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.439
 the same for the soursop are two 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.870
 cups of water two cups of sugar 2 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.809
 pieces of guanabana only the pulp without 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.460
 bone an envelope of grenetine hydrated in 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.790
 a quarter of a cup of dissolved water go 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.010
 I would call a cup of cream to beat and 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.670
 and then only for red fruits 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.399
 Decorating your tightening for both cases is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.739
 the same syrup will never be seen 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.520
 of universal for the two is not to say 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.129
 let's put here the liter that I mentioned 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.010
 for the mamey we are going to put here the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.660
 milestone that I mentioned for the guanábana and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.909
 then we will divide it to be 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.230
 easier not 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.670
 let's put here 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:14.700
 the cup of sugar today and here too 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:18.360
 pass sugar or two cups of sugar 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.130
 ready let's leave the syrup we're not going to 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.950
 nothing will move me to see clearly yes 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.990
 please the time we are moving and 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.119
 which becomes a syrup that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.229
 melts the sugar and that becomes 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.969
 o'hara 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.560
 then what you go and I will leave 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.600
 universal for the two mixtures 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.580
 I'm putting the two 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.320
 of cream so that it is beaten in 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.200
 a single round and then we divide it 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.240
 so that's how we're going to beat it here 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.740
 in peaks in hard peaks 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 perfect there is and now if your hair 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.140
 is ready to grow and it has already dissolved 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.240
 his classics and he already lacks good 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.390
 so let's start making the dni 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.549
 and now we're going to start dividing the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.069
 pulp of the way only the pulp without 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.920
 since he dictated it and here please give me 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.330
 two cups you pass a ladle the option 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.730
 and if you give me two cups of it 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.030
 of the syrup that they already prepared because 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.160
 Let's liquefy the a male with two cups 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.180
 of each time already prepared and by 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.110
 course also with the grenetina that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.720
 I have here that we are only going to 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.630
 moisturize in water at room temperature 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.430
 and we're going to dissolve it, either bain marie 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.770
 or in the microwave 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.620
 nothing more 25 seconds mm highly I the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.150
 you spend more value of the arme the grenetina 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.850

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.510
 we put here with the mamey let's 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.110
