00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
okay and now you go over to caps okay

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.699 
okay and now you go over to caps okay
now<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.390> capsule<00:02:30.600> will<00:02:30.870> say<00:02:31.020> start<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.560> end

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
now in a capsule will say start and end

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.010 
now in a capsule will say start and end
you're<00:02:32.040> gonna<00:02:32.130> go<00:02:32.400> fill<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> cap<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.300> fill<00:02:33.989> a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
you're gonna go fill a cap and fill a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
you're gonna go fill a cap and fill a
cap<00:02:34.290> now<00:02:34.680> where<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.640> says<00:02:35.670> steps<00:02:36.209> one<00:02:37.020> leave<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
cap now where it says steps one leave it

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.890 
cap now where it says steps one leave it
there<00:02:38.220> don't<00:02:38.550> press<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.120> stuff<00:02:39.360> just<00:02:39.690> leave

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
there don't press the stuff just leave

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.460 
there don't press the stuff just leave
it<00:02:40.019> there<00:02:40.230> now<00:02:40.769> um<00:02:41.360> radius<00:02:42.360> make<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.840> three<00:02:43.260> on

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
it there now um radius make it three on

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.979 
it there now um radius make it three on
bolt<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:44.370> start<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.970> end<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.720> completely

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
bolt to start and end so it's completely

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.059 
bolt to start and end so it's completely
even<00:02:46.560> now<00:02:46.890> um<00:02:48.170> we're<00:02:49.170> gonna<00:02:49.290> want<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:49.739> first

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
even now um we're gonna want to do first

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.180 
even now um we're gonna want to do first
is<00:02:50.370> get<00:02:51.239> NHGRI<00:02:52.170> okay<00:02:52.620> which<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:52.890> basically

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
is get NHGRI okay which is basically

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.729 
is get NHGRI okay which is basically
this<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.670> adds<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.690> nice<00:02:54.840> really<00:02:55.290> good

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
this it adds a nice really good

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.380 
this it adds a nice really good
reflection<00:02:56.160> because<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.640> all<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.360> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
reflection because it all it is is a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.570 
reflection because it all it is is a
reflection<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.650> go<00:02:58.799> over<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.040> this<00:02:59.280> panel

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
reflection so go over to this panel

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.900 
reflection so go over to this panel
right<00:02:59.819> here<00:02:59.880> it's<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.690> content<00:03:01.230> browser<00:03:01.440> and

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
right here it's the content browser and

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.620 
right here it's the content browser and
go<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.769> presets<00:03:04.880> um<00:03:07.190> architecture<00:03:08.190> editor

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
go to presets um architecture editor

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.509 
go to presets um architecture editor
edit<00:03:09.630> Edition<00:03:09.870> whatever<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.480> go<00:03:12.480> down<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:13.019> ah

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:24.650 

where<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:21.350> thing<00:03:22.350> oh<00:03:23.030> yeah<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:24.359> click<00:03:24.540> it

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
okay then go down materials and HDRI

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.960 
okay then go down materials and HDRI
now<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.650> chose<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.190> second<00:03:29.549> one<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:29.730> can<00:03:29.880> do

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
you'll see material HDR HDR underscore

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.020 
you'll see material HDR HDR underscore
zero<00:03:52.320> two<00:03:52.560> now<00:03:53.220> right<00:03:53.459> below<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.730> is

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
zero two now right below that is

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.680 
zero two now right below that is
selection<00:03:54.450> you're<00:03:55.230> going<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.410> type<00:03:55.769> capital<00:03:56.160> R

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
selection you're going to type capital R

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.170 
selection you're going to type capital R
one<00:03:57.720> okay<00:03:58.620> now<00:03:59.160> this<00:03:59.280> is<00:03:59.489> just<00:03:59.730> going<00:03:59.910> to<00:03:59.970> make

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
one okay now this is just going to make

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.460 
one okay now this is just going to make
that<00:04:00.930> cap<00:04:01.350> right<00:04:01.829> there<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:03.060> color<00:04:03.410> okay<00:04:04.410> you

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
that cap right there that color okay you

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.960 
that cap right there that color okay you
can<00:04:04.680> do<00:04:04.799> whatever<00:04:05.040> colors<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:05.609> want<00:04:05.640> we're

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
can do whatever colors you want we're

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.759 
can do whatever colors you want we're
just<00:04:06.120> doing<00:04:06.239> with<00:04:06.510> reflect<00:04:06.959> reflection<00:04:07.620> right

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
just doing with reflect reflection right

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.490 
just doing with reflect reflection right
now<00:04:07.920> then<00:04:08.549> you<00:04:08.730> add<00:04:08.940> another<00:04:08.970> one<00:04:09.480> okay

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
now then you add another one okay

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.590 
now then you add another one okay
now<00:04:10.799> this<00:04:11.069> one<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.730> go<00:04:11.910> over<00:04:12.120> same<00:04:12.359> thing

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
now this one you go over same thing

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.190 
now this one you go over same thing
capital<00:04:13.049> R<00:04:13.230> but<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:14.090> okay<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.630> will<00:04:15.810> give<00:04:16.019> a

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
capital R but to okay this will give a

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.110 
capital R but to okay this will give a
reflection<00:04:16.889> on<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.190> other<00:04:17.370> side<00:04:17.729> of<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:17.940> text

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
reflection on the other side of the text

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.600 
reflection on the other side of the text

do not recommend it for videos over like
200<00:05:48.629> frames<00:05:48.810> because<00:05:49.649> then<00:05:49.830> you're<00:05:49.949> going<00:05:50.069> to

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
200 frames because then you're going to

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.610 
200 frames because then you're going to
be<00:05:50.189> sitting<00:05:50.490> there<00:05:50.520> for<00:05:50.849> like<00:05:51.029> six<00:05:51.270> hours<00:05:52.229> with

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
be sitting there for like six hours with

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.850 
be sitting there for like six hours with
like<00:05:52.800> a<00:05:52.830> quad-core<00:05:53.250> computer<00:05:54.199> that's<00:05:55.199> not<00:05:55.379> fun

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
like a quad-core computer that's not fun

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.480 
like a quad-core computer that's not fun
so<00:05:56.490> um<00:05:57.259> other<00:05:58.259> than<00:05:58.800> that<00:05:58.919> I<00:05:59.159> would<00:05:59.310> definitely

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
so um other than that I would definitely

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.139 
so um other than that I would definitely
use<00:05:59.729> it<00:06:00.029> um<00:06:00.860> so<00:06:01.860> that's<00:06:02.189> basically<00:06:02.879> it<00:06:03.000> you

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:03.149 
use it um so that's basically it you

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:06.550 
use it um so that's basically it you
just<00:06:03.599> render<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:04.050> out<00:06:04.139> and<00:06:04.379> it<00:06:04.469> works<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:05.129> mean

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
just render it out and it works I mean
