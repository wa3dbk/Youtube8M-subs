is going to 80s before you scope in and
pull<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> trigger<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.490> way<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
pull the trigger so that way you you

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
paper at the center of your screen it's

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.539 
paper at the center of your screen it's
not<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.710> at<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> center<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> screen

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
not really at the center of the screen

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.999 
not really at the center of the screen
it's<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.270> your<00:02:03.479> fixed<00:02:03.840> focal<00:02:04.259> 80s<00:02:04.710> point

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
it's that's your fixed focal 80s point

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.920 
it's that's your fixed focal 80s point

now<00:03:27.180> here's<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.810> problem<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.290> here's<00:03:28.590> why<00:03:28.769> a

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
now here's the problem and here's why a

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.520 
now here's the problem and here's why a
lot<00:03:29.099> of<00:03:29.159> Call<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.430> Duty<00:03:29.699> players<00:03:29.909> were

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
lot of Call of Duty players were

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.890 
lot of Call of Duty players were
struggling<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:31.949> much<00:03:32.280> on<00:03:32.790> destiny<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.720> hit

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
struggling so much on destiny to hit

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.839 
struggling so much on destiny to hit
sniper<00:03:34.169> shots<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.069> reason<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.579> is

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
sniper shots and the reason for that is

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.259 
sniper shots and the reason for that is
on<00:03:36.329> call<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.959> duty<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:38.010> fixed<00:03:38.519> focal<00:03:39.030> point

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
on call of duty the fixed focal point

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.979 
on call of duty the fixed focal point
for<00:03:39.359> their<00:03:39.659> 80s<00:03:40.199> is<00:03:40.409> two<00:03:41.099> inches<00:03:41.430> higher<00:03:42.299> on

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
for their 80s is two inches higher on

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.170 
for their 80s is two inches higher on
your<00:03:43.319> television<00:03:43.769> screen<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.759> the<00:03:44.909> problem

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
your television screen so the problem

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.909 
your television screen so the problem
with<00:03:45.449> that<00:03:45.479> is<00:03:45.629> is<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.379> people<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.739> have

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
with that is is that people that have

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.140 
with that is is that people that have
been<00:03:47.069> playing<00:03:47.280> call<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.519> duty<00:03:47.609> for<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:47.909> past
