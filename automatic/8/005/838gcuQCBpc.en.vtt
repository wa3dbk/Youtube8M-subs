know what you think so moving on this
week's<00:01:09.030> topic<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.680> about<00:01:10.920> coming<00:01:11.430> out

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
week's topic it's it's about coming out

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.810 
week's topic it's it's about coming out
in<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.299> college<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.170> coming<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.430> college

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
in in college and coming out in college

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.730 
in in college and coming out in college
is<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> lot<00:01:15.150> different<00:01:15.659> than<00:01:16.049> coming<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
is a lot different than coming out in

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.429 
is a lot different than coming out in
high<00:01:16.950> school<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> reason<00:01:18.840> for

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
high school and I think the reason for

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.149 
high school and I think the reason for
that<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.619> let's<00:01:20.100> say<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:21.500> you're<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:23.009> away

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that is let's say you you're going away

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.670 
that is let's say you you're going away
to<00:01:23.340> college<00:01:23.960> totally<00:01:24.960> different<00:01:25.320> state

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to college totally different state

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
to college totally different state
you're<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.430> anybody<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.689> are

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
you're not going to know anybody you are

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.850 
you're not going to know anybody you are
your<00:01:28.350> own<00:01:28.380> person<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:30.960> the

just what happens and for me like I said

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.890 
just what happens and for me like I said
as<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.620> freshman<00:04:05.099> I<00:04:05.190> was<00:04:05.310> very<00:04:05.549> like<00:04:05.819> gung<00:04:06.239> ho<00:04:06.510> I

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
as a freshman I was very like gung ho I

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.479 
as a freshman I was very like gung ho I
want<00:04:07.169> to<00:04:07.230> make<00:04:07.349> sure<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.530> support<00:04:07.950> these<00:04:08.040> issues

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.000 
want to make sure I support these issues
but<00:04:09.329> then<00:04:09.510> looking<00:04:09.900> back<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:10.349> realized<00:04:10.739> that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
but then looking back I realized that

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.729 
but then looking back I realized that
while<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:11.970> did<00:04:12.329> I<00:04:12.480> did<00:04:12.750> learn<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.019> lot<00:04:13.349> in<00:04:13.410> those
