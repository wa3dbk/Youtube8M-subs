as<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:31.750> can<00:02:31.870> see<00:02:32.110> after<00:02:32.319> hands<00:02:32.860> inside<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.520> of

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
as you can see after hands inside of of

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.960 
as you can see after hands inside of of
the<00:02:34.540> hands<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:34.990> them<00:02:35.290> already<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:38.970> it's

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
the hands on them already so it's

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.920 
the hands on them already so it's
actually<00:02:40.830> fairly<00:02:41.830> simple<00:02:42.250> put<00:02:42.790> it<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.090> but

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
actually fairly simple put it on but

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.630 
actually fairly simple put it on but
just<00:02:44.319> have<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.650> take<00:02:44.890> note<00:02:45.069> that<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.610> I

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
just have to take note that the I

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.550 
just have to take note that the I
Slugger<00:02:46.120> are<00:02:46.450> really<00:02:46.930> thin<00:02:48.300> over<00:02:49.300> here<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:50.200> you

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
Slugger are really thin over here so you

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.770 
Slugger are really thin over here so you
have<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:50.890> be<00:02:51.040> extremely<00:02:51.310> careful<00:02:51.940> if<00:02:52.360> not<00:02:52.600> you

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
have to be extremely careful if not you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.860 
have to be extremely careful if not you
will<00:02:52.959> actually<00:02:53.500> break<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.240> but<00:02:55.240> here<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.660> have

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
that's our two ice loggers combined it

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.470 
that's our two ice loggers combined it
is<00:03:04.060> very<00:03:04.300> nicely<00:03:04.599> sculpted<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:07.209> hand

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.650 

so<00:03:16.660> let<00:03:17.020> me<00:03:17.050> show<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.260> how<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.470> actually

have it very easy to put and it's secure

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.580 
have it very easy to put and it's secure
as<00:04:00.070> well<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:00.820> it<00:04:01.420> doesn't<00:04:01.810> mean<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.230> doesn't

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
as well so it doesn't mean it doesn't

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.530 
as well so it doesn't mean it doesn't
fall<00:04:02.740> off<00:04:02.890> easily<00:04:03.130> and<00:04:03.550> it<00:04:04.030> doesn't<00:04:04.420> actually

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
fall off easily and it doesn't actually

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.530 
fall off easily and it doesn't actually
hinder<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.530> movement<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.970> joints<00:04:07.420> over

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
hinder the movement of the joints over

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.220 
hinder the movement of the joints over
here<00:04:08.640> so<00:04:10.260> no<00:04:11.260> problems<00:04:11.770> for<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.460> articulation

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
here so no problems for the articulation

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.770
