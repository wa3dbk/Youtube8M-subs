cooked<00:00:04.490> you<00:00:05.490> see<00:00:05.670> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.090 

all<00:00:26.500> right<00:00:26.619> we're<00:00:26.740> gonna<00:00:26.830> try<00:00:27.040> another

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.100 
all right we're gonna try another

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:47.320 
all right we're gonna try another
certified<00:00:27.820> run<00:00:28.180> here<00:00:28.600> at<00:00:28.779> half<00:00:29.020> an<00:00:29.170> ohm

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:54.270 

we<00:00:47.960> hang<00:00:48.140> up

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.319 

there<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:55.370> go<00:00:55.519> folks<00:00:57.699> you<00:00:58.699> don't<00:00:58.969> run<00:00:59.149> this

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
there you go folks you don't run this

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.369 
there you go folks you don't run this
amplifier<00:00:59.870> at<00:01:00.170> half<00:01:00.350> an<00:01:00.500> ohm

amplifier at half an ohm
yes<00:01:03.379> it<00:01:04.100> blew<00:01:04.519> up<00:01:05.140> capacitors<00:01:06.140> blue<00:01:06.790> smoke<00:01:07.790> is

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
yes it blew up capacitors blue smoke is

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.749 
yes it blew up capacitors blue smoke is
rising<00:01:09.759> does<00:01:10.759> not<00:01:11.119> like<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:12.170> half<00:01:12.409> own<00:01:12.789> load

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
rising does not like the half own load

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.270 
rising does not like the half own load
resistive<00:01:18.190> consistent<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:21.560> smoke<00:01:21.979> is<00:01:22.220> a

resistive consistent the smoke is a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.820 
resistive consistent the smoke is a

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
flying and the room in here is a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.730 
flying and the room in here is a
smelling<00:01:25.340> bad<00:01:26.259> but<00:01:28.780> we<00:01:29.780> have<00:01:29.990> cut<00:01:30.440> off<00:01:30.560> our

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
smelling bad but we have cut off our

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.809 
smelling bad but we have cut off our
power<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:32.289> to<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.380> amplifier<00:01:33.890> we<00:01:34.640> go

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
power to the to the amplifier we go

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.340 
power to the to the amplifier we go
ahead<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.000> shut<00:01:35.450> down<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.630> power<00:01:35.929> supply

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
ahead and shut down the power supply

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.980 
ahead and shut down the power supply
I've<00:01:36.530> got<00:01:36.909> power<00:01:37.909> disconnected<00:01:38.299> but<00:01:38.750> we<00:01:38.840> want

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
I've got power disconnected but we want

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.649 
I've got power disconnected but we want
to<00:01:39.080> shut<00:01:39.229> everything<00:01:39.470> off<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:41.330> make<00:01:41.479> sure

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
to shut everything off to make sure

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.169 
to shut everything off to make sure
we're<00:01:41.840> not<00:01:41.869> going<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.170> start<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.440> fire<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:42.890> here

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
we're not going to start a fire in here

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.359 
we're not going to start a fire in here
and<00:01:44.179> what<00:01:44.690> we'll<00:01:44.840> do<00:01:44.929> next<00:01:45.110> is<00:01:45.409> we'll<00:01:45.649> open<00:01:46.190> it

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
and what we'll do next is we'll open it

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.620 
and what we'll do next is we'll open it
up<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:47.020> see<00:01:48.020> what<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.500> inside<00:01:48.860> is<00:01:48.890> like<00:01:49.630> so

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
up and see what the inside is like so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:02:10.850 
up and see what the inside is like so
hold<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:50.929> we'll<00:01:51.229> check<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:51.590> out

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
