will be healed for quite a high amount

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
will be healed for quite a high amount
so<00:02:01.460> yeah<00:02:02.460> DPS<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:03.390> done<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.780> fast<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.229> he

so yeah DPS I'm done really fast and he

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.389 
so yeah DPS I'm done really fast and he
also<00:02:04.530> goes<00:02:04.890> into<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.369> frenzy<00:02:06.500> when<00:02:07.500> he<00:02:07.560> reaches

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
also goes into a frenzy when he reaches

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.510 
also goes into a frenzy when he reaches
I<00:02:08.700> guess<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.599> about<00:02:10.170> twenty<00:02:10.890> percent<00:02:11.280> or

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
I guess it's about twenty percent or

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.570 
I guess it's about twenty percent or
something

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
something

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.500 
something
so<00:02:13.450> that's<00:02:14.230> basically<00:02:17.250> what<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.880> abilities
