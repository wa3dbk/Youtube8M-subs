00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.150
 hdr 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.270
 is the acronym for high dynamic frames 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.460
 with Spanish high dynamic range this 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.770
 kind of photography has a better 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.360
 dynamic range of illuminance between 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.670
 lighter and darker areas of 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.340
 an image 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.810
 thanks to this feature 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.390
 we get more images chords 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.340
 to the one visualized by the human eye the 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.170
 process would consist of doing three 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.570
 photographs of the same shot with 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.210
 different arrangements for later 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.210
 join them and get our picture hdr 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.020
 the problem with this procedure is 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.490
 which may be impractical 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.440
 than to get a single photo 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.360
 we need to do minimum two is to say 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.640
 We are losing time and capacity 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.199
 our memory card that's why 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.000
 I want to show you another procedure 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.250
 with which we will get results 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.729
 similar using only one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.729
 Photography 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.340
 the first step is to separate into different 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.890
 layers the zones with different 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.530
 positions in this case the sky for a 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.900
 side and water and land for another to 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.220
 I'm going to use the pen tool that 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.220
 I will go contouring the sky 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.869
 yes 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.960
 once we finish click right click 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.840
 about the outline of our layout and 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.080
 followed left click on doing 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.240
 selection and we accept 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.830
 as we can check we have already 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.420
 selected one of the parties that 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.520
 we want to extract 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.180
 let's create a mask and remove 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.180
 the layout 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.209
 once the layout removed again 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.280
 select the sky we press control and 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.550
 we left click on the mask 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.640
 Once selected we copy and paste 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.190
 doing master control and control the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.140
 juve in the case of windows and causing 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.470
 more commands more c 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.400
 command over this layer we apply a 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.400
 rap camera filter 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.950
 the part of the sky is overexposed 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.079
 therefore we will have to lower the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.459
 exposure lower lighting the 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.290
 blacks and play a little with each 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.379
 parameter until the result is achieved 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.379
 searched 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.720
 we can see now before and after 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.739
 we will repeat the process in the layer 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.159
 lower corresponding to the ship of the 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.159
 water from the earth 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.950
 but this time the values will be 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.080
 completely different and even 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.780
 opposites because this part of the image 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.300
 it is super exposed therefore 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.440
 we will raise the exhibition the shadows the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.440
 lighting and clarity 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.650
 once finished then we will accept and 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.030
 as we can see our picture 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.030
 presents a major change 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.030
 now we can see the before and the after 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.140
 well that's it if you liked the video 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.090
 do not forget to subscribe and give me 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.050
 like and if you have any questions you can
