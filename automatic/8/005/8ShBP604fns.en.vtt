00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
release that's the standard type of a

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.640 
release that's the standard type of a
smoker<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.520> this<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:42.910> great<00:02:43.240> addition

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650

many<00:02:47.500> points<00:02:47.740> for<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.870> know<00:02:49.960> taking<00:02:50.800> care<00:02:50.830> and

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
many points for you know taking care and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.270 
many points for you know taking care and
the<00:02:51.640> design<00:02:51.970> but<00:02:52.360> jeez<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.530> practical<00:02:54.100> when

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
the design but jeez this practical when

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.700 
the design but jeez this practical when
you're<00:02:54.430> there<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:55.360> just<00:02:55.570> grab<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.870> hold<00:02:56.350> it

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
you're there and just grab it hold it

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.740 
you're there and just grab it hold it
you<00:02:56.800> can<00:02:56.980> still<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.370> course<00:02:57.580> hook<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.630> onto

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
you can still of course hook it onto

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.960 
you can still of course hook it onto
onto<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> side<00:02:59.800> of<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.980> hive<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.670> stands

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
onto the side of the hive so it stands

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.300 
onto the side of the hive so it stands
up<00:03:01.150> nicely<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.530> don't<00:03:02.710> burn<00:03:02.860> yourself

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
up nicely to you you don't burn yourself

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.070 
up nicely to you you don't burn yourself
but<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.239> don't<00:03:04.450> have<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.980> carry<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.100> weight

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
but you don't have to carry the weight

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.790 
but you don't have to carry the weight
of<00:03:08.820> this<00:03:09.820> work<00:03:10.090> up<00:03:10.239> between<00:03:11.080> your<00:03:11.200> fingers<00:03:11.560> you

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
of this work up between your fingers you

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.160 
of this work up between your fingers you
carry<00:03:12.790> like<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.030> shipping<00:03:13.480> Bay<00:03:13.600> between<00:03:14.050> your

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
carry like a shipping Bay between your

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.340 
carry like a shipping Bay between your
hives<00:03:14.760> brilliant<00:03:15.760> tool<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:17.130> also<00:03:18.130> his<00:03:18.310> die

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
hives brilliant tool and also his die

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.949 
hives brilliant tool and also his die
it's<00:03:20.350> a<00:03:20.500> 2<00:03:20.680> layer<00:03:20.890> 2<00:03:21.700> level<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.630> can<00:03:22.780> see

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
it's a 2 layer 2 level so you can see

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.199 
it's a 2 layer 2 level so you can see
this<00:03:23.080> is<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.320> carrier<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:24.280> if<00:03:24.640> you're<00:03:24.790> using

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
this is the carrier and if you're using

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.890 
this is the carrier and if you're using
the<00:03:25.390> function<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.260> actually<00:03:26.650> get<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.900> its

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
the function you actually get to its

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.680 
the function you actually get to its
spaced<00:03:29.650> perfectly<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.580> it<00:03:31.000> allows<00:03:31.330> you<00:03:31.570> to

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
spaced perfectly so it allows you to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.050 
spaced perfectly so it allows you to
actually<00:03:31.810> blow<00:03:32.200> with<00:03:32.410> your<00:03:32.530> thumb<00:03:33.060> while

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
actually blow with your thumb while

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.520 
actually blow with your thumb while
you're<00:03:34.239> carrying<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.630> at<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.810> same<00:03:35.020> time<00:03:35.080> so

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
you're carrying it at the same time so

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.440 
you're carrying it at the same time so
it's<00:03:36.330> quite<00:03:37.330> quite<00:03:38.320> unique<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.280> thought<00:03:39.520> not

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
it's quite quite unique I thought not

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.860 
it's quite quite unique I thought not
pretty

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
pretty

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.590 
pretty
gee<00:03:41.370> if<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.489> had<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.700> give<00:03:42.850> it<00:03:42.940> design<00:03:43.270> points

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
gee if I had to give it design points

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.850 
gee if I had to give it design points
and<00:03:43.720> be<00:03:43.840> probably<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.410> negatives<00:03:44.739> but

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
and be probably in the negatives but

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.070 
and be probably in the negatives but
tell<00:03:45.600> very<00:03:46.600> very<00:03:46.840> effective<00:03:47.320> very<00:03:48.220> nice<00:03:49.080> very
