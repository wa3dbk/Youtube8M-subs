even though it's only going from AAG
16th<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:46.140> or<00:01:46.290> 18<00:01:46.710> they're<00:01:47.189> still<00:01:47.460> taking

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
16th to or 18 they're still taking

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.510 
16th to or 18 they're still taking
action<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.329> potential<00:01:49.020> safety<00:01:49.320> hazards<00:01:49.950> from

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
action on potential safety hazards from

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.260 
action on potential safety hazards from
really<00:01:51.390> crappy<00:01:51.720> manufacturers<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.680> are

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
really crappy manufacturers that are

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.600 
really crappy manufacturers that are
creating<00:01:54.270> counterfeit<00:01:54.960> chargers<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
creating counterfeit chargers and I

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.700 
creating counterfeit chargers and I

think this is going to really help with
apple's<00:01:59.460> image<00:01:59.939> as<00:02:00.119> well<00:02:00.360> as<00:02:00.570> safety

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.990 
apple's image as well as safety
especially<00:02:01.649> since<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.369> other<00:02:02.520> countries

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
especially since in other countries

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.670 
especially since in other countries
there<00:02:03.240> are<00:02:03.270> really<00:02:03.960> low<00:02:04.320> quality

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
there are really low quality

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
there are really low quality
manufacturers<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.700> no<00:02:06.000> quality<00:02:06.479> control

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
manufacturers with no quality control

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.859 
manufacturers with no quality control
and<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.710> products<00:02:08.160> they<00:02:08.369> create<00:02:08.869> especially

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and the products they create especially

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.089 
and the products they create especially
when<00:02:09.989> dealing<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.319> electricity<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
when dealing with electricity and

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.460 
when dealing with electricity and
charging<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.239> downright<00:02:12.540> dangerous

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
charging can be downright dangerous

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620 
charging can be downright dangerous
so<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> would<00:02:14.250> really<00:02:14.550> recommend<00:02:14.820> if<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.390> have

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
so I would really recommend if you have

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.860 
so I would really recommend if you have
a<00:02:15.660> third-party<00:02:16.410> charger<00:02:17.190> bring<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:18.120> get<00:02:18.750> it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
a third-party charger bring it in get it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.050 
a third-party charger bring it in get it
replaced<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.530> an<00:02:19.620> official<00:02:20.070> charger<00:02:20.520> just

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
replaced with an official charger just

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.060 
replaced with an official charger just
so<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.240> don't<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.840> worry<00:02:22.080> about<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.530> now

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
so you don't have to worry about it now

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.110
