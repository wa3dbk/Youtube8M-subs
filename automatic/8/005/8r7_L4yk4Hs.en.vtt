now<00:01:10.400> we<00:01:11.210> have<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:11.450> jack<00:01:11.690> up<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.080> foot<00:01:12.260> of

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
now we have to jack up the foot of

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.070 
now we have to jack up the foot of
suspension<00:01:13.040> a<00:01:13.100> little<00:01:13.310> bit<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.080> the

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
suspension a little bit so that the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.859

wheel Castor's of the hoist can fit on
the<00:01:17.960> a-frames<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:21.500> here<00:01:21.650> you<00:01:21.830> can<00:01:21.950> see<00:01:22.160> the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
the a-frames and here you can see the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.170 
the a-frames and here you can see the
engine<00:01:22.520> set<00:01:22.970> in<00:01:23.090> place<00:01:23.360> about<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.990> put<00:01:24.200> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
engine set in place about to put the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.700 
engine set in place about to put the
motor<00:01:26.180> mount<00:01:26.420> bolts<00:01:26.810> in<00:01:26.899> those<00:01:27.050> holes<00:01:27.320> right

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
motor mount bolts in those holes right

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.790 
motor mount bolts in those holes right
in<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.399> center<00:01:28.820> of<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.970> camera<00:01:29.530> on<00:01:30.530> both

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
in the center of the camera on both

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.080 
in the center of the camera on both
sides

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.209 

sitting<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.869> there<00:01:36.990> nicely

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.800 

so<00:01:39.549> the<00:01:39.609> home<00:01:39.850> header<00:01:40.749> is<00:01:40.929> in<00:01:41.049> position<00:01:41.319> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
so the home header is in position and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.660 
so the home header is in position and
the<00:01:43.810> transmission<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:44.740> see<00:01:45.189> a<00:01:45.219> transmission

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
the transmission you see a transmission

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.959 
the transmission you see a transmission
back<00:01:45.969> there<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.299> the<00:01:46.390> transmission<00:01:46.840> dipstick

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
back there and the transmission dipstick

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.809 
back there and the transmission dipstick
almost<00:01:48.969> finished<00:01:49.299> with<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.630> using<00:01:50.819> there's

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
almost finished with the using there's

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.429 
almost finished with the using there's
the<00:01:52.000> motor<00:01:52.149> completely<00:01:52.450> set<00:01:52.869> in<00:01:53.049> we've<00:01:53.229> still

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
the motor completely set in we've still

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.370 
the motor completely set in we've still
got<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.759> hookup<00:01:54.759> all<00:01:54.969> the<00:01:55.090> wiring<00:01:55.299> and<00:01:55.959> bolts<00:01:56.259> on

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
got a hookup all the wiring and bolts on

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.830 
got a hookup all the wiring and bolts on
the<00:01:56.530> intake<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.759> headers<00:01:58.060> are<00:01:58.530> put<00:01:59.530> on<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.689> got

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
the intake the headers are put on we got

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.149 
the intake the headers are put on we got
the<00:02:02.020> engine<00:02:02.590> mounts<00:02:03.069> tightened<00:02:03.609> up<00:02:05.099> start<00:02:06.099> you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
the engine mounts tightened up start you

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.279 
the engine mounts tightened up start you
look<00:02:06.280> really<00:02:06.399> nice<00:02:06.609> so<00:02:07.019> this<00:02:08.019> thing<00:02:08.170> together

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
look really nice so this thing together

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.769 
look really nice so this thing together
pretty<00:02:08.619> soon
