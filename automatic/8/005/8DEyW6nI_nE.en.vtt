00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
hello this is Wally and I've got a B

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
and like C and C now this is using

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.950

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.290 
eyes that Nicholas Stuart has written
let's<00:00:24.900> see<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.230> was<00:00:25.590> able<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.859> print<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.580> small

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
let's see I was able to print a small

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.860 
let's see I was able to print a small
little<00:00:31.009> beagle<00:00:32.009> bone<00:00:32.329> I'm<00:00:33.329> gonna<00:00:33.480> try<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.719> do

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
little beagle bone I'm gonna try to do

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:46.869 
little beagle bone I'm gonna try to do
that<00:00:33.930> again<00:00:35.000> see<00:00:36.000> if<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.690> still<00:00:37.110> works

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.450 

I'm<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.690> missing<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> pan<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.530> here

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.720 

but

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
but

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:08.320 
but
it<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:55.329> what<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:55.600> is

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.170 

and<00:01:09.020> wall-e<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.830> moving<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:10.580> sporting

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
and wall-e is moving and sporting

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.710 
and wall-e is moving and sporting
plastic<00:01:12.670> now<00:01:13.670> I've<00:01:14.210> got<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.480> do<00:01:14.600> the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
plastic now I've got to do the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.060 
plastic now I've got to do the
kinematics

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.330 

and<00:01:20.610> tweak<00:01:20.970> my<00:01:21.120> print<00:01:21.390> settings<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.920> not

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and tweak my print settings but I'm not

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:45.359 
and tweak my print settings but I'm not
real<00:01:23.550> worried<00:01:23.820> about<00:01:23.970> that

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.969 

now<00:01:46.179> one<00:01:46.359> of<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.539> things<00:01:46.750> with<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.560> segment

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
now one of the things with the segment

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.240 
now one of the things with the segment
eyes<00:01:48.189> is<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:49.840> compensates<00:01:50.320> for<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:50.890> bed<00:01:51.070> not

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
eyes is it compensates for the bed not

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.480 
eyes is it compensates for the bed not
being<00:01:51.579> level<00:01:52.409> I'm<00:01:53.409> not<00:01:53.439> sure<00:01:53.829> if<00:01:53.890> we<00:01:54.009> can<00:01:54.039> see

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
being level I'm not sure if we can see

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.849 
being level I'm not sure if we can see
it<00:01:54.609> back<00:01:54.939> here<00:01:55.329> but<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.869> bed<00:01:59.109> is<00:01:59.140> actually

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
it back here but the bed is actually

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:06.450 
it back here but the bed is actually
moving<00:02:00.130> up<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:02.110> down<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:04.270> it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
moving up and down as it

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.359 
moving up and down as it
goes<00:02:07.120> my<00:02:07.630> bed<00:02:07.810> mostly<00:02:08.259> is<00:02:08.380> unlevel<00:02:08.770> in<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.040> Y

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
goes my bed mostly is unlevel in the Y

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.490 
goes my bed mostly is unlevel in the Y
dimension<00:02:09.670> front<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.390> back<00:02:10.540> side<00:02:11.110> besides

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
dimension front to back side besides

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.050 
dimension front to back side besides
actually<00:02:11.770> pretty<00:02:12.130> good<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:14.790> gonna<00:02:15.790> have<00:02:15.910> to

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
actually pretty good so gonna have to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.820 
actually pretty good so gonna have to
compensate<00:02:16.600> for<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:16.960> in<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> kinematics<00:02:17.770> I

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
compensate for that in the kinematics I

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.310 
compensate for that in the kinematics I
write<00:02:18.040> from<00:02:18.160> my<00:02:18.250> CNC<00:02:18.910> or<00:02:19.180> otherwise<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:20.140> bed

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
write from my CNC or otherwise the bed

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.920 
write from my CNC or otherwise the bed
level<00:02:20.500> somehow

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.930 

some<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.680> movement<00:02:26.129> with<00:02:26.280> Wally<00:02:26.489> seems<00:02:26.819> a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
some of the movement with Wally seems a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.670 
some of the movement with Wally seems a
little<00:02:27.209> bit<00:02:27.480> jerky<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.930> don't<00:02:28.170> know<00:02:28.319> if<00:02:28.440> that's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
little bit jerky I don't know if that's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.789 
little bit jerky I don't know if that's
my<00:02:29.040> build<00:02:29.610> if<00:02:30.150> that's<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.810> design<00:02:31.319> or<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
my build if that's the design or the

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:42.430 
my build if that's the design or the
segment<00:02:32.159> eyes<00:02:32.310> or<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.470> issue<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.980> but

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.070 

can<00:02:43.010> pretty<00:02:43.190> well<00:02:43.420> got<00:02:44.420> one<00:02:44.600> more<00:02:44.810> day<00:02:45.020> to

can pretty well got one more day to

challenge

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:04:10.839 

it's<00:03:50.310> almost<00:03:50.490> on

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:24.040 

oh<00:04:13.120> oh<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:14.540> I<00:04:14.840> forgot<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.349> move<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:23.050> so

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
oh oh and I forgot the move to the so

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.820 
oh oh and I forgot the move to the so
now<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.350> have<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:24.560> blob<00:04:24.830> but<00:04:25.460> that's<00:04:25.729> okay<00:04:26.830> yeah

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
now I have a blob but that's okay yeah

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.670 
now I have a blob but that's okay yeah
there<00:04:28.190> we<00:04:28.280> go

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.640 

little<00:04:33.680> blue<00:04:33.889> tape<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.639> can<00:04:34.849> print<00:04:35.199> cold<00:04:36.199> I

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
little blue tape you can print cold I

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.860 
little blue tape you can print cold I
don't<00:04:37.610> have<00:04:37.849> the<00:04:37.940> bed<00:04:38.120> heater<00:04:38.300> hooked<00:04:38.570> up<00:04:38.690> yet

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
don't have the bed heater hooked up yet

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.530 
don't have the bed heater hooked up yet
but<00:04:39.020> there<00:04:39.349> we<00:04:39.410> go
