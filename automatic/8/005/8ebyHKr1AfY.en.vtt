00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.120
 now since it is in the habits and half 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.720
 little golden I put the fried onions and 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.720

 If I put the onion soup envelope 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.879

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.879
 I'll put 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.560
 the species 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:40.300
 with the onion hyssop you do not put 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.300
 the meat broth 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.770
 I'm going to add a glass of water and 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.930
 how much the sauce starts to thicken 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.660
 that's going to be nothing right now and same 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.400
 because as has proved fort 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.580
 evaporates the water that you added from 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.710
 immediately going to catch the flavors the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.440
 meat and we're going to have a dish of 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.280
 minister have been five minutes more 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.090

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.590
