means before the blade is put on a tough
I<00:00:32.250> guess<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:32.940> 500<00:00:33.510> grams<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.050> size<00:00:34.290> 8

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
I guess it's up 500 grams and a size 8

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.740 
I guess it's up 500 grams and a size 8
the<00:00:35.610> particular<00:00:35.940> size<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.540> we're<00:00:36.660> using

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750

the particular size that we're using
here<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.680> size<00:00:38.070> seven<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.480> picked<00:00:39.719> up

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
here is a size seven that we picked up

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.940 
here is a size seven that we picked up
here<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.579> this<00:00:41.579> boot<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.469> 667<00:00:43.469> grams

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
here and this boot here was 667 grams

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.369 
here and this boot here was 667 grams
now<00:00:44.250> that's<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.700> blade<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:46.230> what

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
now that's what the blade on it so what

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.799 
now that's what the blade on it so what
we<00:00:46.469> did<00:00:46.590> was<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:47.010> took<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.280> holder<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.539> runner

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
we did was we took a holder and runner

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.630 
we did was we took a holder and runner
which<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> plastic<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> steel<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
which is the plastic and a steel with a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520 
which is the plastic and a steel with a
bolts<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.000> everything<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.930> put<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.199> our<00:00:52.320> gram

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
bolts and everything we put on our gram

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.639 
bolts and everything we put on our gram
scale<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.850> blade<00:00:54.059> itself<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.570> 246<00:00:55.320> grams

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
scale and the blade itself was 246 grams

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.830 
scale and the blade itself was 246 grams
which<00:00:56.550> leads<00:00:56.789> us<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.030> believe<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.539> boot

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
which leads us to believe that the boot

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.490 
which leads us to believe that the boot
itself<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.289> 441<00:00:59.570> grams<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> boot<00:01:01.170> so

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
itself is 441 grams for the boot so

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.439 
itself is 441 grams for the boot so
Easton<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.340> right<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> market<00:01:03.090> being<00:01:03.300> if

couple<00:01:43.740> cuts<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.790> they<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.840> help<00:01:45.990> with

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
couple cuts that they have to help with

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.789 
couple cuts that they have to help with
this<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:47.130> skate<00:01:47.399> bending<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.560> way<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.710> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
this the skate bending the way that it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.469 
this the skate bending the way that it
bends<00:01:49.979> forward<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.549> actually<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
bends forward I actually have the

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.560 
bends forward I actually have the
previous<00:01:52.579> version<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.180> which<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
previous version to this which is the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.020 
previous version to this which is the
east<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.320> 1500<00:01:56.040> which<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.340> really<00:01:56.700> do<00:01:56.820> like

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
east and 1500 which I really do like

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.999 
east and 1500 which I really do like
this<00:01:57.869> skate<00:01:58.110> here<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.350> nice<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.710> only<00:01:58.860> thing

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
this skate here is nice the only thing

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.380 
this skate here is nice the only thing
that<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.189> don't<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.460> about<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.149> liner

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that I don't like about this the liner

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.899 
that I don't like about this the liner
if<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.020> here<00:02:01.399> on<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> inside<00:02:02.759> I'll

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
if they have on here on the inside I'll

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.819 
if they have on here on the inside I'll
moving<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.299> little<00:02:03.479> closer<00:02:04.320> here<00:02:04.439> for<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
moving in a little closer here for you

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.889 
moving in a little closer here for you
and<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.759> material<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.450> almost<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and this material here is almost like a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.749 
and this material here is almost like a
material<00:02:07.350> they<00:02:07.619> took<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.799> hydrophobic<00:02:08.399> foam

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
material they took that hydrophobic foam

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.850 
material they took that hydrophobic foam
out<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.090> here<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:09.929> some<00:02:10.110> reason<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> only

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
out of here for some reason and the only

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.619 
out of here for some reason and the only
problem<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:11.640> people<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.300> escape

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
problem is with people that escape

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.760 
problem is with people that escape
barefoot

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
barefoot

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
barefoot
this<00:02:13.920> escape<00:02:14.520> for<00:02:14.700> some<00:02:14.850> reason<00:02:15.210> in<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:16.020> very

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
this escape for some reason in a very

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.100 
this escape for some reason in a very
beginning<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.190> have<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.490> broken<00:02:17.640> in

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
beginning and so you have it broken in

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.600 
beginning and so you have it broken in
almost<00:02:19.110> acts<00:02:19.320> like<00:02:19.380> sandpaper<00:02:19.800> we've<00:02:20.490> had

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
almost acts like sandpaper we've had

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.230 
almost acts like sandpaper we've had
reports<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:21.150> people<00:02:21.500> cutting<00:02:22.500> your<00:02:22.680> feet<00:02:22.890> up

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
know it's pretty good to incorporate at

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.080 
know it's pretty good to incorporate at
that<00:02:30.330> same<00:02:31.040> material<00:02:32.040> here<00:02:32.460> on<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.610> tongue<00:02:32.850> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
yeah this is the light parabolic it's

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.180 
yeah this is the light parabolic it's
really<00:02:45.690> nice<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:45.960> got<00:02:46.110> two<00:02:46.350> screws<00:02:47.010> right

this<00:02:52.470> skate<00:02:52.710> is<00:02:52.830> very<00:02:53.010> lightweight<00:02:53.960> it's<00:02:54.960> got

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
this skate is very lightweight it's got

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.750 
this skate is very lightweight it's got
the<00:02:55.200> bio<00:02:55.350> dry<00:02:55.680> liner<00:02:55.980> that's<00:02:56.460> on<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.640> inside

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
the bio dry liner that's on the inside

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.960 
the bio dry liner that's on the inside
and<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:59.040> know<00:02:59.070> pretty<00:02:59.280> much<00:02:59.430> that's<00:02:59.730> about<00:02:59.940> it

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
and you know pretty much that's about it

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.850 
and you know pretty much that's about it
about<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.420> skate<00:03:00.660> here<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.350> technology

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
about this skate here the technology

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.110 
about this skate here the technology
material<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.310> you're<00:03:02.430> using<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.820> inside

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
material that you're using on the inside

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.210 
material that you're using on the inside
here<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.720> textured<00:03:04.170> look<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.100> they

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
here is just a textured look that they

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.440 
here is just a textured look that they
have<00:03:05.370> here<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.820> looks<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.000> carbon

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
have here so it looks like carbon

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.480 
have here so it looks like carbon
graphite<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:07.530> that's<00:03:07.710> basically<00:03:07.890> about<00:03:08.160> it

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
graphite and that's basically about it

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.920 
graphite and that's basically about it
the<00:03:08.820> only<00:03:08.970> problem<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.300> see<00:03:09.360> with<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.690> skate

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
the only problem I see with this skate

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.350 
the only problem I see with this skate
here<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.410> that<00:03:10.710> sometimes<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.490> pieces<00:03:12.150> on<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
here is that sometimes the pieces on the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.210 
here is that sometimes the pieces on the
outside<00:03:12.720> here<00:03:12.960> come<00:03:13.440> off<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.830> skate<00:03:14.100> is

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
outside here come off this skate is

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.030 
outside here come off this skate is
actually<00:03:14.900> stitched<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.200> inside<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
actually stitched to the inside of the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.340 
actually stitched to the inside of the
boot<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.850> everything<00:03:18.240> kind<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:19.080> glued

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
boot so everything kind of is is glued
