00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello dmitry tell me why you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.389
 What did you choose this DVR? 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.940
 Liked it but the last time I am more 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.530
 based on advice 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.940
 employees of the company Karadar because 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.210
 Last time when I was a receptionist 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.939
 website is a very good model this time 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.660
 deciding to change him since he just 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.000
 left 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.500
 went the old way called in 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.300
 companies offered me a choice 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.260
 several models one of which me 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.739
 arranged so that it is rather miniature 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.230
 camera car on and god himself stands just 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.250
 another place wish handouts there 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.090
 want blockade thanks thanks let's order 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.430
 installation service and attended it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.969
 how did you like the quality of work all 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.340
 whether you are satisfied with the quality good done 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.770
 fast enough of course a little longer 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.329
 than promised it seemed 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.660
 due simply to the complexity of the installation 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.890
 it was my very big 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.260
 gram 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.560
 very clean then no trace 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.830
 cars left and plus put everything 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.110
 very convenient as possible 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.880
 Dmitry did you talk about the hidden 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.000
 the installation of a surprise camera is practically 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.340
 not visible that is, it merges with the background 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.080
 dark mirror and and as far as I understand 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.509
 looked outside 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.330
 voting just doesn't cling she doesn't 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.280
 stands out so you need to look closely 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.930
 even means there is something worth to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.550
 I speak as I had questions in 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.710
 plan for the registrar to work 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.289
 constantly 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.820
 suggested it power up switching on 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.690
 the ignition is really constant 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.050
 basis 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.380
 on the motion sensor and what's good with him 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.820
 we have a light on the camera 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.410
 which shows what is really 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.619
 works that we don't need to constantly 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.399
 check turned on he did not turn on goes 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.399
 record or not
