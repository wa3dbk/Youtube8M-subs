00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
as the VCO range is 70 to 79 so you can

as the VCO range is 70 to 79 so you can
set<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.210> discrimination<00:02:09.840> all<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.440> way<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> 79

of<00:03:30.440> 10<00:03:30.710> iron<00:03:31.370> target<00:03:31.910> volume<00:03:32.060> is<00:03:32.420> now<00:03:32.750> at<00:03:33.050> 0

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
of 10 iron target volume is now at 0

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.040 
of 10 iron target volume is now at 0
while<00:03:34.220> all<00:03:34.460> other<00:03:34.850> targets<00:03:35.360> are<00:03:35.540> at<00:03:35.780> max

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
while all other targets are at max

while all other targets are at max
volume<00:03:37.010> numbers<00:03:37.520> 11<00:03:37.910> through<00:03:38.270> 20

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
volume numbers 11 through 20

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.930 
volume numbers 11 through 20
incrementally<00:03:39.590> increases<00:03:40.220> only<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.760> iron

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
incrementally increases only the iron

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.440 
incrementally increases only the iron
targets<00:03:41.360> so<00:03:42.230> at<00:03:42.350> volume<00:03:42.590> 20<00:03:43.160> both<00:03:43.730> iron<00:03:44.090> and

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
targets so at volume 20 both iron and

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.230 
targets so at volume 20 both iron and
non<00:03:44.810> iron<00:03:45.140> targets<00:03:45.530> are<00:03:45.890> at<00:03:46.130> a<00:03:46.190> maximum<00:03:46.790> volume

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.240 
non iron targets are at a maximum volume

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.140 
non iron targets are at a maximum volume
this<00:03:47.990> unique<00:03:48.410> feature<00:03:48.680> is<00:03:49.040> ideal<00:03:49.580> for<00:03:50.000> hunting

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
this unique feature is ideal for hunting

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.290 
this unique feature is ideal for hunting
iron<00:03:50.630> infested<00:03:51.290> sites<00:03:51.590> by<00:03:52.550> setting<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.090> iron

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
iron infested sites by setting the iron

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.590 
iron infested sites by setting the iron
volume<00:03:53.810> lower<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.950> can<00:03:55.190> still<00:03:55.520> hear<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:55.940> but

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
volume lower you can still hear it but

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.540 
volume lower you can still hear it but
the<00:03:56.750> good<00:03:56.960> targets<00:03:57.440> come<00:03:57.740> through<00:03:58.010> stronger

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
the good targets come through stronger

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.330 
the good targets come through stronger
let's<00:03:58.940> go<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.210> 10<00:03:59.570> and<00:03:59.900> totally<00:04:00.590> knock<00:04:00.830> out<00:04:01.100> the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
let's go to 10 and totally knock out the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.240 
let's go to 10 and totally knock out the
ferrous<00:04:01.760> volume<00:04:05.380> so<00:04:06.380> now<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.560> can<00:04:06.800> see<00:04:07.040> we're

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
ferrous volume so now you can see we're

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.449 
ferrous volume so now you can see we're
getting<00:04:07.520> an<00:04:07.640> iron<00:04:07.970> target<00:04:08.739> but<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:09.770> volume<00:04:10.130> is

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
getting an iron target but the volume is

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.420 
getting an iron target but the volume is
gone<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:11.660> let's<00:04:11.870> adjust<00:04:12.020> the<00:04:12.380> volume<00:04:12.709> up<00:04:12.830> to<00:04:12.980> 11

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
gone so let's adjust the volume up to 11

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.060 
gone so let's adjust the volume up to 11
which<00:04:13.970> will<00:04:14.150> give<00:04:14.330> us<00:04:14.360> a<00:04:14.660> non-ferrous<00:04:15.440> setting

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
which will give us a non-ferrous setting

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:27.720 
which will give us a non-ferrous setting
of<00:04:16.220> max<00:04:16.790> volume<00:04:17.150> in<00:04:17.600> a<00:04:17.750> ferrous<00:04:18.320> setting<00:04:18.799> of<00:04:19.090> 1

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.400 

so<00:04:28.730> now<00:04:28.880> we'll<00:04:29.060> set<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.330> volume<00:04:29.450> at<00:04:29.780> 20<00:04:30.230> and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
so now we'll set the volume at 20 and

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.370 
so now we'll set the volume at 20 and
you'll<00:04:30.950> hear<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.220> ferrous<00:04:31.970> target<00:04:32.630> at<00:04:32.810> max

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
you'll hear a ferrous target at max

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:58.900 
you'll hear a ferrous target at max
volume<00:04:40.840> much<00:04:41.840> louder

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.400 

all<00:04:59.910> right<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:00.240> now<00:05:00.389> let's<00:05:00.419> take<00:05:00.810> a<00:05:00.840> look<00:05:01.110> at<00:05:01.380> a

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
all right so now let's take a look at a

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.190 
all right so now let's take a look at a
good<00:05:01.830> target<00:05:02.250> with<00:05:02.669> a<00:05:02.700> ferrous<00:05:03.210> target<00:05:03.720> will

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
good target with a ferrous target will

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.140 
good target with a ferrous target will
have<00:05:04.350> the<00:05:04.500> volume<00:05:04.889> set<00:05:05.190> at<00:05:05.310> eleven<00:05:05.790> which<00:05:06.000> will

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
have the volume set at eleven which will

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.020 
have the volume set at eleven which will
be<00:05:06.270> max<00:05:06.660> level<00:05:07.350> for<00:05:07.560> non-ferrous<00:05:08.130> targets<00:05:08.820> in

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
be max level for non-ferrous targets in

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:29.140 
be max level for non-ferrous targets in
a<00:05:09.510> setting<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.930> one<00:05:10.620> for<00:05:11.280> ferrous<00:05:11.639> targets

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.210 

okay<00:05:30.150> let's<00:05:30.389> take<00:05:30.570> this<00:05:30.750> up<00:05:30.960> to<00:05:30.990> 20<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.710> now

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
okay let's take this up to 20 and now

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.820 
okay let's take this up to 20 and now
we'll<00:05:32.430> have<00:05:32.580> a<00:05:32.639> max<00:05:33.210> volume<00:05:33.840> on<00:05:34.020> ferrous<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:34.740> a

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
we'll have a max volume on ferrous and a

00:05:34.830 --> 00:06:02.180 
we'll have a max volume on ferrous and a
max<00:05:35.220> volume<00:05:35.729> on<00:05:35.880> non-ferrous<00:05:36.419> target

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.960 

alright<00:06:03.190> I'm<00:06:03.280> going<00:06:03.430> to<00:06:03.490> show<00:06:03.610> you<00:06:03.639> a<00:06:03.759> couple

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
alright I'm going to show you a couple

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:12.290 
alright I'm going to show you a couple
of<00:06:04.120> common<00:06:04.479> targets<00:06:04.840> here's<00:06:05.080> a<00:06:05.169> u.s.<00:06:05.470> quarter

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:23.670 

here's<00:06:13.300> a<00:06:13.360> u.s.<00:06:13.690> dime<00:06:22.169> and<00:06:23.169> now<00:06:23.349> we'll<00:06:23.530> do<00:06:23.650> a

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
here's a u.s. dime and now we'll do a

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:44.930 
here's a u.s. dime and now we'll do a
u.s.<00:06:24.099> nickel

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.000 

you
