1.85<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.940> next<00:00:35.180> thing<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:35.420> like<00:00:35.780> about<00:00:35.810> alters

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
1.85 the next thing I like about alters

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.620 
1.85 the next thing I like about alters
that<00:00:36.500> they<00:00:36.650> do<00:00:36.800> these<00:00:37.090> incremental<00:00:38.090> changes

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
that they do these incremental changes

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.810 
that they do these incremental changes
so<00:00:38.780> they<00:00:38.900> come<00:00:39.050> out<00:00:39.170> with<00:00:39.320> these<00:00:39.410> 1.5<00:00:40.070> s<00:00:40.280> rather

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
so they come out with these 1.5 s rather

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.700 
so they come out with these 1.5 s rather
than<00:00:41.000> saying<00:00:41.059> that<00:00:41.420> torrent<00:00:42.079> 2<00:00:42.199> point<00:00:42.440> 0<00:00:42.530> and

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
than saying that torrent 2 point 0 and

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.069 
than saying that torrent 2 point 0 and
they<00:00:42.770> just<00:00:42.890> make<00:00:43.070> some<00:00:43.250> slight<00:00:43.489> modifications

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
they just make some slight modifications

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.799 
they just make some slight modifications
from<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:45.500> first<00:00:45.770> pair<00:00:45.980> I<00:00:46.160> know<00:00:46.579> shoes<00:00:47.239> come<00:00:47.780> in

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
from the first pair I know shoes come in

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.139 
from the first pair I know shoes come in
and<00:00:48.170> wait<00:00:48.350> at<00:00:48.620> nine<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.340> a<00:00:49.430> half<00:00:49.460> ounces<00:00:49.760> so

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
and wait at nine and a half ounces so

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.209 
and wait at nine and a half ounces so
pretty<00:00:50.809> light<00:00:51.050> not<00:00:51.289> the<00:00:51.320> lightest<00:00:51.769> thing<00:00:51.949> on

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
pretty light not the lightest thing on

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.419 
pretty light not the lightest thing on
the<00:00:52.340> earth<00:00:52.460> but<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.000> is<00:00:53.329> a<00:00:54.079> highly<00:00:54.859> cushion

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
the earth but this is a highly cushion

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.360 
the earth but this is a highly cushion
neutral<00:00:56.090> training<00:00:56.690> shoe<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.140> this<00:00:57.289> is<00:00:57.500> ultras

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
neutral training shoe so this is ultras

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.069 
neutral training shoe so this is ultras
version<00:00:58.760> they<00:00:59.000> still<00:00:59.239> have<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.510> zero<00:00:59.719> drop

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
version they still have the zero drop

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.169 
version they still have the zero drop
that<00:01:00.320> means<00:01:00.530> from<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:01.100> heel<00:01:01.429> to<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:02.030> toe

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
that means from the heel to the toe

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.710 
that means from the heel to the toe
there<00:01:02.929> is<00:01:03.170> zero<00:01:03.829> offset<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:04.550> zero<00:01:04.879> drop<00:01:05.239> but

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
there is zero offset so zero drop but

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.540 
there is zero offset so zero drop but
it's<00:01:05.870> highly<00:01:06.260> cushioned<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.250> they've<00:01:07.400> got

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
it's highly cushioned so they've got

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.060 
it's highly cushioned so they've got
more<00:01:07.820> cushion<00:01:08.270> in<00:01:08.510> here<00:01:08.810> than<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:09.530> lot<00:01:09.890> of<00:01:09.980> the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
more cushion in here than a lot of the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.950 
more cushion in here than a lot of the
other<00:01:10.250> cultures<00:01:10.790> shoes<00:01:11.030> heads<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:11.630> this<00:01:11.810> is

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
other cultures shoes heads so this is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.289

which I really appreciate at at first
the<00:01:25.549> shoe<00:01:25.759> almost<00:01:26.149> felt<00:01:26.450> like<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:26.899> was<00:01:26.990> a

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
the shoe almost felt like it was a

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.510 
the shoe almost felt like it was a
little<00:01:27.229> too<00:01:27.380> big<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:27.860> just<00:01:28.040> wasn't<00:01:28.189> used<00:01:28.369> to

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
little too big it just wasn't used to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.760 
little too big it just wasn't used to
that<00:01:28.579> wide<00:01:29.479> of<00:01:29.689> a<00:01:29.780> toe<00:01:29.960> box<00:01:30.140> now<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.409> wear<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:30.649> lot

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
that wide of a toe box now I wear a lot

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.710 
that wide of a toe box now I wear a lot
of<00:01:30.920> minimal<00:01:31.340> shoes<00:01:31.579> but<00:01:31.790> this<00:01:32.000> even<00:01:32.329> compared

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
of minimal shoes but this even compared

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.389 
of minimal shoes but this even compared
to<00:01:32.810> other<00:01:32.930> minimal<00:01:33.320> shoes<00:01:33.500> felt<00:01:33.860> even<00:01:34.220> a

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
to other minimal shoes felt even a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.300 
to other minimal shoes felt even a
little<00:01:35.000> wider<00:01:35.240> than<00:01:35.390> normal<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.500> they<00:01:36.979> really

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
little wider than normal so they really

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.010 
little wider than normal so they really
let<00:01:37.520> your<00:01:37.729> toes<00:01:38.090> get<00:01:38.270> in<00:01:38.390> there<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.600> spread

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020

let your toes get in there and spread
out<00:01:39.200> there's<00:01:39.439> tons<00:01:39.770> of<00:01:39.890> room<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:40.579> on<00:01:40.729> those

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
out there's tons of room so on those

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.090 
out there's tons of room so on those
long<00:01:41.090> distances<00:01:41.689> where<00:01:41.930> your<00:01:42.110> feet<00:01:42.500> may<00:01:42.680> start

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
swelling up it just has a room to

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.800 
breathe in there to push off and really
helps<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.560> form<00:01:48.860> more<00:01:49.490> of<00:01:49.640> that<00:01:49.820> proper

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
helps you to form more of that proper

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.719 
helps you to form more of that proper
technique<00:01:51.350> when<00:01:51.649> you're<00:01:51.799> running<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:52.549> it

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
technique when you're running so it

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.529 
technique when you're running so it
encourages<00:01:52.939> you<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.630> do<00:01:53.960> that<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:55.270> rubber<00:01:56.270> on

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
encourages you to do that that rubber on

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.270 
encourages you to do that that rubber on
the<00:01:56.659> side<00:01:56.869> here<00:01:56.899> throughout<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.560> platform<00:01:58.130> is

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
the side here throughout the platform is

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.109 
the side here throughout the platform is
a<00:01:58.729> blended<00:01:59.119> evaa<00:01:59.570> bound<00:02:00.289> cushioning<00:02:01.039> system

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
a blended evaa bound cushioning system

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.330 
a blended evaa bound cushioning system
so<00:02:02.119> it's<00:02:02.630> got<00:02:02.960> some<00:02:03.200> cushion<00:02:03.500> in<00:02:03.619> here<00:02:03.920> like<00:02:04.189> I

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
so it's got some cushion in here like I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.639 
so it's got some cushion in here like I
said<00:02:04.600> more<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:05.780> than<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:06.020> lot<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.469> other

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
said more so than a lot of the other

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.460 
said more so than a lot of the other
ultra<00:02:07.280> shoes<00:02:07.549> and<00:02:07.820> so<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.600> upper<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.110> little

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
ultra shoes and so the upper is a little

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.220 
ultra shoes and so the upper is a little
bit<00:02:09.619> different<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.240> has<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.420> quick<00:02:11.720> dry<00:02:11.960> a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
bit different and it has a quick dry a

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.470 
bit different and it has a quick dry a
term<00:02:12.380> ish<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.710> that's<00:02:12.920> what<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.640> mesh<00:02:13.850> system

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
term ish so that's what the mesh system

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.009 
term ish so that's what the mesh system
on<00:02:14.630> here<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.790> some<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:16.970> few<00:02:17.150> things<00:02:17.209> I<00:02:17.540> did

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
on here is some of the few things I did

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.470 
on here is some of the few things I did
not<00:02:18.290> like<00:02:18.680> there<00:02:18.920> wasn't

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
not like there wasn't

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.259 
not like there wasn't
but<00:02:19.930> like<00:02:20.650> i<00:02:20.769> said<00:02:20.800> i<00:02:20.980> have<00:02:21.159> about<00:02:21.310> 20<00:02:21.700> miles<00:02:21.879> on

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
but like i said i have about 20 miles on

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.539 
but like i said i have about 20 miles on
these<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.050> that's<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.409> WOB<00:02:23.769> see<00:02:24.010> do<00:02:24.190> more

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
these and that's it and WOB see do more

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.699 
these and that's it and WOB see do more
of<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.670> deep<00:02:24.819> dive<00:02:25.000> after<00:02:25.629> I<00:02:25.870> logs<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.319> miles<00:02:26.500> on

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
of a deep dive after I logs and miles on

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.470 
of a deep dive after I logs and miles on
tomb<00:02:26.950> but<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.519> shoe<00:02:27.640> right<00:02:27.849> now<00:02:28.000> feels<00:02:28.299> a

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
tomb but the shoe right now feels a

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.229 
tomb but the shoe right now feels a
little<00:02:28.690> stiff<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:30.099> can<00:02:30.250> see<00:02:30.400> right<00:02:30.430> here<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
little stiff you can see right here the

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.729 
little stiff you can see right here the
only<00:02:31.480> place<00:02:31.629> that's<00:02:31.780> really<00:02:32.049> bending<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.560> just

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
only place that's really bending is just

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.729 
only place that's really bending is just
right<00:02:33.010> across<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.420> toes<00:02:34.690> up<00:02:34.989> front<00:02:35.319> there<00:02:35.500> so

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
right across the toes up front there so

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.160 
right across the toes up front there so
there's<00:02:36.250> not<00:02:36.430> much<00:02:36.760> flexibility<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.900> here

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
there's not much flexibility in here

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.860 
there's not much flexibility in here
hopefully<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.830> loosens<00:02:39.190> up<00:02:39.340> after<00:02:39.790> we<00:02:40.420> walk

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
hopefully that loosens up after we walk

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.479 
hopefully that loosens up after we walk
some<00:02:41.110> more<00:02:41.140> miles<00:02:41.470> but<00:02:41.739> right<00:02:41.920> now<00:02:42.069> that's<00:02:42.250> my

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
some more miles but right now that's my

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.250 
some more miles but right now that's my
first<00:02:42.819> just<00:02:43.060> gut<00:02:43.299> reaction<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.870> feels<00:02:44.080> a

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
first just gut reaction it feels a

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.789 
first just gut reaction it feels a
little<00:02:44.500> stiff<00:02:44.920> overall<00:02:45.849> and<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:47.260> tongue<00:02:47.530> on

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
little stiff overall and the tongue on

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.039 
little stiff overall and the tongue on
here<00:02:48.040> also<00:02:48.220> felt<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.849> little<00:02:49.329> thick<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.870> me<00:02:50.019> I

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
here also felt a little thick to me I

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.020 
here also felt a little thick to me I
can<00:02:50.230> already<00:02:50.409> feel<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:50.860> kind<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.370> felt<00:02:51.940> a

obviously love what they're doing on a
heel<00:03:12.790> where<00:03:13.209> they<00:03:13.329> have<00:03:13.540> taking<00:03:13.900> on<00:03:13.989> some

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
heel where they have taking on some

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.530 
heel where they have taking on some
rubber<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.470> give<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.769> skeleton<00:03:15.700> kinda

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.990 
rubber to give it that skeleton kinda
toe<00:03:17.260> look<00:03:17.739> but<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.549> other<00:03:18.700> thing<00:03:18.849> they've

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
toe look but the other thing they've

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.599 
toe look but the other thing they've
actually<00:03:19.209> taken<00:03:19.450> out<00:03:19.900> rubber<00:03:20.620> from<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.370> heel

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
actually taken out rubber from the heel

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.699 
actually taken out rubber from the heel
here<00:03:21.819> so<00:03:22.120> where<00:03:22.840> it's<00:03:23.109> not<00:03:23.290> needed<00:03:23.500> they've

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
here so where it's not needed they've

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.199 
here so where it's not needed they've
taken<00:03:23.889> it<00:03:24.069> out<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.549> obviously<00:03:24.730> saves

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
taken it out and that obviously saves

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.190 
taken it out and that obviously saves
weight<00:03:25.419> so<00:03:25.959> that's<00:03:26.169> good<00:03:26.739> for<00:03:27.430> everyone

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
weight so that's good for everyone

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.599 
weight so that's good for everyone
overall<00:03:29.200> like<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.709> colors<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.220> comes<00:03:30.459> in

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
overall like the colors this comes in

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.620 
overall like the colors this comes in
three<00:03:30.910> different<00:03:30.940> colors<00:03:31.410> yellow<00:03:32.410> in<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.829> blue

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
three different colors yellow in a blue

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.559 
three different colors yellow in a blue
so<00:03:34.630> that's<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.989> review<00:03:35.319> the<00:03:35.769> torn<00:03:36.269> 1.5<00:03:37.269> from

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
so that's the review the torn 1.5 from
