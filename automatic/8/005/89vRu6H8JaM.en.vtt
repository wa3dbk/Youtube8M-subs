00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.080
 Gangelt 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.250
 the hope 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.610
 as always will 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.330
 Photographer Jim Rakete in his Berlin studio as 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.039
 to succeed, not just the other way around 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.150
 century 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
 I think that was unfortunately so exhausted 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.849
 was continued 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.509
 super fast taken pictures 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.149
 and also sweet 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.529
 and I always believe that 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.230
 then listen that way when it looks like that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 This is really only possible with all your strength 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.520
 it is only necessary to take pictures that allows a Leica 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.700
 no other camera so the photographer can find the natural light 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.010
 Life has acquired Jan Rakete around a dozen Lankas 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.860
 and she did not let go 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.250
 for a photographer is immensely important to him 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.490
 very suitable for bad light 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.610
 lock closure Shake the most lock of the story 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.140
 this mastery of camera technology in which he continues 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.390
 Andreas Kaufmann 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.930
 three years ago, he took over the loan camera goes as the company 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.740
 was in dire need 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.050
 The triumphant advance of digital photography in the companies almost fatal 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.070
 become 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.050
 because the strength of the camera was analogue images. 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.090
 Movie- 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.800
 Now the Hessian company wants to make up ground in the digital market 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.320
 Meanwhile, Leicher cooperates with the Japanese electronics giant 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.580
 Panasonic 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.080
 5 IV clear on Kos the expansion of digital technology 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.610
 He has almost decided who is in the scoring of connected produce 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.159
 back 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.259
 itself a world wonder may produce itself before our year of life 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.670
 First of all, things are much worse 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.980
 but that said 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.030
 the preferred digital one is to see it immediately 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.030
 Now they can go back so we all go for the numbers 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.869
 the flagship is the EM 8 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:15.430
 a digital camera with if sparkling and licking Olic from Germany 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.239
 around 1000 pieces are built by her per month 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.829
 the foothold for the 450 employees insolvency 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.799
 Power here is a typical Leicher with the famous search technique 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.140
 the sighted object can be seen twice and is brought to cover thanks 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.229
 it sharp 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:39.039
 With the absence of mirror reflex can be better optical values 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.969
 achieve 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:45.379
 that has its price the case alone costs just 5000 euros 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.049
 but for whom only glider builds something like that 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.380
 a specific clientele 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.259
 that's especially appreciated and 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:55.549
 I'm sorry that children are 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.379
 a special feature 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.379
 But Liker also needs customers with smaller budgets 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.499
 There are other digital cameras for that 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:08.329
 The are used for Leica by Panasonic in Japan from just under 500 euros 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.349
 one with it 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.790
 But first, it wants to invest amounts in the double-digit million range 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.860
 you buy in development and production in the next few years 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.869
 and he wants to take the AG off the stock exchange 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:25.809
 The listing of the company only unnecessarily costs up to 800,000 euros per year 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:28.889
 for refinancing 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.899
 she was not available for one movie on the stock exchange 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.899
 and it always costs and publicity 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.529
 a small medium-sized company in a fairly opel country 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:40.259
 VirnetX lost 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.210
 and then there are still looks 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.270
 the classic analogue photo film cameras with bees the enterprise 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.059
 grew up 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.959
 Slowly they are dying out at Leica too 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.429
 but the company still builds it still only mint 500 pieces a month 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.429
 a small consolation for photographers like Jim Rocket when his heart beats 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:01.399
 analogous 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:05.689
 all his like cars are analogous as well and even if you have over a hundred others 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.159
 Cameras has these are in the main ones
