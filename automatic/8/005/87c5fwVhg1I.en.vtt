00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.689
 again this is another class on 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.940
 crossing office 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.519
 you will watch the previous before 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.330
 following for this was 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.219
 basically the same rule is a general rule 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.289
 which is at junctions and junctions 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.810
 driver must be the ticket to the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.400
 vehicles that followed submit to their 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.730
 right 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.510
 then we go to the first exercise and the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.800
 question is always who passes first 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.430
 to know 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.469
 we must first try to visualize where 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.770
 is on the left 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.930
 let's start with the black car 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:50.700
 black vehicle stay here or be grace 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:55.340
 black was normal and therefore 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.340
 director of the romario is the blue vehicle 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.840
 it's straight from the blue 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.210
 nobody in the vehicle 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.549
 therefore we already conclude that the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.250
 first pass will be the blue car 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.400
 seen as no one is direct and the others 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.400
 leave 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.909
 however if I ask if the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.350
 black car can move forward in 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:33.630
 used a good part you would say that 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:41.759
 Yes, because you can not advance before 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:44.970
 double again that only after 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.970
 is that some 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:56.399
 they would say guns a waste of time 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:02:03.810
 both ahead and think otherwise 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:06.090
 ahead and passes the first and only 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.110
 possible solution 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.160
 This lady used her work and 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.160
 end the black 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.820
 now I usually teach I think the trick 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.650
 if it's easier for you than I 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.650
 I called the roger accounts trick 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.100
 I'll explain and we tried to visualize 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.570
 of the three vehicles 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.750
 What vehicle is there that does not have anyone? 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.180
 before we try to find 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.730
 go to the left license plate 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.610
 we come to the conclusion that black has no 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.980
 nobody until now had nobody to 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.410
 right 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.220
 the order will be to the accounts of the stores that 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.070
 This black one imagines the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.440
 centennial school clock could 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.680
 promoters confirmed and then to the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.680
 blue 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.750
 another example we have the same confusion 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.000
 if you had seen again come to 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:23.079
 of each vehicle 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.980
 we again conclude that the 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.540
 others know more primary because it passes 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.010
 so black 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.269
 then another one, but we went back to the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.950
 previous year 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:42.040
 deep down we will do 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.890
 we did find out who did not 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:50.670
 I had neither the right one that used in Christmas to 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.670
 from there it 's simple blue 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.920
 finally have questions come back to see the the 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.410
 class 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.070
 sometimes you need to think 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.760
 is there anything missing in the video? 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:14.310
 comments or your ideas and not 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.400
 forget that you can continue to 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.130
 search our videos on other 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.530
 missions and notes on this site 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.570
 with this as much as in the last blog 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.570
 occurs until the next
