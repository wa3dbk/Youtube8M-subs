00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.450
 we study simply 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.099
 Few words 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.099
 Nikolai Frost and her story 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.679
 head of government 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.550
 the region 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.369
 last season even at the world championships 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.369
 Elena became the fourth number 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.689
 how did the team get 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.260
 amazing at all 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
 mutiny antony won the championship 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.390
 Japan excluded 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.610
 from 2004 to half a year 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.740
 that is, already five championship fifa not 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.300
 can 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.920
 By the way, the first year can hardly be 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 the second last year even past the book became 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.359
 but this one 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.869
 what we published 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.869
 Nikita Andava 

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:51.940
 but also about his program 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.019
 she performed 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.929
 triple rittberger in cascade 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:58.709
 Well, in general it was 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.359
 program 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.039
 let's say in the best traditions 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:04.669
 Nicholas Frost 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:05.870
 there was everything 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.129
 exactly what is needed 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.429
 and in the steps track 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:14.459
 but in all 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.459
 manifestations of this program 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:21.180
 members of united Russia were not 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.180
 in the original position 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.150
 in this environment 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.830
 then it became a phrase 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.650
 but did a good job 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.650
 music of course such that 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:37.759
 let's see what is there to work 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.379
 the names are a little bit from the effective measures 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.519
 if you don't give it against it, but let's see what's all there 

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:44.339
 Of course, it will not count a little bit better. 

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:46.460
 any talk yy 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.219
 but it will be cheaper 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.849
 last year she is of course very hard 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.070
 started the season 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.070
 serious 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.439
 clean here 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.449
 andrew deegin then 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.949
 36 thousand 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.080
 changed so much 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.080
 it's not enough for us 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.050
 but still it was a struggle 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.319
 moving forward 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.039
 it is immediately clear that this is more athletes 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.309
 emotions this season she's from the very first 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:31.400
 kidney start 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.090
 move forward i hope that 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.259
 free program yet 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.029
 more interesting 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:39.029
 I liked the show 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.259
 due to which beat this season percentage 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.180
 from frost 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.569
 all staging in the USSR 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.039
 trying to repeat success 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.699
 new country staging 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.309
 and if Russia 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:00.529
 also there was such a fashionable look 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:03.199
 even though it has changing 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.289
 Chaykovsky helil 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.729
 and if real life information 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.809
 and it is natural 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:13.360
 Here and now 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.289
 look what exactly is it that I 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.349
 I think that and probably the last stage rub 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:20.869
 just now when all the night it was 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:21.449
 would 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.449
 that is, another assessment 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.619
 it does not meet the requirements for 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:30.940
 soon we are such viruses 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.170
 It is very likely that no telling 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.900
 calculated if the solution is still
