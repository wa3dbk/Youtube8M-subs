00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.980
 30 thousand 6 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.870

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.290
 square 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 at 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.110
 submarines if not 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 square 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.920
 now 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 woke up here 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.530
 hockey 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.280
 and who knows 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.280
 found a typo this balance 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.730
 0 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.730
 in skp 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 and 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.780
 m 1 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:11.839
 RU 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:15.009
 i don't need 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.009
 so 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.259
 m 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.819
 they are not so content 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.819
 According to mid I donâ€™t have 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.729
 itar tass 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.609
 just unlike some 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.509
 dealt with 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:41.509
 So 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.899
 fact of something new 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.539
 ipad 3 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.729
 Euro 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:06.089
 but he is clearly a ship of this class very 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.089
 nicely 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.789
 so m 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.799
 who knew 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.239
 views 2 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.149
 Besides 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:53.249
 because we have first 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:54.979
 from per square meter 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:57.979
 and the public knows 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.689
 on the eve 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.789
 connecticut and here 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.900
 wonderful places in the play at all 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.979
 cube 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.979
 spruce 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.309

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.210

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.779
 decree 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.400
 what else 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.969
 recall 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:00.919
 even better 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.330
 Sokolovsky is no better 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.550
 the investigation believes that experts believe that 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.550
 Russia is now just 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.580
 but as always 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.259

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.259
 sixth match 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:27.330
