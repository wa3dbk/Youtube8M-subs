and I was up close it's made of paper
mache<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.150> wire<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> did<00:00:19.560> was<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.859> got<00:00:19.890> a

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
mache and wire so what I did was I got a

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.509 
mache and wire so what I did was I got a
section<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.840> craft<00:00:22.170> wire<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.890> shaped<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.369> into

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
section of craft wire and shaped it into

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.230 
section of craft wire and shaped it into
the<00:00:23.699> base<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.210> mask<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.369> then<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.609> paper

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the base of the mask and then I paper

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.150 
the base of the mask and then I paper
machine<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:27.930> newspaper<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.769> then

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
machine it with newspaper and then

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.279 
machine it with newspaper and then
coated<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.970> again<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.390> plain<00:00:30.689> white<00:00:30.960> paper

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
coated it again with plain white paper

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.290 
coated it again with plain white paper
and<00:00:32.239> after<00:00:33.239> its<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.260> painted<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> with

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
and after its it I painted it with

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.299 
and after its it I painted it with
acrylic<00:00:36.300> paints<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:39.410> then<00:00:40.410> after<00:00:41.190> I'd

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
acrylic paints and then after I'd

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.680 
acrylic paints and then after I'd
finished<00:00:41.340> painting<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.270> took<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.510> while<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
finished painting it it took a while to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.270 
finished painting it it took a while to
paint<00:00:43.050> i<00:00:43.670> glazed<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.920> gloss<00:00:46.920> glaze

haven't painted the back I've just put
some<00:00:56.280> elastic<00:00:56.730> something<00:00:57.030> where<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:58.670> yeah

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
some elastic something where it yeah

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.000 
some elastic something where it yeah
actually<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.050> took<00:01:01.230> me<00:01:01.410> ages<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.980> make<00:01:04.010> it's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
actually it took me ages to make it's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.820 
actually it took me ages to make it's
just<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.729> great<00:01:05.909> achievement<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:06.570> me

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
just a really great achievement for me

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.980 
just a really great achievement for me
to<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.100> after<00:01:08.520> I've<00:01:08.580> actually<00:01:08.729> made<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.299> I

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.600 

have<00:01:12.990> seen<00:01:13.229> some<00:01:13.409> other<00:01:13.560> majoras<00:01:14.040> masks<00:01:14.460> have

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
have seen some other majoras masks have

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.480 
have seen some other majoras masks have
been<00:01:14.670> made<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.799> wooden<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:17.280> for

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
been made they the wooden one for

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.039 
been made they the wooden one for
example<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.659> good<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.990> know

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
example is really really good I know

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.800 
example is really really good I know
this<00:01:19.619> one<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.860> flawed<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.030> my<00:01:21.299> opinion

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
this one is flawed but in my opinion

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.380 
this one is flawed but in my opinion
it's<00:01:22.740> not<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.009> bad<00:01:23.220> job<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.640> first<00:01:23.880> try<00:01:24.060> I'll

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
it's not a bad job for a first try I'll

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.760 
it's not a bad job for a first try I'll
just<00:01:24.509> hold<00:01:24.659> them<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> camera<00:01:25.500> so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
just hold them up to the camera so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.179 
just hold them up to the camera so
people<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.009> see

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
people can see it then and you can see

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.980 
people can see it then and you can see
the<00:01:32.400> layering<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.520> pops<00:01:35.520> out

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
the layering of it and how it pops out

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.210 
the layering of it and how it pops out
to<00:01:36.990> shape<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.409> that's<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.710> craft<00:01:37.979> while

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to shape it that's the craft while

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.080 
to shape it that's the craft while
shaping<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:40.310> should<00:01:41.310> probably<00:01:41.460> put<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.970> on

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
shaping it I should probably put it on

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.600 
shaping it I should probably put it on
and<00:01:42.270> show<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.509> what<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.780> looks<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.610> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
and show you what it looks like on and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.660 
and show you what it looks like on and
so<00:01:45.509> yeah<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.290> painted<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so yeah it's just painted with the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.440 
so yeah it's just painted with the
actual<00:01:48.299> bone<00:01:48.540> bits<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.369> lot<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> masks<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
actual bone bits a lot of the masks that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.289 
actual bone bits a lot of the masks that
are<00:01:51.659> created<00:01:52.460> have<00:01:53.460> sort<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> colors<00:01:54.090> there

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
are created have sort of colors there

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.590 
are created have sort of colors there
which<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.259> live<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.560> barren<00:01:55.799> plain<00:01:56.240> but<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
which I just live the barren plain but I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.670 
which I just live the barren plain but I
think<00:01:57.869> it's<00:01:57.990> probably<00:01:58.110> supposed<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.530> have

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
think it's probably supposed to have

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.840 
think it's probably supposed to have
colours<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.909> actually<00:02:00.119> missed<00:02:00.630> some<00:02:01.850> dots

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
colours and I actually missed some dots

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.410 
colours and I actually missed some dots
and<00:02:03.240> stripes<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.399> had<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.880> paint<00:02:06.119> those<00:02:06.299> on

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
and stripes so I had to paint those on

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.820 
and stripes so I had to paint those on
right<00:02:06.630> at<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.780> very<00:02:06.990> end<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:09.440> if<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.679> any

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
