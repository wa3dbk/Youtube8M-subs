00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.230
 bio everyone 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.330
 chris back in house new force 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.230
 I hope you have passed or that you 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.570
 have a good holiday 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.660
 there we are almost a month away from 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.550
 direct exit 13 yen and all and 13 may 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.160
 do a little update on what we know 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.750
 already play for now we did not 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.780
 not burned so words outages 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.970
 pronounces on the gameplay an email 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.390
 my opinion so far on everything that 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.509
 what's going on 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.309
 you start with nv like 13 good already 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:37.410
 shot to say that even though I 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.720
 am not naive to 2003 if I remember 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.910
 well here you are not concerned not 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.020
 it's not the lived my thesis what but I 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.699
 I'm really glad he comes back on 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.550
 the video game market they have more they 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.180
 have had two years to bang on so 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.079
 I hope they will do something 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.309
 not bad and then many steps are what 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.260
 it happens competition is going 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.900
 necessarily pushed both ways the line 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.239
 already progressed it will pull all this towards 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.640
 the top so for the super plan passes 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.979
 super good that they have returned have 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.940
 them too started here is me charge of 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.070
 wholeheartedly but I also think about 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.110
 nba players get up who do not do 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.630
 necessarily everything is there and as well for 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.560
 that's it for these people do but what is 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.960
 what can I say about it? 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.149
 well not much in fact seen that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.229
 so far they do not really 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.600
 communicate about their game I have not read 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.369
 two back like what someone or 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 a tumor or someone had to wash everything 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.510
 then touched good it's not too much what to say 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.750
 no longer on it 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.990
 fr but we got a little video 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.910
 of not very long gameplay gains is 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.890
 pleased with what I saw the end of this 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.140
 that I see in this video I took 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.159
 an exceptional goal you do not have the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.740
 lips 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.119
 to convince nothing convincing that I 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.390
 think it's going to be a long time 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.069
 win and could but well after we know 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.899
 never have they said that the gameplay of 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.100
 old apatite to tabouk we'll see 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.020
 I hope for them anyway that this 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.789
 really was not the final version 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.959
 of their game because otherwise it's going to be 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:05.420
 not in him but where in short we will see 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.740
 well I actually I can I 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.450
 really not comment too much on the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.470
 game we saw as I already have you 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.150
 said I am a day of strike 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.180
 so if there are live nba players who 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.379
 look at this this video I have to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.700
 know what you expect as 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.349
 improvement over the last I 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.790
 believe it was the say we're going 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.079
 present the elite 1 but what you 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.239
 wait as improvement over 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.890
 the discreet that you like not to shit everything 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.690
 and you expect to find yourself in 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.250
 the lakes what 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.980
 that's all it is to say is the live 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.260
 In any case, we'll go to the game 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.030
 me me concerns me 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.650
 oumou sall farm is not really said 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.920
 but you had to guess she was 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.240
 really disappointed with the 12 so better 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.610
 the only basketball game of valliguiÃ¨res 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.680
 sold so here you imagine my 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.150
 disappointment 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.739
 so I'm really waiting for the 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.209
 turning this year no interest at this 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.069
 role because there we are going to be we're gonna 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.739
 beat we'll finish the year and 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.090
 developers there we will fight but hey 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.700
 I really followed the news closely 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.110
 so far what is really 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.739
 had a lot a communication level they 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.450
 instead managed a universe buman kevin 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.190
 during but griffin and company the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.010
 gameplay lives blatter really going 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.630
 not bad and me there is globally there is 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.400
 three news that really kept my 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.569
 Warning 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.310
 already to start the nudes on the 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.500
 gameplay to mons and I 'm all that stuff 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.819
 in one and the same of one and the same 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.010
 point but all barefoot on the 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.360
 gameplay you know the changes of the 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.640
 famous stic used to dribble 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.930
 exploration on the defense is 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.360
 apparently another one is settled the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.480
 incredible speed problems 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.430
 basically they 're going to take into account of 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.719
 what they were told 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.319
 in the footsteps because they were told 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:39.819
 level of gameplay problems though 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.959
 it can be pretty good I hope that's it 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.120
 who are not of me I'm not saying that the 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.640
 gameplay of the xii was not been not been 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.640
 bad in fashion is rather appreciated well 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.959
 near he had already said but hey if they 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.450
 have been able to improve the few flaws 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.540
 who had in the 12th it can be that a 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.980
 plus the second point that shot me 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.019
 no attention is something 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.389
 again and they therefore have the 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.700
 children have not talked too much and 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.739
 they call it special abilities 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.629
 do not know if you've seen how 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:13.000
 it basically consists of each player 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.470
 will have special abilities that it 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.299
 little what is according to the player 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.489
 they are different for example you 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.139
 take chris paul if I understood correctly 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.549
 a game I see old age to take 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.320
 with tweezers of rigor because 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.460
 I did not have two really confident 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.349
 assure me on it but if I have 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.479
 understood and you take chris paul by 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.610
 example it will have a general capacity 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.840
 loses that allows bakers in 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.419
 so that when he's on the ground 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.099
 the lucidity of his teammates increases 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.199
 that is, they are more lucid and 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.970
 in defense and attack it can play 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.710
 a little how does it work for 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.690
 take that to compare with 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.419
 kendrick perkins not a country if i have 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.060
 well seen if Bernese understood by a 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.650
 screeners capacity that makes that 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.360
 me who put the big stockings here is what 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.070
 it's a hbo screen is a lot more 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.139
 effective than that of such cases which did not 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.699
 not the legal capacity the defender is 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.470
 disoriented all that not you see a little 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.330
 how hard it works I did not get 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.880
 too much detail on it so here it goes 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.470
 I'm also waiting for the museums there 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.389
 but good if salah other something 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.020
 sap is not bad huh in the bus to 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.500
 see how it will be 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.509
 michael all this will start his son 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.789
 nathan a little more of us here on the 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.789
 third point is it to that to the point 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.289
 who I am here made me would do me the 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.289
 more pleasure is that there would be 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.430
 maybe to a return from moore mode or 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.740
 so they did not really communicate 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.090
 again this relay on the game modes I 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.720
 think they will do in in the 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.150
 weeks arriving there but but but 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.800
 but there is a 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.750
 you must have seen her too I think I 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.210
 think but there was the list of successes 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.880
 that was unveiled the list of 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.400
 souks and on one of the knuckles 13 and 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.250
 of successful companies he country speak 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.440
 of a my team mode literally mine 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.970
 my team and my team that fashions 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.080
 corresponded to home instrus me 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.210
 I call the mode my group especially 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.130
 when you know the mode that I like 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.780
 not like me on whom I spent the 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.659
 more time so here it is I 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.330
 fashion flagship game after Touquet 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:07.159
 hungry with the leagues what then 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.750
 I really expect them common who 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.460
 gives us a little more info on the 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.009
 improvements on game modes and 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.580
 all this and that also confirms soft because 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:19.310
 that's it for sure you buy it 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.690
 jordan 70 route it takes 80 but that's so 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.380
 they handed this game mode that would 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.819
 real me a stronger but as big 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.219
 I said we wait to know a little 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:29.659
 more about both games and I'm waiting 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:30.860
 also the demos a day near a video 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.289
 so once we have the 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.669
 means to tell you little by little 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.900
 give a little opinion on both 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.250
 gameplay what 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.660
 and here I think that's all I 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:43.560
 said just about everything I had to 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.139
 to say what am I wii where he 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.020
 added I also wanted to add a 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.880
 last thing we will soon reach 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.470
 I will soon reach the 300 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.449
 subscribers so I really wanted you 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.039
 thank you for following me I'm not 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.229
 really regular at posts 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.270
 dedicated to but hey it's right 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:02.850
 part due to the fact that that's all that is 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.430
 12 disappointed me so here I lost a little 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:09.210
 my winter fashion my motivation sorry but 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.530
 good if store 13 this is it all 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.229
 very useful case is coming up well 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.729
 everything should come back to that's all
