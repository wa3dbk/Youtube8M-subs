jellies<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:51.180> will<00:00:51.360> notice<00:00:51.920> when<00:00:52.920> you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
jellies but you will notice when you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
jellies but you will notice when you
bring<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.399> outside<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.329> expose<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.989> to

bring this outside or you expose it to
UV<00:00:55.140> light<00:00:55.649> it'll<00:00:56.579> change<00:00:57.030> colors<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.500> I'll

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
UV light it'll change colors and I'll

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.619 
UV light it'll change colors and I'll
get<00:00:59.010> into<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> little<00:01:00.000> bit<00:01:00.390> more

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
for now let's take a look at the six row

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.039 
for now let's take a look at the six row
bases<00:01:08.090> one<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> most<00:01:09.510> annoying<00:01:09.840> things

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
bases one of the most annoying things

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
bases one of the most annoying things
about<00:01:10.530> building<00:01:10.799> larger<00:01:11.369> bracelets<00:01:11.909> or

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
about building larger bracelets or

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.750 
about building larger bracelets or
bracelets<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.810> require<00:01:13.320> four<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.310> rows

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
bracelets that require four or more rows

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.749 
bracelets that require four or more rows
is<00:01:15.680> when<00:01:16.680> you're<00:01:16.830> setting<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.400> loom

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
is when you're setting up the loom

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.730 
is when you're setting up the loom
you're<00:01:18.479> gonna<00:01:18.570> find<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.439> gonna

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
you're gonna find that there are gonna

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.210 
you're gonna find that there are gonna
be<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.250> lot<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.000> weak<00:01:21.600> points<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:23.040> are

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
be a lot of weak points that are

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.850 
be a lot of weak points that are
unstable<00:01:24.180> while<00:01:24.720> you're<00:01:25.020> building<00:01:25.290> these

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
unstable while you're building these

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.730 
unstable while you're building these
bracelets<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.200> when<00:01:28.200> you're<00:01:28.350> spending<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
bracelets and when you're spending that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.270 
bracelets and when you're spending that
much<00:01:29.159> time<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> wound<00:01:31.020> fall<00:01:31.380> apart<00:01:31.799> can

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
much time to have a wound fall apart can

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.109 
much time to have a wound fall apart can
be<00:01:32.400> extremely<00:01:33.090> frustrating<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> over<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.939> I

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
be extremely frustrating so over here I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.420 
be extremely frustrating so over here I
have<00:01:36.360> two<00:01:36.840> setups<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.619> labyrinth<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
have two setups of the labyrinth and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.920 
have two setups of the labyrinth and
that<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> 5<00:01:39.570> by<00:01:39.600> 2<00:01:39.900> setup<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.720> take<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
that is a 5 by 2 setup so if you take a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.520 
that is a 5 by 2 setup so if you take a
look<00:01:43.110> at<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> top<00:01:44.420> what<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.600> used<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.259> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
look at the top what I used to do is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.370 
look at the top what I used to do is
create<00:01:46.829> these<00:01:47.159> zigzag<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.149> patterns<00:01:48.750> with

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
create these zigzag like patterns with

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.109 
create these zigzag like patterns with
the<00:01:49.619> bases<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:51.149> even<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.729> will<00:01:53.729> still

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the bases but even so you will still

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.870 
the bases but even so you will still
find<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:55.020> there<00:01:55.320> are<00:01:55.350> parts<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.490> seem

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
find that there are parts that seem

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.620 
find that there are parts that seem
unstable<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.860> pinch<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.850> over

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
unstable you can see can pinch and over

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.200 
unstable you can see can pinch and over
here<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.110> almost<00:02:01.530> looks<00:02:01.829> like<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.549> part<00:02:02.909> will

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
here it almost looks like this part will

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.420 
here it almost looks like this part will
fall<00:02:03.420> off<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.280> they<00:02:05.430> completely

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
fall off and that's what they completely

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.180 
fall off and that's what they completely
sure<00:02:07.080> so<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.119> compare<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.200> old<00:02:11.590> setup

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
sure so when you compare this old setup

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
sure so when you compare this old setup
to<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.090> new<00:02:13.300> setup<00:02:13.720> which<00:02:14.050> has<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:15.340> six<00:02:15.940> row

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
to the new setup which has the six row

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.550 
to the new setup which has the six row
bases<00:02:16.870> placed<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.920> center<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:20.080> will<00:02:20.230> find

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
bases placed in the center you will find

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.580 
bases placed in the center you will find
that<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.490> lot<00:02:22.060> more<00:02:22.450> secure<00:02:22.870> here

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
that it is a lot more secure here

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.440 
that it is a lot more secure here
it<00:02:23.950> doesn't<00:02:24.280> feel<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.490> anything's<00:02:25.150> going<00:02:25.390> to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
it doesn't feel like anything's going to

community and I give it two thumbs up
alright<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.470> moving<00:02:56.860> out<00:02:57.390> now<00:02:58.390> for<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.810> UV

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
alright so moving out now for the UV

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.960 
alright so moving out now for the UV
bands<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.200> UV<00:03:02.380> bands<00:03:02.890> comes<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.580> mixed

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
bands so the UV bands comes in a mixed

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.660 
bands so the UV bands comes in a mixed
pad<00:03:04.270> it's<00:03:04.870> about<00:03:05.080> evenly<00:03:05.590> distributed<00:03:06.459> I

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
pad it's about evenly distributed I

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.490 
pad it's about evenly distributed I
thought<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.240> it<00:03:07.420> had<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.630> little<00:03:07.870> more<00:03:08.170> blue

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
thought that it had a little more blue

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.509 
thought that it had a little more blue
than<00:03:08.530> other<00:03:08.920> colors<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:10.510> as<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.900> can<00:03:11.050> see

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
than other colors but as you can see

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.180 
than other colors but as you can see
it's<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.670> mixed<00:03:13.000> pack<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.830> there's<00:03:14.830> five

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
it's a mixed pack and there's five

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.910 
it's a mixed pack and there's five
different<00:03:15.220> colors<00:03:16.060> there's<00:03:16.840> blue<00:03:17.200> green

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
different colors there's blue green

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.870 
different colors there's blue green
yellow<00:03:18.250> pink<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.420> white<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.320> these<00:03:21.160> all<00:03:21.550> have

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
yellow pink and white and these all have

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.130 
yellow pink and white and these all have
the<00:03:21.910> same<00:03:22.450> consistency<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:24.209> jellybeans<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:26.019> if

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
the same consistency as jellybeans so if

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.500 
the same consistency as jellybeans so if
you<00:03:26.260> have<00:03:26.350> any<00:03:26.500> jelly<00:03:26.860> bags<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.970> can<00:03:28.120> expect

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
you have any jelly bags you can expect

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.190 
you have any jelly bags you can expect
the<00:03:28.660> same<00:03:28.690> characteristics<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:31.019> when<00:03:32.019> you're

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
the same characteristics and when you're

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.560 
the same characteristics and when you're
looking<00:03:32.500> at<00:03:32.620> them<00:03:32.860> they<00:03:33.100> look<00:03:33.130> very<00:03:33.570> similar

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
looking at them they look very similar

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.259 
looking at them they look very similar
to<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.989> glow-in-the-dark

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
to the glow-in-the-dark

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.199 
to the glow-in-the-dark
there's<00:03:37.269> just<00:03:37.450> a<00:03:37.630> slight<00:03:38.050> difference

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
there's just a slight difference

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.870 
there's just a slight difference
honestly<00:03:40.209> if<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.540> set<00:03:40.840> these<00:03:41.080> apart<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.880> you

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
honestly if you set these apart and you

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.000 
honestly if you set these apart and you
ask<00:03:43.060> me<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.330> distinguish<00:03:44.110> which<00:03:44.500> ones<00:03:44.769> were

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
ask me to distinguish which ones were

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.220 
ask me to distinguish which ones were
which<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.580> probably<00:03:46.030> wouldn't<00:03:46.450> be<00:03:46.570> able<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:46.900> do

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
which I probably wouldn't be able to do

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.320 
which I probably wouldn't be able to do
it<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:49.060> as<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.200> can<00:03:50.350> see<00:03:50.549> very<00:03:51.549> similar<00:03:53.040> but

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
it so as you can see very similar but

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.380 
it so as you can see very similar but
the<00:03:55.330> coolest<00:03:55.959> aspect<00:03:56.709> of<00:03:56.920> these<00:03:57.340> bands

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
the coolest aspect of these bands

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.650 
the coolest aspect of these bands
if<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:59.170> they<00:03:59.470> can<00:03:59.950> actually<00:04:00.250> change<00:04:00.790> color

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
if that they can actually change color

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.890 
if that they can actually change color
and<00:04:02.170> sunlight<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.850> I'm<00:04:04.360> just<00:04:04.570> gonna<00:04:04.660> go

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
and sunlight so I'm just gonna go

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.040 
and sunlight so I'm just gonna go
outside<00:04:05.170> for<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:05.980> second<00:04:06.490> and<00:04:06.670> set<00:04:07.000> up<00:04:07.180> so<00:04:08.020> that

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
outside for a second and set up so that

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.340 
outside for a second and set up so that
you<00:04:08.350> can<00:04:08.530> see<00:04:08.830> exactly<00:04:09.160> what<00:04:10.000> happens<00:04:10.570> when

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
you can see exactly what happens when

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.700 
you can see exactly what happens when
you<00:04:11.470> expose<00:04:11.950> these<00:04:12.370> bands<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:13.360> sunlight<00:04:13.810> okay

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
you expose these bands to sunlight okay

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.599 
you expose these bands to sunlight okay
so<00:04:14.770> here<00:04:15.490> we<00:04:15.520> are<00:04:15.700> outside<00:04:16.480> on<00:04:16.780> this<00:04:16.930> fabulous

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609

sunny day and underneath this cardboard
I<00:04:22.450> have<00:04:22.780> all<00:04:23.110> of<00:04:23.170> the<00:04:23.530> bands<00:04:24.070> ready<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.240> change

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600

gonna open up and let you witness the

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:41.430 
gonna open up and let you witness the
transformation<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:34.270> three<00:04:34.780> two<00:04:35.640> one<00:04:36.640> I<00:04:37.110> am<00:04:40.440> you

see<00:04:41.830> they've<00:04:42.460> already<00:04:42.730> changed<00:04:43.450> colors<00:04:43.870> this

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
see they've already changed colors this

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.670 
see they've already changed colors this
was<00:04:44.890> the<00:04:45.040> paint<00:04:45.310> this<00:04:45.970> was<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.240> yellow<00:04:46.750> this<00:04:47.410> was

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
was the paint this was a yellow this was

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.850 
was the paint this was a yellow this was
the<00:04:47.800> green<00:04:48.100> this<00:04:48.880> was<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.360> blue<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:49.990> up<00:04:50.500> here

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
the green this was the blue and up here

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.430 
the green this was the blue and up here
was<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.250> white<00:04:51.600> so<00:04:52.600> as<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.840> can<00:04:52.960> see<00:04:53.020> they

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
was the white so as you can see they

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.310 
was the white so as you can see they
change<00:04:53.730> completely<00:04:54.810> they're<00:04:55.810> not<00:04:56.020> even

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
change completely they're not even

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.010 
change completely they're not even
remotely<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:57.070> same<00:04:57.340> color<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.060> it<00:04:58.570> happens

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
remotely the same color and it happens

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.650 
remotely the same color and it happens
instantaneously<00:05:01.680> so<00:05:03.030> I'm<00:05:04.030> just<00:05:04.240> gonna<00:05:04.330> let<00:05:04.600> it

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
instantaneously so I'm just gonna let it

fast<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.570> mean<00:05:22.690> it<00:05:22.870> doesn't<00:05:23.169> take<00:05:23.500> more<00:05:23.740> than

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
fast I mean it doesn't take more than

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.630 
fast I mean it doesn't take more than
about<00:05:23.979> I'd<00:05:24.729> say<00:05:25.660> 30<00:05:26.350> seconds<00:05:26.979> for<00:05:27.190> it<00:05:27.220> to<00:05:27.430> turn

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
about I'd say 30 seconds for it to turn

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.700 
about I'd say 30 seconds for it to turn
back<00:05:27.940> to<00:05:28.150> its<00:05:28.330> original<00:05:28.450> color<00:05:28.990> when<00:05:29.380> it's<00:05:29.530> in

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
back to its original color when it's in

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:37.260
