00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.410
 let 's go for the tvb ii with a whole 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.560
 call home in the first 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.150
 handball federal the ems hall with 2300 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.940
 spectators look out of stock and mood 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.560
 she was gorgeous from the beginning, yes 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.630
 only problem maybe the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.550
 opponent thw keiel the dominant one 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.160
 team in german handball der 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.100
 last years guest at the construction 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.100
 and the record champion also put directly 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.239
 Let's start with many mugs early 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.840
 17 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.230
 Note the tva in the usual green and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.280
 something unusual green behind the ears 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.590
 presented the host in the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.430
 The first minute, three of us started here 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.739
 Goals in consequence of this scene it went 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.090
 usually very easy niclas ekberg 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.629
 with the early 13 0 for keel and thought 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.170
 some probably already but now came along 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.110
 janko bozovic 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.110
 with the first home Bundesliga goal 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.579
 and here is busse witcher again 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.020
 defensive intercepts the ball and attracts 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:21.909
 you feldkamp 2 3 connection great 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.740
 story feldkamp from the second 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.810
 crew and season ticket holders 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.979
 The game actually wanted to be from 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.170
 look at the tribune 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.729
 so it can come now succeed him 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.240
 hit against the German 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.240
 rekordmeister 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.030
 the first 20 25 minutes you probably the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.860
 most exciting of this part that in the tv ii 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.140
 get the residue with two to four 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.810
 usually very small 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.810
 ThÃ¼nemann defeats park here 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.610
 also a few vitali feshchanka what to 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.729
 owe that to thw not everyone 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.950
 attack to a strike but really 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.560
 it's getting tight for the favorite out of the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.939
 north not the reason too many on 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.340
 construction errors like here 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.149
 the czech many books are faster 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.970
 as the green and ragged enough heating 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.560
 stood 12 to 18 from the view of the homeowners 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.019
 during the break there were a few more 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.519
 encouraging words of the trainer but the 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.810
 first few minutes of the second half 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.800
 already brought the final 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.170
 decision 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.519
 mainly responsible for the number 12 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.709
 andreas palicka held in the gate of thw 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.590
 every ball that came on his box 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.830
 and at the front, kiel continued to meet at will 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.810
 be it from the circle or from the second 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.120
 row as here brand julien with nine 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.660
 best hits on the part of the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.489
 thw the tvg of course due to the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.760
 residue completely demoralized on 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.160
 the end was a clear 25 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.010
 40-defeat to offer but also if 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.079
 one against the series champion 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.269
 The fans had to pay 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.280
 closed throughout the entire game 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.299
 behind the team 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.430
 in the face of this fantastic 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.130
 Support should be against lighter ones 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.930
 opponents in his own hall a lot 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.180
 to be fetched for emsdetten 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.790
 in any case there were from the thw 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.299
 ever encouraging words that vote 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.500
 to the lot 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.910
 and of course to the fans 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.470
 So no game is just in the game 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.070
 you always have to go with the first Bundesliga 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.390
 respect no matter if you are a newcomer or 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.040
 top team we are here 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.690
 driven to play concentrated because 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.240
 you know that you should sunbathe 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.850
 Hall can sometimes get into trouble 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.380
 see last year hsv cup play that 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.680
 is true and so a bit the same 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.840
 head 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.090
 We knew that we were here 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.800
 expected and compliment to this hall 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.640
 to this team the first league 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.660
 fit and I press his thumb 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.430
 Erstligareif is in any case already 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.709
 times the audience here and the hall and 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.780
 that was offered to us here today 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.060
 I think also from the ranks is with 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.620
 distance you always have to be very clear 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.400
 say it was fantastic my first 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.080
 home game 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.520
 that was a great experience except 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.950
 Of course we are 15 goals 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.630
 have lost difference but great 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.880
 was that easy even after playing like that 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.880
 many window ideas are just great 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.010
 this is just played and against the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.620
 government and that's great that 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.510
 amstetten is there and I am glad 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.380
 of course that today we are the points 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.030
 have taken 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.160
 i think i still have one or two 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.650
 others where is what's called here 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.289
 so happens for emsdetten feedback and 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.440
 for my team of course, too and 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.440
 Have a nice Weekend
