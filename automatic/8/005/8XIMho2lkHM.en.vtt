00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.939
 Hello friends this time youtube 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.610
 I bring you a video how to edit 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.710
 geometric is to your taste for example 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.570
 how to change the music of the levels or 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.330
 how to change the characters like you 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.640
 want 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.100
 good for this you have to download 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.960
 the PC version without emulator in the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.410
 description I leave a link if not 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.600
 they have it good in my case I'm going to 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:48.920
 downloads that's where I have the 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:52.460
 file have to extract the file 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.070
 winrar will leave you this folder with these 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.660
 files have to open the folder that 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.610
 it's called re source is that there it is in 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.610
 where are the game files 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.220
 well here are the songs of the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.759
 levels for example I'm going to change the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.759
 from this level 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.030
 good to do that you have to first 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.420
 search for the song which you want 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.420
 change 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.450
 in my case I will put this song 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.580
 they have to copy it in the re folder 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.690
 source and put the name of the song 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.690
 what do you want to replace 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.400
 good the song is pasted in the folder 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.440
 re source source 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.660
 and you have to copy the name of the 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.610
 song of the level they want to change in 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.610
 my case is the level of back on track 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.420
 they hit the name of the song 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.380
 and they give in to replace if this happens to them 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.160
 just erase the original and winged 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.160
 take that away 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.530
 there is x I'll do a test 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.530
 quick level to see 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.659
 xd good at the mere hour change it better 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.180
 at this level 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.040
 xd if you grab him like that it's because I'm not 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.560
 recording with a program to record 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.069
 xd games is also just so that 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.069
 listen 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.560
 and the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.560
 good already exists now I'm going to teach you 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.560
 to change the characters 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.109
 good for this they need photoshop xd or 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.959
 a program that can accept format 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.439
 png with paint do not do it because it's going to 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.439
 look ugly 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.079
 I 'm looking for the image where 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.079
 all the characters come 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.310
 good is this if they see that there are three is 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.890
 because one is for the graphics of the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.700
 game low another for stockings and another for 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.700
 the highest quality 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.790
 good in my case I will edit the average 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.040
 quality 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.569
 I will put it on the desk so that 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.569
 it is easier to find it 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.110
 now I just see it in the photoshop 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.740
 well here they bring you to the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.810
 characters xb and here you can put what 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.940
 that they obviously like 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.170
 they can edit the ships and the buttons and 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.170
 everything you want 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.030
 well here I'm going to put some lenses 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.030

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.560
 oh no mames x that I did tighten 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.560
 control unintentionally 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.569
 yes 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.740
 no mames looks good ugly x for better 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.190
 wait, I 'm going to download other 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.190
 lenses 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.390

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.270
 and 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.479
 Well there is now nothing more I keep 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.940
 they save it in the res folder or bus 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.940
 game 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.639
 but the most important thing is that 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.159
 save in good png format now yes ya 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.560

00:05:56.159 --> 00:06:01.710

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.310
 proof of how that does not exist is also 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.960
 you can change the background of the 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.240
 levels and everything that you crave 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.250
 also the sounds of when you move 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.720
 but to do that the sound that you 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.620
 you want to convert it into 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.620
 format j 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:26.310
