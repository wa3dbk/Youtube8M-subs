 the assassins' creed of the brotherhood always taught 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.250
 us that everything is permitted I thought we 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.900
 we can do whatever we want to defend 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.900
 ideals at any cost 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:23.250
 Now I have a plan 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.250
 this is not permission this warning 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:32.580
 ideals too easily become dogma 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.580
 and dogma will become fanaticism 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.489
 above us there is no higher court does not 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:46.930
 a stern deity that will punish us 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:51.820
 for our sins in the end, only we ourselves 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:56.430
 guard our passions only we decide not 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.430
 too precious of our way we 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.610
 we consider ourselves a savior saviors 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.869
 Avengers lead a bloody war against 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.670
 they are all those who dream against us 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.670
 leave your mark on the world 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.420
 even giving life in battles about which 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.420
 never write in history books 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:30.479
 our essence and our actions start and end 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.479
 in ourselves
