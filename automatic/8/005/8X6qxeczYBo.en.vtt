let's<00:00:36.780> figure<00:00:37.140> out<00:00:37.380> how<00:00:37.890> we<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.940> these

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
let's figure out how we get one of these

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.430 
let's figure out how we get one of these
dragons<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.660> world<00:00:39.899> well<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.290> into

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
creative you will notice the under the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.670 
creative you will notice the under the
lava<00:00:42.270> bucket<00:00:42.540> tab<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> new<00:00:43.320> spawner

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
lava bucket tab you have a new spawner

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.650 
lava bucket tab you have a new spawner
it<00:00:43.860> says<00:00:44.040> spawn<00:00:44.430> dragon<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.239> do<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.539> by

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it says spawn dragon you can do that by

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.200 
it says spawn dragon you can do that by
creative<00:00:46.110> or<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.100> go<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:48.059> of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
creative or you can go and get one of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.110 
creative or you can go and get one of
these<00:00:48.450> eggs<00:00:48.719> which<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:50.160> will<00:00:50.309> spawn<00:00:50.730> in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
these eggs which actually will spawn in

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
these eggs which actually will spawn in
your<00:00:51.539> dragon<00:00:52.140> now<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.500> right<00:00:52.559> now<00:00:52.800> he's<00:00:52.980> not

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
your dragon now as of right now he's not

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.040 
your dragon now as of right now he's not
spawning<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.969> does<00:00:54.270> take<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.750> little

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
spawning because it does take a little

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
spawning because it does take a little
while<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.350> spawn<00:00:55.770> probably<00:00:56.399> maybe<00:00:56.579> by<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
while to spawn probably maybe by the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.790 
while to spawn probably maybe by the
time<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.840> end<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.109> video

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
time of the end of this video

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.010 
time of the end of this video
he<00:00:59.129> might<00:00:59.489> spawn<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.030> not<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.780> says

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
he might spawn I do not know but it says

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.500 
he might spawn I do not know but it says
you<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.680> need<00:01:01.890> them<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> warm<00:01:02.520> place<00:01:02.609> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you do need them in a warm place so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
you do need them in a warm place so
let's<00:01:03.690> try<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.870> get<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.199> lava<00:01:04.650> bucket<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.309> let's

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
let's try to get a lava bucket and let's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.940 
let's try to get a lava bucket and let's
set<00:01:05.909> some<00:01:06.119> lava<00:01:06.420> around<00:01:06.900> him<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.320> maybe<00:01:07.770> we

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
set some lava around him and maybe we

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.490 
set some lava around him and maybe we
can<00:01:08.040> spawn<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.390> know<00:01:09.689> let's<00:01:10.409> just

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
can spawn like a I don't know let's just

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.350 
can spawn like a I don't know let's just
let's<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.189> see<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:11.909> he<00:01:11.970> does<00:01:12.150> so

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
let's just see kind of what he does so

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.399 
let's just see kind of what he does so
hopefully<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> don't<00:01:12.869> think<00:01:13.020> he'll<00:01:13.110> catch<00:01:13.229> on

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
hopefully I don't think he'll catch on

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
hopefully I don't think he'll catch on
fire<00:01:13.590> anything<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.159> he<00:01:14.250> moves<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:14.820> they

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
fire anything if he moves because they

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.910 
fire anything if he moves because they
do<00:01:15.000> tend<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.420> move<00:01:15.600> around<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> stuff<00:01:16.170> but

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
do tend to move around and stuff but

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
do tend to move around and stuff but
yeah<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.460> by<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> end<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.090> video<00:01:18.390> he

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
yeah so by the end of this video he

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.840 
yeah so by the end of this video he
should<00:01:18.930> spawn<00:01:19.229> into<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.770> baby<00:01:20.159> dragon<00:01:20.460> so

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
should spawn into a baby dragon so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.850 
should spawn into a baby dragon so
you're<00:01:21.600> probably<00:01:21.810> wondering<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.650> keep

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
you're probably wondering you keep

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.530 
you're probably wondering you keep
spawning<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.490> these<00:01:23.909> dragons<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> will

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
spawning in these dragons you will

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.179 
spawning in these dragons you will
notice<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.049> only<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> red<00:01:25.799> dragon

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
notice that you only get the red dragon

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.179 
notice that you only get the red dragon
which<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.729> fire<00:01:27.180> dragon<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.009> probably

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
which is the fire dragon so you probably

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.830 
which is the fire dragon so you probably
wonder<00:01:29.520> how<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.850> heck<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.360> change<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
wonder how the heck do I change that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.390 
wonder how the heck do I change that
let's<00:01:31.020> go<00:01:31.140> ahead<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.439> go<00:01:31.560> into<00:01:31.770> our<00:01:31.950> chat<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
some stuff pops up which is pretty weird

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.690 
so you have slash dragon stage so you
have<00:01:39.600> item<00:01:39.990> egg<00:01:40.200> hatching<00:01:40.770> jus<00:01:41.130> Volyn<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
have item egg hatching jus Volyn and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.330 
have item egg hatching jus Volyn and
adult<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.259> also<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.829> breed<00:01:44.130> which

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
adult and they also have the breed which

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.179 
adult and they also have the breed which
is<00:01:44.490> fire<00:01:44.700> ice<00:01:44.970> water<00:01:45.329> gold<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.049> emerald<00:01:46.829> so

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
is fire ice water gold and emerald so

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.429 
is fire ice water gold and emerald so
basically<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.149> go<00:01:48.270> ahead<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.540> spawn<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
basically if we go ahead and spawn in a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.840 
basically if we go ahead and spawn in a
dragon<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.040> let's<00:01:50.220> go<00:01:50.340> ahead<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.640> spawn

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
dragon so let's go ahead and just spawn

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.730 
dragon so let's go ahead and just spawn
and<00:01:51.090> dragon<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.500> can<00:01:52.619> do

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and dragon just like that then we can do

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.969 
and dragon just like that then we can do
slash<00:01:53.070> dragon<00:01:53.939> stage<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.079> if<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.560> slash

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
slash dragon stage so if we do slash

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.030 
slash dragon stage so if we do slash
dragons<00:01:56.549> stage<00:01:57.119> egg<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.590> will<00:01:58.710> turn<00:01:58.860> that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
dragons stage egg then it will turn that

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.130 
dragons stage egg then it will turn that
dragon<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> an<00:01:59.670> egg<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.149> then<00:02:00.270> he<00:02:00.509> will<00:02:00.780> hatch

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
dragon to an egg and then he will hatch

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.050 
dragon to an egg and then he will hatch
but<00:02:01.860> he<00:02:02.130> already<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.640> hatched<00:02:02.820> because
