00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.090
 we are watching the preparations what 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:09.010
 is the amulet truck let's say the one 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.080
 accompanying we are with the hair goal 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.970
 happy and happy to be in the 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.550
 final straight the truck a shirt 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.570
 4x4 haier 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.940
 it's a 2.8 engine I had in calculate in this 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.529
 case you have put a boxes this is not 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:29.230
 sequential the subject the suspension has 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.150
 828 equal port or links in the part of 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.940
 back do not be car already has two the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.550
 back side 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.530
 the much longer travel 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.780
 in the back of the body is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.199
 has taken out and has been totally 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.380
 tubular that's why we enter the category of 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.330
 1.2 which is the diesel modified series 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.430
 and the truck has inside elected ass 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.070
 a fuel tank in 350 liters 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.900
 because it does not require organization 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.070
 because suddenly there are sectors where 600 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.970
 kilometers we will not have 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.090
 fueling 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.430
 the truck let's say it's ready 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.590
 an open electronics that depending 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.090
 where are we going to be we are going to open 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.310
 we are going to close it so that the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.660
 truck is more reliable what 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.729
 we have to make the goal arrive without 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.830
 problems we are going to have a lot for the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.200
 temperature in the desert then you 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.229
 we put 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.210
 less flow - electronics are so that 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.280
 be more standard the quick part you 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.350
 we put more electronic to the truck 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.470
 in itself is ready and was tested in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.130
 the dakar team series or hatton 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.400

 what is the global forest rhein in 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.459
 malaysia we also get ourselves 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.940
 the inscription and the round trip ticket 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.830
 going to Argentina to compete that was a 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.500
 qualifying in argentina that they followed 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.120
 two representatives from South America one 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.290
 he made in chile another one in argentina we won 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.510
 Argentina 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.140
 we were representing one representative 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.530
 of South America was Paraguayan in this 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.800
 opportunity arrives an Argentine co-pilot 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.450
 well again now with Carlos we went 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.220
 al dakar series 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.080
 the coastal challenge that I had to 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.200
 run in Paraguayan territory and 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.520
 Argentine for political issues at the end 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.250
 only the Argentine territory is 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.770
 ran in a lot of experiences here in 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.709
 copilotage theme but for both was 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.600
 new what is a standard face 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.380
 carchi with the jail in argentina with the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.330
 kid face where the same rules are 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.180
 the same feature the same sheet 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.060
 route 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.310
 the same mileage and prime 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.500
 link but not as hard as for example 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.989
 the kite then that served a lot 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.019
 for the experience of reading the 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.359
 roadmap in French and part of 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.519
 all the nomenclatures in French come out 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:26.389
 had to see everything that is the gps the 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.420
 iritrack the sentinel are several several 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.819
 elements that one that one has inside 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.079
 of the truck thing that the rally does not 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.019
 auto uses it 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.609
 change here will fully coordinate 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.090
 indicates on a gps by watching on the 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:44.599
 nomenclature tells you so many kilometers 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.200
 I grabbed 330 degrees then you know one 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.129
 that has to go northwest going 330 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.790
 degrees 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:55.670
 this tells you at kilometer 50 there 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:02.540
 that go to grab there is one 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:05.510
 one of the final part of the moon's 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.860
 you have to go out to a dry river to descend to 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.050
 a valley 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.070
 you have to grab two hundred thirty 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.830
 Five Grades 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:18.889
 after 4.3 kilometers there are 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:22.389
 that make a right that at 330 degrees 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:26.189
 like out of the soft way 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.189
 there is also a small valley 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.450
 good what we were told in the 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.400
 seminar - air is that the five 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:41.340
 first ten days are very hard 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.350
 then it gets a little more light to 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.490
 enter Argentina and it turns to 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.710
 harden entering back to chile that 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.300
 It is what we learned to say in it 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.790
 everything they told us in the seminar 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.460
 we meet again and roma 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.020
 beginning pilots 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.340
 well he really told us without hairs 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.950
 in the language what will be the race 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.260
 the race that we are going to have we do not 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.210
 what the tip teams do 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.220
 it's totally different is other things 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.890
 the schedules that we are going to handle are 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:15.510
 different times the scams are 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.390
 different and really we 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.200
 he painted us as a very hard race 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.390
 a wonderful experience and really 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.309
 a lot of amazing friends because 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.080
 It is an environment much less 

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:33.589
 aggressive that the environment of the rally is 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.309
 much more friendly there are a lot more people 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:39.529
 willing to help you and really a 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:41.599
 fantastic atmosphere and the yesterday in a 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.490
 truck that in the rally the littoral does not 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.819
 it gave us no problem of a 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:50.389
 Extreme reliability is hard is 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:52.849
 reliable is fast really me 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:56.080
 surprised and we really finished the 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.080
 career without any problem
