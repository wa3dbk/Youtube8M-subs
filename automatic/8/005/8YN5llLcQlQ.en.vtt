00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.420 
the camera view and zooming in and out
and<00:00:31.120> so<00:00:31.210> on<00:00:31.450> and<00:00:31.570> so<00:00:31.780> forth<00:00:32.140> okay<00:00:32.830> now<00:00:33.309> the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
and so on and so forth okay now the

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.369 
and so on and so forth okay now the
viewcube<00:00:33.879> can<00:00:34.150> be<00:00:34.239> found<00:00:34.510> in<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.780> upper<00:00:34.989> right

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
viewcube can be found in the upper right

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.970 
viewcube can be found in the upper right
corner<00:00:35.680> here<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.250> your<00:00:37.030> viewport<00:00:37.600> okay<00:00:38.440> when

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
corner here of your viewport okay when

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.340 
corner here of your viewport okay when
your<00:00:39.129> mouse<00:00:39.309> is<00:00:39.550> away<00:00:40.030> from<00:00:40.330> the<00:00:40.420> viewcube<00:00:40.840> it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
your mouse is away from the viewcube it

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.979 
your mouse is away from the viewcube it
darkens<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.160> goes<00:00:42.460> into<00:00:42.730> an<00:00:42.970> inactive<00:00:43.660> State

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
darkens and goes into an inactive State

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.350 
darkens and goes into an inactive State
so<00:00:44.559> what<00:00:44.680> happens<00:00:45.129> is<00:00:45.250> that<00:00:45.280> you<00:00:45.670> cube<00:00:45.970> goes<00:00:46.180> in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
so what happens is that you cube goes in

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.740 
so what happens is that you cube goes in
an<00:00:46.480> inactive<00:00:46.870> state<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.560> becomes<00:00:48.310> about<00:00:48.750> 50%

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
an inactive state and becomes about 50%

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.840 
an inactive state and becomes about 50%
transparent<00:00:50.160> allowing<00:00:51.160> you<00:00:51.220> to<00:00:51.340> focus<00:00:51.520> and

your<00:00:55.210> mouse<00:00:55.360> comes<00:00:55.690> back<00:00:55.989> over<00:00:56.260> viewcube<00:00:57.010> it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
your mouse comes back over viewcube it

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.370 
your mouse comes back over viewcube it
becomes<00:00:57.550> active<00:00:58.090> now<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.600> becomes<00:00:58.899> brighter

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.210 
you want go ahead and rotate this around
because<00:01:55.479> right<00:01:55.689> now<00:01:55.900> North<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.799> actually

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
because right now North is actually

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.160 
because right now North is actually
pointing<00:01:57.490> down<00:01:57.820> let's<00:01:58.479> say<00:01:58.659> you<00:01:58.720> wanted<00:01:59.049> this

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
pointing down let's say you wanted this

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.200 
pointing down let's say you wanted this
to<00:01:59.320> be<00:01:59.439> at<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.650> few<00:01:59.890> point<00:02:00.159> where<00:02:00.579> North<00:02:00.970> is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
to be at a few point where North is

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.260 
to be at a few point where North is
actually<00:02:01.810> facing<00:02:02.229> up<00:02:02.409> on<00:02:02.710> your<00:02:03.189> viewport<00:02:03.640> well

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
actually facing up on your viewport well

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.020 
actually facing up on your viewport well
we<00:02:04.540> can<00:02:04.720> use<00:02:04.900> these<00:02:05.110> arrow<00:02:05.470> icons<00:02:06.040> here<00:02:06.460> on<00:02:06.610> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
we can use these arrow icons here on the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.300 
we can use these arrow icons here on the
top<00:02:07.270> right<00:02:07.509> of<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.900> cube<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.380> do<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:08.709> we

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
top right of the you cube to do that we

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.000 
top right of the you cube to do that we
can<00:02:09.489> use<00:02:09.640> them<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.060> turn<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:10.690> thing

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
can use them to turn this thing

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.560 
can use them to turn this thing
counterclockwise<00:02:12.010> or<00:02:12.549> clockwise<00:02:12.579> depending

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
counterclockwise or clockwise depending

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
compass below the view cube you can

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.069 
compass below the view cube you can
actually<00:04:20.280> turn<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.789> off<00:04:20.910> from<00:04:21.030> here<00:04:21.389> hit<00:04:21.750> OK

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
actually turn it off from here hit OK

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.960 
actually turn it off from here hit OK
and<00:04:22.410> now<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:22.979> get<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.250> view<00:04:23.430> cube<00:04:23.610> you

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
and now you just get the view cube you

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.940 
and now you just get the view cube you
don't<00:04:24.120> get<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.270> compass<00:04:24.660> at<00:04:24.750> all<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.800> maybe

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
don't get a compass at all so maybe

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.860 
don't get a compass at all so maybe
you'd<00:04:26.160> like<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.370> do<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.610> instead<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.630> having
