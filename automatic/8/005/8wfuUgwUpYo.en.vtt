00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 PSV under 19 against Heerenveen on the 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.020
 cookies later because this water sprayer 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.639
 just wanted to stop spraying here 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.550
 of water while the players long ago 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.780
 stood ready and they embrace in India 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.420
 had jill sibon 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.800
 and mark van bommel they tease each other 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.270
 held game by our will 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.640
 of course both win with their team 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.140
 but all good field there is name 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.850
 monique of wonder than the closest 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.130
 in the first half 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.560
 also the only moment that we have anything 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.560
 happened in those first 45 minutes 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.300
 not much boring at first, but 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.530
 a second half this is just after the kick-off 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.629
 begins 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.550
 incomparable martine beds at speed 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.010
 dot over the keeper or on the line 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.010
 cold by captain stefan forces man 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.270
 or speed he power his weapon and 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.800
 images and he is lucky jan 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.899
 bekkema that is even a bit boring 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.670
 second half starts really energetic 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.559
 because this was again a minute later 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.659
 he again entered the name of the dani van der 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.060
 moot white goal and search for everything 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.939
 danger in the second half 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.770
 from martijn third the right winger 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.290
 good cross in a real striker comes after 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.070
 the first pole and dani van der does that 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.890
 moot 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.890
 a 0 for psv under 19 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.759
 and then Heerenveen is completely lost 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.430
 no longer know where to look 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.420
 both sail for loss of the ball here 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.820
 motion 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.439
 by the legs was so long than cutting 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.750
 shoot and this is one 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.490
 very good rescue 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.650
 ball remains a pendant of the engine 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.040
 his second 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.610
 and again it is stefan garten man who 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.920
 comes to the rescue of his keeper 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.900
 [Music] 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.300
 but good game encoder rommens 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.640
 working back Groeneveld picks up attainable 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.200
 is ever had i want you with sam then 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.180
 lambs 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.340
 and then it's worked inside 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.030
 by summer or anyway 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.030
 thoughtful man 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.280
 hard to see but the goal counts 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.870
 and psv of course gives in the name of sam 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.790
 lammers and you have the first even you 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:24.620
 goal kept clean and it is just after 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:27.140
 rest 5 must have already played 2 0 and so 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.780
 probably not very good due to CT 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.050
 been for the freezing hem lambers then 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.820
 behind and dani van der moot 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.830
 and a timeframe of six minutes 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.300
 is it 3 0 for psv and more is it dani 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.080
 van der moot in those cases after a 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.130
 less than half an hour already comes true 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.670
 may pierre 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.670
 eastland 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.860
 so escorts are second of these 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.250
 match and if you watch a state of 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.570
 bomb anyway already for gerald 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.180
 sibon 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.260
 a narrow neck here is a good chance 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.260
 to make a 410 out of it 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.950
 here also in just after resting pruning waste and 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.600
 maybe get another one here 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.980
 possibility to buy the tracks 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.980
 corner and 640 therein 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.160
 achieved a bit of those opportunities 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.260
 minute ago then on the pole but now 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.050
 after excellent object by the way of bob 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.050
 groenendijk the 4 0 or tipped over in 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.090
 yes and then you make a face like that 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.090
 goalkeeper are the van sc heerenveen 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.420
 weimans there again the right side here 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.459
 Martijn Berden to cross the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.440
 engine completely free and his third and he 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.120
 know where to go and walk 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.769
 instantly a power and images it 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.890
 thumb is for him 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.340
 The cover is in perfect condition of the model 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:02.080
 completely free 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.819
 but the goal that counts 5 0 for PSV 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.420
 and who would have thought that 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.040
 after such a boring first half 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.989
 may it is not yet past reinier 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.690
 what is available on it 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.720
 device racist I now go the pole no 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.500
 goal for him but simon and mark van 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.000
 bomb 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.780
 friends also remain a volley sibon 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.650
 but he wins with his ps v50 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.650
 against heerenveen 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.110
 positions ajax koplo position from 24 out of 10 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.479
 four points ahead of az psv 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.540
 back in place 4 7 those points out of 10 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.540
 matches
