00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
I think it's state of the art equipment

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.780 
I think it's state of the art equipment
and<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.659> teaching<00:01:49.200> staff<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.830> a<00:01:50.100> diverse

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
range of specialisms and their leaders

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340
