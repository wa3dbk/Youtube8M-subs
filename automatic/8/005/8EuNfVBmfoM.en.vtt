00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
how you can get to gar Nia as well as

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.829 
how you can get to gar Nia as well as
the<00:00:05.040> order<00:00:05.279> on<00:00:05.310> sanctuary<00:00:05.730> so<00:00:06.330> as<00:00:06.450> you<00:00:06.569> can<00:00:06.660> see

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
the order on sanctuary so as you can see

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.299 
the order on sanctuary so as you can see
here<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.259> just<00:00:07.470> attacked<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.950> high<00:00:08.099> wind

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
here I just attacked a high wind

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.730 
here I just attacked a high wind
albatross<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.059> by<00:00:09.179> doing<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.929> will<00:00:10.590> pick

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
albatross and by doing so it will pick

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.650 
albatross and by doing so it will pick
you<00:00:10.889> up<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.790> will<00:00:11.910> fly<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.120> around<00:00:12.509> the

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
you up and it will fly you around the

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.169 
you up and it will fly you around the
island<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.799> does<00:00:13.980> take<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> long<00:00:14.429> time<00:00:14.700> so

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
island this does take a long time so

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.540 
island this does take a long time so
just<00:00:15.990> keep<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.410> mind<00:00:16.650> when<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
just keep that in mind when you to the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.189 
just keep that in mind when you to the
spot<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.000> want<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.510> drop<00:00:18.750> down<00:00:18.960> into

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
spot that you want to drop down into

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.720 
spot that you want to drop down into
just<00:00:19.650> go<00:00:19.740> ahead<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:19.949> start<00:00:20.160> attacking<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
just go ahead and start attacking the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.160 
just go ahead and start attacking the
albatross<00:00:21.180> otherwise<00:00:21.660> you're<00:00:21.869> not<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
albatross otherwise you're not going to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.050 
albatross otherwise you're not going to
want<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.380> attack<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.769> at<00:00:22.830> all<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060

albatros will stop and then once you

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.650

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
please so if here I'm it to Ruby like

please so if here I'm it to Ruby like
about<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.669> kill<00:00:32.820> gar<00:00:33.000> Nia<00:00:33.149> however<00:00:33.600> there<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.930> a

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
about to kill gar Nia however there is a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.190 
about to kill gar Nia however there is a
faster<00:00:34.500> way<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.149> Ruby<00:00:36.390> Lake<00:00:36.570> as

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
faster way to get to the Ruby Lake as

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.979 
faster way to get to the Ruby Lake as
well<00:00:37.440> as<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.770> Ord<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.070> sanctuary<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.780> is

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
well as the Ord on sanctuary and that is

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.549 
well as the Ord on sanctuary and that is
by<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.770> into<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.460> time<00:00:41.820> lost<00:00:42.000> waters<00:00:42.559> this

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
by going into the time lost waters this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.650 
by going into the time lost waters this
is<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.129> fatigue<00:00:44.520> zone<00:00:44.910> around<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
is a the fatigue zone around the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
is a the fatigue zone around the
timeless<00:00:46.110> Isle<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.100> basically<00:00:47.280> just

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
timeless Isle and you can basically just

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.439 
timeless Isle and you can basically just
fly<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.090> into<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> sky<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.640> I'm<00:00:50.640> as<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.300> is

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
fly up into the sky and I'm as this is

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.020 
fly up into the sky and I'm as this is
more<00:00:51.660> deadly<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:53.010> again<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
more deadly to do this but again it is a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.389 
more deadly to do this but again it is a
lot<00:00:54.270> faster<00:00:54.780> but<00:00:55.410> basically<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.129> want

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
lot faster but basically you just want

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.790 
lot faster but basically you just want
to<00:00:56.430> fly<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.789> high<00:00:56.969> enough<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.629> when<00:00:58.590> you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
to fly up high enough so that when you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.029 
to fly up high enough so that when you
fly<00:00:59.280> towards<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> island<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.870> will<00:01:01.079> fall

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
fly towards the island you will fall

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
fly towards the island you will fall
into<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> lake<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.180> won't<00:01:03.390> die<00:01:03.629> from

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
into the lake and you won't die from

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.950 
into the lake and you won't die from
fall<00:01:04.470> damage<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.000> proceed<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
fall damage and then you can proceed to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
fall damage and then you can proceed to
kill<00:01:07.650> garnier<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.280> I'm<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.460> exactly<00:01:08.729> sure

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
kill garnier so I'm not exactly sure

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.399 
kill garnier so I'm not exactly sure
what<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.450> proper<00:01:09.900> height<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.229> would

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
what the proper height is would

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.420 
what the proper height is would
hopefully<00:01:10.560> you'll<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.799> able<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.040> tell<00:01:11.220> from

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
hopefully you'll be able to tell from

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.359 
hopefully you'll be able to tell from
this<00:01:11.640> video<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> started

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
this video but as you can see I started

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.359 
this video but as you can see I started
flying<00:01:14.580> towards<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.540> lake<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:17.280> i

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
flying towards the lake and then i

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.940 
flying towards the lake and then i
dismounted<00:01:17.880> myself<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.630> sometimes<00:01:19.619> it

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
dismounted myself because sometimes it

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.859 
dismounted myself because sometimes it
the<00:01:20.400> dismount<00:01:20.729> doesn't<00:01:20.970> happen<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.780> you

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the dismount doesn't happen when you

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.830 
the dismount doesn't happen when you
need<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.479> make<00:01:24.479> sure<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.659> don't<00:01:24.780> have

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
need it to and make sure you don't have

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
need it to and make sure you don't have
any<00:01:24.990> water<00:01:25.140> walking<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.619> otherwise<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.280> will

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
any water walking on otherwise you will

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670 
any water walking on otherwise you will
die<00:01:26.880> which<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.240> why<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> clicked<00:01:27.720> off<00:01:27.869> my<00:01:28.140> path

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
die which is why I clicked off my path

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.280 
die which is why I clicked off my path
across<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.880> once<00:01:30.030> you're<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.299> then<00:01:30.750> if

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
across but once you're up here then if

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.780 
across but once you're up here then if
garni<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.950> then<00:01:32.159> obviously<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.640> come

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
garni is up then obviously you can come

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.490 
garni is up then obviously you can come
garnier<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.750> you're<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> overrun

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
garnier if you're going to overrun
