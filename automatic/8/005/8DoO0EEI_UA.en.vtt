00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.890
 [Music] 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.280
 let's make a tomato sauce is 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.430
 basic and for that we're going to use 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.090
 onion 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.190
 white garlic tomato puree a few leaves 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.290
 laurel salt and pepper this to make 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.410
 something basic if you want to add 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.400
 other vegetables like I have here we go 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.710
 to add 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.520
 Let's give fresh tomato onion 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:35.600
 green a bit of grated carrots 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.000
 peppers also a little bit chopped 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.530
 but let's do the basic 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.870
 for that then we are going to cut the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.130
 onion let's peel it first 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.180
 let's take out one extreme 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.020
 to make some small cuts 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.250
 and around her 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.250
 and we are going to operate it 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.330
 that force the part of the knot 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.150
 what is this part of here below we are going to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.710
 cut it in the middle 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.710
 and you have to make small pieces 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.930
 with this amount of being enough 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.620
 let's light the fire good then 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.290
 let's start cooking the average 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.870
 onion with these quantities and then 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.230
 let's make a sauce like for 34 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.640
 people 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.280
 we heat the pan 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.850
 if we put some oil and throw 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.850
 the onion 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.510
 to start cooking 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.650
 councilor and that slowly 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.690
 after grabbing in the mouth while 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.490
 let's do is add a little 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.759
 Garlic 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.229
 a tooth are well rather than chop 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.099
 what we are going to do is crush it with 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.099
 the blade of the knife we tighten a bit 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.269
 oh and it will break a bit total after 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.920
 we are going to withdraw it so that it gives 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.770
 a little taste 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.069
 to the preparation we are going to add a 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.069
 bay leaf 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.910
 in the end what he does at this moment is 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.740
 that the onion can release a bit of 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.160
 water then 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.950
 to see and cook the little step as he suffers 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.950
 fugitive we are going to raise the fire a little 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.820
 at this moment it's when he silences that 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.760
 You can add other vegetables to them 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.069
 can put 500 chopped 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.920
 a little carrot pink onion 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.750
 green 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.910
 if you like spicy can you put a 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.120
 chile at this moment the leaves of 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.120
 basil 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.220
 or else put some sound on some 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.939
 fresh or dried herbs that have come on 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.260
 to put a little pepper 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:21.489
 begins to show a little 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.489
 let's add salt 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.139
 [Music] 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.630
 what we are going to do now is to lower the 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.380
 minimum fire 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.530
 and leave it around 20 more minutes or 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.040
 less 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.200
 so that everything gets well 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.579
 and the tomato that is overcoming in this 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.500
 moment begins to pay a little more 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.540
 sweet 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.990
 the more we cook it the harder it goes 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.180
 be the sauce if it is not cured what 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.460
 did for example in the footprint for 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.170
 put a teaspoon of sugar for 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.190
 do not wait that long for the tomato 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.990
 past has been a little bit sweeter 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.260
 I can not add a spoonful of 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.890
 sugar and you already low acidity so 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.960
 Now let's lower the fire then 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.660
 and let's let it cook slowly 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.770
 well here and remove the sauce will be 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:19.430
 about 25 minutes, always try the 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.220
 if you like a little more let's say sweetie 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.860
 leave it a little longer and rectify the 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.240
 flavor of the pepper outlet and in this 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.190
 If you want, you can remove the garlic 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.530
 that we put the laurel or they can 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.110
 leave to keep flavor hoisting a 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.310
 little longer I'll leave and already 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.310
 I'm going to dump in a sauceboat 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.389
 to accompany his students a pasta a 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.860
 polenta rice and the salt was ready 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.960
