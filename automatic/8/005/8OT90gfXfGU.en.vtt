bench<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.020> set<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.470> custom<00:00:19.890> headlights

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
bench is a set of custom headlights

bench is a set of custom headlights
obviously<00:00:21.080> lenses<00:00:22.080> are<00:00:22.230> off<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> sake<00:00:23.250> of

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
obviously lenses are off for the sake of

obviously lenses are off for the sake of
filming<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:24.539> tried<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.840> film<00:00:25.019> one<00:00:25.199> with<00:00:25.380> the

filming we tried to film one with the
lenses<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.189> basically<00:00:26.490> all<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.820> get<00:00:27.000> is

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
lenses on and basically all you get is

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.750 
lenses on and basically all you get is

the truck on tuxedo black also on the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.219 
the truck on tuxedo black also on the
shroud<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> projector<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.210> that's<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
shroud on the projector so that's the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.350 
shroud on the projector so that's the
headlights<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.790> basically<00:01:29.909> what

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
headlights and then so basically what

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.810 
headlights and then so basically what
we're<00:01:30.509> doing<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:32.040> color<00:01:32.520> shift

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
we're doing here is is the color shift

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.690 
we're doing here is is the color shift
lenses<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:34.049> an<00:01:34.650> app<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.100> phone<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
lenses it's an app on your phone and

see<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:42.990> two<00:01:43.110> hands<00:01:43.350> if

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
see if we can do this with two hands if

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
see if we can do this with two hands if
you<00:01:44.159> we're<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> go<00:01:45.060> through<00:01:45.090> real

it's too intense you can dim it down to
nothing<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:43.090> give<00:03:43.329> it<00:03:43.449> back<00:03:43.599> up<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.459> those<00:03:45.459> are

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
nothing and give it back up so those are

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.270 
nothing and give it back up so those are
some<00:03:45.669> of<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.819> features<00:03:46.859> like<00:03:47.859> I<00:03:47.949> said<00:03:48.129> there's

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
some of the features like I said there's

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.740 
some of the features like I said there's
just<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.549> bunch<00:03:48.819> of<00:03:48.940> them<00:03:49.120> built<00:03:49.299> into<00:03:49.599> this

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
just a bunch of them built into this

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.170 
just a bunch of them built into this
strobe<00:03:50.199> features<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:51.280> another<00:03:51.760> one<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:51.970> kind
