the<00:00:39.989> rainbow<00:00:40.320> Nautilus<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.160> think<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:41.489> how

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the rainbow Nautilus I think that's how

the rainbow Nautilus I think that's how
you<00:00:41.640> say<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.719> actually<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
you say it and this is actually a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.810 
you say it and this is actually a
meffert's<00:00:43.500> puzzle<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> logo

meffert's puzzle you can see the logo
right<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.219> puzzle<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
right there and so this puzzle is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.029 
right there and so this puzzle is
divided<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.420> -<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.590> divided<00:00:50.010> up

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
divided up and - it's divided up

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:59.680 
divided up and - it's divided up
unevenly<00:00:50.640> into<00:00:51.239> different<00:00:51.570> sized<00:00:51.949> pieces

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.789 

here<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.340> Calvin<00:01:02.340> diner<00:01:02.670> morphix

have all of my puzzles except it's
already<00:01:10.140> together<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:10.740> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.950> nice

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
already together so that's kind of nice

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.760 
already together so that's kind of nice
the<00:01:11.880> 55<00:01:12.510> millimeter<00:01:13.110> dayan<00:01:13.979> zhanchi<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the 55 millimeter dayan zhanchi so I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.859 
the 55 millimeter dayan zhanchi so I
already<00:01:17.250> opened<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.600> I'll<00:01:18.750> just

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
already opened up this one so I'll just

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.990 
already opened up this one so I'll just
go<00:01:18.960> ahead<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.200> take<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> closer<00:01:19.680> look<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.640> turns

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
go ahead and take a closer look it turns

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.230 
go ahead and take a closer look it turns
as<00:01:21.360> three<00:01:22.320> layers<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.950> direction<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
as three layers in this direction and it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.570 
as three layers in this direction and it
is<00:01:24.390> divided<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:25.020> into<00:01:25.250> all<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.280> these

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
is divided up into all of these

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.440 
is divided up into all of these
different<00:01:26.970> parts<00:01:27.150> different<00:01:27.479> sizes<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> you

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
different parts different sizes so you

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.420 
different parts different sizes so you
see<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> can't<00:01:31.200> turn<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.439> across<00:01:31.710> here<00:01:31.979> because

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
see I can't turn it across here because

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
see I can't turn it across here because
it<00:01:32.579> doesn't<00:01:32.850> line<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.140> find

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it doesn't line up so you have to find

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.520 
it doesn't line up so you have to find
out<00:01:34.530> places<00:01:34.860> where<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> lines<00:01:35.729> up<00:01:35.939> properly

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
out places where it lines up properly

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.929 
out places where it lines up properly
and<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> only<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.430> right<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:38.790> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
and I think the only one right now is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.980 
and I think the only one right now is
actually<00:01:39.090> right<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.079> then<00:01:41.750> maybe<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
actually right here and then maybe this

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.149 
actually right here and then maybe this
like<00:01:43.229> oh<00:01:43.670> no<00:01:44.670> hmm<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.619> see<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.979> it's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
like oh no hmm so you can see that it's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.450 
like oh no hmm so you can see that it's
actually<00:01:48.560> it's<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.619> solid<00:01:50.009> piece<00:01:50.189> right<00:01:50.399> here

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
actually it's a solid piece right here

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.710 
actually it's a solid piece right here
I'm<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:50.820> sure<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.630> is

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I'm not sure that you can see that it is

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.819 
I'm not sure that you can see that it is
different<00:01:52.020> colors<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.340> solid<00:01:53.700> piece

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
different colors but it's a solid piece

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.959 
different colors but it's a solid piece
so<00:01:55.829> that's<00:01:56.009> weird<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.369> looks<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.790> this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
so that's weird it looks like this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.060 
so that's weird it looks like this
puzzle<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.509> kind<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.560> square<00:01:58.860> one

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
puzzle is kind of like if square one

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
puzzle is kind of like if square one
where<00:01:59.640> there's<00:01:59.850> only<00:01:59.969> one<00:02:00.090> slice<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.810> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
where there's only one slice to the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.660 
where there's only one slice to the
middle<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.890> only<00:02:02.040> turns<00:02:02.369> right<00:02:02.640> around

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
middle and it only turns right around

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.630 
middle and it only turns right around
here<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.469> these<00:02:04.860> pieces<00:02:05.159> are

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
here and so all of these pieces are

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.950 
here and so all of these pieces are
right<00:02:06.149> here<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.479> look<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.810> different

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
right here that look like different

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.499 
right here that look like different
pieces<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.649> orange<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.849> yellow<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
pieces the orange the yellow and the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.330 
pieces the orange the yellow and the
green<00:02:09.539> are<00:02:09.780> actually<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.379> actually<00:02:10.590> one<00:02:10.890> solid

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
green are actually is actually one solid

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.150 
green are actually is actually one solid
piece

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
piece

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.060 
piece
and<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.670> blue<00:02:12.940> light<00:02:13.720> blue<00:02:13.980> dark<00:02:14.980> blue

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
and so is the blue light blue dark blue

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.180 
and so is the blue light blue dark blue
pinkish<00:02:16.060> purple<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.630> red<00:02:16.870> are<00:02:17.680> also<00:02:17.890> all

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.100 
pinkish purple and red are also all
connected<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.240> can<00:02:19.360> only<00:02:19.480> make<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.840> turn

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
connected so you can only make this turn

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.260 
connected so you can only make this turn
here<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.680> then<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.190> can<00:02:21.310> turn<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.760> outer

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
here and then you can turn the outer

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.200 
here and then you can turn the outer
layers<00:02:22.600> like<00:02:22.960> this<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.400> it's<00:02:24.730> kind<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:24.970> cool<00:02:25.090> it

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
layers like this so it's kind of cool it

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.010 
layers like this so it's kind of cool it
looks<00:02:25.390> like<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.870> seashell<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:27.220> way<00:02:27.340> they

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
looks like a seashell the way they

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.060 
looks like a seashell the way they
design<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.140> pieces<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.590> made<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.800> go<00:02:29.830> from

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
design the pieces and made it go from

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.700 
design the pieces and made it go from
big<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.310> small<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.240> they<00:02:31.510> do<00:02:31.570> have<00:02:31.840> supposedly

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
big to small and they do have supposedly

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.150 
big to small and they do have supposedly
a<00:02:33.160> gold<00:02:33.610> one<00:02:34.120> i<00:02:34.390> pre-ordered<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.410> one<00:02:35.590> from

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
a gold one i pre-ordered that one from

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.740 
a gold one i pre-ordered that one from
the<00:02:36.280> Jade<00:02:36.490> Club<00:02:36.730> but<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:36.970> never<00:02:37.240> heard<00:02:37.480> anything

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
the Jade Club but I never heard anything

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.290 
the Jade Club but I never heard anything
back<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:39.190> just<00:02:39.370> went<00:02:39.550> ahead<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:40.090> just<00:02:40.210> a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
back so I just went ahead it's just a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.420 
back so I just went ahead it's just a
seven<00:02:40.540> color<00:02:40.870> one<00:02:41.110> I'm<00:02:41.860> not<00:02:42.010> sure<00:02:42.160> if<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.370> will

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
seven color one I'm not sure if I will

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.600 
seven color one I'm not sure if I will
even<00:02:42.760> get<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.210> gold<00:02:44.080> one<00:02:44.260> anymore<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.430> like<00:02:45.550> I

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
even get the gold one anymore but like I

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.910 
even get the gold one anymore but like I
said<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> meffert's<00:02:46.660> puzzle<00:02:46.990> but<00:02:47.860> I

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
said this is a meffert's puzzle but I

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.560 
said this is a meffert's puzzle but I
think<00:02:48.160> it's<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.400> HK<00:02:48.670> now<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:48.970> these<00:02:49.240> layers

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
think it's in HK now so these layers

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.890 
think it's in HK now so these layers
turned<00:02:49.840> very<00:02:50.080> very<00:02:50.380> well<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:52.390> outer<00:02:52.600> layers

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
turned very very well the outer layers

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.570 
turned very very well the outer layers
and<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.380> looks<00:02:53.530> like<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.740> middle<00:02:53.890> slice<00:02:54.160> also

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
and it looks like the middle slice also

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.670 
and it looks like the middle slice also
sounds<00:02:54.880> pretty<00:02:55.060> well<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.350> kind<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.560> have

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
sounds pretty well but you kind of have

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.210 
sounds pretty well but you kind of have
to<00:02:56.710> turn<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.370> find<00:02:58.180> places<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.990> line<00:02:59.980> up

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
to turn it and find places that line up

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.330 
to turn it and find places that line up
so<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.940> one<00:03:01.150> won't<00:03:01.360> line<00:03:01.570> up<00:03:01.600> now<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:03.220> is

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
so this one won't line up now this is

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.740 
so this one won't line up now this is
definitely<00:03:03.460> gonna<00:03:03.760> be<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.940> challenging<00:03:04.390> puzzle

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
definitely gonna be a challenging puzzle

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.170 
definitely gonna be a challenging puzzle
this<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.050> find<00:03:05.260> places<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.860> turn<00:03:06.070> I'm<00:03:06.760> having

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
this to find places to turn I'm having

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:20.700 
this to find places to turn I'm having
trouble<00:03:07.450> right<00:03:07.600> now<00:03:19.260> that's<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.350> kind<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.620> a

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
trouble right now that's a kind of a

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.900 
trouble right now that's a kind of a
weird<00:03:20.890> suit<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.920> this<00:03:24.100> is<00:03:24.190> actually<00:03:24.550> my<00:03:24.670> first

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
weird suit so this is actually my first

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.360 
weird suit so this is actually my first
puzzle<00:03:25.300> that<00:03:25.390> has<00:03:25.540> solid<00:03:26.080> color<00:03:26.290> plastic<00:03:26.920> I've

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
puzzle that has solid color plastic I've

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.550 
puzzle that has solid color plastic I've
never<00:03:27.550> had<00:03:27.700> any<00:03:27.880> before<00:03:28.240> and<00:03:28.990> I'd<00:03:29.200> say<00:03:29.410> this

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
never had any before and I'd say this

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.280 
never had any before and I'd say this
puzzle<00:03:29.860> looks<00:03:30.010> pretty<00:03:30.190> nice<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:31.600> don't<00:03:32.140> know

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
puzzle looks pretty nice I don't know

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.110 
puzzle looks pretty nice I don't know
how<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.500> feel<00:03:32.680> about<00:03:32.740> on<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.040> 3x3<00:03:33.520> man<00:03:33.670> go<00:03:33.820> get<00:03:33.970> one

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
how I feel about on a 3x3 man go get one

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.540 
how I feel about on a 3x3 man go get one
eventually<00:03:34.770> but<00:03:35.770> yeah<00:03:35.950> it's<00:03:36.130> definitely<00:03:36.250> kind

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
eventually but yeah it's definitely kind

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.540 
eventually but yeah it's definitely kind
of<00:03:36.640> hard<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:36.940> find<00:03:37.270> places<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.840> make<00:03:37.960> turns<00:03:41.550> so

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
of hard to find places to make turns so

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.430 
of hard to find places to make turns so
this<00:03:42.850> is<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.030> very<00:03:43.360> very<00:03:43.600> interesting<00:03:43.810> puzzle

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
this is a very very interesting puzzle

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.900 
this is a very very interesting puzzle
I'm<00:03:44.500> gonna<00:03:44.650> spend<00:03:44.890> probably<00:03:45.280> it's<00:03:45.610> gonna<00:03:45.790> take

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
I'm gonna spend probably it's gonna take

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.250 
I'm gonna spend probably it's gonna take
me<00:03:46.000> quite<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.300> long<00:03:46.450> time<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.840> figure<00:03:46.990> out<00:03:47.140> how

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
me quite a long time to figure out how

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.460 
me quite a long time to figure out how
this<00:03:47.440> actually<00:03:47.650> works<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:49.660> how<00:03:49.990> you<00:03:50.020> can<00:03:50.350> make

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
this actually works and how you can make

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.960 
this actually works and how you can make
turns<00:03:50.740> and<00:03:50.890> everything<00:03:50.950> but<00:03:51.310> I'm<00:03:51.670> gonna<00:03:51.820> go

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.910 
ahead and move on to the next puzzle and
this<00:03:54.280> one<00:03:54.459> here<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:55.540> Calvin<00:03:56.110> puzzle<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.590> is

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
this one here is a Calvin puzzle it is

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:10.830 
this one here is a Calvin puzzle it is
the<00:03:57.070> diner<00:03:57.340> morphix

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.199 

see<00:04:11.840> just<00:04:12.620> a<00:04:12.769> little<00:04:13.010> reflective<00:04:14.000> mirror

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
see just a little reflective mirror

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.789 
see just a little reflective mirror
thing<00:04:14.599> on<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.079> bottom<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:17.410> so<00:04:18.410> you<00:04:18.440> can<00:04:18.650> see

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
thing on the bottom and so you can see

it says Calvin puzzle and over here it
says<00:04:21.530> try<00:04:21.859> fun<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.360> is<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.840> morphing

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
says try fun and so it is a morphing

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.870 
says try fun and so it is a morphing
shaped<00:04:25.160> puzzle<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:27.350> it's<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.130> model<00:04:28.760> of<00:04:28.789> a

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
shaped puzzle and it's a model of a

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.000 
shaped puzzle and it's a model of a
diner<00:04:29.150> cube<00:04:29.570> actually<00:04:29.750> but<00:04:30.740> it's<00:04:30.860> very

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
diner cube actually but it's very

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.710 
diner cube actually but it's very
strange<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.820> shape<00:04:32.030> of<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.270> it's<00:04:32.419> not<00:04:32.539> like

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
strange the shape of it it's not like

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.439 
strange the shape of it it's not like
the<00:04:32.990> normal<00:04:33.440> like<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.910> gear<00:04:34.910> more<00:04:35.090> Fink's<00:04:35.360> or

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
the normal like the gear more Fink's or

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.279 
the normal like the gear more Fink's or
anything<00:04:35.600> like<00:04:35.750> that

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
anything like that

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.870 
anything like that
it<00:04:36.680> kind<00:04:36.860> of<00:04:36.889> has<00:04:37.039> a<00:04:37.070> different<00:04:37.430> shape<00:04:37.490> and

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
it kind of has a different shape and

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.300 
it kind of has a different shape and
it's<00:04:37.970> more<00:04:38.150> like<00:04:38.330> flat<00:04:39.199> right<00:04:39.440> here<00:04:39.740> as<00:04:40.250> you

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
it's more like flat right here as you

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.580 
it's more like flat right here as you
can<00:04:40.520> see<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:41.090> then<00:04:41.780> it's<00:04:41.900> really<00:04:42.199> pellet<00:04:42.500> up

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
can see and then it's really pellet up

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.290 
can see and then it's really pellet up
in<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.770> middle<00:04:43.010> but<00:04:43.280> we're<00:04:44.000> gonna<00:04:44.090> go<00:04:44.240> ahead

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
in the middle but we're gonna go ahead

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.180 
in the middle but we're gonna go ahead
and<00:04:44.389> see<00:04:44.660> how<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.780> turns<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:45.770> can<00:04:45.800> make<00:04:46.010> this

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
and see how it turns you can make this

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.340 
and see how it turns you can make this
style<00:04:46.400> turn<00:04:46.669> right<00:04:46.850> here<00:04:47.060> how<00:04:47.750> are<00:04:47.870> you

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
style turn right here how are you

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.140 
style turn right here how are you
a<00:04:48.440> face<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:49.669> that's<00:04:49.789> no<00:04:49.910> good<00:04:51.910> so<00:04:52.910> hopefully

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
a face and that's no good so hopefully

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.590 
a face and that's no good so hopefully
this<00:04:53.330> was<00:04:53.600> pop<00:04:53.930> right<00:04:54.139> back<00:04:55.240> okay<00:04:56.240> let's<00:04:56.479> try

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
this was pop right back okay let's try

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.689 
this was pop right back okay let's try
this<00:04:56.720> again<00:04:57.020> so<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.710> can<00:04:57.949> make<00:04:58.250> turns<00:04:58.490> like

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
this again so you can make turns like

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.670 
this again so you can make turns like
this<00:04:58.970> where<00:04:59.810> you<00:04:59.870> can<00:05:00.020> just<00:05:00.110> turn<00:05:00.289> the<00:05:00.410> face

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
this where you can just turn the face

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.159 
this where you can just turn the face
and<00:05:01.070> then<00:05:02.000> you<00:05:02.030> can<00:05:02.150> also<00:05:02.449> make<00:05:02.780> turns<00:05:02.990> like

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
and then you can also make turns like

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.629 
and then you can also make turns like
this<00:05:03.220> how<00:05:04.220> where<00:05:04.430> you<00:05:04.490> turn<00:05:04.789> a<00:05:05.030> tip<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:07.490> it

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
this how where you turn a tip so it

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.240 
this how where you turn a tip so it
should<00:05:07.789> be<00:05:07.820> very<00:05:08.030> easy<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.720> solve<00:05:09.250> continuing

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
should be very easy to solve continuing

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.550 
should be very easy to solve continuing
it's<00:05:10.430> just<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.840> shape<00:05:11.840> modification<00:05:12.050> of<00:05:12.500> a

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
it's just a shape modification of a

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:23.140 
it's just a shape modification of a
diner<00:05:12.770> cube<00:05:13.130> which<00:05:13.280> is<00:05:13.310> very<00:05:13.789> easy<00:05:22.060> so<00:05:23.060> it

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
diner cube which is very easy so it

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.490 
diner cube which is very easy so it
looks<00:05:23.300> pretty<00:05:23.570> cool<00:05:23.690> scrambled<00:05:24.139> up<00:05:24.169> it's<00:05:24.349> kind

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
looks pretty cool scrambled up it's kind

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.170 
looks pretty cool scrambled up it's kind
of<00:05:24.530> cool<00:05:24.680> how<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:24.830> can<00:05:24.979> do<00:05:25.220> face<00:05:25.520> turns<00:05:25.880> and

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
of cool how you can do face turns and

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.520 
of cool how you can do face turns and
vertex<00:05:26.750> turns<00:05:27.190> on<00:05:28.190> here<00:05:31.990> so<00:05:32.990> it<00:05:33.139> does<00:05:33.320> seem

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
vertex turns on here so it does seem

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.379 
vertex turns on here so it does seem
like<00:05:33.560> it's<00:05:33.830> turning<00:05:34.070> pretty<00:05:34.400> good<00:05:34.580> besides

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
like it's turning pretty good besides

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.270 
like it's turning pretty good besides
that<00:05:35.570> one<00:05:35.780> pop<00:05:36.020> but<00:05:36.349> the<00:05:36.530> piece<00:05:36.650> did<00:05:36.860> pop<00:05:37.070> back

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
that one pop but the piece did pop back

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.760 
that one pop but the piece did pop back
in<00:05:37.460> pretty<00:05:37.729> easily<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.330> now<00:05:39.199> I'm<00:05:39.349> not<00:05:39.500> having

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
in pretty easily and now I'm not having

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.230 
in pretty easily and now I'm not having
any<00:05:39.949> trouble<00:05:40.010> with<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:42.699> but<00:05:43.699> yeah<00:05:43.789> the<00:05:43.970> shape

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
any trouble with it but yeah the shape

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.899 
any trouble with it but yeah the shape
it's<00:05:44.599> a<00:05:44.930> very<00:05:45.289> strange<00:05:45.740> shape<00:05:46.099> considering<00:05:46.580> so

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
it's a very strange shape considering so

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.120 
it's a very strange shape considering so
flat<00:05:47.270> it's<00:05:47.960> not<00:05:48.139> like<00:05:48.380> the<00:05:48.530> normal<00:05:48.800> one<00:05:48.949> but

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
flat it's not like the normal one but

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.710 
flat it's not like the normal one but
you<00:05:49.880> know<00:05:49.909> I<00:05:50.000> kind<00:05:50.240> of<00:05:50.270> like<00:05:50.360> it's<00:05:50.539> just<00:05:50.659> a

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
you know I kind of like it's just a

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.870 
you know I kind of like it's just a
little<00:05:50.810> bit<00:05:50.990> different<00:05:51.320> and<00:05:51.710> trichome<00:05:52.669> always

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
little bit different and trichome always

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.610 
little bit different and trichome always
makes<00:05:53.060> a<00:05:53.180> very<00:05:53.389> good<00:05:53.539> puzzle<00:05:53.870> so<00:05:54.080> I'm<00:05:54.260> glad<00:05:54.500> to

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
makes a very good puzzle so I'm glad to

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.560 
makes a very good puzzle so I'm glad to
see<00:05:54.770> that<00:05:54.800> he<00:05:55.130> has<00:05:55.370> a<00:05:55.400> mass-produced<00:05:55.849> puzzle

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
see that he has a mass-produced puzzle

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.839 
see that he has a mass-produced puzzle
out<00:05:56.659> now<00:05:59.740> but<00:06:00.740> now<00:06:00.889> I'm<00:06:01.130> gonna<00:06:01.310> go<00:06:01.460> ahead<00:06:01.520> and

out now but now I'm gonna go ahead and
I'm<00:06:02.300> going<00:06:02.449> to<00:06:02.659> move<00:06:02.810> on<00:06:03.050> to<00:06:03.949> the<00:06:04.159> last<00:06:04.310> one

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
I'm going to move on to the last one

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.580 
I'm going to move on to the last one
which<00:06:04.849> is<00:06:04.970> just<00:06:05.000> a<00:06:05.360> 55<00:06:05.870> millimeter<00:06:06.020> dayan

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
which is just a 55 millimeter dayan

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.409 
which is just a 55 millimeter dayan
zhanchi<00:06:06.620> I<00:06:07.370> do<00:06:07.729> have<00:06:07.909> another<00:06:08.060> one<00:06:08.150> of<00:06:08.270> these

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
zhanchi I do have another one of these

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.100 
zhanchi I do have another one of these
and<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:09.500> last<00:06:09.680> one<00:06:09.889> that<00:06:10.010> I<00:06:10.039> ordered<00:06:10.539> came<00:06:11.539> as

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
and the last one that I ordered came as

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.320 
and the last one that I ordered came as
a<00:06:12.200> DIY<00:06:12.590> kit<00:06:12.830> so<00:06:13.250> I<00:06:13.280> kind<00:06:13.639> of<00:06:13.669> expected<00:06:14.060> this<00:06:14.120> one

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
a DIY kit so I kind of expected this one

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.410 
a DIY kit so I kind of expected this one
to<00:06:14.450> also

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
to also

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.880 
to also
but<00:06:16.020> kind<00:06:16.710> of<00:06:16.770> nice<00:06:16.890> that<00:06:17.040> it<00:06:17.160> came<00:06:17.310> assembled

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890 
but kind of nice that it came assembled

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:30.200 
but kind of nice that it came assembled
and<00:06:19.890> here<00:06:20.220> it<00:06:20.310> is<00:06:28.340> okay<00:06:29.340> so<00:06:29.400> out<00:06:29.700> of<00:06:29.730> the<00:06:29.880> box<00:06:30.000> it

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
and here it is okay so out of the box it

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.450 
and here it is okay so out of the box it
turns<00:06:30.390> pretty<00:06:30.840> decently<00:06:31.290> actually<00:06:31.710> I'm<00:06:32.190> still

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
turns pretty decently actually I'm still

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.480 
turns pretty decently actually I'm still
kind<00:06:32.640> of<00:06:32.670> surprised<00:06:33.000> that<00:06:33.510> it<00:06:34.260> came<00:06:34.320> as<00:06:34.800> became

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
kind of surprised that it came as became

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.130 
kind of surprised that it came as became
already<00:06:35.730> assembled<00:06:36.060> because<00:06:36.540> the<00:06:36.750> last<00:06:36.870> one<00:06:37.050> I

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
already assembled because the last one I

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.920 
already assembled because the last one I
got<00:06:37.170> I<00:06:37.530> got<00:06:38.490> another<00:06:38.700> 55<00:06:39.180> millimeter<00:06:39.600> one<00:06:39.720> and

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
got I got another 55 millimeter one and

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.200 
got I got another 55 millimeter one and
it<00:06:40.110> came<00:06:40.260> as<00:06:40.410> a<00:06:40.470> DIY<00:06:40.710> and<00:06:41.100> so<00:06:41.550> do<00:06:41.670> my<00:06:41.790> 42

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
it came as a DIY and so do my 42

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.770 
it came as a DIY and so do my 42
millimeter<00:06:42.540> one<00:06:42.690> actually<00:06:43.070> but<00:06:44.330> I'm<00:06:45.330> glad<00:06:45.660> to

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
millimeter one actually but I'm glad to

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.540 
millimeter one actually but I'm glad to
have<00:06:45.990> another<00:06:46.050> one<00:06:46.590> of<00:06:46.650> these<00:06:46.740> so<00:06:47.160> like<00:06:47.370> I<00:06:47.490> said

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
have another one of these so like I said

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.660 
have another one of these so like I said
this<00:06:47.760> is<00:06:47.940> a<00:06:47.970> 55<00:06:48.510> millimeter<00:06:48.860> 3x3<00:06:49.860> compared<00:06:50.580> to

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
this is a 55 millimeter 3x3 compared to

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.450 
this is a 55 millimeter 3x3 compared to
a<00:06:50.730> 57-millimeter<00:06:51.980> which<00:06:52.980> is<00:06:53.130> the<00:06:53.250> standard

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
a 57-millimeter which is the standard

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.660 
a 57-millimeter which is the standard
Rubik's<00:06:54.030> size<00:06:55.040> so<00:06:56.040> it's<00:06:56.160> just<00:06:56.280> a<00:06:56.340> little<00:06:56.550> bit

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:56.670 
Rubik's size so it's just a little bit

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.720 
Rubik's size so it's just a little bit
smaller<00:06:56.850> and<00:06:57.240> I<00:06:57.690> like<00:06:58.050> the<00:06:58.170> size<00:06:58.380> a<00:06:58.650> lot<00:06:58.890> it's

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
smaller and I like the size a lot it's

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.020 
smaller and I like the size a lot it's
just<00:07:00.180> a<00:07:00.270> little<00:07:00.540> bit<00:07:00.660> better<00:07:00.870> than<00:07:01.260> a<00:07:01.530> normal<00:07:02.030> 3

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
just a little bit better than a normal 3

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.120 
just a little bit better than a normal 3
by<00:07:03.180> 3<00:07:03.360> sides<00:07:06.260> so<00:07:07.260> what<00:07:07.500> I'm<00:07:07.620> going<00:07:07.710> to<00:07:07.770> do<00:07:07.890> is

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
by 3 sides so what I'm going to do is

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.490 
by 3 sides so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:07:08.580> going<00:07:08.610> to<00:07:08.940> go<00:07:09.330> ahead<00:07:09.420> and<00:07:09.630> do<00:07:09.720> 4<00:07:10.020> reviews

I don't think I'm gonna do one for the
55<00:07:25.860> millimeters<00:07:26.340> and<00:07:26.630> because<00:07:27.630> I<00:07:27.750> did<00:07:27.930> one<00:07:28.110> for

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:28.140 
55 millimeters and because I did one for

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.220 
55 millimeters and because I did one for
my<00:07:28.530> 42<00:07:28.980> millimeters<00:07:29.430> entry<00:07:29.760> and<00:07:30.300> it's<00:07:30.780> exactly
