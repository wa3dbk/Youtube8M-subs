is<00:00:41.149> normal<00:00:42.149> pencil<00:00:42.500> mechanical<00:00:43.500> pencil<00:00:43.920> takes

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
is normal pencil mechanical pencil takes

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.750 
is normal pencil mechanical pencil takes
point<00:00:44.610> five<00:00:44.760> lead<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.860> course<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.489> don't

pocket retention and this little crevice

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.160 
pocket retention and this little crevice
allows<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.360> stay<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.810> pocket<00:01:43.110> without

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
as you guys can see usually putt closer

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.899 
as you guys can see usually putt closer
the<00:01:49.409> first<00:01:49.590> thing<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> break<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.189> these<00:01:50.670> things

mechanical<00:01:59.130> pencil<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.750> let's<00:02:00.930> talk

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
mechanical pencil to have so let's talk

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.330 
mechanical pencil to have so let's talk
about<00:02:01.229> cons<00:02:03.079> the<00:02:04.079> only<00:02:04.320> cons<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.950> find<00:02:05.250> about

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
about cons the only cons I find about

about cons the only cons I find about
this<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.969> probably<00:02:07.520> this<00:02:08.520> part<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.390> looks

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
this is probably this part it looks

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.880 
this is probably this part it looks
metal<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.200> part<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.470> actually<00:02:10.649> a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
metal but this part is actually a

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.670 
metal but this part is actually a
plastic<00:02:11.430> construction<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.330> feels

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
plastic construction and it feels

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.039 
plastic construction and it feels
decent<00:02:14.310> um<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:14.939> doesn't<00:02:15.239> feel<00:02:15.390> terrible

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
decent um it doesn't feel terrible

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.759 
decent um it doesn't feel terrible
however<00:02:17.599> when<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.689> have<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.049> thing<00:02:19.290> open

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
however when you have this thing open

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.600 
however when you have this thing open
and<00:02:20.659> you're<00:02:21.659> writing<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.290> does<00:02:22.590> flex<00:02:23.159> a<00:02:23.340> little

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
and you're writing it does flex a little

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.520 
and you're writing it does flex a little
bit<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.180> might<00:02:24.540> get<00:02:24.689> a<00:02:24.750> little<00:02:25.110> sketchy<00:02:25.290> it

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
bit so it might get a little sketchy it

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.350 
bit so it might get a little sketchy it
might<00:02:25.650> feel<00:02:25.829> a<00:02:25.860> little<00:02:25.920> sketchy<00:02:26.310> but<00:02:26.640> overall

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
might feel a little sketchy but overall

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.009 
might feel a little sketchy but overall
it's<00:02:27.720> fine<00:02:27.930> um<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:29.430> else<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:30.329> other<00:02:30.750> thing

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
it's fine um what else the other thing

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.440 
it's fine um what else the other thing
is<00:02:31.909> with<00:02:32.909> these<00:02:33.090> pen<00:02:33.540> pens<00:02:34.049> pencils<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:36.239> get
