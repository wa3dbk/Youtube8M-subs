from<00:03:03.459> mysterious<00:03:04.390> fossil<00:03:04.900> in<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.110> trading

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
from mysterious fossil in the trading

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.110 
from mysterious fossil in the trading
card<00:03:05.650> game<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:06.069> think<00:03:06.519> they<00:03:06.700> made<00:03:06.880> like

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120
