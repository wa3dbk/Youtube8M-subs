and those commercials for displaying

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.519 
and those commercials for displaying
some<00:00:13.559> actual<00:00:13.889> practical<00:00:14.429> uses<00:00:15.000> for<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
some actual practical uses for this is a

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.130 
some actual practical uses for this is a
measuring<00:00:17.130> tape<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:18.029> when<00:00:18.180> there<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.840> no

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
measuring tape for when there is no

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.769 
measuring tape for when there is no
other<00:00:19.320> option<00:00:19.439> but<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.400> measure<00:00:20.730> with<00:00:21.060> one

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
other option but to measure with one

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.490 
other option but to measure with one
hand

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
hand

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.230 
hand
okay<00:00:22.890> let's<00:00:23.490> say<00:00:23.640> you're<00:00:23.760> holding<00:00:23.939> something

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
okay let's say you're holding something

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.599 
okay let's say you're holding something
up<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.170> got<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.350> measure<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.430> just

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
up and you got to measure it you just

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.519 
up and you got to measure it you just
you<00:00:27.180> can<00:00:27.330> only<00:00:27.449> use<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> measuring<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> more

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
you can only use the measuring to more

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.769 
you can only use the measuring to more
normal<00:00:28.680> tapes<00:00:29.250> they<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.730> don't<00:00:30.210> work<00:00:30.390> very

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
normal tapes they just don't work very

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.650 
normal tapes they just don't work very
well<00:00:30.810> for<00:00:31.230> those<00:00:31.769> situations<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.660> basically

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
well for those situations so basically

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.639 
well for those situations so basically
what<00:00:33.899> black<00:00:34.170> &amp;<00:00:34.380> decker<00:00:34.410> did<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.270> they<00:00:36.270> took<00:00:36.649> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
what black &amp; decker did is they took the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.319 
what black &amp; decker did is they took the
standard<00:00:38.040> idea<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.110> measuring<00:00:40.110> tape<00:00:40.350> right

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
standard idea of a measuring tape right

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.340 
standard idea of a measuring tape right
and<00:00:42.890> basically<00:00:44.329> they<00:00:45.329> decided<00:00:45.930> well<00:00:46.140> let's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and basically they decided well let's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.830 
and basically they decided well let's
put<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> motor<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.270> make<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.660> that's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
put a motor in it so make it so that's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.900 
put a motor in it so make it so that's
automatic

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.660 

so<00:00:57.910> think<00:00:58.480> about<00:00:58.750> 82<00:00:59.230> inches<00:00:59.469> on<00:00:59.800> that<00:01:00.010> before

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
so think about 82 inches on that before

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.439 
so think about 82 inches on that before
it<00:01:00.789> started<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.420> go<00:01:01.480> with<00:01:02.410> structural

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
it started to go with structural

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.249 
it started to go with structural
integrity<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:06.070> it<00:01:06.520> runs<00:01:06.820> on<00:01:07.180> four<00:01:07.810> triple-a

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
integrity but it runs on four triple-a

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.820 
integrity but it runs on four triple-a
batteries<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.810> suggest<00:01:11.259> if<00:01:11.350> you're<00:01:11.470> using

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
batteries and I suggest if you're using

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.960 
batteries and I suggest if you're using
this<00:01:12.280> on<00:01:12.610> lots<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:14.280> rechargeable<00:01:15.280> triple-a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
this on lots get rechargeable triple-a

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.320 
this on lots get rechargeable triple-a
batteries<00:01:16.509> because<00:01:17.440> this<00:01:17.799> thing<00:01:18.039> you<00:01:18.970> know<00:01:19.090> it

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
batteries because this thing you know it

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.450 
batteries because this thing you know it
does<00:01:19.690> suck<00:01:20.140> out<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.380> decent<00:01:20.710> amount<00:01:20.979> of<00:01:21.250> power

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
does suck out a decent amount of power

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.800 
does suck out a decent amount of power
so<00:01:22.390> well<00:01:23.380> it<00:01:23.799> comes<00:01:24.039> in<00:01:24.220> handy<00:01:24.430> for<00:01:24.820> certain

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
so well it comes in handy for certain

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.480 
so well it comes in handy for certain
situations<00:01:26.409> that<00:01:26.830> really<00:01:27.159> demand<00:01:27.549> it<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
situations that really demand it and I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.100 
situations that really demand it and I
don't<00:01:30.490> remember<00:01:30.970> how<00:01:31.210> much<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.479> paid<00:01:31.509> for<00:01:32.080> it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
don't remember how much I paid for it

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.550 
don't remember how much I paid for it
but<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.440> can't<00:01:32.710> this<00:01:32.950> number<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:33.970> years<00:01:34.270> ago<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
but I can't this number of years ago and

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.980 
but I can't this number of years ago and
it's<00:01:35.710> very<00:01:35.950> sturdy<00:01:36.369> it<00:01:36.880> really<00:01:37.210> does<00:01:37.390> hold<00:01:37.780> up

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
it's very sturdy it really does hold up

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.660 
it's very sturdy it really does hold up
really<00:01:38.289> well<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:40.000> got<00:01:40.210> a<00:01:40.240> belt<00:01:40.690> clip<00:01:40.960> as<00:01:41.590> well

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
really well it's got a belt clip as well

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.050 
really well it's got a belt clip as well
so<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.869> right<00:01:44.200> there<00:01:44.470> right<00:01:44.950> here<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> belt

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
so so right there right here is a belt

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.649 
so so right there right here is a belt
clip<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.549> you<00:01:48.819> got<00:01:48.970> that<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:52.030> far<00:01:52.390> as<00:01:52.569> this

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
clip so you got that and as far as this

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.570 
clip so you got that and as far as this
thing<00:01:52.869> goes<00:01:52.960> out<00:01:53.200> here<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:53.649> thing<00:01:53.950> when<00:01:54.459> you

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
thing goes out here this thing when you

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.270 
thing goes out here this thing when you
just<00:01:54.610> pull<00:01:55.119> this<00:01:55.240> out<00:01:55.420> see<00:01:55.750> just<00:01:56.470> how<00:01:56.679> far<00:01:57.009> this

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
just pull this out see just how far this

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.520 
just pull this out see just how far this
actually<00:01:57.819> goes<00:01:58.090> before<00:01:58.390> runs<00:01:58.840> out<00:01:59.170> of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
actually goes before runs out of

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.969 
actually goes before runs out of
measurements<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.630> keep<00:02:01.930> going<00:02:01.990> keep<00:02:02.950> going

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
measurements so I keep going keep going

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:16.500 
measurements so I keep going keep going
keep<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:09.570> okay<00:02:10.570> so<00:02:12.630> this<00:02:13.630> thing<00:02:15.510> will

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
keep going okay so this thing will

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.780 
keep going okay so this thing will
accurately<00:02:16.870> go<00:02:17.440> up<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.829> 25<00:02:18.519> feet<00:02:19.140> okay<00:02:20.790> so

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
accurately go up to 25 feet okay so

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:31.650 
accurately go up to 25 feet okay so
what's<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.930> pretty<00:02:23.290> long

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.490 

the<00:02:32.660> retraction<00:02:33.140> does<00:02:33.650> work<00:02:33.860> pretty<00:02:33.890> well<00:02:34.250> in

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
the retraction does work pretty well in

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.080 
the retraction does work pretty well in
some<00:02:36.500> cases<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:37.040> retraction<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.850> may<00:02:37.970> need

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
some cases the retraction you may need

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.350 
some cases the retraction you may need
to<00:02:38.240> help<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.570> just<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.780> little<00:02:39.050> bit<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:40.360> overall

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
to help it just a little bit but overall

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.930 
to help it just a little bit but overall
it's<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.050> solid<00:02:42.080> sturdy<00:02:42.740> product<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.430> triple-a

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
it's a solid sturdy product the triple-a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.790 
it's a solid sturdy product the triple-a
batteries<00:02:44.330> going<00:02:44.570> right<00:02:44.960> here<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:47.680> take<00:02:48.680> this

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
batteries going right here I take this
