00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.620
 we started by putting a base 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:18.560
 then let's choose a pastel pink and 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.110
 let's paint the little finger on 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.350
 heart and thumb 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:27.090
 [Music] 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:31.770
 and then as you can see we are going to paint the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.890
 remaining fingers is very likely that 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.979
 you need to put two layers of color 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.979
 [Music] 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.200
 then we will take the tincture or 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.200
 piercing to crave 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.780
 [Music] 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.660
 and with its finest part we are going to start 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 to draw polka dots on the nails with the 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.670
 color contrary to what we have base 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.240
 [Music] 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.950
 so in those with pink base we are going to 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.020
 put beige dots and on those that have 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.440
 beige base let's put colored dots 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.440
 pink 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.360
 but let's leave the ring finger free 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.360
 to draw the bear 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.909
 with the own pink enamel brush 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.909
 let's draw the head of the bear 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.180
 [Music] 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.299
 and with the thick part of the side team tool 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.820
 let's make the ears now with 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.230
 beige and the thick part of the out in tour 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:03.770
 let's make the bear's snout 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:05.750
 [Music] 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.239
 and let's paint black nose and 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.000
 the eyes as a final touch let's give it 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.849
 a little beige to the ears and for 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.520
 Last we are going to seal our manicure 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.440
 with shine top coat 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.330
 [Music] 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.470
 I have chosen because I know it is a glaze 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.470
 transparent secant 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.860
 and that's how our manicure will look 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.860
 [Music] 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.940
