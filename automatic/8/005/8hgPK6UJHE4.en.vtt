this is a just a great opportunity for a

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.750 
this is a just a great opportunity for a
driver<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.600> grow<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.739> person

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
driver to grow as a person

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
driver to grow as a person
you<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.450> much<00:00:42.600> camaraderie<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.739> nuts

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you get so much camaraderie it's nuts

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.459 
you get so much camaraderie it's nuts
not<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.640> company<00:00:45.180> event<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.140> driver

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
not a company event but it's a driver

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.799 
not a company event but it's a driver
event<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.090> helps<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.510> driver

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
event and I think this helps a driver

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.380 
event and I think this helps a driver
grow<00:00:49.170> within<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:50.250> make<00:00:50.460> him<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.820> more<00:00:51.030> aware<00:00:51.360> of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
his surroundings in the trucking

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.630 
his surroundings in the trucking
industry<00:00:53.360> now<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> lot<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.379> fun<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.430> it's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
industry now it's a lot of fun but it's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.010

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.840 
to get to compete in this but with that
comes<00:01:34.049> some<00:01:34.259> stress<00:01:34.650> because<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
comes some stress because just like a

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.569 
comes some stress because just like a
safety<00:01:36.180> record<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.960> safety<00:01:37.619> record<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.070> easy<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
safety record a safety record is easy to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.630 
safety record a safety record is easy to
get<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.840> hard<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.380> retain<00:01:41.159> as

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
get but it's really hard to retain as

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.000 
get but it's really hard to retain as
time<00:01:42.329> goes<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.810> more

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
time goes on more

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.610 
time goes on more
but<00:01:44.730> that's<00:01:44.910> all<00:01:45.060> part<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.510> it<00:01:45.660> I<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.110> all<00:01:46.380> we

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
but that's all part of it I think all we

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.830 
but that's all part of it I think all we
do<00:01:46.800> is<00:01:46.980> professional<00:01:47.610> drivers<00:01:48.120> each<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
do is professional drivers each and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.630 
do is professional drivers each and
every<00:01:49.020> day<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.710> counting<00:01:50.130> what<00:01:50.160> we're<00:01:50.460> going

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
every day not counting what we're going

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.750 
every day not counting what we're going
to<00:01:50.760> do<00:01:50.940> in<00:01:51.600> Houston<00:01:52.230> I<00:01:52.350> always<00:01:52.770> say<00:01:53.010> what<00:01:53.610> we're

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
is actually the icing on our cake

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.600 
is actually the icing on our cake
because<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:58.770> we<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:59.010> each<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.370> every<00:01:59.460> day
