00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.090
 a novel electrical 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.309
 Drive technology is used in aviation 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.309
 make the future greener and more sustainable 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.670
 to have intensive cooperation 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.949
 diamond aircraft siemens and eads the 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.990
 second generation of the plane with 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.240
 serial hybrid electric drive 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.730
 developed and thus an important 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:43.010
 milestone for the efficient use of 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:45.079
 planes reached the new 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.430
 technological concept allows the 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.809
 significant reduction of the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.239
 fuel consumption and emissions 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.489
 by about 25 percent 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.500
 In addition, the empty weight opposite 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.800
 the predecessor about 100 kilograms 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.379
 be lowered 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.620
 For the first time, a series has hybrids 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.890
 electric plane the payload and the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.740
 reach the one from a plane 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.689
 expected 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.700
 the plane is powered by a 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.040
 hybrid system consisting of one 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.380
 Integrated drive system from Siemens 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.030
 and a generator of one 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.030
 small wankelmotor is fed 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 It reflects engine platforms of the 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:39.060
 campers and ustream at startup and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.670
 climb delivers the new 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.830
 drive system has an output of 80 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.869
 kilowatts quiet and efficient only 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.100
 powered by a siemens 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.180
 integrated drive system succeeds in june 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.180
 2013 the jungfernflug 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.979
 Electric drives are scalable 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.310
 that is why we are convinced that in the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.709
 future also airliner for 50 or 100 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.830
 passengers hybrid electric drives 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.260
 will have the test flights 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.260
 proved that the siemens concept of 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.090
 integrated drive system a pioneer 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.830
 step for commercial use 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.830
 this technology is 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.670
 and even more beautiful than flying 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.670
 sustainably fly
