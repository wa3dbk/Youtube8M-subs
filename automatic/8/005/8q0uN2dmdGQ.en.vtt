00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
indirectly that means if DirectX 12 does

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.130 
indirectly that means if DirectX 12 does
live<00:01:01.920> up<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.789> hype<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.780> able<00:01:03.989> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
program game is better that means your

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.700 
program game is better that means your
hard<00:01:06.420> work<00:01:06.600> should<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.900> able<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.140> last<00:01:07.320> longer
