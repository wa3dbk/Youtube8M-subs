name is Jay Andrews and today we're
going<00:00:43.470> to<00:00:43.560> talk<00:00:43.740> about<00:00:43.860> pin<00:00:44.220> systems<00:00:44.840> Lagoon

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
going to talk about pin systems Lagoon

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.450 
going to talk about pin systems Lagoon
has<00:00:45.930> developed<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.440> brand<00:00:46.710> new<00:00:46.860> fin<00:00:47.100> system

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
has developed a brand new fin system

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.520 
has developed a brand new fin system
that's<00:00:47.670> designed<00:00:47.970> to<00:00:48.060> fit<00:00:48.240> your<00:00:48.270> saw<00:00:48.630> and<00:00:49.080> it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
that's designed to fit your saw and it's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.650 
that's designed to fit your saw and it's
called<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.830> drift<00:00:50.070> master<00:00:50.460> fence<00:00:50.700> system<00:00:51.060> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
called the drift master fence system and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.210 
called the drift master fence system and
why<00:00:51.900> we're<00:00:52.080> looking<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.470> fin<00:00:52.680> systems<00:00:53.100> we

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
why we're looking at fin systems we

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.530 
why we're looking at fin systems we
considered<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.700> number<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.030> different<00:00:54.330> reasons

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
considered a number of different reasons

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.750 
considered a number of different reasons
to<00:00:54.990> change<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.739> fin<00:00:55.890> system<00:00:56.220> many<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.610> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
to change the fin system many of you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.330 
to change the fin system many of you
like<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.720> tall<00:00:57.930> fence<00:00:58.200> that<00:00:58.860> we<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.190> on

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
like the the tall fence that we have on

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
like the the tall fence that we have on
a<00:00:59.370> lot<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.580> our<00:00:59.730> band<00:00:59.970> saws<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.080> the<00:01:01.260> fact

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a lot of our band saws you like the fact

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.870 
a lot of our band saws you like the fact
that<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> goes<00:01:01.860> high<00:01:02.130> and<00:01:02.309> low<00:01:02.430> quite<00:01:02.700> easily

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
that it goes high and low quite easily

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.180 
that it goes high and low quite easily
we<00:01:03.870> tried<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.170> make<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.410> design<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.800> little

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
we tried to make this design a little

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.260 
we tried to make this design a little
bit<00:01:05.280> easier<00:01:05.550> and<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.670> little<00:01:05.850> more<00:01:05.910> functional

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
bit easier and a little more functional

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
bit easier and a little more functional
for<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> shop<00:01:06.840> let<00:01:07.560> me<00:01:07.680> show<00:01:07.800> you<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> few<00:01:08.160> of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
for the shop let me show you a few of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.890 
for the shop let me show you a few of
the<00:01:08.340> challenges<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.060> considered<00:01:09.510> when

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the challenges that we considered when

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
the challenges that we considered when
we're<00:01:10.080> developing<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.890> drift<00:01:11.130> master<00:01:11.430> fence

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
we're developing the drift master fence

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.870 
we're developing the drift master fence
system<00:01:12.350> now<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.800> know<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.490> at<00:01:14.520> Laguna

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
system now as you know here at Laguna

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.520 
system now as you know here at Laguna
tools<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.630> slice<00:01:15.869> wafer<00:01:16.350> thin

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
tools we like to slice wafer thin

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.600 
tools we like to slice wafer thin
veneers<00:01:16.860> from<00:01:17.729> lots<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.150> hardwoods<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.610> when

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
veneers from lots of hardwoods and when

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.370 
veneers from lots of hardwoods and when
we<00:01:20.790> slide<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.300> piece<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.900> wood<00:01:22.050> through<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
we slide the piece of wood through the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.980 
we slide the piece of wood through the
bandsaw<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:23.310> preference<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.360> put<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
bandsaw the preference is to put the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.510 
bandsaw the preference is to put the
wood<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.410> inside<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
wood to the inside so that you have the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.180 
wood to the inside so that you have the
big<00:01:26.700> block<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.450> against<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.050> fence<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.560> by

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
big block up against the fence and by

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.160 
big block up against the fence and by
doing<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.910> veneer<00:01:30.030> cut<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.050> come

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
doing so the veneer cut is going to come

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.650 
doing so the veneer cut is going to come
on<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> outside<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.820> reason<00:01:33.180> behind<00:01:33.300> this<00:01:33.600> is

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
on the outside the reason behind this is

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.570 
on the outside the reason behind this is
pretty<00:01:33.990> simple<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.830> were<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.340> cut

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
pretty simple if you were to do the cut

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.280 
pretty simple if you were to do the cut
the<00:01:36.030> way<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.630> butcher<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
the way that you see the butcher do it

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.190 
the way that you see the butcher do it
and<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.100> call<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.520> baloney<00:01:38.910> slicing<00:01:39.479> where

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
and I call this baloney slicing where

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.749 
and I call this baloney slicing where
you<00:01:40.290> put<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> big<00:01:40.830> block<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> wood<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
you put the big block of wood on the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.520 
you put the big block of wood on the
outside<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.690> thin<00:01:42.899> cut<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> inside

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
outside and the thin cut on the inside

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.240 
outside and the thin cut on the inside
and<00:01:44.190> push<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.090> through<00:01:45.120> the<00:01:45.360> bandsaw<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:47.010> only

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
and push it through the bandsaw the only

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.950 
and push it through the bandsaw the only
part<00:01:47.520> against<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> fence<00:01:48.150> on<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.420> backside

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
part against the fence on the backside

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.140 
part against the fence on the backside
edge<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.650> just<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> veneer<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.000> can

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
edge here is just the veneer and it can

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.149 
edge here is just the veneer and it can
flap<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> forth<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.650> big<00:01:52.890> block<00:01:53.130> of

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
flap back and forth the big block of

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.860 
flap back and forth the big block of
wood<00:01:53.460> because<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.880> has<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> lot<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.300> mass<00:01:54.600> and

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
wood because it has a lot of mass and

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.240 
wood because it has a lot of mass and
momentum<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.650> as<00:01:55.770> you're<00:01:55.950> pushing<00:01:56.190> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
momentum on it here as you're pushing it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.070 
momentum on it here as you're pushing it
through<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> bandsaw<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.420> actually<00:01:57.750> steer

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
through the bandsaw can actually steer

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.140 
through the bandsaw can actually steer
itself<00:01:58.380> through<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.620> bandsaw<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.640> diminishes

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
itself through the bandsaw it diminishes

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.690 
itself through the bandsaw it diminishes
the<00:02:00.270> quality<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:00.960> cut<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
the quality of the cut this the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.460 
the quality of the cut this the
advantage<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.570> doing<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.900> way<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.140> it

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
advantage to doing it this way is it

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.200 
advantage to doing it this way is it
allows<00:02:04.650> you<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> get<00:02:04.950> repeatable<00:02:05.520> cuts<00:02:05.820> by

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
allows you to get repeatable cuts by

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.730 
allows you to get repeatable cuts by
push<00:02:06.420> them<00:02:06.600> through<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> quality<00:02:07.560> cut

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
push them through but the quality cut

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.859 
push them through but the quality cut
suffers<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.149> fence<00:02:09.390> isn't<00:02:09.720> doing

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
suffers and the fence isn't doing

anything<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.260> you<00:02:10.350> in<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.500> backside<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
anything for you in the backside so the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.750 
anything for you in the backside so the
alternative<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:13.220> move<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.370> fence<00:02:14.519> over

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
alternative is to move the fence over

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.729 
alternative is to move the fence over
put<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.720> big<00:02:15.900> piece<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.380> wood<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.709> inside

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
put the big piece of wood on the inside

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.699 
put the big piece of wood on the inside
and<00:02:17.310> take<00:02:18.030> your<00:02:18.180> off<00:02:18.360> cut<00:02:18.570> on<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.720> outside<00:02:19.110> now

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
and take your off cut on the outside now

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.500 
and take your off cut on the outside now
what<00:02:19.890> does<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.010> mean<00:02:20.310> well<00:02:21.090> what<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:21.330> means

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
what does that mean well what it means

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.550 
what does that mean well what it means
is<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.720> I'm<00:02:21.900> going<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.410> go<00:02:22.530> through

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
is that I'm going to have to go through

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.160 
is that I'm going to have to go through
each<00:02:23.280> time<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> make<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.940> cut<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.390> position<00:02:25.080> the

each time I make a cut and position the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.229 
each time I make a cut and position the
fence<00:02:25.350> over<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.280> increment<00:02:26.670> at<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.850> time<00:02:27.060> and

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
fence over and increment at a time and

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.220 
fence over and increment at a time and
it<00:02:27.299> requires<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.019> tape<00:02:28.200> measure

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
it requires that I get the tape measure

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.530 
it requires that I get the tape measure
out<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.920> make<00:02:29.489> a<00:02:29.519> measurement<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.269> each<00:02:30.360> and

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
out and make a measurement for each and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.960 
out and make a measurement for each and
every<00:02:30.720> cut<00:02:30.930> that's<00:02:31.860> nice<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.489> works<00:02:32.730> but

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
every cut that's nice and it works but

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.520 
every cut that's nice and it works but
it's<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:33.330> bit<00:02:33.450> slower<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.260> what<00:02:34.410> we

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
it's a little bit slower so what we

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.020 
it's a little bit slower so what we
designed<00:02:34.860> again<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.370> drift<00:02:35.670> master

piece right here

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.420 
piece right here
this<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:55.260> actually<00:04:55.560> used<00:04:55.710> for<00:04:55.950> certain<00:04:56.160> saws

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
this is actually used for certain saws

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.480 
this is actually used for certain saws
and<00:04:57.080> probably<00:04:58.080> is<00:04:58.980> something<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.400> you're

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
and probably is something that you're

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.410 
and probably is something that you're
not<00:04:59.520> going<00:04:59.730> to<00:04:59.790> need<00:04:59.880> so<00:04:59.970> you<00:05:00.030> can<00:05:00.120> remove<00:05:00.360> that

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
not going to need so you can remove that

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.330 
not going to need so you can remove that
and<00:05:00.690> get<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:00.810> out<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.140> way

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
and get that out of the way

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.770 
and get that out of the way
the<00:05:02.550> other<00:05:02.669> thing<00:05:02.850> is<00:05:02.970> you'll<00:05:03.180> probably<00:05:03.390> want

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
the other thing is you'll probably want

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.090 
the other thing is you'll probably want
to<00:05:03.810> remove<00:05:04.110> these<00:05:04.320> studs<00:05:04.650> because<00:05:04.830> we're

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
to remove these studs because we're

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.760 
to remove these studs because we're
going<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.250> use<00:05:05.310> the

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
going to use the

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.100 
going to use the
Universal<00:05:06.370> brackets<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:07.660> these<00:05:07.810> will<00:05:07.990> come

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
Universal brackets so these will come

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.770 
Universal brackets so these will come
out<00:05:08.259> it'll<00:05:09.039> take<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.250> number<00:05:09.430> 19<00:05:09.819> wrench<00:05:10.090> and

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
out it'll take a number 19 wrench and

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.330 
out it'll take a number 19 wrench and
you<00:05:10.870> simply<00:05:11.229> will<00:05:11.349> loosen<00:05:11.650> these<00:05:11.770> studs<00:05:12.069> and

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
you simply will loosen these studs and

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.550 
you simply will loosen these studs and
remove<00:05:12.610> those<00:05:12.789> from<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.030> drift<00:05:13.300> master<00:05:13.660> now

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
remove those from the drift master now

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.170 
remove those from the drift master now
you<00:05:14.620> can<00:05:14.830> install<00:05:15.069> the<00:05:15.340> drift<00:05:15.550> master<00:05:15.909> as<00:05:16.150> a

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
you can install the drift master as a

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.300 
you can install the drift master as a
complete<00:05:16.750> unit<00:05:17.080> what<00:05:17.409> I<00:05:17.440> find<00:05:17.860> is<00:05:18.009> that<00:05:18.039> it's<00:05:18.250> a

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
complete unit what I find is that it's a

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.770 
complete unit what I find is that it's a
little<00:05:18.460> bit<00:05:18.550> easier<00:05:18.759> just<00:05:18.940> to<00:05:19.240> mount<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.539> bar

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
little bit easier just to mount the bar

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.930 
little bit easier just to mount the bar
with<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.560> extra<00:05:20.860> weight<00:05:20.889> off<00:05:21.220> of<00:05:21.250> this<00:05:21.550> so

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
with the extra weight off of this so

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.899 
with the extra weight off of this so
what<00:05:22.090> I<00:05:22.120> can<00:05:22.210> do<00:05:22.419> is<00:05:22.539> I<00:05:22.629> can<00:05:22.690> unbolt<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.199> end

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
what I can do is I can unbolt the end

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.460 
what I can do is I can unbolt the end
take<00:05:24.909> this<00:05:25.060> screw<00:05:25.330> out<00:05:25.360> here<00:05:25.720> take<00:05:26.050> this<00:05:26.199> screw

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
take this screw out here take this screw

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.379 
take this screw out here take this screw
out<00:05:26.560> off<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.710> end<00:05:26.949> and<00:05:27.129> slide<00:05:27.879> the<00:05:28.060> rod<00:05:28.210> and

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
out off the end and slide the rod and

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.939 
out off the end and slide the rod and
everything<00:05:28.629> out<00:05:28.780> of<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:28.960> way<00:05:29.110> in<00:05:29.349> that<00:05:29.740> way<00:05:29.889> it

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
everything out of the way in that way it

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.260 
everything out of the way in that way it
makes<00:05:30.069> it<00:05:30.220> a<00:05:30.250> lot<00:05:30.340> easier<00:05:30.610> to<00:05:30.669> install<00:05:30.970> on<00:05:31.180> the

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
makes it a lot easier to install on the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.270 
makes it a lot easier to install on the
saw<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:32.319> removing<00:05:32.740> this<00:05:32.800> screw<00:05:32.860> is<00:05:33.099> pretty

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
saw and removing this screw is pretty

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.649 
saw and removing this screw is pretty
easy<00:05:33.460> we<00:05:33.639> just<00:05:33.669> take<00:05:33.879> a<00:05:33.909> number<00:05:34.060> six<00:05:34.389> allen

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
easy we just take a number six allen

easy we just take a number six allen
wrench<00:05:34.840> and<00:05:35.650> we'll<00:05:35.830> break<00:05:35.979> the<00:05:36.129> end<00:05:36.280> loose

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
wrench and we'll break the end loose

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:44.040 
wrench and we'll break the end loose
here<00:05:41.849> take<00:05:42.849> the<00:05:43.000> screw<00:05:43.270> out<00:05:43.300> set<00:05:43.659> these<00:05:43.780> parts
