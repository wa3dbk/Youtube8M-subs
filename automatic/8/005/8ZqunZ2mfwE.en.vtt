00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.920
 Sleepy when I put my chocolate for breakfast. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.120
 I taste, taste, keep my dreams in my hand. 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.200
 What did it really seem to me? In my mind, I project those dreams. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.960
 Was there too much or little? I wake up. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.560
 My sweet, chocolate, soul sad to please. 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:59.800
 White, bitter-milky, love, you solve all the troubles. 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.680
 Castles, chateaux, bridges I build from chocolate only 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.000
 I only chew gum there when an emergency comes. 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.840
 Chocolate full of bath, oh how sweet the smell. 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.000
 I swim, swim for fun, swim to the fairy tale. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.600
 My sweet, chocolate, soul sad to please. 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.880
 White, bitter-milky, love, you solve all the troubles. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.400
 My sweet, chocolate, soul sad to please. 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.400
 White, bitter-milky, love, you solve all the troubles. 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.200
 I dreamed of candy and pendreku sweet. 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.400
 My taste is CHOCOLATE! I want her back! 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.680
 My sweet, chocolate, soul sad to please. 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:00.000
 White, bitter-milky, love, you solve all the troubles. 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:16.760
