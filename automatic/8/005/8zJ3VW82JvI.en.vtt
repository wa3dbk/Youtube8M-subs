second only and it will actually look

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.279 
second only and it will actually look
quite<00:00:43.620> different<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.520> right<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:45.329> after<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
quite different so right now after you

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.779 
quite different so right now after you
watch<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> video<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.920> might<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.280> thinking<00:00:47.430> oh

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
watch the video you might be thinking oh

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.119 
watch the video you might be thinking oh
wow<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.300> looks<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.660> same<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.320> both<00:00:49.410> systems

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
wow it looks the same on both systems

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.549 
wow it looks the same on both systems
but<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.940> trust<00:00:51.210> me<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.960> does<00:00:52.230> look

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
but just trust me that it does look

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
but just trust me that it does look
quite<00:00:52.890> different<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:54.030> you're<00:00:54.180> actually

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
quite different and when you're actually

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.600 
quite different and when you're actually
playing<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.739> other<00:00:55.890> thing<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.399> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
playing it the other thing is that I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.240 
playing it the other thing is that I
didn't<00:00:57.239> adjust<00:00:57.510> any<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.500> brightness<00:00:59.010> or

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
didn't adjust any of the brightness or

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
didn't adjust any of the brightness or
other<00:00:59.579> settings<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.420> this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.899> exactly<00:01:01.320> what

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
other settings so this is exactly what

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.860 
other settings so this is exactly what
it<00:01:01.859> looks<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:03.030> yeah<00:01:03.149> right<00:01:03.390> now<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.629> have

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it looks like so yeah right now we have

really<00:01:41.640> good<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.630> actually<00:01:42.780> see

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
really good because you can actually see

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.010 
really good because you can actually see
enemies<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.979> lot<00:01:44.250> better<00:01:44.490> now<00:01:44.729> I'm<00:01:45.570> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> be

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
enemies a lot better now I'm going to be

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.550 
enemies a lot better now I'm going to be
talking<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.470> how<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.220> game<00:01:47.520> plays<00:01:47.549> out<00:01:48.030> now

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
talking about how the game plays out now

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.230 
talking about how the game plays out now
right<00:01:49.560> now<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.159> guess<00:01:50.520> not<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:51.000> many<00:01:51.119> people

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
right now I guess not that many people

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.810 
right now I guess not that many people
are<00:01:51.630> actually<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:52.259> ghosts<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.130> Xbox<00:01:53.579> one

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
are actually on ghosts on the Xbox one

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.090 
are actually on ghosts on the Xbox one
so<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.479> I'm<00:01:54.600> saying<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.079> terms<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.470> lag<00:01:55.710> might

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so what I'm saying in terms of lag might

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.639 
so what I'm saying in terms of lag might
change<00:01:56.520> when<00:01:56.820> more<00:01:57.000> people<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> game<00:01:57.869> but

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
change when more people get the game but

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.800 
change when more people get the game but
I<00:01:58.680> feel<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.070> there<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> lot<00:02:00.060> less<00:02:00.270> lag<00:02:00.570> on

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
I feel like there is a lot less lag on

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.510 
I feel like there is a lot less lag on
the<00:02:00.899> Xbox<00:02:01.259> one<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.799> first<00:02:02.009> game<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the Xbox one the first game that I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.760 
the Xbox one the first game that I
played<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.420> wow<00:02:03.810> there<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> huge

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
played I was like wow there is a huge

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.459 
played I was like wow there is a huge
difference<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> could<00:02:06.240> feel<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.719> I'm

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
difference that I could feel and I'm

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.010 
difference that I could feel and I'm
yeah<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> think<00:02:08.399> obviously<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:09.330> knifing<00:02:09.869> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
yeah I think obviously with knifing I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.750 
yeah I think obviously with knifing I
think<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> knife<00:02:10.590> actually<00:02:11.069> works<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.730> a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
think the knife actually works as a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.360 
think the knife actually works as a
consequence<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.720> fact<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
consequence of the fact that

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.699 
consequence of the fact that
is<00:02:13.430> less<00:02:13.670> lag<00:02:14.000> but<00:02:14.870> i<00:02:15.080> don't<00:02:15.290> know<00:02:15.349> maybe<00:02:15.590> you

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
is less lag but i don't know maybe you

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.410 
is less lag but i don't know maybe you
guys<00:02:15.799> can<00:02:16.190> tell<00:02:16.430> me<00:02:16.580> if<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.819> guys<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.180> played

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
guys can tell me if you guys have played

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.300 
guys can tell me if you guys have played
it<00:02:17.569> as<00:02:17.989> well<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.409> if<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.620> guys<00:02:18.769> are<00:02:18.950> knife<00:02:19.069> is

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
it as well and if you guys are knife is

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.039 
it as well and if you guys are knife is
personally<00:02:19.849> i<00:02:19.879> find<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.599> TAC<00:02:20.870> knife

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
personally i find that the TAC knife

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.199 
personally i find that the TAC knife
actually<00:02:21.620> works<00:02:21.980> on<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.370> xbox<00:02:22.730> one<00:02:22.940> which<00:02:23.180> is

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
actually works on the xbox one which is

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.589 
actually works on the xbox one which is
a<00:02:23.360> big<00:02:23.659> bonus<00:02:23.959> um<00:02:24.580> when<00:02:25.580> I'm<00:02:25.700> running<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.330> feels

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
a big bonus um when I'm running it feels

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.440 
a big bonus um when I'm running it feels
a<00:02:26.720> lot<00:02:26.840> smoother<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.680> don't<00:02:27.950> know<00:02:28.129> if<00:02:28.489> again

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
a lot smoother I don't know if again

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.509 
a lot smoother I don't know if again
that's<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.840> lag<00:02:30.079> issue<00:02:30.379> but<00:02:30.829> it<00:02:31.040> just<00:02:31.220> feels<00:02:31.459> a

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
that's a lag issue but it just feels a

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.000 
that's a lag issue but it just feels a
lot<00:02:31.640> smoother<00:02:32.209> when<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.599> run<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.650> now<00:02:33.829> in

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
lot smoother when you run so now in

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.339 
lot smoother when you run so now in
terms<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.819> xbox<00:02:35.120> one<00:02:35.480> controller<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.170> how

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
terms of the xbox one controller and how

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.440 
terms of the xbox one controller and how
I'm<00:02:36.500> finding<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.159> when<00:02:37.370> I'm<00:02:37.489> playing<00:02:37.670> ghosts

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
I'm finding it when I'm playing ghosts

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.440 
I'm finding it when I'm playing ghosts

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.170 
controllers have sort of complained a
little<00:02:48.170> bit<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.040> don't<00:02:49.340> know<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:49.819> you<00:02:50.030> guys

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
I guess have problems adapting to

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.520 
I guess have problems adapting to
playing<00:02:55.250> ghosts<00:02:55.790> with<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.420> xbox<00:02:57.349> one

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
controller personally when I'm knifing i

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.610 
controller personally when I'm knifing i
use<00:03:00.560> tactical<00:03:01.310> so<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.700> knife<00:03:02.060> using<00:03:02.450> be<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.989> can't

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
use tactical so I knife using be I can't

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.289 
use tactical so I knife using be I can't
say<00:03:03.799> whether<00:03:04.040> or<00:03:04.250> not<00:03:04.370> I'm<00:03:04.609> laughing<00:03:05.060> on

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.899 
say whether or not I'm laughing on
default<00:03:05.810> is<00:03:05.959> any<00:03:06.290> different<00:03:06.590> but<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.370> far<00:03:07.609> I'm

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
default is any different but so far I'm

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.630 
default is any different but so far I'm
adjusting<00:03:08.390> totally<00:03:09.079> fine<00:03:09.319> when<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.340> actually

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
adjusting totally fine when I actually

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.180 
adjusting totally fine when I actually
shoot<00:03:11.299> I've<00:03:11.569> noticed<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.230> it's<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.980> lot<00:03:13.159> more

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
shoot I've noticed that it's a lot more

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.580 
shoot I've noticed that it's a lot more
precise<00:03:14.000> because<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.659> guess<00:03:15.049> with<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.409> new

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
precise because I guess with the new

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.530 
precise because I guess with the new
controllers<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.730> thumbsticks<00:03:17.239> there's

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
controllers and the thumbsticks there's

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.960 
controllers and the thumbsticks there's
no<00:03:17.660> dead<00:03:17.959> zone<00:03:18.200> on<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:18.859> it<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.519> lot<00:03:19.819> more

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
no dead zone on it so it is a lot more

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.089 
no dead zone on it so it is a lot more
precise<00:03:20.359> when<00:03:20.599> you're<00:03:20.750> shooting<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.680> in<00:03:21.889> terms

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
precise when you're shooting so in terms

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.309 
precise when you're shooting so in terms
of<00:03:22.280> whether<00:03:22.519> or<00:03:22.700> not<00:03:22.849> ghost<00:03:23.239> is<00:03:23.599> worth<00:03:24.019> buying

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
of whether or not ghost is worth buying

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.229 
of whether or not ghost is worth buying
on<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.650> xbox<00:03:25.040> one<00:03:25.280> or<00:03:25.310> not<00:03:25.549> I<00:03:25.730> think<00:03:26.060> that

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
on the xbox one or not I think that

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.539 
on the xbox one or not I think that
definitely<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:27.079> is<00:03:27.349> worth<00:03:27.620> buying<00:03:27.950> but<00:03:28.310> one

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
definitely it is worth buying but one

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.670 
definitely it is worth buying but one
thing<00:03:28.879> that<00:03:29.329> you<00:03:29.359> should<00:03:29.599> take<00:03:30.139> note<00:03:30.349> of<00:03:30.379> is

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
thing that you should take note of is

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.610 
thing that you should take note of is
that<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.160> graphics<00:03:31.579> on<00:03:31.730> ghosts<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.540> me<00:03:32.720> it's

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
that the graphics on ghosts to me it's

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.530 
that the graphics on ghosts to me it's
actually<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:33.980> least<00:03:34.160> impressive<00:03:34.549> of<00:03:35.090> all<00:03:35.329> of

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
actually the least impressive of all of

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.470 
actually the least impressive of all of
the<00:03:35.720> xbox<00:03:36.079> one<00:03:36.470> game<00:03:36.799> so<00:03:37.099> far<00:03:37.340> especially<00:03:38.150> when

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
the xbox one game so far especially when

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.440 
the xbox one game so far especially when
you<00:03:38.750> compare<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.200> to<00:03:39.410> battlefield<00:03:39.950> 4<00:03:40.250> 40<00:03:41.000> even

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
you compare it to battlefield 4 40 even

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.240 
you compare it to battlefield 4 40 even
killer<00:03:41.660> instinct<00:03:42.230> which<00:03:42.379> is<00:03:42.530> actually<00:03:42.739> a<00:03:42.949> free

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
killer instinct which is actually a free

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.460 
killer instinct which is actually a free
game<00:03:43.639> so<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:44.480> might<00:03:44.690> be<00:03:44.720> something<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.349> take

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
game so that might be something to take

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.610 
game so that might be something to take
into<00:03:45.650> account<00:03:46.010> of<00:03:46.660> Forza<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.840> battlefield<00:03:48.379> 4

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
into account of Forza and battlefield 4

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.770 
into account of Forza and battlefield 4
actually<00:03:49.010> run<00:03:49.190> in<00:03:49.310> 60<00:03:49.730> frames<00:03:50.060> per<00:03:50.209> second<00:03:50.690> as

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
actually run in 60 frames per second as

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.599 
actually run in 60 frames per second as
well<00:03:50.989> and<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.410> graphics<00:03:51.859> look<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.220> lot<00:03:52.400> better

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
well and the graphics look a lot better

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.330 
well and the graphics look a lot better
so<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.599> don't<00:03:53.900> really<00:03:53.989> know<00:03:54.410> why<00:03:54.620> ghosts

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
so I don't really know why ghosts

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.740 
so I don't really know why ghosts
doesn't<00:03:55.760> look<00:03:55.819> as<00:03:55.970> good<00:03:56.000> as<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.299> but<00:03:56.629> that's

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
doesn't look as good as that but that's

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.720 
doesn't look as good as that but that's
a<00:03:56.840> totally<00:03:57.169> new<00:03:57.290> topic<00:03:57.650> another<00:03:58.280> thing<00:03:58.549> that

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
a totally new topic another thing that

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.490 
a totally new topic another thing that
you<00:03:58.760> might<00:03:59.030> want<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.389> take<00:03:59.569> note<00:03:59.629> of<00:03:59.840> is<00:04:00.260> the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
you might want to take note of is the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.530 
you might want to take note of is the
fact<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.799> there's<00:04:01.069> not<00:04:01.250> as<00:04:01.489> many<00:04:01.730> players<00:04:02.150> on

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
fact that there's not as many players on

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.479 
fact that there's not as many players on
the<00:04:02.720> Xbox<00:04:03.109> one<00:04:03.410> obviously<00:04:03.949> because<00:04:04.280> not<00:04:04.459> that

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
the Xbox one obviously because not that

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.909 
the Xbox one obviously because not that
many<00:04:04.730> people<00:04:04.849> have<00:04:05.269> it<00:04:05.419> yet<00:04:05.629> so<00:04:06.410> I<00:04:06.440> don't<00:04:06.739> know

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
many people have it yet so I don't know

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.920 
many people have it yet so I don't know
I<00:04:06.980> haven't<00:04:07.280> had<00:04:07.519> any<00:04:07.669> problems<00:04:08.269> finding<00:04:08.449> games

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
I haven't had any problems finding games

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.619 
I haven't had any problems finding games
but<00:04:09.349> it<00:04:09.530> does<00:04:09.739> take<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.160> little<00:04:10.430> bit<00:04:10.639> longer<00:04:10.849> to

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
but it does take a little bit longer to

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.539 
but it does take a little bit longer to
find<00:04:11.780> a<00:04:11.930> game<00:04:12.079> compared<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.769> 360<00:04:13.370> because

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
find a game compared to the 360 because

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.369 
find a game compared to the 360 because
there's<00:04:13.910> just<00:04:14.060> so<00:04:14.150> many<00:04:14.269> people<00:04:14.690> on<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.870> 360

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
there's just so many people on the 360

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.830 
there's just so many people on the 360
version<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.980> ghosts<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:17.180> yeah<00:04:17.359> that<00:04:17.510> might<00:04:17.660> be

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
version of ghosts so yeah that might be

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.390 
version of ghosts so yeah that might be
something<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.260> want<00:04:18.349> to<00:04:18.500> take<00:04:18.620> into<00:04:18.799> account
