a really nice TV for gaming my only

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.320 
a really nice TV for gaming my only
complaint<00:00:47.510> about<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:48.020> is<00:00:48.290> when<00:00:48.739> you<00:00:49.520> are<00:00:49.879> going

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
complaint about it is when you are going

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.080 
complaint about it is when you are going
through<00:00:50.660> let's<00:00:51.440> say<00:00:51.559> light<00:00:52.040> or<00:00:52.250> dark<00:00:52.519> areas<00:00:52.910> on

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
through let's say light or dark areas on

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.290 
through let's say light or dark areas on
your<00:00:53.120> TV<00:00:53.420> or<00:00:53.809> in<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.410> video<00:00:54.650> game<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.550> TV<00:00:56.000> will

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
your TV or in the video game the TV will

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.320 
your TV or in the video game the TV will
adjust<00:00:56.750> itself<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.550> brightness<00:00:58.970> setting

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
adjust itself to the brightness setting

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.790 
adjust itself to the brightness setting
that<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.720> area<00:00:59.960> is<00:01:00.050> in<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:00.440> when<00:01:00.590> you<00:01:00.620> go

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
that the area is in so when you go

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.160 
that the area is in so when you go
really<00:01:01.070> dark<00:01:01.309> area<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:02.149> TV<00:01:02.630> will<00:01:02.809> actually

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
really dark area the TV will actually

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.290 
really dark area the TV will actually
lower<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.739> brightness<00:01:03.950> to<00:01:04.399> very<00:01:04.759> dark<00:01:05.089> and

lower the brightness to very dark and

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:14.650 
lower the brightness to very dark and
that's<00:01:05.720> kind<00:01:06.050> of<00:01:06.140> annoying<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:14.330> this<00:01:14.479> next

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
that's kind of annoying so this next

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.060
