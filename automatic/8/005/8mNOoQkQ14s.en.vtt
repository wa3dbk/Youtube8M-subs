00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
there than they are here he doesn't

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.820 
there than they are here he doesn't
think<00:05:21.060> that<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.599> machines<00:05:21.810> are<00:05:22.229> the<00:05:22.349> same<00:05:22.560> for

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
think that the machines are the same for

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.309 
think that the machines are the same for
some<00:05:23.009> reason<00:05:23.460> but<00:05:23.759> after<00:05:24.659> the<00:05:24.750> research<00:05:25.080> I've

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
some reason but after the research I've

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.230 
some reason but after the research I've
done<00:05:25.349> they<00:05:25.800> certainly<00:05:26.279> looked<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:26.819> same<00:05:26.849> to

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
done they certainly looked the same to

thought about putting a website together
with<00:06:27.659> pricing<00:06:28.080> information<00:06:28.289> but<00:06:28.710> I<00:06:28.740> put<00:06:29.009> some

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
pricing information in this and that

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:33.260 
pricing information in this and that
should<00:06:31.500> suffice<00:06:31.710> for<00:06:31.949> now<00:06:32.250> but<00:06:32.909> if<00:06:33.000> somebody

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
should suffice for now but if somebody

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.120 
should suffice for now but if somebody
wanted<00:06:33.479> to<00:06:33.539> put<00:06:33.750> a<00:06:33.779> put<00:06:34.229> a<00:06:34.259> website<00:06:34.589> together
