for what part of the world you live in
but<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.320> me<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.619> Canada<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.820> pre-order<00:01:06.180> date

is in black and 32 gigabytes and instead

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.090 
is in black and 32 gigabytes and instead
of<00:01:20.009> 8<00:01:20.220> gigabytes<00:01:20.670> that's<00:01:21.509> 350<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.920> comes

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
of 8 gigabytes that's 350 and it comes
