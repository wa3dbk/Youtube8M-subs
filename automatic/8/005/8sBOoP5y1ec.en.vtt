00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.180 
I stuck on again as a visual mock-up
with<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.060> clear<00:02:06.390> packing<00:02:06.780> tape<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.890> true

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
with just clear packing tape it's a true

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.150 
with just clear packing tape it's a true
lifting<00:02:08.610> body<00:02:08.819> like<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> dinosaur<00:02:10.500> series<00:02:10.950> of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
lifting body like the dinosaur series of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.790 
lifting body like the dinosaur series of
early<00:02:11.910> 60s<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.569> lifting<00:02:12.900> bodies

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
early 60s the lifting bodies

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
early 60s the lifting bodies
this<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:14.550> arrived<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> mail<00:02:15.240> badly

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
this one arrived in the mail badly

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.350 
this one arrived in the mail badly
damaged<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.890> went<00:02:17.190> ahead<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.490> glued<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
damaged so I went ahead and glued the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.890 
damaged so I went ahead and glued the
broken<00:02:18.870> pieces<00:02:19.080> back<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.710> just<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.400> again

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
broken pieces back on just to again

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.260 
broken pieces back on just to again
experiment<00:02:21.900> with<00:02:22.470> me<00:02:23.070> mainly<00:02:23.580> visual<00:02:24.030> things

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
experiment with me mainly visual things

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.820 
experiment with me mainly visual things
the<00:02:24.690> first<00:02:24.810> thing<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.140> did<00:02:25.320> was<00:02:25.470> add<00:02:25.650> that

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the first thing I did was add that

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.580 
the first thing I did was add that
vertical<00:02:26.250> stabilizer<00:02:26.730> mainly<00:02:27.240> for<00:02:27.450> looks<00:02:27.660> but

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
vertical stabilizer mainly for looks but

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.050 
vertical stabilizer mainly for looks but
also<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.920> think<00:02:28.980> it'll<00:02:29.310> help<00:02:29.460> but<00:02:29.640> fly<00:02:29.820> better

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
also I think it'll help but fly better

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.340 
also I think it'll help but fly better
and<00:02:30.300> that's<00:02:30.450> where<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.780> rudder<00:02:30.990> will<00:02:31.200> be

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
and that's where the rudder will be

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.810 
and that's where the rudder will be
attached<00:02:31.710> once<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.190> learn<00:02:32.370> how<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.550> work<00:02:32.760> with

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
attached once I learn how to work with

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.870 
attached once I learn how to work with
servos<00:02:33.450> when<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> tossed<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.950> once<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.490> repaired

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
servos when I tossed it once I repaired

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.330 
servos when I tossed it once I repaired
it<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.120> my<00:02:36.240> neighbor's<00:02:36.570> lawn<00:02:36.810> in<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.860> absence

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
it in my neighbor's lawn in the absence

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.100 
it in my neighbor's lawn in the absence
of<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.490> vertical<00:02:38.790> stabilizer<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.750> seemed

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
of a vertical stabilizer it seemed

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.890 
of a vertical stabilizer it seemed
really<00:02:40.470> quite<00:02:40.890> unstable<00:02:41.240> so<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.270> put<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:42.690> one

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
really quite unstable so I put this one

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.190 
really quite unstable so I put this one
on<00:02:42.930> mainly<00:02:43.740> for<00:02:43.950> visuals<00:02:44.450> but<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.480> think<00:02:45.780> once<00:02:46.050> I

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
on mainly for visuals but I think once I

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.220 
on mainly for visuals but I think once I
actually<00:02:46.530> commit<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.670> flight<00:02:48.540> it's<00:02:48.960> going<00:02:49.170> to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
actually commit to flight it's going to

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.110 
actually commit to flight it's going to
help<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.590> what<00:02:50.100> I'm<00:02:50.190> also<00:02:50.370> thinking<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.970> doing

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
help it what I'm also thinking of doing

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.520 
help it what I'm also thinking of doing
is<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.690> lip<00:02:51.990> here<00:02:53.690> seems<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.810> meet<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.380> could

is this lip here seems to meet it could

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.600 
is this lip here seems to meet it could
be<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.650> very<00:02:56.010> good<00:02:56.100> place<00:02:56.460> to<00:02:57.330> add<00:02:57.450> canard<00:02:58.260> wings

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
be a very good place to add canard wings

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.670 
be a very good place to add canard wings
to<00:02:59.610> help<00:02:59.790> keep<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.150> nose<00:03:00.330> up<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.750> can<00:03:01.230> keep

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
to help keep the nose up I can keep

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.770 
to help keep the nose up I can keep

sticking<00:03:09.060> out<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.390> love<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.020> fact<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.380> this

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
sticking out I love the fact that this

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.980 
sticking out I love the fact that this
thing<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.190> sculptural<00:03:11.820> they<00:03:12.540> did<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.720> think

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
thing is so sculptural they did I think

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.170 
thing is so sculptural they did I think
they<00:03:13.080> did<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> very<00:03:13.470> good<00:03:13.740> job<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:14.640> sculpting

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
they did a very good job of sculpting

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.580 
they did a very good job of sculpting
one<00:03:15.420> piece<00:03:15.660> of<00:03:15.870> foam<00:03:16.050> into<00:03:16.500> an

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
aerodynamically correct form this one I

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.010 
aerodynamically correct form this one I
also<00:03:19.950> almost<00:03:20.520> for<00:03:20.850> sure<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.209> want<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.570> be<00:03:21.750> rear

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020

also almost for sure I want to be rear
prop-driven<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:23.430> think<00:03:24.360> I'm<00:03:24.510> going<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.690> have<00:03:24.930> to

prop-driven I think I'm going to have to

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.199 
prop-driven I think I'm going to have to
probably<00:03:25.470> get<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> smaller<00:03:26.070> motor<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.730> a

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
probably get a smaller motor and a

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.940 
probably get a smaller motor and a
smaller<00:03:27.540> propeller<00:03:27.989> since<00:03:28.350> it's<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.770> much

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
smaller propeller since it's so much

going<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.850> put<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:58.380> ailerons<00:03:58.860> part<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.580> me

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
going to put the ailerons part of me

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.810 
going to put the ailerons part of me
says<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.120> go<00:04:00.239> ahead<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.630> cut<00:04:00.840> out<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:02.640> back

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
says to go ahead and cut out the back

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.910 
says to go ahead and cut out the back
section<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.900> wing<00:04:04.050> right<00:04:04.230> there<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.680> make

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
section of the wing right there and make

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.010 
section of the wing right there and make
an<00:04:05.130> aileron<00:04:05.700> there<00:04:06.060> part<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.540> me<00:04:06.600> says<00:04:06.840> to

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
an aileron there part of me says to

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.100 
an aileron there part of me says to
extend<00:04:07.500> an<00:04:07.650> aileron<00:04:07.950> behind<00:04:08.670> it<00:04:08.880> but<00:04:09.810> I'm<00:04:09.930> now

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
extend an aileron behind it but I'm now

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.229 
extend an aileron behind it but I'm now
leaning<00:04:10.410> more<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:10.860> more<00:04:11.010> towards<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:12.209> idea

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
leaning more and more towards the idea

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.380 
leaning more and more towards the idea
of<00:04:12.870> having<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.890> aileron<00:04:14.280> extend<00:04:14.910> off<00:04:15.090> from

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
of having the aileron extend off from

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.909 
of having the aileron extend off from
this<00:04:15.510> last<00:04:15.750> portion<00:04:16.140> of<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.380> wing<00:04:16.500> or<00:04:16.680> maybe

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
this last portion of the wing or maybe

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.789 
this last portion of the wing or maybe
even<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.400> wing<00:04:17.580> tip<00:04:17.910> which<00:04:18.799> extends

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
even the wing tip which extends

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.440 
even the wing tip which extends
downwards<00:04:20.250> somewhat<00:04:20.640> but<00:04:20.850> it's<00:04:20.970> really<00:04:21.239> fun

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
downwards somewhat but it's really fun

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
can actually get sustained flight the

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.140 
can actually get sustained flight the
trick<00:05:45.750> now<00:05:45.930> for<00:05:46.260> me<00:05:46.380> is<00:05:46.530> to<00:05:46.880> learn<00:05:47.880> how<00:05:48.120> to

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
trick now for me is to learn how to

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.720 
trick now for me is to learn how to
launch<00:05:48.530> and<00:05:49.530> then<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:49.890> understand<00:05:50.370> better<00:05:50.550> the

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
launch and then to understand better the

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.370 
launch and then to understand better the
mechanicals<00:05:51.330> but<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:51.810> want<00:05:52.020> to<00:05:52.080> share<00:05:52.230> with

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
mechanicals but I want to share with

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.070 
mechanicals but I want to share with
folks<00:05:52.530> this<00:05:52.770> new<00:05:53.040> new<00:05:53.880> hobby<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:54.480> the<00:05:54.810> current

completed or semi completed model either
the<00:06:00.360> flying<00:06:00.630> wing<00:06:00.810> or<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.140> lifting<00:06:01.650> body<00:06:01.680> I'll

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
the flying wing or the lifting body I'll

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.470 
the flying wing or the lifting body I'll
shoot<00:06:02.430> another<00:06:02.640> clip<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.030> share<00:06:03.270> with<00:06:03.360> you
