00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.740 
home it kind of sets the backbone kind
of<00:04:58.830> sets<00:04:59.070> as<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.250> tea<00:04:59.550> what<00:05:00.330> you're<00:05:00.479> basically

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
of sets as a tea what you're basically

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.890 
of sets as a tea what you're basically
doing<00:05:00.900> a<00:05:01.169> loin<00:05:01.380> sets<00:05:01.860> on<00:05:02.009> both<00:05:02.190> sides<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.789> that

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
doing a loin sets on both sides of that

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.260 
doing a loin sets on both sides of that
that<00:05:03.900> tea<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:05.039> you<00:05:05.070> just<00:05:05.310> basically<00:05:05.550> run<00:05:06.030> your

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
that tea so you just basically run your

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:15.170 
that tea so you just basically run your
knife<00:05:06.449> down<00:05:07.940> all<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.240> way<00:05:09.330> down

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.420 

we<00:05:16.180> will<00:05:16.360> up<00:05:16.510> here<00:05:16.720> where<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.130> when<00:05:18.130> the<00:05:18.220> hips

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
we will up here where the when the hips

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.080 
we will up here where the when the hips
are<00:05:19.560> can<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.590> get<00:05:20.800> started<00:05:20.920> it<00:05:21.310> here<00:05:24.090> is

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
are can I get started it here is

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.240 
are can I get started it here is
basically<00:05:25.660> following<00:05:27.810> following<00:05:28.810> it<00:05:29.170> out<00:05:29.350> but

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
basically following following it out but

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.300 
basically following following it out but
if<00:05:30.340> you<00:05:30.370> look<00:05:31.230> part<00:05:32.230> of<00:05:32.320> it<00:05:32.410> here<00:05:32.620> there's<00:05:33.220> a

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
if you look part of it here there's a

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.900 
if you look part of it here there's a
shiny<00:05:34.110> part<00:05:35.110> of<00:05:35.290> this<00:05:35.470> and<00:05:36.310> those<00:05:36.490> are<00:05:36.730> called

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
shiny part of this and those are called

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.140 
shiny part of this and those are called
it<00:05:37.150> that's<00:05:37.390> the<00:05:37.510> sinew<00:05:38.100> okay<00:05:39.100> what<00:05:39.700> I<00:05:39.790> like<00:05:40.000> to

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
it that's the sinew okay what I like to

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.710 
it that's the sinew okay what I like to
do<00:05:40.270> first<00:05:40.570> before<00:05:40.780> I<00:05:41.110> cut<00:05:41.380> that<00:05:41.530> out<00:05:41.590> is<00:05:42.520> I<00:05:42.910> go

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
do first before I cut that out is I go

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.130 
do first before I cut that out is I go
ahead<00:05:43.840> and<00:05:44.770> remove<00:05:45.330> what<00:05:46.330> that<00:05:46.510> does<00:05:46.690> is<00:05:46.930> that

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
ahead and remove what that does is that

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.080 
ahead and remove what that does is that
for<00:05:47.440> once<00:05:47.590> that's<00:05:47.800> a<00:05:47.890> very<00:05:48.100> useful<00:05:48.340> useful

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
for once that's a very useful useful

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.960 
for once that's a very useful useful
item<00:05:49.780> I'll<00:05:50.590> show<00:05:50.860> you<00:05:50.920> maybe<00:05:51.460> on<00:05:51.640> a<00:05:51.700> later

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
item I'll show you maybe on a later

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.430 
item I'll show you maybe on a later
video<00:05:52.540> and<00:05:53.080> how<00:05:53.710> I<00:05:53.740> use<00:05:54.100> sinew<00:05:54.790> but<00:05:55.420> when<00:05:56.350> you

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
video and how I use sinew but when you

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.880 
video and how I use sinew but when you
cut<00:05:56.740> your<00:05:57.010> stakes<00:05:57.400> on<00:05:58.030> there<00:05:58.630> you're<00:05:59.590> by

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
cut your stakes on there you're by

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.890 
cut your stakes on there you're by
removing<00:06:00.520> that<00:06:00.550> right<00:06:00.820> about<00:06:01.150> right<00:06:01.570> off<00:06:01.750> the

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
removing that right about right off the

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.510 
removing that right about right off the
bat<00:06:02.050> you're<00:06:02.380> kind<00:06:02.680> of<00:06:02.710> making<00:06:02.860> it<00:06:03.100> more<00:06:03.130> tender

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
bat you're kind of making it more tender

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.830 
bat you're kind of making it more tender
you<00:06:03.760> don't<00:06:03.910> have<00:06:04.060> to<00:06:04.150> deal<00:06:04.300> with<00:06:04.450> that

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
you don't have to deal with that

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.910 
you don't have to deal with that
gristle<00:06:05.680> part<00:06:05.980> of<00:06:06.130> it<00:06:06.250> on<00:06:06.850> it<00:06:07.060> so<00:06:07.800> although<00:06:08.800> I'm

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
gristle part of it on it so although I'm

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.880 
gristle part of it on it so although I'm
not<00:06:09.070> doing<00:06:09.510> it<00:06:10.510> running<00:06:10.900> my<00:06:11.050> knife<00:06:11.230> blade

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
not doing it running my knife blade

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.630 
not doing it running my knife blade
that's<00:06:14.890> separating<00:06:15.580> it<00:06:15.960> you<00:06:16.960> can<00:06:17.170> kind<00:06:17.350> of

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
that's separating it you can kind of

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:25.440 
that's separating it you can kind of
don't<00:06:18.640> you<00:06:18.700> get<00:06:18.910> started<00:06:19.390> there<00:06:24.300> see<00:06:25.300> you

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
don't you get started there see you

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.750 
don't you get started there see you
right<00:06:25.600> here<00:06:25.630> where<00:06:25.930> I'm<00:06:26.050> peeling<00:06:26.290> it<00:06:26.590> down<00:06:26.770> I'm

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
right here where I'm peeling it down I'm

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.840 
right here where I'm peeling it down I'm
taking<00:06:27.940> a<00:06:28.180> flat<00:06:28.420> of<00:06:28.450> my<00:06:28.600> my<00:06:29.170> blade<00:06:29.500> and<00:06:29.890> running

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
taking a flat of my my blade and running

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.580 
taking a flat of my my blade and running
it<00:06:31.000> kind<00:06:31.690> of<00:06:31.830> scraping<00:06:32.830> it<00:06:34.260> working<00:06:35.260> it<00:06:35.380> back

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
it kind of scraping it working it back

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:45.480 
it kind of scraping it working it back
and<00:06:35.620> forth<00:06:40.980> in<00:06:41.980> between<00:06:42.070> the<00:06:42.520> meat
