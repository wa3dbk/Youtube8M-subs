00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
but again all you're trying to do is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.899 
but again all you're trying to do is
achieve<00:01:12.049> filling<00:01:13.049> any<00:01:13.200> holes<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.979> making

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
achieve filling any holes and making

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.410 
achieve filling any holes and making
sure<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.540> good<00:01:15.840> bond<00:01:17.420> this

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
sure that you have a good bond this

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.520 
sure that you have a good bond this
stuff<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.900> run<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:21.119> quite<00:01:21.530> quite

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
stuff can run it's actually quite quite

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.710 
stuff can run it's actually quite quite
viscous<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.220> moving<00:01:23.549> around<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.240> don't<00:01:24.540> be

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
viscous at moving around so don't be

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.609 
viscous at moving around so don't be
afraid<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:26.630> have<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> look<00:01:27.930> at<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> back<00:01:28.350> side

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
afraid to have a look at the back side

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.929 
afraid to have a look at the back side
make<00:01:28.890> sure<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.549> any<00:01:29.700> holes

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
make sure you don't have any holes

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.580 
make sure you don't have any holes
through<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> back<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.840> it'll<00:01:31.229> run<00:01:31.409> right

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
through the back because it'll run right

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.460 
through the back because it'll run right
through<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> back<00:01:32.220> side<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.670> well<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:34.200> can

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
through to the back side as well you can

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.230 
through to the back side as well you can
sand<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.189> although<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.759> quite<00:01:35.909> difficult

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
sand this although it's quite difficult

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
sand this although it's quite difficult
to<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:38.490> trick<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:40.020> make<00:01:40.170> sure<00:01:40.200> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
to do the trick is is to make sure that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.780 
to do the trick is is to make sure that
your<00:01:41.280> repair<00:01:42.619> does<00:01:43.619> all<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.070> filling<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
your repair does all the filling that it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.490 
your repair does all the filling that it
needs<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:46.549> before<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.640> begins<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.149> set<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.570> now

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
needs to before it begins to set up now

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.609 
getting close to the end of what I have
mixed<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:06.290> okay<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:08.929> with<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.110> we'll<00:02:10.379> try

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
mixed up okay and with this we'll try

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.530 
mixed up okay and with this we'll try
and<00:02:10.770> keep<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.039> as<00:02:11.190> neat<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.550> possible<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:12.300> you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and keep it as neat as possible but you

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.700 
and keep it as neat as possible but you
do<00:02:12.900> have<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.290> open

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
do have to open

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.120 
do have to open
crack<00:02:14.070> up<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:15.570> get<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.960> epoxy<00:02:16.590> into<00:02:16.830> it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
crack up and get the epoxy into it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.160 
crack up and get the epoxy into it
because<00:02:17.520> if<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> don't<00:02:17.970> get<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> epoxy<00:02:18.870> into

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
because if you don't get the epoxy into

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.220 
because if you don't get the epoxy into
the<00:02:19.260> crack<00:02:19.940> it's<00:02:20.940> gonna<00:02:21.300> sit<00:02:21.660> on<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.050> surface

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
the crack it's gonna sit on the surface

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.050 
the crack it's gonna sit on the surface
and<00:02:22.710> it's<00:02:22.830> not<00:02:23.040> gonna<00:02:23.280> do<00:02:23.490> anything

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
and it's not gonna do anything

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.540 
and it's not gonna do anything
so<00:02:24.450> open<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.110> up<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.560> let<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.740> go<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.160> there<00:02:26.370> and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
so open it up and let it go in there and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.320 
so open it up and let it go in there and
I'm<00:02:26.700> gonna<00:02:26.820> do<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> back<00:02:27.300> side<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:32.180> try<00:02:33.180> and

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
I'm gonna do the back side to try and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.090 
I'm gonna do the back side to try and
get<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.600> into<00:02:33.840> every<00:02:34.200> area<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.950> can

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
get it into every area that you can

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.880 
get it into every area that you can
reach<00:02:36.260> then<00:02:37.260> go<00:02:37.530> ahead<00:02:37.830> again<00:02:37.980> close<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.030> up

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
reach then go ahead again close it up

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.790 
reach then go ahead again close it up
once<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.100> closed<00:02:41.430> up<00:02:42.260> skinned<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.380> off<00:02:43.560> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
once it's closed up skinned it off the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.590 
once it's closed up skinned it off the
outside<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.880> don't<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.210> a<00:02:45.270> bunch

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
outside so that you don't have a bunch

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.140 
outside so that you don't have a bunch
of<00:02:45.750> lumps
