this collection was released to the Game
Boy<00:01:22.130> Advance<00:01:22.310> back<00:01:22.939> in<00:01:23.119> 2005<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.710> was<00:01:24.740> kind<00:01:25.310> of

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
Boy Advance back in 2005 it was kind of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.370 
Boy Advance back in 2005 it was kind of
slammed<00:01:25.700> by<00:01:25.969> critics<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.630> for<00:01:26.810> good<00:01:26.960> reason<00:01:27.319> I

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
slammed by critics and for good reason I

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.499 
slammed by critics and for good reason I
mean<00:01:27.499> these<00:01:27.679> games<00:01:27.920> are<00:01:28.100> classics<00:01:28.640> but<00:01:28.880> these

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
mean these games are classics but these

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.450 
mean these games are classics but these
are<00:01:29.689> not<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.079> classic<00:01:30.560> versions<00:01:31.009> these<00:01:31.310> are

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
are not the classic versions these are

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.309 
are not the classic versions these are
really<00:01:31.729> bad<00:01:31.909> ports<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.600> these<00:01:32.749> classics

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
really bad ports of these classics

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.080 
really bad ports of these classics
stripped<00:01:33.920> down<00:01:33.979> for<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.369> gameboy<00:01:34.729> advance

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
stripped down for the gameboy advance

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.809 
stripped down for the gameboy advance
and<00:01:35.329> with<00:01:35.630> inexplicably<00:01:36.560> bad<00:01:36.829> gameplay<00:01:37.399> like

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
and with inexplicably bad gameplay like

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.359 
and with inexplicably bad gameplay like
I<00:01:38.149> got<00:01:38.659> how<00:01:38.840> do<00:01:38.899> you<00:01:39.109> screw<00:01:39.380> up<00:01:39.469> paperboy<00:01:40.009> how's

I got how do you screw up paperboy how's

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.669 
I got how do you screw up paperboy how's
that<00:01:40.460> even<00:01:40.520> possible<00:01:41.319> anyway<00:01:42.319> let's<00:01:42.530> start

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
that even possible anyway let's start

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.859 
that even possible anyway let's start
with<00:01:42.979> rampage<00:01:43.460> since<00:01:43.999> that's<00:01:44.210> easily<00:01:44.569> the

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
with rampage since that's easily the

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.569 
with rampage since that's easily the
better<00:01:45.109> of<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.380> two<00:01:45.530> games<00:01:45.770> as<00:01:46.009> they've<00:01:46.399> been

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
better of the two games as they've been

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.849 
better of the two games as they've been
replicated<00:01:47.240> here<00:01:47.270> rampage<00:01:48.170> was<00:01:48.350> originally

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
replicated here rampage was originally

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.340 
replicated here rampage was originally
released<00:01:49.009> back<00:01:49.369> in<00:01:49.579> 1986<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.719> a<00:01:51.020> game<00:01:51.170> was<00:01:51.319> a

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
released back in 1986 and a game was a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.620 
released back in 1986 and a game was a
huge<00:01:51.560> success<00:01:51.999> destructible<00:01:52.999> environments

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
huge success destructible environments

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.539 
huge success destructible environments
was<00:01:53.780> an<00:01:53.899> exciting<00:01:54.289> concept<00:01:54.530> at<00:01:54.889> the<00:01:55.009> time<00:01:55.039> and

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
was an exciting concept at the time and

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.359 
was an exciting concept at the time and
also<00:01:55.999> unlike<00:01:56.899> a<00:01:57.079> lot<00:01:57.289> of<00:01:57.319> arcade<00:01:57.709> games<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.280> was

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
also unlike a lot of arcade games it was

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.949 
also unlike a lot of arcade games it was
actually<00:01:58.759> even<00:01:58.850> more<00:01:58.999> fun<00:01:59.359> with<00:01:59.479> multiplayer

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
actually even more fun with multiplayer

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.099 
actually even more fun with multiplayer
so<00:02:00.499> rampage<00:02:01.159> really<00:02:01.490> stood<00:02:01.729> out<00:02:01.789> in<00:02:02.030> 1986<00:02:02.840> and

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
so rampage really stood out in 1986 and

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.800 
so rampage really stood out in 1986 and
it<00:02:03.259> played<00:02:03.469> great<00:02:03.799> I<00:02:04.209> guess<00:02:05.209> it<00:02:05.389> stands<00:02:05.659> out

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
it played great I guess it stands out

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.889 
it played great I guess it stands out
here<00:02:06.109> since<00:02:06.560> paperboy<00:02:07.009> so<00:02:07.279> bad<00:02:07.490> but<00:02:07.899> it

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
here since paperboy so bad but it

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:20.520 
here since paperboy so bad but it
doesn't<00:02:08.929> play<00:02:09.410> great

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.840 

and<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.650> primary<00:02:21.950> problem<00:02:22.550> here<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.820> that

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
and the primary problem here is that

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.630 
and the primary problem here is that
these<00:02:23.630> games<00:02:23.840> were<00:02:24.050> really<00:02:24.770> compressed<00:02:25.340> for

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
these games were really compressed for

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.760 
these games were really compressed for
this<00:02:25.760> collection<00:02:26.060> Rampage<00:02:26.990> loses<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.470> lot<00:02:27.710> of

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
this collection Rampage loses a lot of

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.110 
this collection Rampage loses a lot of
graphical<00:02:28.340> detail<00:02:28.760> here

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120

not<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.480> mention<00:02:29.630> animation<00:02:30.350> movement<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.160> way

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
not to mention animation movement is way

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.460 
not to mention animation movement is way
choppier<00:02:32.270> than<00:02:32.420> its<00:02:32.570> supposed<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.930> be<00:02:33.110> which

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
choppier than its supposed to be which

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.990 
choppier than its supposed to be which
hasn't<00:02:33.680> effect<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> appearance<00:02:34.580> as<00:02:34.940> well

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
hasn't effect on the appearance as well

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.330
