00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
inconsistencies but if you just take it

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.700 
inconsistencies but if you just take it

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
into this alternate reality and

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.240 
into this alternate reality and
everybody's<00:02:54.989> blight<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.470> flipped<00:02:55.830> their

everybody's blight is flipped their
desires<00:02:56.610> are<00:02:56.880> flipped<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.959> basically<00:02:58.230> what

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
desires are flipped so basically what

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.960 
desires are flipped so basically what
now<00:02:58.530> she<00:02:58.590> wants<00:02:58.830> most<00:02:59.010> in<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> world<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.700> a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
because she hasn't had much use at all

realizes<00:03:52.620> like<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.970> horror<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.360> he<00:03:55.019> may<00:03:55.230> be

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
realizes like the horror that he may be

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.729 
realizes like the horror that he may be
the<00:03:55.410> hero<00:03:55.799> but<00:03:56.130> he's<00:03:56.280> still<00:03:56.640> alone<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.840> that's

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
the hero but he's still alone and that's

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.039 
the hero but he's still alone and that's
what<00:03:59.010> really<00:03:59.040> hit<00:03:59.430> home<00:03:59.670> the<00:04:00.209> animation<00:04:00.840> was

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
what really hit home the animation was

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.350 
what really hit home the animation was
actually<00:04:01.650> pretty<00:04:01.860> damn<00:04:02.100> good<00:04:02.340> obviously<00:04:03.269> it

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
actually pretty damn good obviously it

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.120 
actually pretty damn good obviously it
wasn't<00:04:03.480> as<00:04:03.660> high<00:04:03.870> as<00:04:03.930> I<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.650> could've<00:04:05.040> been

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
wasn't as high as I it could've been

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.430 
wasn't as high as I it could've been
because<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.090> good<00:04:06.720> movie<00:04:07.049> based<00:04:07.230> on<00:04:07.380> a

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
because it is a good movie based on a

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.190 
because it is a good movie based on a
series<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.180> it's<00:04:09.180> not<00:04:09.299> like<00:04:09.420> Evangelion

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
series and it's not like Evangelion

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.860
