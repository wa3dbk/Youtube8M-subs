00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.559
 how about friends how are they very good 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.599
 days of November of the year of 2014 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:11.969
 we are nowhere to reach 1400 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.620
 subscribers so I have to 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.560
 thank you all for the support 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.930
 unconditional that they have given us as well as 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.760
 all your good and bad comments we 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.070
 they help to try to improve 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.050
 in the same way thank diego said 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.119
 alva that sends us the update of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.490
 your aquarium previously had a 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.679
 aquarium of 110 liters and has taken the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.620
 decision to extend it and change it 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.840
 this 180- liter aquarium which 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.329
 it seems a correct decision since 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.940
 remember that the greater the amount of water 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.649
 lower will be the difficulty of 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.680
 maintenance of our species 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.480
 going to our friend's aquarium 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.899
 I can see three different species of 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.379
 angels one is coral angel beauty that is 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.960
 the one with orange and blue tones 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.059
 bicolor angel and the french angel can 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.120
 see two species of damsel damsel 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.340
 three bands and Australian damself as well 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.020
 like a yellow surgeon and a fish 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.000
 Picasso crossbow 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.429
 I can also see a butterfly fish that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 see a little stressed I have no more data 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:16.469
 so you would have to see if this fish 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.469
 just been introduced recently or 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:21.990
 well some fish is bothering you friends 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.939
 there will have to review this point has 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.710
 come the time to move to a 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.380
 next level in aquariums that 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.509
 we see so from now on with 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.390
 the videos that you send me I will try 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.819
 detect certain weak points like 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.189
 to comment on what is it 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.530
 what could we improve to have a 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.929
 good health in our fish the first 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.319
 Diego change that I would recommend would be 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:48.840
 zoom in on this fish tank so that 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.220
