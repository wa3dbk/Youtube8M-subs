going to slice our beef I like to put
the<00:00:36.030> beef<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.750> freezer<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.320> 30

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the beef in the freezer for about 30

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.010 
the beef in the freezer for about 30
minutes<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.610> makes<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.210> lot<00:00:39.420> easier<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
minutes this makes it a lot easier to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.040 
minutes this makes it a lot easier to
slice<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:41.129> when<00:00:41.340> slicing<00:00:41.610> beef<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.690> really

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
slice now when slicing beef it's really

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.020 
slice now when slicing beef it's really
important<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.739> actually<00:00:43.920> slice<00:00:44.430> across

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
important that you actually slice across

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.840 
important that you actually slice across
the<00:00:45.210> grain<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.500> ensures<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.250> really

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the grain this ensures that it's really

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.330 
the grain this ensures that it's really
tender<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.870> slice<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> grain<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
tender if you slice with the grain it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.520 
tender if you slice with the grain it
can<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.700> kind<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.059> stringy<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.690> kind<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.260> tough

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
can be kind of stringy and kind of tough

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.069

some white pepper I'm just gonna toss

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.789 
some white pepper I'm just gonna toss
this<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.759> combine<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.930> reason<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.380> use<00:01:22.530> white

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this to combine the reason you use white

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.950 
this to combine the reason you use white
pepper<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.430> Chinese<00:01:24.030> cooking<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.570> because

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
pepper in Chinese cooking is because

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
pepper in Chinese cooking is because
it's<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.530> more<00:01:26.040> subtle<00:01:26.280> taste<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> then<00:01:27.000> you

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it's a more subtle taste and then you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.149 
it's a more subtle taste and then you
don't<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:27.960> black<00:01:28.229> specks<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.829> your

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
don't have little black specks in your

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.280 
don't have little black specks in your
stir-fry<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.909> I'm<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.240> gonna<00:01:30.329> toss<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
stir-fry so I'm just gonna toss this to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.830 
stir-fry so I'm just gonna toss this to
coat<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:36.259> then<00:01:37.259> I'm<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.619> cover<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
coat and then I'm going to cover it and
