00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello in this video I show you is among the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.379
 four wheels just arrived right away for 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.870
 the elementary school 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.000
 this is the among the violet there is also 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.639
 available of me and I will also come to 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.389
 frozen and other spiderman characters for 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.760
 the boys 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.619
 I wanted to show a lot 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.380
 important aside go well 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.439
 the aesthetics of this very beautiful backpack 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.900
 very roomy and peculiarity ie 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.679
 than four wheels instead of the normal ones 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 two-wheeled trolley with trolley 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.719
 wheels are pivoting this vi 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.820
 will allow you to do this thing to be able 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.890
 remember the backpack completely and 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.350
 so today then transport it normally 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.070
 so between in corner or even being able to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.809
 walk with your backpack by your side 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.480
 seems a trivial thing but this is one 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.460
 very useful because it allows you to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.520
 take an escalator with a backpack 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.949
 next or to walk under the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.930
 rain under the umbrella keeping it 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.090
 backpack attached you then protected 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.070
 or if you are a mom you can bring it for 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.990
 hand your child and in the other hand 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.080
 sa and the backpack always at the end 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.119
 I always bring it to you without having a 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.170
 weight behind you but sell close to 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:23.900
 you next the handle is made of aluminum 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.380
 it is completely removable and disappears 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.540
 inside of 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.090
 let's see the backpack this is 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.200
 proposed for elementary school though 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 as a dimension and as an approach is an e 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 also excellent as hand luggage can 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.369
 go by plane calmly 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.360
 let's get a better look at the behind 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.030
 this zipper and the only one they take 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.579
 open that lately has a maneuver 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.920
 born in there are the shoulder straps for 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.040
 being able to wear it if you want by hooking it 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.810
 here also as a backpack the nice thing about 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.700
 these shoulder straps completely a 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.940
 disappearance is what I say for 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.570
 experience with other backpacks less 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.400
 of lesser quality that you do not have precisely 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.170
 he pretends that they therefore come down when 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.780
 you can the cart 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.970
 in this way you will not have laces or 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.430
 straps that crawl on the ground that 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.380
 they get dirty that they pierce themselves and get worn out 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.480
 9 over time so the backpack remains 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.970
 ordered and lasts over time 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.000
 let's turn the wheels are 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.960
 wonderfully soft then pocket 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.570
 front door in the diary door 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.000
 etc. as you can see the opening is total 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.490
 so you always see so much too 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.360
 hidden things the girls will not lose 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:45.020
 no main pocket too 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.090
 zipper is beautiful wide almost opens 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.980
 completely here you see the double 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.170
 function you have a buckle of 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.630
 containment that is suitable for holding i 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.670
 books always vertically and you also have 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:05.330
 a pocket you see that when you put 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.000
 books or things you wo n't like 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.250
 remains on the bottom disappearing in the moment 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.739
 in which you have to wear some 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.170
 clothes czar something else 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.090
 this one pulls out opens you can 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.610
 quietly use it as a briefcase 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.890
 fill it with clothes and then lock it with 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.570
 the buckle 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.570
 here it is the dimensions of this backpack 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.940
 they are about 47 centimeters therefore beautiful 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.790
 not at all great at a great 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.769
 21 cm thick a very thing 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.360
 important that I will not forget not me 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.860
 I will never forget to say it precisely because 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.709
 I have had many past experiences 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.430
 trolley for school have the 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.410
 very narrow trolley here and in front 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.840
 they have nice bags in the beautiful ones 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.090
 pocket to put money in pens 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.860
 to put these pockets in the snack 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.660
 they are too protruding often and 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.380
 gladly with the weight of the books of the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.900
 backpack come down and touch the ground which 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.540
 it means that dragging the backpack for 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.910
 vanilla this pocket rubs 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.380
 continually and eventually it holes 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.960
 instead in this case this problem 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.520
 there is no reason for precisely the wheels to be 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.960
 the rear body that the body 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.670
 front 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.110
 so this corner is completely 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.270
 safe 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.210
 the last thing then I greet you the front 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.800

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.100
 in addition to having an approach anyway 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.170
 in cute fashion and so on and even protected 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.580
 with is the part that is most exposed to 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.600
 rain then water anyway 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.090
 slips away and the backpack remains beautiful e 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.390
