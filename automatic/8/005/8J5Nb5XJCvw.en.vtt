00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 a secret recipe for old school and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.619
 i have to say it is really one of the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.980
 first streusel cake I know and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.430

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.719
 that no wifi part tastes me but 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.730
 that's exactly how it just tastes 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.039
 Let's have a look and have fun 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.039
 comments until then 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.309
 so our happiness cake 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:13.390
 First and foremost we need 250 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:13.390
 flour and another 250 grams of sugar 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:28.369
 there are now four eggs and 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:42.770
 last then a well-ripened 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:43.909
 Teaspoon baking powder so briefly 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.979
 envelope we get a nice 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.810
 lumpy pond and we give it now 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.810
 then on a well-oiled baking sheet 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.650
 The lime should not be too thick 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.300
 be applied to pass them 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.430
 Now the mass careful are still so 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.430
 really the whole is nicely covered 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.620
 that's how we have that too 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.470
 scaffold already finished we now 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.310
 actually only the sprinkles and around 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.540
 our chances to come 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.400
 250 grams of butter here in small 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.300
 i just know how to cut cubes 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.140
 take a look 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.320
 Generally, the production of bouquets 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.920
 yes, still a lot of manual labor 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.050
 So 250 grams of butter and these 250 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:09.170
 grams of butter now get another 200 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:13.660
 gram sugar to it and next to cuba for 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.660
 finish 400 grams of flour 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.150
 the whole is short dough hook with the 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.640
 stirred a bit and then with the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.200
 Hands continue to knead well the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.800
 handcrafted that means we are attacking 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.830
 into and connect possible to families 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.420
 mix really nice with the butter it 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.340
 quite a long process must there 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.340
 Of course we rent for a while 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.840
 a few more minutes 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.840
 if you have the butter well incorporated 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.160
 has in the flour and sugar 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.120
 then I have such a nice crumbly 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:01.790
 you can also share a bit 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:03.290
 firmly knead here easy and these are 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.890
 Now our roads and they are mine 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:11.750
 Now what our finished cake dough 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:15.110
 here is the beautiful in all forms 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:20.470
 ball outside and we'll get it now 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.470
 here simply generous and over the dough 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.380
 until the dough is really complete with 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.380
 sprinkles is covered 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:14.069
 so and now the whole cake goes why 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.539
 He is at 180 degrees for 25 minutes 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:21.229
 circulated in the stove and then we have 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:24.750

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.199
 ready but now comes the secret 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.360
 ingredient that makes the cake even finer 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.460
 and we just take normal 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.650
 whipped undefeated and gives the 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:43.949
 just her nice dick over the top 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:52.710
 streuselkuchen over it and then read the 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:53.699
 Cream still nice to move in the sun 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.080
 now attracts a still beautiful 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.150
