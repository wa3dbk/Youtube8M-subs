00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.349 
keyboard is stretched quite obviously
across<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.139> screen<00:04:15.349> and<00:04:15.940> it<00:04:16.940> could<00:04:17.120> do<00:04:17.269> it

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
across the screen and it could do it

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.759 
across the screen and it could do it
being<00:04:17.570> a<00:04:17.660> little<00:04:17.959> higher<00:04:18.199> up<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.470> screen

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
being a little higher up the screen

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.409 
being a little higher up the screen
maybe<00:04:19.010> just<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.180> wasn't<00:04:20.479> quite<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:20.810> thin

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
maybe just a so it wasn't quite so thin

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.510 
maybe just a so it wasn't quite so thin
you<00:04:23.419> can<00:04:23.570> also<00:04:23.719> type<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.800> way<00:04:25.010> around<00:04:25.130> and

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
you can also type this way around and

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.780 
you can also type this way around and
have

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
have

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.170 
have

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
in the portrait style which is equally

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.250 
in the portrait style which is equally
as<00:04:29.300> easy<00:04:29.510> to<00:04:29.840> do<00:04:30.220> but<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:32.390> s7<00:04:32.660> seems<00:04:32.990> quite

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
as easy to do but the s7 seems quite

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.290 
as easy to do but the s7 seems quite
nice<00:04:33.410> fair<00:04:33.830> enough<00:04:33.980> and<00:04:34.160> device<00:04:34.820> rather<00:04:35.120> the

nice fair enough and device rather the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.090 
nice fair enough and device rather the
tablet<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.840> found<00:04:36.320> that<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.530> screen<00:04:36.830> isn't

I mean it's not a slow only strip to the

I mean it's not a slow only strip to the
imagination<00:04:48.410> it's<00:04:48.740> just<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:48.950> orientation<00:04:49.580> of

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640
