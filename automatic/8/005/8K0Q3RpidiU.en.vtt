we<00:00:00.870> need<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.140> get<00:00:01.260> our<00:00:01.380> air<00:00:01.589> in<00:00:01.890> and<00:00:02.190> so<00:00:03.120> that<00:00:03.480> we

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
we need to get our air in and so that we

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.240 
we need to get our air in and so that we
can<00:00:03.689> carry<00:00:03.959> out<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.500> functions<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.130> the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
can carry out the functions of the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.980 
can carry out the functions of the
respiratory<00:00:05.730> system<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.299> we're<00:00:06.839> going<00:00:06.960> to

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
respiratory system and we're going to

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.110 
respiratory system and we're going to
start<00:00:07.350> out<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.980> upper<00:00:08.309> respiratory<00:00:08.490> tract

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
start out in the upper respiratory tract

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.390 
start out in the upper respiratory tract
from<00:00:09.780> here<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.290> out<00:00:10.469> we're<00:00:10.950> looking<00:00:11.280> at

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
from here on out we're looking at

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.640 
from here on out we're looking at
plumbing<00:00:11.849> we're<00:00:12.179> looking<00:00:12.509> at<00:00:12.719> structures

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
plumbing we're looking at structures

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.359 
plumbing we're looking at structures
that<00:00:15.020> influence<00:00:16.020> how<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.410> air<00:00:16.770> flows<00:00:17.340> through

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
that influence how the air flows through

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.769 
that influence how the air flows through
the<00:00:17.880> plumbing<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:20.359> even<00:00:21.359> though<00:00:21.539> there's

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the plumbing and so even though there's

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.450 
the plumbing and so even though there's
two<00:00:22.230> ways<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:22.920> get<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:24.560> we<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.800> get<00:00:25.980> into

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
two ways we can get in we can get into

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.429 
two ways we can get in we can get into
the<00:00:26.550> respiratory<00:00:26.849> system<00:00:27.210> through<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> mouth

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the respiratory system through the mouth

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.759 
the respiratory system through the mouth
and<00:00:28.830> into<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> oral<00:00:30.150> cavity<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.660> through<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and into the oral cavity or through the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.510 
and into the oral cavity or through the
external<00:00:32.340> Nerys<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.469> into<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> nasal<00:00:34.890> cavity

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
external Nerys and into the nasal cavity

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
external Nerys and into the nasal cavity
the<00:00:36.360> nasal<00:00:36.750> cavity<00:00:37.320> there<00:00:37.469> are<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> couple

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the nasal cavity there are a couple

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
the nasal cavity there are a couple
structures<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.700> want<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.270> be

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
structures in here that I want you to be

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.229 
structures in here that I want you to be
aware<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.629> first<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.730> actually

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
aware of first of all this is actually

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.950 
aware of first of all this is actually
skull<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.110> these<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.160> holes<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> skull

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
skull and these are holes in the skull

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.350 
skull and these are holes in the skull
bones<00:00:46.350> themselves<00:00:47.100> these<00:00:47.219> are<00:00:47.280> your<00:00:47.550> sinuses

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
bones themselves these are your sinuses

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.889 
bones themselves these are your sinuses
they're<00:00:49.079> called<00:00:49.289> paranasal<00:00:49.860> sinuses

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
they're called paranasal sinuses

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.010 
they're called paranasal sinuses
hopefully<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:53.160> half<00:00:53.520> head<00:00:53.910> prep<00:00:54.690> that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
hopefully we have a half head prep that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.049 
hopefully we have a half head prep that
we<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.410> look<00:00:55.559> at<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.100> examine<00:00:56.910> these

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
we can look at to examine these

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.020 
we can look at to examine these
different<00:00:57.510> structures<00:00:58.550> once<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.820> are<00:00:59.850> through

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
different structures once we are through

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.410 
different structures once we are through
the<00:01:00.719> external<00:01:01.140> Nerys<00:01:01.649> air<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.789> through<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the external Nerys air is through the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.840 
the external Nerys air is through the
external<00:01:03.809> Nerys<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.070> nasal<00:01:05.280> cavity

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
external Nerys and in the nasal cavity

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.170 
external Nerys and in the nasal cavity
remember<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.200> nasal<00:01:07.439> cavity<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.400> space

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
remember the nasal cavity is the space

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.210 
remember the nasal cavity is the space
that's<00:01:10.070> superior<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> hard<00:01:12.330> palate

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
that's superior to the hard palate

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
that's superior to the hard palate
you'll<00:01:14.220> notice<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.790> there<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.240> some<00:01:15.659> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you'll notice that there are some I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.780 
you'll notice that there are some I
don't<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.360> little<00:01:18.890> what<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.009> those<00:01:20.159> bumps

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
don't know little what are those bumps

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.280 
don't know little what are those bumps
they<00:01:21.659> are<00:01:21.840> bumps<00:01:22.259> these<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.100> actually

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
they are bumps these are actually

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.940 
they are bumps these are actually
epithelial<00:01:25.290> covered<00:01:26.810> pieces<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.990> skull<00:01:28.409> there

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
epithelial covered pieces of skull there

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.660 
epithelial covered pieces of skull there
bones<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.729> are<00:01:29.880> part<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:30.630> skull<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
bones that are part of your skull and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.890 
bones that are part of your skull and
make<00:01:32.670> sure<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> understand<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.659> this

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
make sure that you understand that this

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.920 
make sure that you understand that this
image<00:01:34.409> right<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:35.040> actually<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.930> sagittal

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
image right here is actually a sagittal

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.109 
image right here is actually a sagittal
section<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.520> midline<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
section down the midline it's a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.300 
section down the midline it's a
midsagittal<00:01:39.600> section<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.009> nasal

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
midsagittal section with the nasal

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.819 
midsagittal section with the nasal
septum<00:01:41.729> removed<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.649> actually

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
septum removed so that we can actually

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.780 
septum removed so that we can actually
see<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:45.090> truly<00:01:45.570> was<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.799> midsagittal

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
see this if it truly was a a midsagittal

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.899 
see this if it truly was a a midsagittal
cut<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.110> right<00:01:49.439> down<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.890> middle<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
cut we go right down the middle of the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.230 
cut we go right down the middle of the
nasal<00:01:51.119> septum<00:01:51.540> which<00:01:52.350> separates<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.700> left

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
nasal septum which separates the left

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.499 
nasal septum which separates the left
nostril<00:01:54.420> from<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> right<00:01:55.619> nostril<00:01:55.829> if<00:01:56.509> we

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
nostril from the right nostril if we

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.359 
nostril from the right nostril if we
remove<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.049> nasal<00:01:58.259> septum<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.189> look

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
remove the nasal septum then we can look

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.090 
remove the nasal septum then we can look
into<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.939> nasal<00:02:00.509> cavity<00:02:00.899> space<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.560> you'll

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
into that nasal cavity space and you'll

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.399 
into that nasal cavity space and you'll
see<00:02:02.369> these<00:02:02.579> bumps<00:02:03.060> these<00:02:03.540> guys<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:04.200> your

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
see these bumps these guys are your

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.190 
see these bumps these guys are your
nasal<00:02:04.770> Concha<00:02:06.439> nasal<00:02:07.789> Concha

and<00:02:10.520> when<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.879> cover<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.959> skull<00:02:13.379> you'll

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and when we cover this skull you'll

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.509 
and when we cover this skull you'll
learn<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.730> names<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.750> bones<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.680> lie

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
learn the names of the bones that lie

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.839 
learn the names of the bones that lie
beneath<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:19.019> epithelium<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.010> create<00:02:20.580> that

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
beneath the epithelium and create that

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.900 
beneath the epithelium and create that

the<00:05:23.340> auditory<00:05:23.970> tube<00:05:24.210> does<00:05:24.600> its<00:05:24.810> thing<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.740> if

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
the auditory tube does its thing and if

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.590 
the auditory tube does its thing and if
it<00:05:26.370> didn't<00:05:26.880> you<00:05:27.720> would<00:05:27.870> be<00:05:27.990> crying<00:05:28.440> right<00:05:29.100> now

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
it didn't you would be crying right now

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.930 
it didn't you would be crying right now
the<00:05:30.600> auditory<00:05:31.200> tube<00:05:31.290> is<00:05:31.740> what<00:05:32.130> helps<00:05:32.610> you

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
the auditory tube is what helps you

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.320 
the auditory tube is what helps you
equilibrate<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:34.470> pressure<00:05:35.010> in<00:05:35.460> your<00:05:35.520> ears

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
equilibrate the pressure in your ears

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.230 
equilibrate the pressure in your ears
when<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.140> change<00:05:37.710> okay<00:05:38.700> it<00:05:38.880> helps<00:05:39.150> you

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
when you change okay it helps you

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.960 
when you change okay it helps you
equilibrate<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:39.930> volume<00:05:40.740> of<00:05:41.010> gas<00:05:41.400> in<00:05:41.760> your

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
equilibrate the volume of gas in your

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.020 
equilibrate the volume of gas in your
middle<00:05:42.210> ear<00:05:42.660> when<00:05:43.500> you<00:05:43.650> change<00:05:44.100> elevation

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
middle ear when you change elevation

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.710 
middle ear when you change elevation
which<00:05:45.630> is<00:05:45.810> changing<00:05:46.380> atmospheric<00:05:46.980> pressure

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
which is changing atmospheric pressure

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.470 
which is changing atmospheric pressure
dude<00:05:48.720> really<00:05:49.110> yeah<00:05:49.770> because<00:05:50.730> you<00:05:50.880> have<00:05:51.000> air<00:05:51.270> in

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
dude really yeah because you have air in

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.660 
dude really yeah because you have air in
your<00:05:51.600> middle<00:05:51.780> ear<00:05:51.870> and<00:05:52.350> when<00:05:52.950> you<00:05:53.070> go<00:05:53.280> to<00:05:53.340> a

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
your middle ear and when you go to a

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.750 
your middle ear and when you go to a
higher<00:05:54.090> elevation<00:05:54.560> you<00:05:55.560> are<00:05:55.950> going<00:05:56.580> to<00:05:56.730> a

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
higher elevation you are going to a

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.840 
higher elevation you are going to a
low-pressure<00:05:57.720> environment<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.550> low

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
low-pressure environment and the low

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.710 
low-pressure environment and the low
pressure<00:06:00.620> when<00:06:01.620> a<00:06:01.830> gas<00:06:02.190> is<00:06:02.550> at<00:06:02.880> a<00:06:02.910> low<00:06:03.330> pressure

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
pressure when a gas is at a low pressure

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.490 
pressure when a gas is at a low pressure
it<00:06:04.080> actually<00:06:04.590> expands<00:06:05.400> its<00:06:05.820> volume<00:06:06.350> well<00:06:07.350> the

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
it actually expands its volume well the

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.770 
it actually expands its volume well the
gas<00:06:07.680> in<00:06:08.010> your<00:06:08.040> middle<00:06:08.370> ear<00:06:08.630> expands<00:06:09.630> its

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
gas in your middle ear expands its

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.150 
gas in your middle ear expands its
volume<00:06:10.170> and<00:06:10.290> it<00:06:10.410> pushes<00:06:10.620> against<00:06:11.070> the

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
volume and it pushes against the

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.100 
volume and it pushes against the
tympanic<00:06:11.700> membrane<00:06:12.180> it<00:06:12.420> pushes<00:06:12.720> against<00:06:13.050> the

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
tympanic membrane it pushes against the

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.850 
tympanic membrane it pushes against the
oval<00:06:13.440> window

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
oval window

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.040 
oval window
it's<00:06:14.430> like<00:06:14.640> expanding<00:06:15.450> in<00:06:15.600> your<00:06:15.810> middle<00:06:15.960> ear

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
it's like expanding in your middle ear

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.040 
it's like expanding in your middle ear
and<00:06:16.230> how's<00:06:16.560> that<00:06:16.590> feel<00:06:17.100> to<00:06:17.280> y'all<00:06:17.460> that<00:06:18.050> hurts

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
and how's that feel to y'all that hurts

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.020 
and how's that feel to y'all that hurts
that<00:06:19.410> done<00:06:20.310> hurt<00:06:21.120> and<00:06:21.450> if<00:06:22.050> it<00:06:22.200> hurts<00:06:22.850> you<00:06:23.850> don't

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
that done hurt and if it hurts you don't

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.880 
that done hurt and if it hurts you don't
like<00:06:24.180> that<00:06:24.390> so<00:06:24.750> what<00:06:24.900> do<00:06:24.960> you<00:06:25.050> do<00:06:25.200> you<00:06:25.680> go<00:06:25.800> like

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
like that so what do you do you go like

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.180 
like that so what do you do you go like
this<00:06:26.900> right<00:06:27.900> do<00:06:28.230> it<00:06:28.380> right<00:06:28.650> now<00:06:28.830> you<00:06:28.890> can

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
this right do it right now you can

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.520 
this right do it right now you can
totally<00:06:29.880> hear<00:06:30.330> your<00:06:30.990> auditory<00:06:31.710> tube<00:06:31.950> open<00:06:32.610> and

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
totally hear your auditory tube open and

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.399 
totally hear your auditory tube open and
when<00:06:34.530> it<00:06:34.650> opens<00:06:35.100> it<00:06:35.820> allows<00:06:36.390> ya

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
when it opens it allows ya

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.179 
when it opens it allows ya
to<00:06:37.679> go<00:06:37.800> in<00:06:38.009> or<00:06:38.459> out<00:06:38.489> if<00:06:38.999> you<00:06:39.749> go<00:06:40.289> to<00:06:40.349> a<00:06:40.619> higher

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:41.189 
to go in or out if you go to a higher

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:43.879 
to go in or out if you go to a higher
pressure<00:06:41.519> hard<00:06:42.419> for<00:06:42.629> us<00:06:42.749> at<00:06:42.959> sea<00:06:43.289> level<00:06:43.439> unless

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
pressure hard for us at sea level unless

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.879 
pressure hard for us at sea level unless
we<00:06:44.069> go<00:06:44.249> into<00:06:44.519> the<00:06:44.699> water<00:06:45.019> but<00:06:46.019> if<00:06:46.169> we<00:06:46.319> were<00:06:46.619> on

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:46.889 
we go into the water but if we were on

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.739 
we go into the water but if we were on
Mount<00:06:47.309> Everest<00:06:47.519> and<00:06:48.059> we<00:06:48.119> decided<00:06:48.419> to<00:06:48.539> come

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:48.749 
Mount Everest and we decided to come

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:52.909 
Mount Everest and we decided to come
down<00:06:49.139> then<00:06:50.009> as<00:06:50.309> the<00:06:50.819> pressure<00:06:51.059> increases<00:06:51.919> the

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
down then as the pressure increases the

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:56.239 
down then as the pressure increases the
gas<00:06:53.279> in<00:06:53.729> our<00:06:53.969> middle<00:06:54.569> ear<00:06:54.899> actually<00:06:55.379> shrinks

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:56.249 
gas in our middle ear actually shrinks

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.149 
gas in our middle ear actually shrinks
which<00:06:56.969> same<00:06:57.569> thing<00:06:57.839> happens<00:06:58.259> your<00:06:58.469> ears<00:06:58.769> start

00:06:59.149 --> 00:06:59.159 
which same thing happens your ears start

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:00.859 
which same thing happens your ears start
feeling<00:06:59.459> funky<00:06:59.729> because<00:07:00.239> there's<00:07:00.629> like

00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:00.869 
feeling funky because there's like

00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:03.769 
feeling funky because there's like
pressure<00:07:01.289> pushing<00:07:01.800> in<00:07:01.949> on<00:07:02.309> your<00:07:02.779> tympanic

00:07:03.769 --> 00:07:03.779 
pressure pushing in on your tympanic

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:07.939 
pressure pushing in on your tympanic
membrane<00:07:04.229> ow<00:07:04.379> and<00:07:05.099> so<00:07:05.789> all<00:07:05.939> you<00:07:06.029> have<00:07:06.149> to<00:07:06.179> do<00:07:06.949> is

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:07.949 
membrane ow and so all you have to do is

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:10.369 
membrane ow and so all you have to do is
pop<00:07:08.279> your<00:07:08.339> ears<00:07:08.789> right<00:07:09.419> that's<00:07:09.749> just<00:07:09.929> opening

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:10.379 
pop your ears right that's just opening

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.379 
pop your ears right that's just opening
auditory<00:07:10.889> tube<00:07:11.099> and<00:07:11.309> allowing<00:07:11.819> gas<00:07:12.089> to<00:07:12.300> go

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389 
auditory tube and allowing gas to go

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:13.129 
auditory tube and allowing gas to go
back<00:07:12.569> and<00:07:12.719> forth

laryngeal pharynx and we're going to

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:38.089 
laryngeal pharynx and we're going to
spend<00:07:36.059> the<00:07:36.239> next<00:07:36.479> entire<00:07:36.959> section<00:07:37.649> talking

spend the next entire section talking

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:43.489 
spend the next entire section talking
about<00:07:38.309> the<00:07:38.489> larynx<00:07:39.169> so<00:07:41.599> yeah<00:07:42.599> we<00:07:43.139> already<00:07:43.379> know

about the larynx so yeah we already know
what<00:07:43.649> pharynx<00:07:44.009> is<00:07:44.099> are<00:07:44.279> especially<00:07:44.849> the<00:07:45.119> fact

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 
what pharynx is are especially the fact

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.509 
what pharynx is are especially the fact
that<00:07:45.479> this<00:07:45.869> I'm<00:07:46.169> drawing<00:07:46.559> a<00:07:46.649> green<00:07:47.159> line

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:47.519 
that this I'm drawing a green line

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:50.719 
that this I'm drawing a green line
through<00:07:47.999> my<00:07:48.179> what<00:07:48.449> structure<00:07:48.839> is<00:07:48.959> that<00:07:49.729> it's

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:50.729 
through my what structure is that it's

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:52.069 
through my what structure is that it's
my<00:07:50.849> esophagus<00:07:51.149> clowns

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:52.079 
my esophagus clowns

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:55.969 
my esophagus clowns
so<00:07:52.800> our<00:07:53.669> esophagus<00:07:54.479> you<00:07:54.809> can<00:07:55.110> send<00:07:55.469> air<00:07:55.769> down

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:55.979 
so our esophagus you can send air down

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:57.589 
so our esophagus you can send air down
your<00:07:56.159> esophagus<00:07:56.339> but<00:07:56.849> let's<00:07:57.029> not<00:07:57.240> because

00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599

00:07:59.419 --> 00:07:59.429 
there's an ax being a gas exchange that

00:07:59.429 --> 00:08:03.040 
there's an ax being a gas exchange that
occurs<00:07:59.729> there<00:08:00.029> there<00:08:00.659> will<00:08:00.869> be<00:08:00.899> only<00:08:01.369> belching

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.050 
occurs there there will be only belching

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.379 
occurs there there will be only belching
all<00:08:04.050> right<00:08:04.259> very<00:08:04.559> cool<00:08:05.089> is<00:08:06.089> there<00:08:06.239> anything

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 
let's move on to the larynx

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.999 
let's move on to the larynx
which<00:08:11.489> will<00:08:11.669> explain<00:08:12.089> how<00:08:12.449> and<00:08:12.839> why<00:08:13.019> you<00:08:13.829> can

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:14.009 
which will explain how and why you can

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:18.769 
which will explain how and why you can
hear<00:08:14.279> me<00:08:14.399> know<00:08:14.789> I<00:08:15.059> can<00:08:15.629> make<00:08:15.809> sound<00:08:16.110> right<00:08:16.589> now
