Pokemon<00:01:58.600> on<00:01:58.720> my<00:01:58.900> part<00:01:59.260> because<00:01:59.530> this<00:01:59.650> thing<00:01:59.860> is

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
Pokemon on my part because this thing is

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.350 
Pokemon on my part because this thing is
steel<00:02:00.729> fairy<00:02:01.360> if<00:02:01.570> I<00:02:01.659> do<00:02:01.720> recall<00:02:01.900> correctly<00:02:03.360> so

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
steel fairy if I do recall correctly so

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.180 
steel fairy if I do recall correctly so
poison<00:02:04.869> jab<00:02:05.050> won't<00:02:05.350> do<00:02:05.470> anything<00:02:05.830> against<00:02:06.070> it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
poison jab won't do anything against it

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.880 
poison jab won't do anything against it
because<00:02:06.400> it's<00:02:06.520> steel<00:02:06.759> type<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.890> then

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
because it's steel type and then

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.710 
because it's steel type and then
everything<00:02:09.369> else<00:02:09.459> is<00:02:09.850> going<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.060> be<00:02:10.149> somewhat

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
everything else is going to be somewhat

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.040 
everything else is going to be somewhat
resisted<00:02:11.320> so<00:02:11.770> fire<00:02:12.670> type<00:02:13.030> tacks<00:02:13.540> are<00:02:13.840> your

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
resisted so fire type tacks are your

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.460 
resisted so fire type tacks are your
best<00:02:14.350> bet<00:02:14.530> against<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.100> thing<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:16.660> don't<00:02:17.410> know

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470

I don't really have anything for it who

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.290 
I don't really have anything for it who

that is a very type attack and it hits
pretty<00:02:38.110> hard<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.800> think<00:02:39.010> it's<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.310> tea<00:02:39.370> power

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
pretty hard I think it's a tea power

there we go

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.940 
there we go
all<00:04:39.430> right<00:04:39.640> proba<00:04:40.120> pass<00:04:40.330> huh<00:04:40.660> so<00:04:41.620> this<00:04:41.740> is<00:04:41.920> a

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
all right proba pass huh so this is a

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.940

I<00:04:46.920> think<00:04:47.920> greninja<00:04:48.190> should<00:04:48.550> do<00:04:48.670> pretty<00:04:48.940> well

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
I think greninja should do pretty well

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.540 
I think greninja should do pretty well
here<00:04:49.600> because<00:04:49.720> remember<00:04:50.250> steel<00:04:51.250> does<00:04:51.520> not

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
here because remember steel does not

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.100 
here because remember steel does not
resist<00:04:52.240> either<00:04:52.510> electric<00:04:53.080> or<00:04:54.240> water<00:04:55.240> for<00:04:56.020> that

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
resist either electric or water for that

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.930 
resist either electric or water for that
matter<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:56.560> doesn't<00:04:56.740> really<00:04:57.100> resist<00:04:57.460> ghosts

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
matter it doesn't really resist ghosts

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.670
