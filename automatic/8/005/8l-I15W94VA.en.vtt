day I love it but I did switch up my
night<00:02:47.640> cream<00:02:48.209> because<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.990> actually<00:02:49.260> never

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
night cream because I actually never

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.979

used<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.430> separate<00:02:50.820> moisturizer<00:02:51.239> for<00:02:51.570> night<00:02:51.780> I

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
used a separate moisturizer for night I

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.240 
used a separate moisturizer for night I
thought<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.260> was<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.620> too<00:02:52.800> young<00:02:52.980> for<00:02:53.220> that

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
thought I was just too young for that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.510 
thought I was just too young for that
but<00:02:54.350> after<00:02:55.350> talking<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.739> my<00:02:55.860> mom<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.250> kind<00:02:56.489> of

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
but after talking to my mom I kind of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.520 
but after talking to my mom I kind of
got<00:02:56.670> freaked<00:02:56.910> out<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.480> started<00:02:58.140> using

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
got freaked out and started using

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.949 
got freaked out and started using
preventive<00:02:59.250> stuff<00:02:59.489> it's<00:03:00.390> been<00:03:00.690> working

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
preventive stuff it's been working

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.350 
preventive stuff it's been working
really<00:03:01.110> well<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.950> I've<00:03:02.430> been<00:03:02.580> noticing<00:03:02.940> just

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
really well and I've been noticing just

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.290 
really well and I've been noticing just
my<00:03:03.510> skin's<00:03:03.780> been<00:03:04.020> really<00:03:04.620> smooth<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.489> not

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
my skin's been really smooth and not

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.720 
my skin's been really smooth and not
that<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.540> had<00:03:06.750> wrinkles<00:03:06.989> before<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.370> just

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
that I had wrinkles before but I just

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640 
that I had wrinkles before but I just
felt<00:03:08.850> like<00:03:08.970> my<00:03:09.239> skin<00:03:09.480> was<00:03:09.540> tighter<00:03:09.930> oh<00:03:10.230> my

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
felt like my skin was tighter oh my

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.050 
felt like my skin was tighter oh my
that's<00:03:10.920> even<00:03:11.160> possible<00:03:11.190> maybe<00:03:11.730> I'm<00:03:11.880> imagining

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
that's even possible maybe I'm imagining

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.280 
that's even possible maybe I'm imagining
it<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:12.989> this<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.410> what<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> use<00:03:14.030> neutrogena

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
it but this is what I use neutrogena

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.979 
it but this is what I use neutrogena
ageless<00:03:16.290> essentials<00:03:16.530> night<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.780> it's<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
ageless essentials night and it's the

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.900 
ageless essentials night and it's the
continuous<00:03:19.590> hydration<00:03:20.010> cream<00:03:20.310> there's

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
continuous hydration cream there's

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.270 
continuous hydration cream there's
actually<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.810> guess<00:03:22.110> if<00:03:22.260> you're<00:03:22.380> older<00:03:22.830> there's

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
actually I guess if you're older there's

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.430 
actually I guess if you're older there's
an<00:03:23.610> ageless<00:03:23.910> line<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.480> has<00:03:24.630> retinol<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.290> it

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
an ageless line that has retinol in it

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.770 
an ageless line that has retinol in it
and<00:03:25.650> retinol<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.549> actually<00:03:27.030> really<00:03:27.209> expensive

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
and retinol is actually really expensive

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.940 
and retinol is actually really expensive
if<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.560> look<00:03:28.799> at<00:03:29.040> um<00:03:29.340> designer<00:03:30.500> skincare<00:03:31.500> and

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
same skin like whatever well first of

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.229 
same skin like whatever well first of
all<00:03:49.560> at<00:03:49.769> night<00:03:50.190> that's<00:03:50.580> when<00:03:50.760> you're<00:03:51.030> at

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
all at night that's when you're at

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.640 
all at night that's when you're at
breast<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.840> that's<00:03:52.110> when<00:03:52.320> your<00:03:52.440> skin

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
breast and that's when your skin

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.770 
breast and that's when your skin
regenerates<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.670> that's<00:03:54.030> when<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.450> want<00:03:54.660> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
regenerates so that's when you want to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.620 
regenerates so that's when you want to
give<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.110> most<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:56.040> guess<00:03:56.670> like<00:03:56.850> nutrients

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
give it the most I guess like nutrients

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.270 
give it the most I guess like nutrients
