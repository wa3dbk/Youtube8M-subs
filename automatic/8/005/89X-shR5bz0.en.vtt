and if not you can always just fill in
the<00:01:23.670> little<00:01:23.820> gaps<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.570> pen<00:01:24.810> or<00:01:24.990> pencil

next all you're going to do is just cut
out<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:30.030> circle<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:30.990> pretty

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
out this circle and that's pretty

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.880 
out this circle and that's pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:33.500> once<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.800> your

circle cut out you're just going to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.120 
circle cut out you're just going to
measure<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> fits<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.950> lid<00:01:38.100> of

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
measure and see if it fits on the lid of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.620 
measure and see if it fits on the lid of
the<00:01:38.220> jar<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.790> totally<00:01:39.180> fine<00:01:39.330> if<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the jar and it's totally fine if it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.870 
the jar and it's totally fine if it
doesn't<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.530> always<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.310> trim<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
doesn't you can always just trim the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.190 
doesn't you can always just trim the
circle<00:01:42.240> until<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:43.080> fits<00:01:43.290> nicely<00:01:48.049> next<00:01:49.049> you're

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
circle until it fits nicely next you're

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.990 
circle until it fits nicely next you're
going<00:01:49.289> to<00:01:49.350> need<00:01:49.440> some<00:01:50.039> color<00:01:50.310> markers<00:01:50.820> I'm

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.359 
going to need some color markers I'm
using<00:01:51.330> green<00:01:51.960> sharpie<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.920> think<00:01:53.250> it

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
using green sharpie because I think it

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.999 
using green sharpie because I think it
goes<00:01:53.550> well<00:01:53.940> with<00:01:54.149> my<00:01:54.179> color<00:01:54.539> scheme<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.170> so

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
goes well with my color scheme and so

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
goes well with my color scheme and so
I'm<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.220> using<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.550> pencil<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.149> sketch<00:01:57.179> out

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
I'm just using a pencil to sketch out

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.990 
I'm just using a pencil to sketch out
the<00:01:57.720> words<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.440> want<00:01:58.679> on<00:01:58.830> my<00:01:58.950> lid<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.460> what

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the words that I want on my lid and what

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.180 
the words that I want on my lid and what
I<00:02:00.149> chose<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.840> pamper<00:02:01.350> yourself<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:02.069> I

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
I chose was pamper yourself because I

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.570 
I chose was pamper yourself because I
think<00:02:02.250> that's<00:02:02.550> perfect<00:02:02.940> for<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.149> pamper<00:02:03.569> jar<00:02:04.580> so

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
think that's perfect for a pamper jar so

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.910 
think that's perfect for a pamper jar so
now<00:02:05.789> all<00:02:06.000> I'm<00:02:06.119> doing<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.539> going<00:02:07.170> over<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
now all I'm doing is going over the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.040 
now all I'm doing is going over the
sketched<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.519> words<00:02:08.850> with<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.660> light<00:02:09.840> green

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
sketched out words with a light green

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.990 
sketched out words with a light green
sharpie<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:11.250> always<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:11.700> choose

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
sharpie and you can always just choose

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.120 
sharpie and you can always just choose
any<00:02:12.209> color<00:02:12.630> or<00:02:12.870> any<00:02:13.080> different<00:02:13.620> kind<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.890> paper

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
any color or any different kind of paper

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.790 
any color or any different kind of paper
or<00:02:14.459> any<00:02:14.670> phrase<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.350> what<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> chose

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
or any phrase but this is what I chose

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.610 
or any phrase but this is what I chose
to<00:02:16.920> do<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.280> mine

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.630 

once<00:02:23.620> you're<00:02:23.799> done<00:02:23.950> with<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.189> little<00:02:24.459> label

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
once you're done with this little label

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.789 
once you're done with this little label
you're<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.180> going<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.480> use<00:02:25.780> liquid<00:02:26.140> glue<00:02:26.349> I'm

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
you're just going to use liquid glue I'm

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.069 
you're just going to use liquid glue I'm
using<00:02:26.980> Elmer's<00:02:27.340> glue<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:27.970> just<00:02:28.060> painting<00:02:28.989> it

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
using Elmer's glue and just painting it

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.780 
using Elmer's glue and just painting it
on<00:02:29.140> with<00:02:29.319> my<00:02:29.409> paintbrush<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.159> you<00:02:30.370> want<00:02:30.579> to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
on with my paintbrush and you want to

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.850 
on with my paintbrush and you want to
have<00:02:30.939> a<00:02:31.150> light<00:02:31.510> coat<00:02:31.840> but<00:02:32.110> at<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.379> same<00:02:32.590> time

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
have a light coat but at the same time

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:43.890 
have a light coat but at the same time
you<00:02:33.400> don't<00:02:33.579> want<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.909> leave<00:02:34.060> any<00:02:34.299> space<00:02:34.780> bear

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.240 

so<00:02:44.900> once<00:02:45.109> you're<00:02:45.260> done<00:02:45.290> coating<00:02:45.859> the<00:02:45.950> lid<00:02:46.129> in

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
so once you're done coating the lid in

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.380 
so once you're done coating the lid in
glue<00:02:46.459> you're<00:02:46.640> just<00:02:46.760> going<00:02:46.879> to<00:02:46.909> figure<00:02:47.090> out

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
glue you're just going to figure out

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.089 
glue you're just going to figure out
where<00:02:47.629> you<00:02:47.780> want<00:02:47.810> your<00:02:48.049> letters<00:02:48.409> to<00:02:48.439> be<00:02:48.650> facing

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
where you want your letters to be facing

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.209 
where you want your letters to be facing
so<00:02:49.280> that's<00:02:49.489> what<00:02:49.640> I'm<00:02:49.730> doing<00:02:49.939> right<00:02:50.150> now<00:02:50.209> and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:51.219 
so that's what I'm doing right now and

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.369 
so that's what I'm doing right now and
once<00:02:52.219> I<00:02:52.430> figure<00:02:52.879> that<00:02:53.060> out<00:02:53.299> I'm<00:02:53.510> just<00:02:53.569> going<00:02:54.049> to

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
once I figure that out I'm just going to

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.589 
once I figure that out I'm just going to
place<00:02:54.859> the<00:02:55.159> label<00:02:55.310> down<00:02:55.640> on<00:02:55.879> top<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.420> glue

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
place the label down on top of the glue

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.380 
place the label down on top of the glue
and<00:02:56.870> Pat<00:02:57.109> it<00:02:57.230> down<00:02:57.379> softly<00:02:58.159> making<00:02:58.609> sure<00:02:58.879> that

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
and Pat it down softly making sure that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.059 
and Pat it down softly making sure that
there<00:02:59.599> are<00:02:59.689> no<00:02:59.870> wrinkles<00:03:00.079> in<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.439> paper<00:03:00.650> but

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
there are no wrinkles in the paper but

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.170 
there are no wrinkles in the paper but
at<00:03:01.189> the<00:03:01.280> same<00:03:01.430> time<00:03:01.609> you<00:03:01.730> want<00:03:01.819> to<00:03:01.909> press<00:03:02.150> down

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
at the same time you want to press down

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.929 
at the same time you want to press down
hard<00:03:02.750> enough<00:03:02.810> so<00:03:03.019> that<00:03:03.319> it<00:03:03.739> actually<00:03:04.220> sticks

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
hard enough so that it actually sticks

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:13.420 
hard enough so that it actually sticks
to<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.390> lid<00:03:05.569> of<00:03:05.689> the<00:03:05.720> jar<00:03:11.799> so<00:03:12.799> that<00:03:12.829> is<00:03:13.189> just

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
to the lid of the jar so that is just

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.679 
to the lid of the jar so that is just
how<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.609> label<00:03:13.970> looks<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.329> I<00:03:14.359> think<00:03:14.540> it's<00:03:14.659> a

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
how the label looks and I think it's a

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.210 
how the label looks and I think it's a
really<00:03:15.019> cute<00:03:15.200> addition<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.799> gift<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.189> think

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
really cute addition to the gift I think

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.190 
really cute addition to the gift I think
it<00:03:16.519> spices<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.120> up<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.389> little<00:03:17.540> bit<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.959> makes

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
it spices that up a little bit and makes

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.740 
it spices that up a little bit and makes
it<00:03:18.349> a<00:03:18.409> little<00:03:18.620> bit<00:03:18.799> more<00:03:18.950> personal<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:20.150> then<00:03:20.720> I

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
it a little bit more personal so then I

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.869 
it a little bit more personal so then I
am<00:03:21.109> just<00:03:21.260> adding<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.829> thin<00:03:22.129> layer<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.730> the

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
am just adding a thin layer of the

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.509 
am just adding a thin layer of the
Elmer's<00:03:23.239> glue<00:03:23.540> on<00:03:23.780> top<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.379> it<00:03:24.530> making<00:03:25.129> sure

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
Elmer's glue on top of it making sure

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.059 
Elmer's glue on top of it making sure
that<00:03:25.849> the<00:03:26.060> Sharpie<00:03:26.419> has<00:03:26.599> already<00:03:27.019> dried<00:03:27.590> for<00:03:28.040> a

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
that the Sharpie has already dried for a

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.909 
that the Sharpie has already dried for a
little<00:03:28.310> bit<00:03:31.269> so<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.780> just<00:03:33.169> seals<00:03:33.409> it<00:03:33.590> off<00:03:33.680> and

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
little bit so that just seals it off and

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.289 
little bit so that just seals it off and
makes<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.159> look<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.400> little<00:03:34.579> bit<00:03:34.790> more<00:03:35.000> polished

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
makes it look a little bit more polished

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.300 
makes it look a little bit more polished
and<00:03:35.689> then<00:03:36.409> you're<00:03:36.590> just<00:03:36.680> going<00:03:36.859> to<00:03:36.919> let<00:03:37.069> it<00:03:37.099> dry

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
and then you're just going to let it dry

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.339 
and then you're just going to let it dry
I'm<00:03:37.639> opening<00:03:38.150> mine<00:03:38.359> up<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.840> let<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.109> dry<00:03:39.319> so

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
I'm opening mine up to let it dry so

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.229 
I'm opening mine up to let it dry so
that<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.709> can<00:03:39.919> put<00:03:40.129> in<00:03:40.280> my<00:03:40.430> goodies<00:03:40.819> but<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.120> can

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
that I can put in my goodies but you can

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.720 
that I can put in my goodies but you can
always<00:03:41.389> just<00:03:41.629> set<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.870> aside<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:43.310> first<00:03:43.519> thing

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
always just set it aside the first thing

looked<00:05:28.900> really<00:05:29.260> good<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:29.889> all<00:05:30.280> filled<00:05:30.639> up<00:05:30.880> but

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
looked really good and all filled up but

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.270 
looked really good and all filled up but
at<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:31.810> same<00:05:31.990> time<00:05:32.229> not<00:05:32.919> too<00:05:33.190> crammed<00:05:33.610> so<00:05:35.280> next

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
at the same time not too crammed so next

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.219 
at the same time not too crammed so next
it's<00:05:36.490> time<00:05:36.520> for<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:36.850> bow<00:05:37.090> and<00:05:37.360> you're<00:05:37.960> going

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
it's time for the bow and you're going

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.840 
it's time for the bow and you're going
to<00:05:38.260> need<00:05:38.440> some<00:05:38.680> ribbon<00:05:38.950> so<00:05:39.160> I<00:05:39.190> decided<00:05:39.610> to<00:05:39.729> go

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
to need some ribbon so I decided to go

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.580 
to need some ribbon so I decided to go
with<00:05:39.880> gold<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.450> can<00:05:40.600> go<00:05:40.720> with<00:05:40.810> any<00:05:40.990> color<00:05:41.110> but

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
with gold you can go with any color but

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.870 
with gold you can go with any color but
I<00:05:41.650> just<00:05:41.889> thought<00:05:42.040> this<00:05:42.250> went<00:05:42.400> well<00:05:42.610> with<00:05:42.760> my

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
I just thought this went well with my

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.490 
I just thought this went well with my
green<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.210> blue<00:05:43.479> color<00:05:43.750> scheme<00:05:43.960> that<00:05:44.260> I<00:05:44.289> have

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
green and blue color scheme that I have

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.460 
green and blue color scheme that I have
going<00:05:44.860> on<00:05:45.010> and<00:05:45.280> you're<00:05:46.120> going<00:05:46.270> to<00:05:46.330> want<00:05:46.570> to<00:05:46.960> cut

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
going on and you're going to want to cut

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.620 
going on and you're going to want to cut
off<00:05:47.710> your<00:05:47.950> ribbon<00:05:48.250> with<00:05:48.520> a<00:05:48.700> lot<00:05:49.000> of<00:05:49.180> spare

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
off your ribbon with a lot of spare

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.990 
off your ribbon with a lot of spare
ribbon<00:05:50.080> because<00:05:50.800> you<00:05:50.919> will<00:05:51.039> always<00:05:51.550> need<00:05:51.729> more

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
ribbon because you will always need more

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.520 
ribbon because you will always need more
than<00:05:52.240> you<00:05:52.360> think<00:05:52.539> to<00:05:52.750> make<00:05:52.780> a<00:05:52.930> bow

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.590 

so<00:06:02.530> now<00:06:02.800> I'm<00:06:03.010> just<00:06:03.280> tying<00:06:03.700> a<00:06:03.910> really<00:06:04.360> tight

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
so now I'm just tying a really tight

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.629 
so now I'm just tying a really tight
knot<00:06:04.840> to<00:06:05.050> make<00:06:05.169> sure<00:06:05.410> that<00:06:05.620> it<00:06:05.800> doesn't<00:06:06.130> slip

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
knot to make sure that it doesn't slip

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.720 
knot to make sure that it doesn't slip
off<00:06:06.880> or<00:06:07.210> get<00:06:07.419> too<00:06:07.600> loose<00:06:07.870> and<00:06:08.250> then<00:06:09.250> I'm<00:06:09.550> just

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
off or get too loose and then I'm just

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:23.900 
off or get too loose and then I'm just
going<00:06:09.940> to<00:06:10.030> start<00:06:10.330> making<00:06:10.630> a<00:06:11.050> simple<00:06:12.010> bow

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.249 

so<00:06:24.910> once<00:06:25.120> you've<00:06:25.270> adjusted<00:06:25.389> your<00:06:25.750> bow<00:06:25.960> to<00:06:26.020> the

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
so once you've adjusted your bow to the

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.110 
so once you've adjusted your bow to the
size<00:06:26.470> and<00:06:26.500> shape<00:06:26.740> that<00:06:26.889> you<00:06:27.160> like<00:06:27.400> you're<00:06:27.970> just

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
size and shape that you like you're just

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.610 
size and shape that you like you're just
going<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:28.300> cut<00:06:28.539> off<00:06:28.629> the<00:06:28.810> extra<00:06:29.110> ends<00:06:29.349> of<00:06:29.530> the

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
going to cut off the extra ends of the

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.010 
going to cut off the extra ends of the
ribbon<00:06:29.949> and<00:06:30.160> I<00:06:30.460> am<00:06:30.759> just<00:06:31.000> cutting<00:06:31.389> a<00:06:31.539> diagonal

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
ribbon and I am just cutting a diagonal

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.360 
ribbon and I am just cutting a diagonal
cut<00:06:32.530> across<00:06:33.280> the<00:06:33.490> end<00:06:33.639> of<00:06:33.759> my<00:06:33.879> ribbon<00:06:35.370> tada

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
cut across the end of my ribbon tada

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.369 
cut across the end of my ribbon tada
that<00:06:36.879> is<00:06:37.060> the<00:06:37.240> finished<00:06:37.539> product<00:06:37.960> and<00:06:38.110> I<00:06:38.349> think

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:38.379 
that is the finished product and I think

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:40.080 
that is the finished product and I think
this<00:06:38.650> is<00:06:38.770> a<00:06:38.800> really<00:06:39.159> great<00:06:39.250> gift<00:06:39.490> because<00:06:39.940> it

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
this is a really great gift because it

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.270 
this is a really great gift because it
can<00:06:40.509> be<00:06:40.629> super<00:06:41.080> inexpensive<00:06:41.349> but<00:06:41.860> also<00:06:42.069> you

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
can be super inexpensive but also you

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.950 
can be super inexpensive but also you
can<00:06:42.520> customize<00:06:42.729> it<00:06:43.240> and<00:06:43.360> make<00:06:43.419> it<00:06:43.629> really

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
can customize it and make it really

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.740 
can customize it and make it really
personal<00:06:44.590> and<00:06:44.740> I<00:06:44.970> think<00:06:45.970> that<00:06:46.210> it's<00:06:46.389> just<00:06:46.509> a

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
or and pretty much anybody I guess you

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:02.850 
or and pretty much anybody I guess you
could<00:07:01.659> make<00:07:01.840> one<00:07:01.960> for<00:07:02.139> a<00:07:02.169> guy<00:07:02.289> too<00:07:02.349> but<00:07:02.590> you'd

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
could make one for a guy too but you'd

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.439 
could make one for a guy too but you'd
have<00:07:02.889> to<00:07:03.039> substitute<00:07:03.699> a<00:07:03.970> few<00:07:04.150> of<00:07:04.240> the<00:07:04.330> things

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
have to substitute a few of the things

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:06.120 
have to substitute a few of the things
in<00:07:04.720> here<00:07:04.750> but<00:07:05.319> I<00:07:05.349> think<00:07:05.620> it's<00:07:05.710> a<00:07:05.770> really<00:07:05.949> good

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
in here but I think it's a really good

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.950 
in here but I think it's a really good
idea<00:07:06.400> for<00:07:06.460> a<00:07:06.849> Christmas<00:07:06.909> gift<00:07:07.419> and<00:07:07.539> it's<00:07:07.690> super

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 
idea for a Christmas gift and it's super

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.110 
idea for a Christmas gift and it's super
inexpensive<00:07:08.169> this<00:07:08.979> whole<00:07:09.280> thing<00:07:09.520> cost<00:07:09.970> me

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
inexpensive this whole thing cost me

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.540 
inexpensive this whole thing cost me
under<00:07:10.479> $20<00:07:11.139> so<00:07:11.530> I<00:07:11.560> was<00:07:11.860> really<00:07:12.190> happy<00:07:12.370> about

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
under $20 so I was really happy about

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.219 
under $20 so I was really happy about
that<00:07:12.909> and<00:07:13.120> I<00:07:13.180> wanted<00:07:13.419> to<00:07:13.539> share<00:07:13.780> with<00:07:13.930> you<00:07:13.990> guys
