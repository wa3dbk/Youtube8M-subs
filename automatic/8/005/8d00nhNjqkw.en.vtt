00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.080
 From Walter Jackson 80 to 4 90 VW built the culprit a syncope that was one 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.800
 Mixture of SUV and VW bus but about 6000 Mark more expensive than one 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.620
 normal bully and that was probably the reason that bought the car almost no one 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.360
 has only 43,000 Synchro VW has built and that's why he is a real today 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.070
 Object of desire a small fanatical community goes with the Allradler 3 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.250
 still to the limit and sometimes a bit further 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.239
 when Andreas Lidl leaves the house early in Pale 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.409
 it's only about 1 

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.670
 a tour with his VW t3 syncro 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.950
 for the electrician, the car is simply the means of transportation 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 than just to go from pastor to b 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.230
 because hardly any other vehicle offers search 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.080
 many options remained the big Volkswagen 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.860
 the noise of the vehicles and the windows in one 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.610
 affordable 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.220
 And this robustness keeps real Simko riders out in close quarters 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.230
 Andreas Lidl literally rushes his bus over the forest 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.020
 this versatility gave VW a solid fan-community 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.250
 the city powerful SUV rather drives the minibus 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.979
 because even with the usual synchro Viva can drive everything 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.120
 So there's a big barrier over almost everything here 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.630
 so procured was not yet again 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.630
 no problem she does not just see way 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.200
 said and done 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.529
 for a bad luck of the terrain professional also has everything 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.689
 the heavy train applies just in case 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.580
 the fast laid around the tree 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.580
 and the goalie can show what's in them 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.110
 it is difficult to block your way around 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.830
 Ambri ass as a way car has also been some hard kicking in these hairs 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.279
 behind him 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.200
 The 36-year-old was already three times 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 also alone with his vehicle through the sandy soil 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.739
 and Dirty 3 has always held out bravely 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.279
 only once had Andreas Schleef 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.269
 the idea was 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.039
 Seward adapts lock 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.659
 when trying to cross a very high sand dunes if so 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.259
 then get too close to an edge 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.259
 and then cheers crashed down to the bus 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.980
 Nikon but save the situation by putting the bus back on 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.979
 have and process have not really caused great damage 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.930
 So always let of a few hours were held strong again and 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:46.389
 could continue 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.870
 if he does not cross this Harald 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.610
 then the enthusiastic ones are burnout on the way to a meeting with others 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.189
 Fans of the all-wheel drive c3 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.079
 Andreas Bauch calls this a seven-hour journey to Acar 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.339
 Ernst near Schwedt -ing 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.260
 there on a former NVK site 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.449
 wore these weeks 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.449
 A good 60 are out in the country 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.549
 represented are the strangest tags 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.840
 Like this former radio operator, its owners are already in the Sahara 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:22.819
 accompanied 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.819
 WestLB sees 11d Cinco France announce 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.469
 and a lot of space is not important for everyone 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.229
 although of course there are bully fans who give it a luxurious word 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.539
 Times Â»only topic they all want to go to the terrain 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.849
 and if possible with the whole family 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.559
 makes sense, too 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.939
 is the meaning Court of the only family SUV 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:53.179
 the little ones quickly understood for VW the ten coalition on Fox 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.069
 robust like that 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.079
 Scan Ufuk sound spy 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.349
 Wooden slats with small beads are the toys for adults 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.969
 on a course who has in himself 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.989
 Perfect cooperation between both drivers and co-driver Zetsche and the halfpipe 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.389
 it's about 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.629
 that the course given by us he partly set himself 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.319
 when driving through and no increase is driven or so 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.559
 the one ball is touched and thereby on a judgment that goes quite fast 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.559
 when it was here 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.120
 Ladies receive penalty points 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 but the fun does not detract 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.800
 whirled through the sand 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.659
 thanks to its off-road transfer bus on its debut in 1986 many 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.100
 Buyers looking for a hard guy for heavy duty 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:57.949
 from the mountain rescue over the Federal Armed Forces to road construction 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.060
 So today's Syncos are for a large skillful conversions 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.060
 Past is no longer recognizable 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.129
 if they are not so clear in the terrain it is not a problem 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.129
 the spectators do not even look to tackle 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:19.949
 Andreas Lidl is not afraid to get stuck 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:20.740
 his secret recipe
