trying to do an effect or something like

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.570 
trying to do an effect or something like
that<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:11.989> have<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.590> make<00:04:12.800> sense<00:04:13.070> of<00:04:13.310> where<00:04:13.550> the

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
that you have to make sense of where the

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.719 
that you have to make sense of where the
blood<00:04:13.970> actually<00:04:14.269> flows<00:04:15.230> this<00:04:16.100> is<00:04:16.250> why<00:04:16.400> we<00:04:16.549> put

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
blood actually flows this is why we put

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.060 
blood actually flows this is why we put
a<00:04:16.760> cape<00:04:17.000> on<00:04:17.239> most<00:04:17.479> people<00:04:17.900> or<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.140> paper<00:04:18.680> towel

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
a cape on most people or a paper towel

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.650 
a cape on most people or a paper towel
or<00:04:19.400> even<00:04:19.789> a<00:04:19.880> newspaper

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
or even a newspaper

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.570 
or even a newspaper
because<00:04:21.230> sometimes<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.830> blood<00:04:22.040> will<00:04:22.280> drip

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
because sometimes the blood will drip

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.570 
because sometimes the blood will drip
okay<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:24.230> can<00:04:24.410> use<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.590> stopper<00:04:25.190> for<00:04:25.400> this

into<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.260> wound<00:04:39.590> okay<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.880> her<00:04:41.060> head<00:04:41.270> is<00:04:41.300> back

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
into the wound okay and her head is back

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.960 
into the wound okay and her head is back
and<00:04:41.990> then<00:04:42.890> keep<00:04:43.070> your<00:04:43.220> eye<00:04:43.250> closed<00:04:43.670> please

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
and then keep your eye closed please

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.930 
and then keep your eye closed please
then<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:45.020> let<00:04:45.350> our<00:04:45.500> head<00:04:45.740> come<00:04:46.040> forward<00:04:46.640> and<00:04:46.820> I

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
then I let our head come forward and I

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.190 
then I let our head come forward and I
can<00:04:47.150> maneuver<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.920> blood<00:04:49.840> coming<00:04:50.840> and

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
can maneuver the blood coming and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.640 
can maneuver the blood coming and
dripping<00:04:51.770> out<00:04:52.280> of<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:53.240> womb<00:04:53.480> and<00:04:53.720> so<00:04:54.170> you<00:04:54.230> want

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
dripping out of the womb and so you want

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.860 
dripping out of the womb and so you want
that<00:04:54.950> really<00:04:55.280> natural<00:04:56.030> kind<00:04:56.330> of<00:04:56.480> effect

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
that really natural kind of effect

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.090 
that really natural kind of effect
sometimes<00:04:57.740> I<00:04:57.920> will<00:04:58.070> take<00:04:58.280> my<00:04:58.310> finger<00:04:58.910> and

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
sometimes I will take my finger and

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.610 
sometimes I will take my finger and
smash<00:05:01.100> it<00:05:01.570> because<00:05:02.570> that<00:05:02.810> gives<00:05:02.990> you<00:05:03.200> an<00:05:03.350> extra

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
smash it because that gives you an extra

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.940 
smash it because that gives you an extra
effect<00:05:04.270> ok<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:05.750> can<00:05:05.900> smash<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.380> button<00:05:06.650> as<00:05:06.740> if

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
effect ok you can smash the button as if

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.980 
effect ok you can smash the button as if
now<00:05:07.430> it<00:05:07.580> looks<00:05:07.700> like<00:05:07.910> she<00:05:08.240> actually<00:05:08.420> hit<00:05:08.780> her

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
now it looks like she actually hit her

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.580 
now it looks like she actually hit her
lips<00:05:09.460> in<00:05:10.460> some<00:05:10.700> kind<00:05:10.910> of<00:05:10.940> accident<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.660> the

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
lips in some kind of accident and the

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.580 
lips in some kind of accident and the
blood<00:05:12.830> is<00:05:13.010> dripping<00:05:13.280> down<00:05:13.640> from<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:15.320> forehead

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
blood is dripping down from the forehead

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.560 
blood is dripping down from the forehead
and<00:05:16.040> if<00:05:16.250> you're<00:05:16.460> ever<00:05:16.640> filming<00:05:17.150> or<00:05:17.270> something

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
and if you're ever filming or something

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.600 
and if you're ever filming or something
like<00:05:17.690> that<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:18.200> can<00:05:18.410> put<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:19.070> blood<00:05:19.280> in<00:05:19.430> there

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
like that you can put the blood in there

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.750 
like that you can put the blood in there
and<00:05:19.760> actually<00:05:19.880> film<00:05:20.270> it<00:05:20.420> dripping<00:05:21.760> but

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
and actually film it dripping but

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.610 
and actually film it dripping but
basically<00:05:23.240> you<00:05:23.450> want<00:05:23.600> to<00:05:23.690> catch<00:05:23.870> most<00:05:24.290> of<00:05:24.500> the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
basically you want to catch most of the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.400 
basically you want to catch most of the
drips<00:05:24.890> and<00:05:25.040> all<00:05:25.220> that<00:05:25.460> before<00:05:25.700> you<00:05:26.240> go<00:05:27.020> up<00:05:27.230> to

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
drips and all that before you go up to

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.870 
drips and all that before you go up to
the<00:05:27.530> front<00:05:27.650> door<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.130> scare<00:05:28.400> someone<00:05:28.640> to

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
the front door and scare someone to

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.410 
the front door and scare someone to
death<00:05:29.650> by<00:05:30.650> keeping<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.280> drips<00:05:31.550> from<00:05:31.640> actually

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
death by keeping the drips from actually

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.420 
death by keeping the drips from actually
falling<00:05:32.810> in<00:05:32.930> your<00:05:33.050> eyes<00:05:33.260> and<00:05:33.620> you<00:05:34.220> can

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
falling in your eyes and you can

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.150 
falling in your eyes and you can
maneuver<00:05:34.970> all<00:05:35.090> of<00:05:35.450> the<00:05:35.630> blood<00:05:35.870> a<00:05:36.230> little<00:05:37.010> bit

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
maneuver all of the blood a little bit

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.690 
maneuver all of the blood a little bit
more<00:05:37.370> around<00:05:37.820> the<00:05:38.060> wound<00:05:38.270> and<00:05:39.400> that's<00:05:40.400> why<00:05:40.640> the

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
more around the wound and that's why the

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.640 
more around the wound and that's why the
jelly<00:05:41.090> blood<00:05:41.419> is<00:05:41.630> wonderful<00:05:42.110> because<00:05:42.260> it's

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
jelly blood is wonderful because it's

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.010 
jelly blood is wonderful because it's
actually<00:05:43.190> the<00:05:44.000> jelly<00:05:44.270> bloods<00:05:44.600> actually

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
actually the jelly bloods actually

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.570 
actually the jelly bloods actually
staying<00:05:45.290> in<00:05:45.530> place<00:05:45.650> so<00:05:45.890> it<00:05:46.010> always<00:05:46.250> looks

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
staying in place so it always looks

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.570 
staying in place so it always looks
bloody<00:05:46.940> and<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:47.510> raw<00:05:48.350> meaty<00:05:48.770> in<00:05:49.160> the<00:05:49.280> middle

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
bloody and and raw meaty in the middle

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.080 
bloody and and raw meaty in the middle
and<00:05:49.730> the<00:05:50.419> liquid<00:05:50.630> blood<00:05:51.400> will<00:05:52.400> actually<00:05:52.820> drip

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
and the liquid blood will actually drip

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.390 
and the liquid blood will actually drip
and<00:05:53.270> fall<00:05:53.480> into<00:05:53.780> its<00:05:53.930> natural<00:05:54.410> placement<00:05:54.710> by

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
and fall into its natural placement by

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.659 
and fall into its natural placement by
the<00:05:55.460> way<00:05:55.700> you<00:05:56.440> maneuver<00:05:57.440> the<00:05:57.560> head<00:05:57.800> so<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.400> think

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
the way you maneuver the head so I think

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:04.960 
the way you maneuver the head so I think
Vanessa<00:05:59.480> you<00:05:59.660> can<00:06:01.360> open<00:06:02.360> up<00:06:02.450> your<00:06:02.660> eyes<00:06:03.970> know

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
Vanessa you can open up your eyes know

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.830 
Vanessa you can open up your eyes know

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
there is our wound effect you can do it

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.210 
there is our wound effect you can do it
on<00:06:11.780> your<00:06:11.960> nose<00:06:12.169> you<00:06:12.560> can<00:06:12.710> do<00:06:12.830> it<00:06:12.950> on<00:06:13.070> your

forehead you can make a slit throat you
can<00:06:16.910> put<00:06:17.090> them<00:06:17.240> almost<00:06:17.390> anywhere<00:06:17.780> just

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
starts to warm up during the night and

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.120 
starts to warm up during the night and
it<00:06:28.729> stays<00:06:29.000> on<00:06:29.270> for<00:06:29.300> quite<00:06:29.750> a<00:06:29.810> while<00:06:30.050> it<00:06:30.500> starts

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
it stays on for quite a while it starts

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.510 
it stays on for quite a while it starts
to<00:06:31.340> get<00:06:31.460> a<00:06:31.520> little<00:06:31.640> bit<00:06:32.000> more

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
to get a little bit more

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.680 
to get a little bit more
and<00:06:33.139> can<00:06:34.139> actually<00:06:34.949> have<00:06:35.250> a<00:06:35.280> tendency<00:06:35.789> to<00:06:35.819> want

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
and can actually have a tendency to want

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.559 
and can actually have a tendency to want
to<00:06:36.870> move<00:06:37.050> some<00:06:37.440> and<00:06:37.860> maybe<00:06:38.190> even<00:06:38.460> to<00:06:38.849> want<00:06:39.419> to

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
to move some and maybe even to want to

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.230 
to move some and maybe even to want to
fall<00:06:39.750> off<00:06:39.780> or<00:06:40.259> almost<00:06:40.560> melt<00:06:40.889> away<00:06:41.069> so<00:06:41.610> I<00:06:41.849> always

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
fall off or almost melt away so I always
