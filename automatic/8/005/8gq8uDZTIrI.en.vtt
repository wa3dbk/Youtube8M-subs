00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.090 
show you how to fit two inserts if
you've<00:00:08.550> got<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:08.970> horn<00:00:09.389> stick<00:00:09.750> problem<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.740> this

you've got a horn stick problem so this
can<00:00:11.550> arise<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> couple<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.960> ways<00:00:13.050> some<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.769> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
can arise a couple of ways some of the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.920 
can arise a couple of ways some of the
air<00:00:13.980> bags<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.580> models<00:00:14.940> are<00:00:15.120> starting<00:00:15.360> to

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
air bags on the models are starting to

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.349 
air bags on the models are starting to
sort<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> lift<00:00:17.039> at<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> corners<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.849> can<00:00:18.150> see

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
sort of lift at the corners you can see

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.109 
sort of lift at the corners you can see
here<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.050> look<00:00:19.589> at<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> side<00:00:20.009> that<00:00:20.279> should<00:00:20.609> be<00:00:20.849> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
here I look at the side that should be a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.880 
here I look at the side that should be a
lot<00:00:21.749> lower<00:00:21.929> down<00:00:22.230> although<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:22.710> not<00:00:22.829> a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
lot lower down although it's not a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.939 
lot lower down although it's not a
problem<00:00:23.159> only<00:00:24.079> cosmetically<00:00:25.079> on<00:00:25.259> the<00:00:25.439> top

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
problem only cosmetically on the top

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.339 
problem only cosmetically on the top
it<00:00:26.249> can<00:00:26.519> also<00:00:26.730> start<00:00:27.329> to<00:00:27.509> happen<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:28.079> side

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
it can also start to happen at the side

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.259 
it can also start to happen at the side
hear<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.919> click<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.460> leather<00:00:29.640> can<00:00:29.849> start<00:00:30.119> to

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
hear it click the leather can start to

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.979 
hear it click the leather can start to
lift<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.859> cause<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.160> horn<00:00:32.460> push<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.720> do<00:00:33.930> you

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
lift and cause the horn push so do you

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.080 
lift and cause the horn push so do you
want<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.260> show<00:00:34.410> them<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.039> problems<00:00:35.430> if

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
want to show them that the problems if

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.360 
want to show them that the problems if
if<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.019> can<00:00:37.140> emulate<00:00:37.379> the<00:00:37.590> problem<00:00:37.949> by<00:00:38.100> pushing

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
if we can emulate the problem by pushing

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.990 
if we can emulate the problem by pushing
on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.760> side<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.840> then<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.289> horn<00:00:40.530> button

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
on the side and then your horn button

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.450 
on the side and then your horn button
sticks<00:00:42.000> down<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.859> we've<00:00:43.980> done<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.219> used

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
sticks down so what we've done is used

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.979 
sticks down so what we've done is used
about<00:00:44.609> a<00:00:44.670> couple<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.090> spaces<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> want<00:00:45.899> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
about a couple of spaces if you want to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.220 
about a couple of spaces if you want to
show<00:00:46.199> show<00:00:47.070> me<00:00:47.339> and<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.579> these<00:00:47.699> are<00:00:47.910> two<00:00:48.230> black

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
show show me and so these are two black

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.009 
show show me and so these are two black
plastic<00:00:49.670> laser-cut<00:00:50.670> spaces<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.870> we're

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
plastic laser-cut spaces that we're

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.680 
plastic laser-cut spaces that we're
going<00:00:52.109> to<00:00:52.199> show<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.410> how<00:00:52.589> to<00:00:52.649> fit<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:53.690> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
going to show you how to fit now to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.299 
going to show you how to fit now to
solve<00:00:54.929> the<00:00:55.019> problem<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.589> could<00:00:55.829> also<00:00:56.039> be

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
solve the problem it could also be

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.860 
solve the problem it could also be
happen<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.820> fit<00:00:56.999> every<00:00:57.300> trim<00:00:57.600> steering

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
happen if you fit every trim steering

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.720 
happen if you fit every trim steering
wheel<00:00:58.199> sometimes<00:00:58.499> the<00:00:58.920> leather<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.429> bit

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
wheel sometimes the leather is a bit

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.779 
wheel sometimes the leather is a bit
thicker<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.839> area<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.679> this<00:01:02.280> area<00:01:02.550> here

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
thicker in this area and this area here

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.080 
thicker in this area and this area here
which<00:01:03.030> sort<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.659> causes<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.820> switch<00:01:05.820> pack

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
which sort of causes the switch pack

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.640 
which sort of causes the switch pack
assembly<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.660> push<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.200> way<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.530> then

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
assembly to push that way and then

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.610 
assembly to push that way and then
obviously<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.760> squid<00:01:09.360> jizz<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.440> is<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
obviously it's squid jizz on that is a

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.190 
obviously it's squid jizz on that is a
technical<00:01:11.010> term<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.520> think<00:01:11.730> so<00:01:11.910> on<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.630> horn

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
technical term I think so on the horn

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.110 
technical term I think so on the horn
push<00:01:13.440> there<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.700> we'll<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:14.940> a<00:01:14.970> quick

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.540 
don't need to disconnect any ones we
haven't<00:01:49.260> disconnected<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.890> battery<00:01:49.920> today

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
haven't disconnected the battery today

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.220 
haven't disconnected the battery today
it<00:01:50.820> would<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.180> wise<00:01:51.450> precaution<00:01:51.660> perhaps

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
it would be a wise precaution perhaps

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.530 
it would be a wise precaution perhaps
but<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:53.130> we're<00:01:53.370> not<00:01:53.490> disconnecting<00:01:54.180> any<00:01:54.300> wise

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
but as we're not disconnecting any wise

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.700 
but as we're not disconnecting any wise
we<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:55.050> we're<00:01:55.200> okay

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
we think we're okay

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.070 
we think we're okay
so<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.310> laser-cut<00:01:56.670> insert<00:01:57.300> literally<00:01:57.810> just

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
so the laser-cut insert literally just

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.790 
so the laser-cut insert literally just
nest<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.280> there<00:01:59.720> you<00:02:00.720> can<00:02:00.930> see<00:02:01.200> where<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:01.530> fit

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
nest in there you can see where they fit

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.050 
nest in there you can see where they fit
against<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.630> leather<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.930> against<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.410> back

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
against the leather and against the back

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.250 
against the leather and against the back
so<00:02:06.060> they<00:02:06.180> should<00:02:06.390> hold<00:02:06.540> themselves<00:02:06.750> no<00:02:07.110> need

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
so they should hold themselves no need

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.690 
so they should hold themselves no need
for<00:02:07.440> any<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.620> these<00:02:07.830> or<00:02:08.099> anything<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.580> then

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
for any of these or anything and then

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.800 
for any of these or anything and then
once<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.090> got<00:02:09.869> them<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.370> you<00:02:11.370> can

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
once you got them that you can

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.040 
once you got them that you can
back<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:16.250> clip<00:02:17.250> that<00:02:17.430> back<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.300> now<00:02:18.840> even

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
back in clip that back in and now even

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.750 
back in clip that back in and now even
if<00:02:19.319> we<00:02:19.350> press<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.160> side<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:20.580> you're<00:02:20.670> going

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
if we press on the side if you're going

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.699 
if we press on the side if you're going
to<00:02:20.850> do<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.090> same<00:02:22.040> trial<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.730> won't<00:02:24.060> allow<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
to do that same trial it won't allow the

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.470 
to do that same trial it won't allow the
air<00:02:25.709> back<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.310> there's<00:02:26.790> no<00:02:26.970> visible<00:02:27.420> change

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
air back and there's no visible change

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.290 
air back and there's no visible change
you<00:02:27.959> can't<00:02:28.200> see<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> gap<00:02:28.950> all<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.700> does<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.030> stop

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
you can't see a gap all it does is stop

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.479 
you can't see a gap all it does is stop
this<00:02:30.480> sort<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.840> loose<00:02:31.440> bit<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.830> leather<00:02:32.069> at<00:02:32.370> the
