for 16 hours but I always notice that
after<00:01:11.240> an<00:01:11.330> hour<00:01:11.540> -<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.500> lipsticks<00:01:12.890> starting

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160

after an hour - the lipsticks starting
to<00:01:13.250> look<00:01:13.370> really<00:01:13.610> dry<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.000> it's<00:01:14.420> starting<00:01:14.720> to

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
to look really dry and it's starting to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.930 
to look really dry and it's starting to
weather<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.470> crack<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.010> flake<00:01:16.340> off<00:01:16.520> my<00:01:16.700> lips
