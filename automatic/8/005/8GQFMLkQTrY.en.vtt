we're<00:04:58.770> not<00:04:58.889> doing<00:04:59.130> a<00:04:59.220> lipstick<00:04:59.840> because<00:05:00.840> we

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
we're not doing a lipstick because we

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.350 
we're not doing a lipstick because we
know<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:01.350> lipstick<00:05:02.190> does<00:05:02.370> not<00:05:02.580> last<00:05:02.850> the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360

know that lipstick does not last the
whole<00:05:03.510> day<00:05:03.540> so<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.080> best<00:05:04.229> way<00:05:04.410> to<00:05:04.440> do<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.830> is

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
whole day so the best way to do it is

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.930 
whole day so the best way to do it is
just<00:05:04.979> wear<00:05:05.940> on<00:05:06.300> some<00:05:06.750> lip<00:05:06.930> lip<00:05:07.470> gloss<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:08.639> this
