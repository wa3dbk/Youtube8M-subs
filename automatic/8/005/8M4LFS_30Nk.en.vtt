hi-hat right so tell us about this so we

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.369 
hi-hat right so tell us about this so we

first came out with 100 ml version and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.990 
first came out with 100 ml version and
we<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> lot<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.129> requests<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.579> 75

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
we have a lot of requests for a 75

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.510 
we have a lot of requests for a 75
millimeter<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.230> what's<00:00:46.649> great<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.100> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
millimeter so what's great about this is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.860 
millimeter so what's great about this is
instead<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.000> having<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.360> traditional

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
instead of having your traditional

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.619 
instead of having your traditional
cast-iron<00:00:49.440> hi-hat<00:00:50.010> which<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.670> very<00:00:50.969> limiting

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
cast-iron hi-hat which is very limiting

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.700 
cast-iron hi-hat which is very limiting
and<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> drill<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.289> down<00:00:52.469> into<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and you have to drill it down into a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.650 
and you have to drill it down into a
board<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.000> actually<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.449> this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
board you can actually have this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.090 
board you can actually have this
freestanding<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.469> itself<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.949> can

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
freestanding by itself you can

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.459 
freestanding by itself you can
independently<00:00:59.399> change<00:01:00.030> each<00:01:00.780> leg<00:01:01.079> position

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
independently change each leg position

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.590 
independently change each leg position
for<00:01:04.070> further<00:01:04.280> adjustment<00:01:04.820> you<00:01:05.030> can<00:01:05.059> telescope

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
for further adjustment you can telescope

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.180 
for further adjustment you can telescope
each<00:01:05.810> leg<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.260> get<00:01:06.380> another<00:01:06.560> two<00:01:06.799> inches<00:01:07.040> out

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
each leg you get another two inches out

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.660 
each leg you get another two inches out
of<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:09.110> this<00:01:09.200> is<00:01:09.259> great<00:01:09.530> for<00:01:09.740> if<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:10.520> want

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
of that so this is great for if you want

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.310 
of that so this is great for if you want
to<00:01:10.729> go<00:01:10.820> from<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:11.060> high<00:01:11.210> hat<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.869> a<00:01:11.930> low<00:01:12.140> hat

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
to go from a high hat to a low hat

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.760 
to go from a high hat to a low hat
position<00:01:13.030> in<00:01:14.030> about<00:01:14.210> 30<00:01:14.420> seconds<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.500> how<00:01:15.619> much

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
position in about 30 seconds so how much

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.800 
position in about 30 seconds so how much
weight<00:01:16.040> can<00:01:16.250> this<00:01:16.400> hold<00:01:16.549> this<00:01:17.390> guy<00:01:17.570> can

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
weight can this hold this guy can

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.550 
weight can this hold this guy can
actually<00:01:18.170> hold<00:01:19.030> 165<00:01:20.030> pounds<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:21.440> got

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
actually hold 165 pounds and you got

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.940 
actually hold 165 pounds and you got
your<00:01:21.649> 75<00:01:22.130> millimeter<00:01:22.670> flat<00:01:22.880> base<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.110> if<00:01:24.830> you

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
your 75 millimeter flat base so if you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.680 
your 75 millimeter flat base so if you
have<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.100> 75<00:01:25.520> millimeter<00:01:25.940> video<00:01:26.240> head<00:01:26.479> you

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
have a 75 millimeter video head you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.480 
have a 75 millimeter video head you
could<00:01:26.780> just<00:01:26.930> take<00:01:27.049> this<00:01:27.170> half<00:01:27.380> ball<00:01:27.619> out<00:01:27.799> but

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
could just take this half ball out but

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.920 
could just take this half ball out but
since<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:28.909> many<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.210> new<00:01:29.330> heads<00:01:29.509> are<00:01:29.720> flat

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
since so many of the new heads are flat

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.510 
since so many of the new heads are flat
base<00:01:30.170> or<00:01:30.500> if<00:01:30.649> they<00:01:30.740> have<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:30.890> ball<00:01:31.190> head<00:01:31.369> and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
base or if they have a ball head and

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
20 stud you can actually convert it to

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.700 
20 stud you can actually convert it to
be<00:01:55.880> three-eighths<00:01:56.330> with<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:56.690> right<00:01:57.500> right

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
be three-eighths with this right right

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.800 
be three-eighths with this right right
okay<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.039> now<00:01:58.250> tell<00:01:58.460> us<00:01:58.550> about<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.940> new<00:01:59.330> s<00:01:59.539> pate

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
okay so now tell us about the new s pate

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.710 
okay so now tell us about the new s pate
head<00:02:00.050> absolutely<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.159> s<00:02:01.310> 8<00:02:01.549> is<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:02.240> step<00:02:02.569> up

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
head absolutely so the s 8 is a step up

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.990 
head absolutely so the s 8 is a step up
from<00:02:02.840> our<00:02:03.020> s<00:02:03.200> six<00:02:03.560> so<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.460> have<00:02:04.549> an<00:02:04.640> increased

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
from our s six so you have an increased

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.760 
from our s six so you have an increased
weight<00:02:05.179> capacity<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.720> up<00:02:05.899> to<00:02:05.929> seventeen<00:02:06.500> point

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
weight capacity of up to seventeen point

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.130 
weight capacity of up to seventeen point
six<00:02:06.830> pounds<00:02:07.399> it's<00:02:08.000> still<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.300> flat<00:02:08.660> base<00:02:08.840> head

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
six pounds it's still a flat base head

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.490 
six pounds it's still a flat base head
but<00:02:09.590> now<00:02:09.679> it's<00:02:09.890> at<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.280> 75<00:02:10.879> millimeter<00:02:11.390> base<00:02:11.629> so

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
but now it's at a 75 millimeter base so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.339 
but now it's at a 75 millimeter base so
with<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.160> guy<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:14.050> two<00:02:15.050> three

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
with this guy you have two three

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.410 
with this guy you have two three

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
successor e mounts on the top so if you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.119 
successor e mounts on the top so if you
don't<00:02:17.660> have<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> cage<00:02:18.200> rails

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
middle to make an adjustment super

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.110 
middle to make an adjustment super
user-friendly<00:02:41.420> okay<00:02:42.319> yeah<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.769> S<00:02:42.920> six<00:02:43.340> had

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
user-friendly okay yeah so the S six had

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.420 
user-friendly okay yeah so the S six had
variable<00:02:44.780> drag<00:02:44.989> on<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.290> tilt<00:02:45.620> but<00:02:46.069> not<00:02:46.250> in<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
variable drag on the tilt but not in the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.580 
variable drag on the tilt but not in the
pan<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:46.849> now<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.030> s<00:02:47.330> eight<00:02:47.510> has<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.989> in<00:02:48.230> the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
pan so now that s eight has it in the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.740 
pan so now that s eight has it in the
pan<00:02:49.069> actually<00:02:49.459> exactly<00:02:49.819> so<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.239> S<00:02:50.360> six<00:02:50.599> had

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
pan actually exactly so the S six had

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.110 
pan actually exactly so the S six had
your<00:02:50.989> tilt<00:02:51.769> drag<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.489> had<00:02:52.580> your<00:02:52.700> four<00:02:52.910> step

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
your tilt drag and it had your four step

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.150 
your tilt drag and it had your four step
counterbalance<00:02:53.720> like<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:53.959> see<00:02:54.080> here<00:02:54.319> so<00:02:55.040> what

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
counterbalance like you see here so what

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.440 
counterbalance like you see here so what
we<00:02:55.250> added<00:02:55.430> was<00:02:55.730> we<00:02:55.879> actually<00:02:56.000> added<00:02:56.390> a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
we added was we actually added a

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.720 
we added was we actually added a
continuous<00:02:57.140> pan<00:02:57.379> drag<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:58.099> an<00:02:58.370> increased

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
continuous pan drag and an increased

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.490 
continuous pan drag and an increased
weight<00:02:58.879> capacity<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.599> then<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.230> got<00:03:00.379> your

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
weight capacity and then you got your

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.229 
weight capacity and then you got your
accessory<00:03:00.950> mounts<00:03:01.220> as<00:03:01.310> well<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.940> then<00:03:02.090> you

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
accessory mounts as well and then you

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.339 
accessory mounts as well and then you
kind<00:03:02.450> of<00:03:02.510> mentioned<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.870> me<00:03:02.989> earlier<00:03:03.019> that

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
yeah we have a lot of show prices here

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.400 
yeah we have a lot of show prices here
so<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.709> S<00:03:09.860> 8<00:03:10.129> right<00:03:10.430> now<00:03:10.610> by<00:03:11.090> itself<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:12.170> going

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
so the S 8 right now by itself is going

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.350 
so the S 8 right now by itself is going
to<00:03:12.470> be<00:03:12.620> $50<00:03:13.220> off<00:03:13.430> that's<00:03:13.700> good<00:03:13.790> for<00:03:13.970> April<00:03:14.240> and

to be $50 off that's good for April and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.140 
to be $50 off that's good for April and
May<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.290> aluminum<00:03:15.770> kit

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
May the aluminum kit

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.360 
May the aluminum kit
also<00:03:16.480> fifty<00:03:16.780> off<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.290> then<00:03:17.709> our<00:03:17.799> carbon<00:03:18.189> fiber

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
also fifty off and then our carbon fiber

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.270 
also fifty off and then our carbon fiber
is<00:03:18.670> actually<00:03:18.840> 125<00:03:19.840> off<00:03:20.079> so<00:03:20.769> you're<00:03:20.890> looking<00:03:20.980> at
