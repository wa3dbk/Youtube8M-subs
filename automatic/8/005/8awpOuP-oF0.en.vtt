here<00:00:19.789> with<00:00:19.939> our<00:00:20.060> mounting<00:00:20.449> system<00:00:20.480> we<00:00:20.960> call

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
here with our mounting system we call

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.040 
here with our mounting system we call
this<00:00:21.320> our<00:00:21.470> hybrid<00:00:21.949> mounting<00:00:22.640> system<00:00:23.060> and<00:00:23.300> that

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
this our hybrid mounting system and that

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.200 
this our hybrid mounting system and that
is<00:00:24.230> because<00:00:24.589> this<00:00:24.830> is<00:00:24.890> a<00:00:25.039> hybrid<00:00:25.279> between<00:00:25.519> it's

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
is because this is a hybrid between it's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.630 
is because this is a hybrid between it's
much<00:00:26.449> like<00:00:26.660> a<00:00:26.689> chain<00:00:27.019> but<00:00:27.589> it<00:00:27.740> has<00:00:27.980> two<00:00:28.189> cables

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
much like a chain but it has two cables

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.689 
much like a chain but it has two cables
it<00:00:29.029> has<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.839> flexibility<00:00:30.499> and<00:00:30.529> strength<00:00:31.009> of<00:00:31.279> a

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
it has the flexibility and strength of a

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.819 
it has the flexibility and strength of a
cable<00:00:31.909> but<00:00:32.570> it<00:00:32.719> also<00:00:32.870> has<00:00:33.079> a<00:00:33.110> gripping<00:00:33.590> power

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
cable but it also has a gripping power

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.310 
cable but it also has a gripping power
of<00:00:34.160> a<00:00:34.579> chain<00:00:34.910> because<00:00:35.600> there's<00:00:35.780> little<00:00:35.989> links

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
of a chain because there's little links

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.500 
of a chain because there's little links
in<00:00:36.500> here<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:36.949> allow<00:00:37.160> it<00:00:37.309> to<00:00:37.340> really<00:00:37.699> get

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
in here that allow it to really get

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.930 
in here that allow it to really get
right<00:00:38.690> along<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.109> tree<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:39.469> grip<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.940> the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
right along the tree and grip it the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.049 
right along the tree and grip it the
connecting<00:00:41.570> system<00:00:42.020> is<00:00:42.170> a<00:00:42.440> lock<00:00:42.800> pin<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:43.430> then

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
connecting system is a lock pin and then

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.330 
connecting system is a lock pin and then
we<00:00:44.449> have<00:00:44.660> this<00:00:44.899> spring<00:00:45.379> pin<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:45.949> you<00:00:46.039> pull

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
we have this spring pin and you pull

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.849 
we have this spring pin and you pull
that<00:00:46.550> out<00:00:46.760> that<00:00:47.329> releases<00:00:47.960> it<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.710> can

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
that out that releases it and you can

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.490 
that out that releases it and you can
adjust<00:00:49.180> in<00:00:50.180> or<00:00:50.390> out<00:00:50.510> whatever<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:51.019> need<00:00:51.260> and

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
adjust in or out whatever you need and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.529 
adjust in or out whatever you need and
when<00:00:52.429> you<00:00:52.519> get<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.879> hole<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:53.059> have<00:00:53.239> to

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
when you get to the hole you have to

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.720 
when you get to the hole you have to
find<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:54.109> just<00:00:54.140> pull<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.429> see<00:00:55.609> that

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
find you just pull it and you see that

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.389 
find you just pull it and you see that
spring-loaded<00:00:56.269> action<00:00:56.780> drops<00:00:57.170> in<00:00:57.469> then

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
spring-loaded action drops in then

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.930 
spring-loaded action drops in then
insert<00:00:59.030> your<00:00:59.269> safety<00:00:59.719> pin<00:00:59.899> again<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:00.940> you're

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
insert your safety pin again and you're

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.439 
insert your safety pin again and you're
good<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.269> go

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
good to go

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.320 
good to go
so<00:01:03.350> that<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.340> a<00:01:04.370> really<00:01:04.940> handy<00:01:05.150> little

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
so that is a really handy little

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.420 
so that is a really handy little
mounting<00:01:05.900> system<00:01:06.290> let's<00:01:06.830> go<00:01:06.980> right<00:01:07.130> down<00:01:07.250> here

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
mounting system let's go right down here

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.940 
mounting system let's go right down here
to<00:01:07.550> the<00:01:07.640> platform<00:01:08.210> we<00:01:08.720> have<00:01:08.750> non-slip<00:01:09.440> slats

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
to the platform we have non-slip slats

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.380 
to the platform we have non-slip slats
on<00:01:10.190> here<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.400> can<00:01:10.520> see<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:10.790> drippers<00:01:11.180> on

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
on here you can see the drippers on

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.040 
on here you can see the drippers on
there<00:01:11.660> we<00:01:12.620> include<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:14.060> stirrup<00:01:14.810> straps

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
there we include the stirrup straps

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.510 
there we include the stirrup straps
where<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.530> just<00:01:15.650> put<00:01:15.860> your<00:01:16.010> feet<00:01:16.190> through

complete system one of the other

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.830 
complete system one of the other
features<00:01:42.980> this<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.730> on<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.150> both<00:01:44.300> on<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.660> top

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
features this is on the both on the top

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.290 
features this is on the both on the top
and<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.080> bottom<00:01:45.230> if<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:46.160> loosen<00:01:46.760> this<00:01:46.790> pin
