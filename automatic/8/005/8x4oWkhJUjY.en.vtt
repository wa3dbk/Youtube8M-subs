00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.370
 Hi, people today. I'll show you how. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.740
 I made this heart shirt 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.320
 so these are the materials that you 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:42.610
 will need a t-shirt 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.550
 scissors green ribbon as the fabric 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.180
 then I'll start of this label 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.700
 shirt was 20 and 99 and I bought it from 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.790
 american store 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.410
 only that this model was male and then 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.100
 companion size p 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.780
 and I'll cut the bottom of the collar 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.780
 and the sleeves 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.440
 now my shirt for us to draw 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.610
 to the heart and I got a little pen 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.930
 Yellow 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.930
 not to get much faster 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.490
 so I made the heart freehand even 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.490
 but if you want you can use the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 mold with cardboard a cardboard 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.710
 and now I've got scissors but in the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.880
 Actually I'm going to cut this heart a 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.760
 canter because it was easier to do 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.670
 drawing of the heart and after I go 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.230
 take scissors to finalize the court to 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.230
 take heart from shirt 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:27.689
 now I've got the green ribbon and I 'm going 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:32.609
 measure the size of half a heart 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:36.189
 idea the portal and cut the same size 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:38.730
 tape to make the other an act of 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.730
 heart 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.290
 so now I got the glue for fabric 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.290
 and I'll pass on the secular chubby 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.569
 half of fifa was the other half 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.020
 We'll paste it inside the 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.020
 T-shirt 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.430
 now I cut the tape excess that 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.959
 left a little bit and it's always better 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.069
 left over than missing 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:35.590
 so now I'm going to reverse the shirt 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.590
 to stick the tape on the side of everything 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.430
 I'm going to do the same process now in 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.850
 two or the heart doing in the part of 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.640
 outside the shirt and inside 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.790
 and this part of the kitchen of the heart is 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.800
 more complicated then just do with 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.750
 care money in of varzinha com 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.750
 calm that works 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.620
 so now I'm going to make the final touches 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:28.050
 and glue the ends of the tapes and also 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.680
 cut that need what you have to 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.680
 access 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.980
 and then it 's your end result I hope 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.480
