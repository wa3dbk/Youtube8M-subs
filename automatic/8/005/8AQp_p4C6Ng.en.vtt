00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.089
 a 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.460
 How do I present the cappuccino today? 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.220
 a game of charles shepherd depending on 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.570
 pegasus appeared and almost 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:20.070
 at the same time in german just at pegasus 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.079
 at the fair in Essen 2013 and one 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.200
 plant at the beginning of the game has the bin 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.790
 supervised by pegasus that does not mean 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.250
 that's not exactly what we are 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.910
 will look critically karachi tore 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.070
 and very simple abstract game should 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.559
 being so easy for anyone to learn 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.810
 be you stack kaffeebecher brings 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 each other or not so wild we 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.160
 then someday i will explain it 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.100
 you and then at the end 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.050
 I tell you these feature films for 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.390
 Every player receives exactly the beginning of the game 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.460
 a color except in a two player 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.930
 You can play a variation of two colors 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.290
 but can only be with two 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.910
 a color play and these cups of the 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.230
 respective color or of the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.870
 respective symbols have up here 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.240
 also symbols on it you put that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.280
 then just happen to be in here 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.679
 profi variant makes it easy 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.469
 in turn, each player puts one 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.960
 new mug on the field and there 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.179
 but it is true, make sure that you 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.249
 always a cup on borders with two 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:24.149
 more roofs so that here to 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:25.950
 example would not be allowed and then 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.810
 the game is already going on in 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.700
 A player is now allowed one of his moves 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.340
 cup or move a bÃ¼cherstapel 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.229
 means you jump on other cups and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.609
 others stack on it the only one 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.979
 condition that you have to consider 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.200
 You must never go to higher states 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.979
 but jump to smaller or equal 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.959
 big stacks 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.139
 that is, when the brown game starts 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:49.859
 may he jump on this cup here 

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:51.719
 and the kab play here you can for 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.799
 example on white then jump is white 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.109
 series on the here and tried it on 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.209
 come and jump on the brown ones 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:03.240
 mug on it and now it works 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:06.679
 whole just always so on should one 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.030
 players here today because of that 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.670
 demarcate part of the field here 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.820
 then you can if you want that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.890
 immediately dissolve the b player of the same 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.690
 on top is the pile and gets 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.550
 Just put it in front of you 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.590
 another possibility would be this 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.780
 situation here too here it would be now 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.480
 separated and also here you can 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.950
 dissolve prematurely because this cup 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.310
 Nobody can jump out of this for that 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.170
 the on the and therefore that einzuges the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.730
 one then in the end also quite on 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.530
 you just want to make it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.690
 do it right away does not count as an action 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.670
 not as a pull and brown player 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.740
 can turn in now and immediately 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.570
 then make another move 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.130
 in the course of the game then the 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.560
 playing area is always smaller com 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.450
 minutes in and finally you play 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.060
 so long until just a big one 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.770
 States is left and then create 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.720
 all players collect theirs 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.130
 book stack on each other 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.230
 that means you do not pull the biggest 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.240
 state but all states together 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.220
 and who has the highest tower now 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.780
 is called the most mug of others 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.510
 or has collected own books 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.070
 win the game and look forward to 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.020
 the two players variant in the mine 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.850
 two colors used works 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.370
 whole similar just that you just finished 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.750
 only one of the two died e10 may that 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.640
 means you have to just separate 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.600
 So now I would have brown and 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.390
 dark brown here 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.920
 then I would have to be separated from each other 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.570
 turn off celebrity and then I look at 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.820
 end just which ones in which 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.320
 most stable higher and also wins here 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.000
 against the highest with the stapi and 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.500
 is glad 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.630
 no, not the shortest one 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.120
 Game explanation of a time was an example 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.880
 as a game is really very fast 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.760
 you really only need four 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.040
 five sentences and everything else will come 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.080
 easy in the gameplay and that 's for 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.120
 It's really easy for me to do that 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.489
 play with anyone but before that it is 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.860
 again to the components are possible 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.200
 unique I think it's really great 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.060
 material beautiful large roofs so not 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.780
 so small and peaceful but right 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.360
 something in hand 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.459
 also done so well by that 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.769
 here you can have such a ring 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.830
 Lift it all up and hold it 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.810
 then also stand correctly and that 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.870
 means one also has the handling here 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.810
 a really great one 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.090
 play also applies here, too 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.410
 friendliness for colorblind people 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.570
 not only here in different 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.729
 colors that only once from any sound yet 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.979
 are a bit similar to it but above 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.419
 on it you still have a symbol where 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.070
 then colors sound like a player 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.300
 can orientate it a bit and 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.190
 that is a bit different are things 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.300
 quite clearly I think that's right 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.490
 Great 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.050
 the box is also great one lives 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.690
 Here just experienced what rain man 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.280
 it had awkward magnet lids and here 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.729
 The money is meant to be used by users 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.500
 Make sure you get that right 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.340
 nicely nested so that the good 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.280
 fit in 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.210
 they keep a bit of pressure 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.979
 out or even a lot of pressure out and there 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.780
 nothing can break like 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.860
 I find nothing happened also 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.080
 I have not heard yet 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.789
 Well that was the game material for the 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.419
 It's really a game in itself 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.789
 I just jump on others 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.260
 towers better on it one must just 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:15.010
 just make sure that you do not stop 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.810
 things jump and despite this 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.520
 simplicity of the rules is then 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.560
 still a lot of tactical depth 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.419
 There is a lot of nice thinking in there 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.979
 go a bit on the offensive 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.960
 or you have to defend yourself 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.270
 still take a tear on food search 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.190
 situation that is at two or three 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.870
 corners at once and then has to 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.010
 of course a bit 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.590
 calculate which train is because 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.240
 the next best thing so I have now 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.530
 erich may call him least 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.510
 or where can I maybe then 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.919
 still somehow win 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.110
 beat out or a situation 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.360
 produce that serves me to the advantage 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.880
 So really real in spite of this 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.539
 simplicity very nice decisions 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.729
 with it 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:54.669
 I like it really well and I say that 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.139
 really perfectly objective I take 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.550
 because no consideration for objections not 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.250
 I would have liked this too 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.530
 but that's really it 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.400
 great game that I just 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.229
 can recommend 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.550
 as I said I am in others 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.130
 already mentioned videos I'm not that 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.410
 great fan of abstract games though 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.120
 if you have such great stuff here and 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.919
 if that's just so easy and fluid 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.110
 goes by the hand and still in such 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.450
 short time player we are talking about here 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.520
 a maximum of 20 minutes then I like that 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.290
 just scary so the game has 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.240
 just become one of an abstract one 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.880
 Darlings there we have on the ami porta 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.800
 del diablo mirko educator and now 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.110
 just add cappuccino 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.750
 who looks for something attractive and who looks for something 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.130
 for the coffee table that one faster 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.010
 Most table can do with it 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.200
 anyone can play yes the two 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.680
 really cappuccino just to heart 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.290
 and a player works that way 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.700
 pay the variations are in there 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.290
 really good too so i am too 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.670
 not difficult to introduce at 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.900
 Two players just a color beside 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:57.520
 be the bigger tower or at the 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.380
 profi variant support the field 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.420
 Of course , building up also brings 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.260
 a lot of depth with purely how to do that 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:07.030
 it's clear that this is it 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.440
 but then more for professionals 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.120
 but that is really something you can do with it 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.690
 family play with anyone 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.760
 simple very very great 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.840
 I just can play abstract games 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.780
 Praise and recommend 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.730
 and now here who relish on top of 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.770
 a nice attractive game that too 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.150
 should still have to do with coffee 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.520
 easy access maybe it's 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:30.130
 a nice gift to the coffee 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.350
 drank it or so it was mine 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.970
 opinion on the cappuccino if it is you 

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.380
 liked helped has 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.260
