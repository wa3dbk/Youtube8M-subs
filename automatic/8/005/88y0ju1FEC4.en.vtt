00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
something that we can expect in the

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:58.399 
something that we can expect in the
future

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
future

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.410 
future
and<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> reason<00:01:59.460> why<00:01:59.579> I'm<00:01:59.700> saying<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.329> we

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
and the reason why I'm saying that we

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.989 
and the reason why I'm saying that we
might<00:02:00.630> see<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.799> Marsha<00:02:02.159> pack<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.609> because

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
might see a for Marsha pack is because

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:04.789 
might see a for Marsha pack is because
it's<00:02:03.570> been<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> while<00:02:04.229> since<00:02:04.560> we've<00:02:04.770> had

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
it's been a while since we've had

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.219 
it's been a while since we've had
anything<00:02:05.369> master<00:02:05.759> pack<00:02:06.090> related<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:06.929> all

been<00:02:07.469> skin<00:02:08.070> packs<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.610> texture<00:02:09.060> packs<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
been skin packs and texture packs and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.300 
been skin packs and texture packs and
even<00:02:09.810> saying<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.440> been<00:02:10.649> all<00:02:10.920> skin

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
even saying that it's been all skin

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.309 
even saying that it's been all skin
packs<00:02:11.580> which<00:02:11.819> are<00:02:11.850> good<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:12.960> prefer

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
packs which are good but I prefer

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.320 
packs which are good but I prefer
texture<00:02:13.860> packs<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.310> master<00:02:14.700> parks<00:02:15.090> we've

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
texture packs and master parks we've

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.050 
texture packs and master parks we've
only<00:02:15.420> got<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.600> few<00:02:15.660> at<00:02:15.990> master<00:02:16.290> packs<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.770> do<00:02:17.700> know

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
only got a few at master packs I do know

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.340 
only got a few at master packs I do know
after<00:02:18.330> speaking<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.780> some<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.140> forge

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
after speaking to some of the forge

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.540 
after speaking to some of the forge
employees<00:02:19.860> they<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.100> lot<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.340> things

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
employees they have a lot of things

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.910 
employees they have a lot of things
planned<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.810> our<00:02:21.990> area<00:02:22.470> which<00:02:22.770> I'm

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
planned in the our area which I'm

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.260 
planned in the our area which I'm
guessing<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.280> gonna<00:02:23.460> be<00:02:23.520> master<00:02:23.820> packs<00:02:24.060> and

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
guessing is gonna be master packs and

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.390 
guessing is gonna be master packs and
texture<00:02:24.600> packs<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.860> do<00:02:25.950> think<00:02:26.310> if

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
texture packs and so I do think if

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800 
texture packs and so I do think if
fallout<00:02:26.700> for<00:02:26.880> masha<00:02:27.090> pack<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.480> something

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
fallout for masha pack is something

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.089 
fallout for masha pack is something
we<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:27.989> really<00:02:28.230> look<00:02:28.380> forward<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.770> in<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
we can really look forward to in the

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.530 
we can really look forward to in the
future<00:02:29.280> I'm<00:02:29.610> guessing<00:02:30.030> they'll<00:02:30.150> probably<00:02:30.300> be

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
future I'm guessing they'll probably be

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.680 
future I'm guessing they'll probably be
after<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.930> release<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.640> Fallout<00:02:32.640> 4<00:02:33.060> because

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
after the release of Fallout 4 because

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.600 
after the release of Fallout 4 because
obviously<00:02:34.110> fall<00:02:34.380> four<00:02:34.620> releases<00:02:34.920> they<00:02:35.400> make

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
obviously fall four releases they make

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.670 
obviously fall four releases they make
sales<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.270> 4G<00:02:36.720> can<00:02:36.900> bring<00:02:37.050> out<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> fallout

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
sales then 4G can bring out a fallout

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.830 
sales then 4G can bring out a fallout
for<00:02:37.980> Monsieur<00:02:38.310> pack<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.760> fact<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.450> could<00:02:39.660> be<00:02:39.810> a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
for Monsieur pack in fact it could be a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.240 
for Monsieur pack in fact it could be a
jewel<00:02:40.170> one<00:02:40.410> where<00:02:40.620> they<00:02:40.709> both<00:02:40.830> come<00:02:41.069> at<00:02:41.160> the
