00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.199
 the history of mankind experimented towards the fifth century before Christ 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.559
 one of its most important turning points 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.460
 at this time it roughly coincides with the classic era of Greece 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.239
 define one of the great moments of Western civilization 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.460
 whose effects still endure in our days 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.949
 The ancient Greeks 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.250
 they gave us a rational explanation of the world and of man democracy 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.219
 as a form of government and an artistic canon 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.090
 which has served as a reference to the attack and blockade 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.329
 from the Romans 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.929
 up to neoclassicism 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:43.420
 going through the renaissance 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.690
 but it is impossible to understand art history 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.450
 with the poetry of the old 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.850
 without first mentioning his background 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.150
 to your foreign country 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.760
 the weather the mountains and the sea 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.750
 In short, the context that made possible the emergence of 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.030
 splendid civilization 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.510
 Classical Greece 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.110
 it is the fruit of a long cultural process 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.299
 with more critical stages such as decreed civilizations and dinners 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.569
 that develop between the years 2007 begin before Christ 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.869
 the Greek civilization 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.280
 owes much also to the mountainous and fertile landscape presided over by a 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.720
 Mediterranean splashed by hundreds of islands 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.320
 the presence of the sea 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.190
 more than separate with serves as a link between their scattered territories 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.830
 an authentic way of cultural expansion 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.510
 today a flow will be felt even in very distant points like the peninsula 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.290
 Iberian 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.720
 in the fifth century before Christ 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.430
 it is considered as the starting point of a period rich in cultural achievements 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.680
 in social and political transformations and in conflictive situations 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.870
 in this period called archaic that goes until the twentieth century 'this before 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.869
 Christ begins to gestate the importance of Sparta and Athens 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.979
 while colonial expansion 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.210
 favors the expansion of the Greek bond 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.450
 the sixth century is the stage of consolidation of the Greek character 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.630
 especially from the great test that supposes its confrontation with the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.439
 Persians in medical wars 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.040
 during the fifth century and part of the body before Christ 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.770
 the classic stage after the victories over the Persians in the battles of 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.870
 marathon and salamis the Greeks got a high level that in all 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.760
 the aspects of their culture and they succeeded thanks in part ensure development 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.899
 economic 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:37.709
 the engine that said development was the maritime trade that his merchants 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.019
 excellent navigators managed to extend throughout the Mediterranean 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.869
 leaning on the colonies that were creating along their coasts 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.279
 The commercial rotax followed the coasts of southern Europe 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:54.619
 trading with the Etruscans in the Italian peninsula and known in the 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:56.189
 Iberian Peninsula 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.650
 the same coasts close before them by the Phoenicians open a path 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.749
 that should be of vital importance to him 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.789
 Mediterranean in the centuries to come 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.950
 Hellenic world and in general for the cultures of the Middle East terra child 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.469
 the west is an unknown but attractive world 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.909
 the confines of the civilized world bounded by the columns of 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.199
 Hercules 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.079
 in the fifth century before Christ the century of Pericles Greece is a mosaic 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.529
 of city states or by the independent iss 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:34.289
 each of them was a political economic social and cultural unit 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:38.939
 autonomous hit in a territory under its domain for agricultural exploitation and 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.079
 livestock 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.170
 the West Bank city made up the polis 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.519
 again the landscape does not serve to explain this fragmentation 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.959
 territorial 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.270
 because the mountainous landscape diego 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.850
 greatly hindered communications between different 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.699
 populations 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:01.489
 in this conglomerate Athens occupies a central position within the world 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.349
 Greek 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.169
 had an excellent port the Piraeus a few kilometers 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.540
 which allowed him to master sailing in the Aegean 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.650
 He also had good supports on the other side of this sea on the coast 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.989
 eastern asia 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.479
 with these bases athens settled down as the police reached a greater development 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.210
 economic social political and artistic among other cities 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.450
 thanks to the commercial agreement that its merchants rulers created in the 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.800
 Mediterranean 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.300
 in that Athenian expansion had much to do without doubt the implementation of a 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.990
 system of democratic government as well as the attention that its citizens 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.180
 they dedicated the archer to the theater to philosophy 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.819
 laying the foundation of our own western culture 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.800
 such expansion of Athens and other papers 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.809
 is reflected in the construction of magnificent works of art 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:56.120
 whose importance transcends the borders of time 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.110
 the parthenon finished building around 432 BC 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.529
 the propyleans 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:06.429
 the erection or the Temple of Athena Nikke in Acropolis of Athens 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.069
 witnessing and magnificent moment that the city through 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.929
 with everything sometimes tomorrow they had always had in front of their great rival 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.800
 Sparta 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.409
 at the end of the fifth century both cities and their respective allies 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:25.029
 they fought in the Peloponnesian War 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:28.309
 this struggle brought about a transformation of the classical world 

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:30.629
 the defeat of Athens 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.889
 it opened a time of clashes of Greek cities with each other that lasted 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.020
 almost the entire fourth century before Christ 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.949
 this climate of instability 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.259
 opened the door to the conquest of all of them by Macedonian and Alexander the Great 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.490
 this conquest supposes for greece the novelty of being under 1 sole command 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.650
 forming the head and an empire that will spread across egypt and the entire east 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.650
 until you get to india 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.300
 little would last however tamagno empire 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.570
 the death of alejandra in the year 332 before Christ 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.140
 meant the division of his empire between his generals and so much place 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.449
 several independent kingdoms 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.050
 the continuous struggles between them and their neighbors will allow rome conquest 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.449
 aggressions and the second before our era 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.139
 since then Greece became a Roman province 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.120
 the stage that goes 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.690
 from the death of Alejandro until the year 30 before Christ 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.410
 At the time Augustus seized Rome is called the mystic period 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:36.229
 Athens 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.919
 continues to retain its ancient prestige as a cultural and artistic focus 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.270
 although yes what it is as a person 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.309
 Rhodes 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:46.580
 which andria 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.979
 they will be in charge of the realization of the main artistic manifestations 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.979
 Discreet by the end of ancient Greek culture 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:58.639
 the direct contact that blurs with ideas and in which diego 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.419
 as well as the adoption of almost all of its accomplishments as its own 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.139
 will allow the survival of Hellenic culture that from then on 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.990
 become part of Western civilization
