shampoos<00:02:40.430> like<00:02:40.880> these<00:02:41.510> are<00:02:41.750> probably<00:02:42.110> not

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
shampoos like these are probably not

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.340 
shampoos like these are probably not
cheap<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.890> ship<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:44.660> don't<00:02:44.930> live<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.200> the

cheap to ship and I don't live in the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.110 
cheap to ship and I don't live in the
state<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:45.800> it<00:02:45.920> probably<00:02:46.340> cost<00:02:46.640> some<00:02:46.790> more<00:02:46.940> son

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
can't really tell the blue one but I've

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.120 
can't really tell the blue one but I've
used<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:56.840> both<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.140> exact<00:02:57.380> same<00:02:57.560> amount<00:02:57.680> and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
used in both the exact same amount and

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.330 
used in both the exact same amount and
I've<00:02:58.610> used<00:02:58.880> about<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.930> much<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.070> I

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
I've used about that much of it so I

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.040 
I've used about that much of it so I
definitely<00:03:01.489> gave<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.209> fit<00:03:02.480> well<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:02.810> guess<00:03:02.959> to

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
definitely gave it a fit well I guess to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.080 
definitely gave it a fit well I guess to
here<00:03:03.200> that's<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.470> wood<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.860> gave<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.850> fair

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
here that's the wood I gave it a fair

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.680 
here that's the wood I gave it a fair
shot<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.890> testing<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.010> out<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:08.090> my<00:03:08.390> first

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
shot of testing it out so my first

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.990 
shot of testing it out so my first
initial<00:03:09.170> thoughts<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.860> were<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.340> smell<00:03:10.700> I

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
initial thoughts of it were the smell I

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.420 
initial thoughts of it were the smell I
thought<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.690> they<00:03:11.810> smell<00:03:12.080> fantastic<00:03:12.440> um

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
thought that they smell fantastic um

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.250 
thought that they smell fantastic um
they<00:03:14.360> both<00:03:14.600> are<00:03:15.040> um<00:03:16.930> quite<00:03:18.280> ariana<00:03:19.450> GU<00:03:20.450> ara<00:03:21.049> and

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
they both are um quite ariana GU ara and

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.350 
they both are um quite ariana GU ara and
I'm<00:03:21.500> not<00:03:21.739> really<00:03:21.980> sure<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.640> thought<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:23.269> was

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
I'm not really sure I thought it was

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.390 
I'm not really sure I thought it was
glava<00:03:23.630> at<00:03:23.900> first<00:03:24.140> but<00:03:24.440> then<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:24.709> looked<00:03:25.280> at

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
glava at first but then I just looked at

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.100 
glava at first but then I just looked at
the<00:03:25.549> title<00:03:25.850> of<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:26.150> suck<00:03:26.360> but<00:03:26.630> anyway<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:26.959> think

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
the title of it suck but anyway I think

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.960 
the title of it suck but anyway I think
it<00:03:27.320> smells<00:03:27.620> mostly<00:03:28.160> like<00:03:28.250> ginger<00:03:28.549> and<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:28.790> says

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
it smells mostly like ginger and it says

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.520 
it smells mostly like ginger and it says
and<00:03:29.180> ginger<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.600> there<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.230> go

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
and ginger so there you go

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.330 
and ginger so there you go
but<00:03:31.010> yeah<00:03:31.450> um<00:03:32.450> they<00:03:32.690> both<00:03:32.840> smell<00:03:33.340> fantabulous

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
so yeah um the second thing is um the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.330 
so yeah um the second thing is um the
the<00:04:05.750> consistency<00:04:06.410> like<00:04:06.620> when<00:04:06.739> you<00:04:06.829> put<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:07.130> on

the consistency like when you put it on

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.210 
the consistency like when you put it on
um<00:04:08.019> well<00:04:09.019> with<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.380> shampoo<00:04:09.739> I<00:04:09.769> started

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
um well with the shampoo I started

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.800 
um well with the shampoo I started
putting<00:04:10.459> it<00:04:10.549> on<00:04:10.640> and<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:11.060> noticed<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.570> was

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
putting it on and I noticed that it was

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.000 
putting it on and I noticed that it was
very<00:04:12.140> um<00:04:14.140> how<00:04:15.140> can<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.320> describe<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.769> I<00:04:15.829> guess

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
very um how can I describe it I guess

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.279 
very um how can I describe it I guess
it's<00:04:16.160> like<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:16.700> doesn't<00:04:17.060> set<00:04:17.299> up<00:04:17.510> very<00:04:17.810> well<00:04:17.900> so

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
it's like it doesn't set up very well so

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.509 
it's like it doesn't set up very well so
I<00:04:18.320> was<00:04:18.470> thinking<00:04:18.769> all<00:04:18.919> is<00:04:19.100> gonna<00:04:19.280> work<00:04:19.459> great

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
I was thinking all is gonna work great

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.170 
I was thinking all is gonna work great
because<00:04:19.910> um<00:04:20.979> higher-end<00:04:21.979> shampoos<00:04:22.610> don't

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
because um higher-end shampoos don't

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.730 
because um higher-end shampoos don't
have<00:04:23.419> something<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.260> I'm<00:04:24.349> not<00:04:24.380> really<00:04:24.620> sure

still going in there and like I don't

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.990 
still going in there and like I don't
know<00:06:14.210> I<00:06:14.479> just<00:06:14.539> I<00:06:14.960> never<00:06:15.740> had<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.280> shampoo<00:06:16.789> like

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
know I just I never had a shampoo like

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.760 
know I just I never had a shampoo like
this<00:06:17.210> before<00:06:17.599> it's<00:06:17.750> it's<00:06:17.900> own<00:06:18.020> thing<00:06:18.289> and<00:06:18.680> I'm

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
this before it's it's own thing and I'm

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.800 
this before it's it's own thing and I'm
really<00:06:18.919> disappointed<00:06:19.130> because<00:06:19.610> I<00:06:20.150> thought<00:06:20.509> it

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
really disappointed because I thought it

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.580 
really disappointed because I thought it
would<00:06:20.870> be<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:22.280> would<00:06:22.400> be<00:06:22.430> great<00:06:22.819> I<00:06:23.060> mean<00:06:23.590> but

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
would be it would be great I mean but

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.839 
would be it would be great I mean but
but<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:24.949> conditioner<00:06:25.340> I<00:06:25.370> think<00:06:25.580> is<00:06:25.639> pretty

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
but the conditioner I think is pretty

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.219 
but the conditioner I think is pretty
good<00:06:26.000> I<00:06:26.060> think<00:06:26.330> if<00:06:26.449> you<00:06:26.599> were<00:06:26.719> to<00:06:26.870> use<00:06:27.020> this

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
good I think if you were to use this

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.580 
good I think if you were to use this
without<00:06:27.729> the<00:06:28.729> shampoo<00:06:29.150> it<00:06:29.330> would<00:06:29.449> be<00:06:29.659> it<00:06:30.500> would

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
without the shampoo it would be it would

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.309 
without the shampoo it would be it would
probably<00:06:30.860> be<00:06:30.949> really<00:06:31.069> good<00:06:31.219> so<00:06:31.930> I<00:06:32.930> might

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
probably be really good so I might

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:36.159 
probably be really good so I might
