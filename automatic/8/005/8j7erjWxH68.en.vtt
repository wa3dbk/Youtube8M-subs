00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 one of you to all welcome to the 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.270
 review of the human naruto 693 manga 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.340
 we must as you know that you really attack 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.870
 to cure and apparently it's like creation of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.849
 those that has completely changed has 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.400
 grabbed a bipolarity of those typical 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.660
 of him and as face is totally 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.270
 sinister not in the previous marks 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.310
 I help naruto to trotta the hood 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.109
 he seemed so honest and suddenly pum 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.490
 heights me so good a chapter the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.230
 it's true that he left quite short 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.670
 there was no action or I thought that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.710
 in this chapter we are going to see the full 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.240
 Naruto battle against those that but 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.890
 we simply have presented a 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.210
 little the stage and I think he's capable of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.670
 to do those that he has also revealed to us 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.260
 certain intentions so to speak in 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.270
 end before starting also to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.469
 comment the chapter I would like to give you 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.149
 thanks to everyone who reviewed 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.250
 of the last manga comments stage or 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.079
 you subscribed that you even distei like 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.430
 the truth that you helped me a lot 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.870
 thank you for that and now we are going to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.579
 start commenting on things more 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.890
 important a little more in detail 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.270
 of this manga you know what he wants 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.399
 make the virus so give me 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.809
 I'll have this manga is to leave them there for 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.609
 that does not intervene in the battle of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.280
 Naruto also says that you have to 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.870
 destroy the viruses themselves and to finish 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.250
 with the billions you will need to kill 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.610
 naruto that is to say here we see that the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.950
 intentions of those 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.360
 is to beat Naruto defeat him in plan 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.280
 leave him unconscious no no 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.320
 this son of the great whore really what 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.030
 wants to kill or be the bipolarity that he 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.380
 has seized is is very strong today to 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.850
 get to kill someone who has 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.920
 been helping during all this 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.810
 battle for a fucking revolution or for 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.370
 I would be shit and one thing is that it says 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.400
 if you leave the viruses out then you can 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.990
 annoy and taltal and also fuck him like that 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.340
 to the button or because after all that 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.900
 They have helped him heal I get Bhutto 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.220
 deprive them of their freedom as it is something 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.780
 that in the car he fucks him is not that 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.490
 like to click on to taste and for that 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.200
 I also feel that in part it has 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.420
 done this shut up the viruses in this 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.479
 species of chivas cut itself also 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.160
 we see here a little unsa shusaku very fail 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.540
 because that cure makes him more or less 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.250
 he communicates the same to him 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.410
 communicated if I remember correctly before 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.640
 end up in something normal just when 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.920
 You know he left with the villa 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.899
 hidden from the sound where I put a le 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.270
 I said that is that I wish I had a 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.649
 little bit of your heart really I 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.240
 I would like you to come back here 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.200
 let's go back to form that team 7 so 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.820
 great that we had formed 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.550
 I previously believe that all this will come back 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.860
 to be as before but it is rough sas that 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.540
 his cure another thing that go directly to 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.130
 for this reason and crossing this is something 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.450
 quite confusing because we see how you know 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.370
 you go through cure 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.110
 they tell us something that apparently you know that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.700
 what this is to use a gay yushu 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.290
 towards sakura is to say that right now or 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.730
 sakura is in an illusion and this makes 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.989
 basically so that that cure does not 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.430
 this is this is very repetitive the 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.110
 true that we wanted two in this handle 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.030
 uses the resource he used in that 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.920
 man gap specifically since I do not know about 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.480
 cuts well but I think you know that 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.550
 in the normal naruto well he also did 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.019
 that not that of just when the cure 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.880
 he realizes that those he wants 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.860
 go with the bad guys so to speak 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.239
 He used an in yushu to it as 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.860
 does the same but in this case not 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.989
 it seems bad color if you do not stop to fight 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.670
 against naruto in a lonely way is 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.980
 careful way that is to which they are very much 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.769
 trying to go alone with naruto to see if 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.599
 the intentions of this one are different 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.220
 I callus stopped thinking evil and 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.470
 scenario that we have for this epic 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.510
 battle is that valley of the fallen and 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.459
 again like in the normal naruto that 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.989
 valley where they fought justly I have 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.180
 said before I started in adults and I could 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.500
 where this epic battle was held 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.599
 I wish we wanted all the 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.700
 again to encourage or be in plan that the 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.650
 will change no but I say it was equal 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.390
 epic that which was that time and good 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.950
 I hope this one is also longer 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.390
 although we tell a little more about 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.190
 intentions of those that since the end 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.780
 we see a scene where those who say 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.580
 to taste that has a very idea 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.890
 touched upon to what he refers to 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.510
 that become hacker naruto 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.700
 also does not mention here that in 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.350
 really a game that can not be or 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.150
 suddenly charge and have everyone look at them 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.610
 but be rebellious have to admire 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.380
 and subsequently to be admired seriously 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.270
 shit that's something that the truth is that 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.220
 They have much reason I think it is 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.750
 he said and crossed out the vote and completely 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.280
 no agreement and because of this they have many 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.989
 possibilities also to be naruto the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.400
 own hockey since the villa by 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.470
 defeat the comb etc. and so on 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.150
 for really he has started to look at 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.440
 Naruto and is a great candidate to be 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.450
 I play for this that we just 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.560
 comment right now and one we have a 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.480
 little like kaka if it's totally 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.910
 burst and know how to use sessa lingÃ¡n 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.330
 it was calculated as saying I can not 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.489
 plus 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.050
 saski son of a bitch you think this is 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.120
 that uses the viruses that it has 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.800
 locked in the chivas cut in 6 or 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.780
 this is a little crazy is not something like that 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.310
 that dissolved it in plan by releasing something 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.900
 but you think that is what is going to 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.610
 get those viruses that you have 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.860
 locked in those chivas cut balls 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.769
 in 6 and he will use them for his 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.570
 own help to send everyone out of their 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.639
 dreams is not over with his healing a 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.070
 infinite and even you think that is capable 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.400
 of killing Naruto killing Kaka Yes and 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.590
 of killing that good cure something 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.810
 also by the way that I forgot 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.220
 we see something in plan observing everything 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.840
 I trust you but I stay here is 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.130
 that I do not want to see myself involved 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.660
 in this battle in which I stay here 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.190
 I 'm very good looking at that and good 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.139
 what is basically commented on the 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.780
 fact that he uses those that the 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.759
 virus and its own power to save 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.500
 all of your infinite body and do as 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.210
 if he were the super savior because of course 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.770
 no witnesses have not killed kakÃ¡ if 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.509
 has killed the priest killed in bushes 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.430
 it's a little crazy intentions 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.990
 but knowing the bipolarity that he has 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.310
 caught this one I think he's capable of 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.350
 because it's like faces totally 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.030
 sinister like he does not care to kill 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.070
 as if it crosses sakura as if it 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.139
 part of the face almost like the balls 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.210
 everything he does or does not care 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.160
 basically he wants to change everything 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.960
 the ninja system and he does it his way 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.400
 I do not think I did not leave anything 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.600
 for commenting to comment to you what 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.520
 This chapter that has 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.810
 like that shusaku fail of music 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.340
 This day if you liked is that I 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.870
 It helps a lot even as I say goodbye here 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.070
 subscribe not to miss any video 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.990
 I say goodbye here we'll see you in the 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.990
 next come kids until then 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.680
 i 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.960
 after it charges
