we can't do that unfortunately at least
for<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.420> moment<00:01:54.659> 4j<00:01:55.259> Studios<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.860> creator<00:01:56.130> of

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
for the moment 4j Studios the creator of

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.200 
for the moment 4j Studios the creator of
the<00:01:56.280> game<00:01:56.399> are<00:01:56.729> trying<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.960> work<00:01:58.680> out<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.369> way<00:01:59.640> to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the game are trying to work out a way to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.510 
the game are trying to work out a way to
be<00:02:00.329> able<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.689> enlarge<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.619> converted<00:02:02.100> world<00:02:02.340> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
be able to enlarge a converted world and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.010 
be able to enlarge a converted world and
I<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:02.909> they'll<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.360> able<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:03.990> I

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
I think they'll be able to do it so I

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.859 
I think they'll be able to do it so I
think<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> near<00:02:04.979> future<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:06.000> will<00:02:06.810> be

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
think in the near future it will be

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.710 
think in the near future it will be
possible<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.940> will<00:02:09.060> be<00:02:09.119> able<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.509> then

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
possible to do we will be able to then

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.750 
possible to do we will be able to then
enlarge<00:02:10.110> our<00:02:10.319> worlds<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.099> I'm<00:02:11.400> keeping<00:02:11.610> me

on it absolutely drew me nuts

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.519 
on it absolutely drew me nuts
which<00:05:38.969> is<00:05:39.090> why<00:05:39.240> all<00:05:39.300> my<00:05:39.599> videos<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.139> music<00:05:40.440> is

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 
which is why all my videos the music is

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.610

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
really like the ambience music so I'd

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.409 
really like the ambience music so I'd
never<00:05:47.190> know<00:05:47.370> I<00:05:47.400> might<00:05:47.520> actually<00:05:47.789> just<00:05:48.000> turn
