00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.609 

nothing<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.539> different<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.140> come<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.500> into

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
nothing really different I come out into

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.520 
nothing really different I come out into
the<00:01:04.710> play<00:01:04.860> hard<00:01:05.070> every<00:01:05.309> game<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:06.200> just<00:01:07.200> paid<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the play hard every game I just paid a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.780 
the play hard every game I just paid a
little<00:01:07.770> bit<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.010> attention<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.340> detail<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
little bit more attention to detail and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:24.200 
little bit more attention to detail and
everything<00:01:22.430> we<00:01:23.430> work<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.700> them<00:01:23.850> practice

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
everything we work on them practice

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.990 
everything we work on them practice
every<00:01:24.450> day<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:26.400> press<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.640> drills<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
every day all the press and drills and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.160 
every day all the press and drills and
everything<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> think<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.810> carrying

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
everything so I think it's just carrying

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.440 
everything so I think it's just carrying
over<00:01:28.259> from<00:01:28.320> practice<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> again<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:33.090> guys<00:01:33.240> you

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
right now that's one of the main things

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.620 
right now that's one of the main things
we<00:01:55.140> got<00:01:55.320> working<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:56.149> when<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.240> come<00:01:57.390> back<00:01:57.509> from

we got working on when we come back from
vacation<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:58.530> got<00:01:58.649> really<00:01:58.830> working

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
vacation I think we got really working

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.210 
vacation I think we got really working
on<00:01:59.250> getting<00:01:59.789> rebounds<00:02:00.799> getting<00:02:01.799> more<00:02:01.979> loose

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
on getting rebounds getting more loose

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.840 
on getting rebounds getting more loose
balls

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
balls

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.880 
balls
I<00:02:02.880> mean<00:02:03.420> we're<00:02:03.600> scrappy<00:02:04.049> team<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.320> mean<00:02:04.470> we<00:02:04.770> need

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
I mean we're scrappy team I mean we need

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.109 
I mean we're scrappy team I mean we need
the<00:02:05.009> biggest<00:02:05.340> team<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> world<00:02:05.850> so

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the biggest team in the world so

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.089 
the biggest team in the world so
sometimes<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:07.049> won't<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.350> all<00:02:07.439> rebounds<00:02:07.979> and

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
sometimes we won't get all rebounds and

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.160 
sometimes we won't get all rebounds and
stuff<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.569> think<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.050> just

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
stuff like that but I just think we just

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.750 
stuff like that but I just think we just
need<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> focus<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.069> more<00:02:11.280> I'll<00:02:11.640> be

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
need to focus on that more I'll be

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.550 
need to focus on that more I'll be
focusing<00:02:12.120> or<00:02:12.239> anything<00:02:12.390> else<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.840> rebounding

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
focusing or anything else is rebounding

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.650 
focusing or anything else is rebounding
so<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.519> next<00:02:14.700> couple<00:02:14.940> weeks<00:02:14.970> we'd<00:02:15.540> be

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
so I know the next couple weeks we'd be

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.360 
so I know the next couple weeks we'd be
doing<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.019> lot<00:02:16.170> boxing<00:02:16.890> out<00:02:16.980> drills

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
doing that a lot boxing out drills

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.699 
doing that a lot boxing out drills
getting<00:02:18.150> getting<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> ball<00:02:18.989> above<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.350> rim

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
getting getting the ball above the rim

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.740 
getting getting the ball above the rim
so<00:02:19.950> hopefully<00:02:20.910> we<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.540> next

I try one of them to prepare you for the
for<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> ASUW<00:02:38.519> tournament<00:02:39.269> because<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.569> is

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
for the ASUW tournament because this is

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.729 
for the ASUW tournament because this is
exactly<00:02:39.780> how<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.319> going<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.530> be<00:02:40.590> in<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
exactly how it's going to be in the

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.229 
exactly how it's going to be in the
tournament<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.370> gonna<00:02:41.549> play<00:02:41.700> games<00:02:41.910> back<00:02:42.209> to

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
tournament you gonna play games back to

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.300 
tournament you gonna play games back to
back<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:43.109> if<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.350> went<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.680> tournaments<00:02:44.130> now

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
back so if you went in tournaments now

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.370 
back so if you went in tournaments now
is<00:02:44.970> more<00:02:45.239> prepared<00:02:45.390> for<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.930> sort<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.290> as

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
is more prepared for that sort of as

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.199 
is more prepared for that sort of as
later<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.040> season<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.880> think<00:02:47.940> this

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
later on in the season so I think this

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.330 
later on in the season so I think this
was<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.359> big<00:02:48.540> one<00:02:48.690> plug<00:02:48.989> five<00:02:49.620> team<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.160> for<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
was a big one plug five team and for the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.549 
was a big one plug five team and for the
program
