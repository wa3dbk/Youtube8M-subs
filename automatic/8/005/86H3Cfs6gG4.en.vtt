00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello everyone, glad to welcome you on 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.359
 game revizor channel with you has 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.090
 you know, even though I played and yes 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.010
 and z and in war z on no infestation i'm not 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.929
 I love these games, I understand that they 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.030
 directed to a specific audience that have 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.520
 they have their own Russian community which 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.490
 loves these games but it's not mine, I 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 I consider both boring and uninteresting topics 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.000
 less relatively recently in service 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.490
 digital distribution steam appeared 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.470
 nazar game and despite the fact that i knew 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 that in fact the game is similarly named 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 Earlier, I was all kind of hoping that 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.980
 maybe she 'll like me 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.920
 Unfortunately, I was wrong, however, immediately 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.110
 I will make a reservation at the time of creating the review game 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.030
 is in beta test and maybe 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.309
 in the future, the developers will change something 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.289
 something will add or remove and and said 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.149
 in this review will be irrelevant therefore 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.399
 When viewing a review, please do this 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.559
 discount and treat this review as 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.180
 beta test review is only about 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.250
 the fact that there is a beta test 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.010
 and what on this beta test yes in fact 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.930
 nothing is a ruined city 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 lagging by the way we are 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.060
 filaments surviving in this ruined city 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.400
 there are other survivors and there are hordes 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.590
 monsters up down and the developers decided 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.330
 be different and the place of zombies will be us 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.240
 chase the monsters and several 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.920
 different types and with different abilities 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.200
 this is essentially the only difference from 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.900
 daisy from our task is to find among 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.700
 ruins food weapons and useful items 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.560
 we can sell these items 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.390
 special safety zone so that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 money to buy even more 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.860
 good weapons and items 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.140
 all the usual banal survived to not 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.119
 plot is not some kind of development 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.460
 gameplay is built on what we need 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.000
 walk neatly among the ruins to look for 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.040
 items 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.930
 and do it as quietly as possible 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.600
 kill you at least one only monsters but also 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.180
 other players and trust me they are 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.340
 adore but meeting with other monsters and 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.290
 other players are quite rare in 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.110
 mostly we have to crawl and 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.850
 crawl and crawl need to really give 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.829
 some things due to developers 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.329
 they have turned out much more interesting than 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.829
 up from this lebanese 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.259
 for example, I liked the system 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.730
 hand-to-hand combat monsters represent 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.100
 serious threat but 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.400
 and kill them you can generally easily 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.230
 importantly dynamic and interesting with graphics 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.270
 too, all is not the same can not be said 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.740
 that schedule but delightful 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.050
 at least enough for 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.490
 This kind of level games however and here 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.410
 there are problems and in some places 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.880
 conflicts occur scheme of action 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.560
 between the models bringing 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.570
 invisible walls appear which 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.850
 have to get around the most sophisticated 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.620
 methods, however, write it on beta 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.160
 tests for the hope that the loan is 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.620
 will fix 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.540
 and tightened maybe in the future game and 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.940
 It will be interesting and at the moment it 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.800
 not so after about 20 minutes of playing me 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.690
 I wanted to sleep because of the battle with 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.240
 monsters though are certain 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.950
 action but they are rare and even those later 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.350
 for a while they tire everything else 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.020
 time is boring and dull crawling over to 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.210
 ruins if you thought taking a game or 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.280
 No, I think that at the moment it is 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.410
 not worth the least 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.560
 wait for its release and after that 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.120
 maybe she will be more attracted we 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.070
 Be sure to wait for the game and 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.350
 look at it again but for now 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.270
 nazar moment will be interesting only ardent 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.880
 a fan and z everything else we are 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.550
 advise not rush to buy it all 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.550
