starts<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.140> cases<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.980> they're<00:00:47.550> divided<00:00:47.969> up

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
starts with cases and they're divided up

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.290 
starts with cases and they're divided up
into<00:00:48.539> six<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.829> compartments<00:00:50.789> that's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
into six little compartments that's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.959 
into six little compartments that's
standard<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:52.079> most<00:00:52.110> batteries<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.640> what's

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
standard with most batteries but what's

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.810 
standard with most batteries but what's
inside<00:00:54.899> each<00:00:54.980> compartment<00:00:55.980> you'll<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
inside each compartment you'll see that

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.510 
inside each compartment you'll see that
there<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.120> series<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.629> lead<00:00:57.989> grids<00:00:58.520> they

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
there are a series of lead grids they

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.979 
there are a series of lead grids they
won't<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.840> they're

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
won't be like this because they're

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.770 
won't be like this because they're
actually<00:01:01.379> coated<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:02.280> lead<00:01:02.579> oxide<00:01:03.300> paste

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
actually coated with lead oxide paste

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.039 
actually coated with lead oxide paste
and<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.760> reacts<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.790> sulfuric<00:01:06.510> acid<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and that reacts with sulfuric acid and

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.880 
and that reacts with sulfuric acid and
makes<00:01:07.229> electricity<00:01:08.450> they<00:01:09.450> also<00:01:09.659> put<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.680> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
makes electricity they also put in a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
makes electricity they also put in a
little<00:01:11.310> envelope<00:01:11.490> called<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.330> separator<00:01:12.900> or

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
little envelope called a separator or

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.890 
little envelope called a separator or
the<00:01:13.799> acid<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.520> through<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.939> okay<00:01:15.360> but

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the acid can get through this okay but

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.450 
the acid can get through this okay but
it<00:01:16.020> causes<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.770> electricity<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.700> made<00:01:19.460> it

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it causes the electricity to be made it

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.240 
it causes the electricity to be made it
also<00:01:20.700> helps<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.140> separator<00:01:22.680> has<00:01:23.009> some

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
also helps if the separator has some

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.840 
also helps if the separator has some

the past six or eight weeks but there
are<00:02:09.869> some<00:02:09.959> dramatic<00:02:10.500> differences<00:02:11.160> for

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
are some dramatic differences for

this<00:02:13.620> one<00:02:13.830> he<00:02:14.010> was<00:02:14.040> labeled<00:02:14.370> up<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> 100<00:02:15.690> amp

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930

this one he was labeled up as a 100 amp
hour<00:02:16.200> battery<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:17.280> yet<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.580> tiny<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.240> that

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
hour battery and yet it's tiny in that

hour battery and yet it's tiny in that
not<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.050> case<00:02:19.380> but<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.770> plates<00:02:20.130> as<00:02:20.400> well

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
not just the case but the plates as well

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.490 
not just the case but the plates as well
what's<00:02:20.910> going<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.330> here<00:02:21.630> well<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.350> classic

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
what's going on here well it's a classic

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.770 
what's going on here well it's a classic
case<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.190> they<00:02:23.310> were<00:02:23.370> saving<00:02:23.730> on<00:02:23.970> money<00:02:24.240> the

case that they were saving on money the
lead<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.890> many<00:02:26.190> school<00:02:26.580> look<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
lead in that is is many school look the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.510 
lead in that is is many school look the
height<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.870> plate<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.350> nowhere<00:02:28.770> near<00:02:28.830> the

height of the plate is nowhere near the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.320 
height of the plate is nowhere near the
height<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> case<00:02:31.130> for<00:02:32.130> instance<00:02:32.330> there's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
height of the case for instance there's

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.880 
height of the case for instance there's
such<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> problem<00:02:33.870> here<00:02:34.200> they've<00:02:34.410> had<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.740> make

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
such a problem here they've had to make

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.100 
such a problem here they've had to make
this<00:02:35.040> pillar<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.760> top<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.510> actually<00:02:36.840> reach

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
this pillar on the top to actually reach

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.550 
this pillar on the top to actually reach
the<00:02:37.440> top<00:02:37.680> no<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:39.060> won't<00:02:39.360> perform<00:02:39.660> Andy<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.500> is

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the top no it won't perform Andy it is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.310 
the top no it won't perform Andy it is
absolutely<00:02:41.400> useless<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.420> saving<00:02:42.840> money

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
absolutely useless it's saving money

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.980 
absolutely useless it's saving money
right<00:02:43.820> well<00:02:44.820> that's<00:02:45.090> telling<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.780> is

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
right well that's telling it like it is

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.270 
right well that's telling it like it is
by<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.260> way<00:02:46.350> don't<00:02:46.650> do<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.040> at<00:02:47.250> home

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
by the way don't do this at home

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.000 
by the way don't do this at home
whatever<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:48.030> do<00:02:48.240> it's<00:02:48.420> nasty<00:02:49.020> stuff<00:02:49.320> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
whatever you do it's nasty stuff the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.520 
whatever you do it's nasty stuff the
stuff<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.400> get<00:02:50.580> inside<00:02:51.000> batteries<00:02:51.600> what

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
stuff you get inside batteries what

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.250 
stuff you get inside batteries what
about<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.880> John<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.690> noticed<00:02:55.140> it

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
about this one here John I noticed it

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.500 
about this one here John I noticed it
was<00:02:55.410> white<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.980> it's<00:02:56.340> actually<00:02:56.580> got<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.970> couple

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
was white and it's actually got a couple

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.270 
was white and it's actually got a couple
of<00:02:57.720> holes<00:02:57.959> with<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> paste<00:02:58.590> falling<00:02:59.040> out<00:02:59.160> and

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
of holes with a paste falling out and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.590 
of holes with a paste falling out and
yet<00:02:59.400> it's<00:02:59.550> supposed<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.940> be<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.120> brand<00:03:00.390> new

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
yet it's supposed to be a brand new

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.280 
yet it's supposed to be a brand new
battery<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:02.060> think<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.180> classic<00:03:03.420> case<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:04.080> is

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
battery I think the classic case here is

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.770 
battery I think the classic case here is
that<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:05.100> it's<00:03:05.459> actually<00:03:06.000> an<00:03:06.120> old<00:03:06.300> battery

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
that it's it's actually an old battery

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.380 
that it's it's actually an old battery
that<00:03:06.959> sat<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.590> shelf<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.130> some<00:03:08.610> time<00:03:08.910> and

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
that sat on the shelf for some time and

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.990 
that sat on the shelf for some time and
it<00:03:10.020> lost<00:03:10.290> its<00:03:10.560> charge<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.310> when<00:03:11.490> it<00:03:11.610> gets<00:03:11.730> down

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
it lost its charge and when it gets down

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.860 
it lost its charge and when it gets down
to<00:03:12.209> twelve<00:03:12.600> point<00:03:13.350> two<00:03:13.770> volts<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:14.850> starts<00:03:15.720> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
to twelve point two volts it starts to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.490 
to twelve point two volts it starts to
develop<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.670> sulphate<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.720> surface<00:03:19.230> and

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
develop a sulphate on the surface and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.280 
develop a sulphate on the surface and
that<00:03:19.530> gets<00:03:20.489> worse<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.060> worse<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:22.050> then

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
that gets worse and worse and it then

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.160 
that gets worse and worse and it then
can't<00:03:22.620> perform<00:03:22.890> at<00:03:23.220> all<00:03:23.430> last<00:03:24.360> year's<00:03:24.720> model

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
can't perform at all last year's model

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.580 
can't perform at all last year's model
being<00:03:25.709> sold<00:03:26.100> this<00:03:26.519> year<00:03:26.750> Wow<00:03:27.810> Oh

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
all over the top it's getting between

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.009 
all over the top it's getting between
the<00:03:46.470> plates<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:47.100> even<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.060> best<00:03:48.390> charger<00:03:48.900> in

the plates and even the best charger in
the<00:03:49.140> world<00:03:49.350> isn't<00:03:49.739> gonna<00:03:50.070> get<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.519> one<00:03:50.760> back

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
the world isn't gonna get this one back

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.580 
the world isn't gonna get this one back
to<00:03:51.510> its<00:03:51.660> original<00:03:51.810> state

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
to its original state

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.650 
to its original state
and<00:03:53.070> yet<00:03:53.220> it's<00:03:53.340> virtually<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.760> brand<00:03:54.120> new<00:03:54.420> back

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
and yet it's virtually a brand new back

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.620 
and yet it's virtually a brand new back
and<00:03:54.840> yet<00:03:54.989> its<00:03:55.140> brand<00:03:55.470> new<00:03:55.880> goodness<00:03:56.880> me<00:03:57.150> I

and yet its brand new goodness me I

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.970 
and yet its brand new goodness me I
think<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.200> surprising<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:58.950> perhaps

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
think that the surprising and perhaps

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.070 
think that the surprising and perhaps
shocking<00:03:59.850> thing<00:04:00.180> about<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.660> batteries<00:04:00.989> that

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
shocking thing about the batteries that

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.930 
shocking thing about the batteries that
we've<00:04:01.230> looked<00:04:01.440> at<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:01.860> if<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.070> go<00:04:02.220> by<00:04:02.400> the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
we've looked at is that if you go by the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.600 
we've looked at is that if you go by the
size<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.810> weight<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.680> design<00:04:05.160> of<00:04:05.430> these

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
size the weight the design of these

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.780 
size the weight the design of these
cells<00:04:06.299> it<00:04:07.080> shows<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.010> batteries<00:04:08.489> really

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
cells it shows that the batteries really

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.500 
cells it shows that the batteries really
have<00:04:09.590> probably<00:04:10.590> starter<00:04:11.400> batteries<00:04:11.790> there's

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
have probably starter batteries there's

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.630 
have probably starter batteries there's
one<00:04:12.630> exception<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.440> here<00:04:14.070> it<00:04:14.160> is<00:04:14.220> John<00:04:14.489> tell

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
one exception and here it is John tell

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.469 
one exception and here it is John tell
us<00:04:14.730> about<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.120> well<00:04:16.109> quite<00:04:16.350> clearly<00:04:17.090> all<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
us about this well quite clearly all the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.880 
us about this well quite clearly all the
plates<00:04:18.720> there<00:04:19.080> are<00:04:19.260> heavy<00:04:19.910> it's<00:04:20.910> tall<00:04:21.269> and

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
plates there are heavy it's tall and

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.920 
plates there are heavy it's tall and
also<00:04:22.890> there's<00:04:23.160> fiberglass<00:04:23.789> pressing<00:04:24.450> against

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
also there's fiberglass pressing against

also there's fiberglass pressing against
the<00:04:25.020> separator<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.919> keep<00:04:26.250> that

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
the separator to keep that

thought but next time we go out shopping
for<00:04:58.280> a<00:04:58.699> leisure<00:04:59.270> battery

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409
