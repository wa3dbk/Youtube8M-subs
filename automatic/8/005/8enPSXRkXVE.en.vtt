00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.590
 hi guys back with a new one 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.790
 episode of the climb I repeat also in 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.010
 this video he has right now 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.540
 that if they don't answer the comments will be 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.720
 because right now I'm on an excursion 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.560
 I was having fun on the nega face 9 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.120
 I'm kidding anyway for the pan de re 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.740
 if you want a reply, he had to 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.360
 wait for Friday 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.920
 I also tell you that if in this 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.199
 episode I will begin to say things without 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.270
 meaning you have to understand me why in a day 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.860
 today and Sunday I'm preparing three videos 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.989
 one for Monday 1 for Tuesday 1 for one 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.030
 so what am i really talking about from 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.840
 a lot of time and I'm getting tired of 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.489
 ugly 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.170
 then the first game this is the 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.270
 second game of the second of the 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.890
 division team we start right away wrong 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.440
 in fact patience makes us a goal 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.270
 you will see this when it has a lot 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.500
 pine tree in the years rebounds as in the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.000
 first goal 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.059
 the board the climb nevertheless does not fit 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.330
 to a star I urge then study we do 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.149
 on the 22nd goal very very very nice 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.009
 with kone that really gets into these two 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.300
 matches will be unleashed to unleash his 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.700
 fury 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.799
 then look at the reds that yes 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.560
 eat a goal already done I did not understand 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.869
 at least how he did it is more difficult to 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.420
 miss those goals you don't speak to 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.170
 twenty-eighth then we take advantage of one 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.090
 new 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.790
 new opportunities and concurs teach 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.380
 the goal of 2 to 1 the game anyway 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.299
 I'm hard fought as you can see 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.100
 opponents will immediately want to recover but 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.710
 in the second half with rabbits we give 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.520
 really the first coup de grace to 59 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.340
 goal of 3 to 1 is immediately after two minutes 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.130
 after more or less with a borini cross 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.750
 with the marks another goal and we can 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.670
 say close the game 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.649
 then asamoah's goal will be in vain 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.350
 they look even if there was a duck 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.909
 of the goalkeeper you don't understand how he did it 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.200
 they are truly absolute cost in this 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.759
 episode 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.770
 the game then ends with the physis 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.780
 with kong state of 4 to 2 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.780
 we conquer the first victory of the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.030
 second division we seek immediately 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.429
 another we immediately look for another 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.250
 game as you can see by now not 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.790
 I will use more physical forms since 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.260
 he permeated some or three substitutes in all 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.630
 roles except goalkeeper goalkeeper 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.519
 I would like to buy julio cesar other but 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.200
 what really too much about 2,000 and 3,000 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.739
 that I don't feel like spending it on a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.040
 goalkeeper 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.180
 in the second game as an opponent 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.920
 stronger risk than wim flight 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.090
 in fact, even this game will be like 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.280
 that of the last episode a lot 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.140
 hard-fought we take the lead immediately 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.120
 in the tenth minute always with is the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.060
 usually he was competing 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.530
 mirallas really after that we go 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.650
 really close to the goal of the two a 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.269
 zero that really would have solved immediately 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.930
 the match 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.130
 I missed a goal anyway it's ok 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.430
 done the 2 to 0 however I am 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.710
 forgot to cut it gerrard reopens 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.380
 the match at 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.600
 at the minute, however, we always go 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.300
 very close to goals you will save yourself in 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.400
 lots of songs in this opponent 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.780
 but then fortunately at the end 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.650
 towards the end of the first half 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.600
 always with the usual score another goal 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.810
 result of 3 to 1 when in the second half 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.370
 but look at simpsons that despite the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.770
 his speed can't hold van 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.840
 if you remember me between two games and 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.080
 open once again 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.280
 but at 60, the 60th will always think about it 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.680
 with him 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.980
 to score another goal one of mine 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.810
 very few goals in precision you see that 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.819
 I feel you always go to power I don't know 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.890
 because the game will still be already 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.800
 open again but d'or munster 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.170
 he made very few goals but very good goals 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.880
 fundamentals closes to close 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.459
 definitely the game we can say 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.160
 but I'm obviously joking because I have to 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.310
 reopen it once again we will go 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.970
 immediately close with ronconi to the goal of 5 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.250
 equal 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.140
 but with the there is also not marked between 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.360
 coni has very few facts and then to the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.910
 ninetieth marks the goal of yes to 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.500
 four to end the game 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.410
 politics therefore fears with this 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.910
 result is we do nothing else like it 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.840
 really a contract for the acmar of 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.340
 which unfortunately had ended with this 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.030
 I greet you I hope this episode there 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.130
 both liked it 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.650
 I know I said something 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.970
 meaningless but 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.610
 no one aware why they are not i 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.360
 botticini to comment anyway I will 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.980
 greeting 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.420
 I ask you to let me like it 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.130
 compensate for the work I'm doing 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.980
 leaving with a small gesture leaving 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.390
 I like the clicking of the button 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.980
 I greet you and tell you to be 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.510
 so i like a comment if it is not 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.960
 always did write to the channel 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.960
 beautiful
