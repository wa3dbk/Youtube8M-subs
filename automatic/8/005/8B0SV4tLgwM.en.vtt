question<00:00:14.950> out<00:00:15.130> there<00:00:15.160> that<00:00:15.880> I<00:00:15.910> have<00:00:16.119> an

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
question out there that I have an

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.960 
question out there that I have an
address<00:00:16.450> so<00:00:16.810> far<00:00:17.020> in<00:00:17.140> these<00:00:17.259> videos<00:00:17.439> is

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
address so far in these videos is

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.029 
address so far in these videos is
creatine<00:00:18.970> monohydrate<00:00:19.320> versus<00:00:20.320> other<00:00:20.619> types

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039 
creatine monohydrate versus other types

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.519 
creatine monohydrate versus other types
of<00:00:21.190> creatine<00:00:21.520> and<00:00:21.880> that's<00:00:22.109> pretty<00:00:23.109> tough<00:00:23.320> to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
of creatine and that's pretty tough to

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.250 
of creatine and that's pretty tough to
address<00:00:23.890> in<00:00:24.070> a<00:00:24.189> short<00:00:24.670> video<00:00:25.020> I'm<00:00:26.020> going<00:00:26.170> to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
address in a short video I'm going to

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.810 
address in a short video I'm going to
repeat<00:00:26.560> something<00:00:27.189> I<00:00:27.340> said<00:00:27.400> in<00:00:27.640> other<00:00:27.730> videos

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
repeat something I said in other videos

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.740 
repeat something I said in other videos
but<00:00:28.240> it's<00:00:28.300> important<00:00:28.990> to<00:00:29.609> listen<00:00:30.609> to<00:00:30.939> which<00:00:31.539> is

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
but it's important to listen to which is

other forms of creatine generally come

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.440 
other forms of creatine generally come
in<00:00:44.829> the<00:00:44.920> latter<00:00:45.129> category<00:00:45.489> that<00:00:45.940> is<00:00:46.120> they<00:00:46.270> have

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
in the latter category that is they have

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.049 
in the latter category that is they have
a<00:00:46.780> first<00:00:47.620> attempt<00:00:47.950> to<00:00:48.010> create<00:00:48.309> a<00:00:48.399> problem<00:00:48.730> with

a first attempt to create a problem with
creatine<00:00:49.480> monohydrate<00:00:49.750> and<00:00:50.289> then<00:00:50.379> solve<00:00:50.620> it

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
creatine monohydrate and then solve it

for<00:00:50.950> you<00:00:51.149> I'm<00:00:52.149> going<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.390> summarize<00:00:52.800> quickly

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
for you I'm going to summarize quickly

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.549 
for you I'm going to summarize quickly
which<00:00:55.120> I<00:00:55.239> think<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:55.510> can<00:00:55.660> apply<00:00:55.870> to<00:00:55.989> most<00:00:56.350> of

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
which I think you can apply to most of

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.970 
which I think you can apply to most of
them<00:00:56.710> which<00:00:57.190> is<00:00:57.340> to<00:00:57.460> say<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.840> drawbacks<00:00:59.770> that

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
them which is to say the drawbacks that

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.619 
them which is to say the drawbacks that
is<00:01:00.190> often<00:01:00.370> listed<00:01:00.760> of<00:01:01.059> creatine<00:01:01.420> monohydrate

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
is often listed of creatine monohydrate

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.609 
is often listed of creatine monohydrate
by<00:01:02.350> competing<00:01:02.770> products<00:01:03.250> are<00:01:03.430> either<00:01:03.609> wrong

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
by competing products are either wrong

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.510 
by competing products are either wrong
bogus<00:01:06.420> unproven<00:01:07.420> or<00:01:07.600> all<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:08.020> above<00:01:08.049> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
bogus unproven or all of the above and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.679 
bogus unproven or all of the above and
then<00:01:09.520> they<00:01:09.729> list<00:01:09.970> as<00:01:10.180> benefits<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.950> their

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
then they list as benefits of their

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.289 
then they list as benefits of their
ulterior<00:01:13.689> forms<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.890> monohydrate<00:01:15.729> are<00:01:16.000> also

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
ulterior forms to monohydrate are also

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.899 
ulterior forms to monohydrate are also
usually<00:01:16.570> unproven<00:01:17.409> wrong<00:01:17.710> or<00:01:17.979> bogus<00:01:18.369> so

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
usually unproven wrong or bogus so

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.149 
usually unproven wrong or bogus so
there's<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.509> pretty<00:01:20.200> nice<00:01:20.560> summary<00:01:20.950> right

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
there's a pretty nice summary right

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.530 
there's a pretty nice summary right
there<00:01:21.400> it<00:01:21.490> covers<00:01:21.759> an<00:01:21.850> awful<00:01:22.090> lot<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.330> ground

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
there it covers an awful lot of ground

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.020 
there it covers an awful lot of ground
obviously<00:01:23.080> I<00:01:23.259> can't<00:01:24.130> talk<00:01:24.280> about<00:01:24.580> every<00:01:24.820> type

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
obviously I can't talk about every type

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.880 
obviously I can't talk about every type
because<00:01:25.390> there<00:01:25.570> are<00:01:25.689> dozens<00:01:26.049> and<00:01:26.409> dozens<00:01:26.470> of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
because there are dozens and dozens of

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.399 
because there are dozens and dozens of
alternative<00:01:27.520> forms<00:01:27.729> of<00:01:27.820> creatine<00:01:28.090> but<00:01:28.990> look

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
alternative forms of creatine but look

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.429 
alternative forms of creatine but look
critically<00:01:29.710> at<00:01:30.040> their<00:01:30.610> claims<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.360> about<00:01:32.200> what

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
critically at their claims a about what

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.020 
critically at their claims a about what
they<00:01:32.619> claim<00:01:33.040> are<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.310> drawbacks<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.700> creatine

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
they claim are the drawbacks of creatine

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.300 
they claim are the drawbacks of creatine
and<00:01:34.210> then<00:01:34.509> look<00:01:34.750> critically<00:01:34.960> at<00:01:35.200> what<00:01:36.159> they

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
and then look critically at what they

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.090 
and then look critically at what they
claim<00:01:36.549> are<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:37.180> benefits<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.439> whether<00:01:38.950> these

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
claim are the benefits and whether these

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.039 
claim are the benefits and whether these
benefits<00:01:39.610> are<00:01:39.759> actually<00:01:40.210> proven<00:01:40.570> or<00:01:40.659> not<00:01:40.810> and

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
benefits are actually proven or not and

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:42.929 
benefits are actually proven or not and
usually<00:01:41.350> you'll<00:01:41.500> find<00:01:41.799> they<00:01:42.430> are<00:01:42.460> strictly

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
usually you'll find they are strictly

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.999 
usually you'll find they are strictly
theoretical<00:01:43.180> benefits<00:01:44.110> now<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.799> doesn't

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
theoretical benefits now that doesn't

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.300 
theoretical benefits now that doesn't
mean<00:01:45.220> alternative<00:01:45.850> forms<00:01:46.860> may<00:01:47.860> not<00:01:48.100> be

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
mean alternative forms may not be

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.569 
mean alternative forms may not be
superior<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:48.970> creatine<00:01:49.930> monohydrate<00:01:50.579> but

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
superior to creatine monohydrate but

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.870 
superior to creatine monohydrate but
until<00:01:51.729> proven<00:01:52.299> otherwise<00:01:52.979> again<00:01:53.979> it's<00:01:54.340> as<00:01:54.670> i

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
until proven otherwise again it's as i

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.899 
until proven otherwise again it's as i
like<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.119> say<00:01:55.240> mental<00:01:55.720> masturbation<00:01:56.729> sorry<00:01:57.729> to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
like to say mental masturbation sorry to

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.100 
like to say mental masturbation sorry to
be<00:01:58.000> graphic<00:01:58.210> but<00:01:58.479> that's<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.750> way<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:58.869> feel

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
be graphic but that's the way I feel

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.399 
be graphic but that's the way I feel
about<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.759> again<00:02:00.759> it<00:02:01.479> bothers<00:02:01.930> me<00:02:02.140> if<00:02:02.380> you're

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
about it again it bothers me if you're

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.399 
about it again it bothers me if you're
going<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.710> start<00:02:03.009> by<00:02:03.600> putting<00:02:04.600> down<00:02:04.899> creatine

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
going to start by putting down creatine

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.800 
going to start by putting down creatine
monohydrate<00:02:05.530> with<00:02:06.460> supposed<00:02:06.939> negatives<00:02:07.600> and

down on alternative forms of creatine

and and there's two basic reasons like I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.600 
and and there's two basic reasons like I
say<00:02:39.510> one<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.290> most<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.070> claims<00:02:41.250> they<00:02:41.460> make

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
say one is most of the claims they make

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.610 
say one is most of the claims they make
are<00:02:41.790> simply<00:02:42.180> unproven<00:02:42.780> unresearched<00:02:43.290> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
are simply unproven unresearched and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.800 
are simply unproven unresearched and
you'll<00:02:43.710> see<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.550> or<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.240> claims<00:02:45.480> they<00:02:45.630> make

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
you'll see that or the claims they make

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.110 
you'll see that or the claims they make
are<00:02:46.020> known<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.440> be<00:02:46.560> bogus<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:47.550> those<00:02:47.850> two

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
are known to be bogus and so those two

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.590 
are known to be bogus and so those two
together<00:02:48.300> make<00:02:49.230> me<00:02:50.150> sort<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.210> down<00:02:51.390> on

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
together make me sort of down on

a bogus as I said and to not only it's
not<00:03:41.850> even<00:03:42.150> as<00:03:42.300> good<00:03:42.390> as<00:03:42.720> creatine<00:03:43.080> monohydrate
