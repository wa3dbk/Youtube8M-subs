00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
and then you get like a little extra

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.479 
and then you get like a little extra
burst<00:02:48.169> at<00:02:48.469> the<00:02:48.500> end<00:02:48.739> if<00:02:48.919> you<00:02:48.949> hold<00:02:49.219> down<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
burst at the end if you hold down the

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.759 
burst at the end if you hold down the
first<00:02:49.790> attack<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:53.049> then<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.590> other

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
first attack and then the the other

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.470 
first attack and then the the other
technique<00:02:55.069> does<00:02:55.250> is<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.909> shoot<00:02:56.150> out<00:02:56.269> this

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
technique does is and shoot out this

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.199 
technique does is and shoot out this
ball<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.349> will<00:02:57.530> roll<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:58.549> gold<00:02:58.730> dudes<00:02:58.969> up

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
ball that will roll the gold dudes up

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.270 
ball that will roll the gold dudes up
and<00:02:59.389> if<00:02:59.449> you<00:02:59.540> hold<00:02:59.719> the<00:02:59.930> button<00:02:59.959> you<00:03:00.889> can<00:03:01.069> run

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
and if you hold the button you can run

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.589 
and if you hold the button you can run
with<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.599> it<00:03:03.439> gets<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.680> little<00:03:03.769> bigger<00:03:04.599> and

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
with it and it gets a little bigger and

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.979 
with it and it gets a little bigger and
I<00:03:06.109> think<00:03:06.379> that<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.769> will<00:03:06.949> stay<00:03:07.310> with<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.090> for

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
I think that that will stay with you for

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.199 
I think that that will stay with you for
for<00:03:09.980> awhile<00:03:10.069> I<00:03:10.219> don't<00:03:10.549> think<00:03:10.699> that<00:03:10.819> goes<00:03:11.060> away

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
for awhile I don't think that goes away

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.789 
for awhile I don't think that goes away
until<00:03:11.599> you<00:03:11.750> release<00:03:14.169> again<00:03:15.169> the<00:03:15.349> third<00:03:15.560> thing

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
until you release again the third thing

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.249 
until you release again the third thing
is<00:03:15.859> his<00:03:16.459> soul<00:03:16.729> gem<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.329> press<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.780> third

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
he's hovering around and I'll kind of

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.260 
he's hovering around and I'll kind of
strafe<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.520> little<00:04:48.760> bit

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.020 

took<00:04:52.230> me<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.440> long<00:04:52.530> time<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:53.370> get<00:04:53.550> used<00:04:53.730> to<00:04:53.820> that

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
took me a long time to get used to that

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.210 
took me a long time to get used to that
because<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.080> can<00:04:55.230> see<00:04:55.380> he's<00:04:55.530> not<00:04:55.680> strafing

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
because so you can see he's not strafing

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.180 
because so you can see he's not strafing
now<00:04:56.430> but<00:04:56.790> that<00:04:56.940> when<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.180> start<00:04:57.420> firing<00:04:58.190> it'll

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
now but that when you start firing it'll

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.430 
now but that when you start firing it'll
sort<00:04:59.370> of<00:04:59.490> start<00:04:59.760> strafing<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.170> have<00:05:01.320> to

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
sort of start strafing so you have to

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.310 
sort of start strafing so you have to
kind<00:05:01.650> of<00:05:01.740> stop<00:05:02.130> firing<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.870> be<00:05:04.020> able<00:05:04.230> to

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
kind of stop firing to to be able to

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.260 
kind of stop firing to to be able to
turn<00:05:04.500> around<00:05:04.560> see<00:05:05.280> I'm<00:05:05.400> firing<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.030> right

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
turn around see I'm firing to the right

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.980 
turn around see I'm firing to the right
I'm<00:05:06.990> facing<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.740> the<00:05:07.770> right<00:05:08.010> if<00:05:08.460> I<00:05:08.970> stop<00:05:09.270> firing

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.540 
I'm facing to the right if I stop firing
no<00:05:10.320> I<00:05:10.350> turn<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.010> left<00:05:11.610> firing<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.570> left<00:05:13.550> so

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
no I turn the left firing to the left so

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.670
