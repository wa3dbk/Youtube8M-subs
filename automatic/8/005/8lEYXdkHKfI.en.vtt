00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.170
 In this video tutorial we will learn how to repair four red lights of the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.799
 old stress and santa 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.370
 this failure can be anticipated to many problems but in this case the 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.259
 overheating 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.210
 and it's the one we're going to do 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.699
 as you see nothing else turn on the console 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.000
 we know we are missing 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 the notice that looks red 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.009
 due to overheating the console 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.600
 now we see the video tutorial how to dismantle the illustrious 60 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.840
 and we got to the step where we only had one motherboard 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.680
 we already have the motherboard and now what we have to fix is ​​in these two 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.590
 Boys 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.610
 and through a stick we will clean everything that is silicone 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.610
 that are those of the che 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.780
 As you can see, all this area of ​​the cicpc has a silicone which has been scattered 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.680
 medium heat sink and heat 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.170
 report of a stick we have to explode all forms it seems 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.220
 totally clean 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.760
 simply if floating 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.400
 go withdrawing little by little once we have all this area of ​​the tin 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.080
 of the clean subway we proceed to clean 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.110
 the other micro 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.240
 the program that we are going to solve here and it is due to problems with the 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.660
 first consoles in the 3 60 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.600
 by half once I heat that opel out here and have dissipated 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.470
 caused overheating of the console 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.450
 provide it, we will solve it by applying heat 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.350
 to the whole minister so that the welds that knew of soldier 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.660
 Re-weld correctly 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.570
 but the repair process useful stretches in this case a heat gun 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.920
 there are other methods such as the paint stripper gun 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.240
 at optimum produce a stable welding 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.630
 and they can burn the silver 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.520
 this process is quite delicate with who you are and we are not 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.140
 professionals or we have no experience 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.130
 with the best plates of barcelona a repair shop so that what 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.620
 repair for us 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.689
 The first thing we will do will be 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:12.689
 put a plate on a metal sheet 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.269
 what is it for food model caprice moscardó not burn us the 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.839
 center table 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.839
 remember that it has is detailed that seven plastic 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.839
 can cause all the plastic to melt on our body 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.959
 now they will have a charge gun 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.959
 the maximum air temperature 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.499
 we will start to apply little by little circularly 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.539
 movements on the micro 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.829
 remember that it has to be headlines and non-stop 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.029
 the time to stop can cause you to burn the silver 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.199
 we will apply heat for five minutes on the two micros 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.089
 simple movement 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.019
 As you can see, the movement has to be totally 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.219
 non-stop 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.219
 with an average speed 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.319
 if little by little we will get 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.319
 that the myths are letting go correctly 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:31.499
 we have already applied heat during the two meters for five minutes 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.199
 and now we want to leave the entity for about 15 minutes 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.400
 an agency the square we will apply three drops 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.249
 on 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:41.969
 the micros 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.659
 of thermal paste 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.659
 i will not be extending 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.849
 now it simply cost us this issue places the heatsinks 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:01.839
 hillá see the video tutorial of how to mount the whole plate and we can already be 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:06.269
 They use our console without problems stated for quite some time 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.379
 a side with only has he checked that the lights 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.379
 I felt letterhead 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.599
 As you can see, the operation is correct, nor amounts of the red light 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.639
 now we can just put a goal of the dvd and I can play without problems 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.229
 three red lustrums 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.159
 I recommend that you are in put a fan to the consolidation 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.189
 you can probably go through the same mistake again because these consoles have 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:37.400
 to overheat too 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.699
 Ministry of culture have surprised 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.149
 how to fix our environment
