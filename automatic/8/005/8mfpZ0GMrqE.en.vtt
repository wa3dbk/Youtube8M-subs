this one and it's alarms as well so it's

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.970 
this one and it's alarms as well so it's
tamper-proof<00:02:35.540> alarmed<00:02:36.540> i<00:02:36.830> think<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:37.920> cost

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
tamper-proof alarmed i think this cost

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.940 
tamper-proof alarmed i think this cost
