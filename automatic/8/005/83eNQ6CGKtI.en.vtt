 The zipper will be easy 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.020
 Wrapped up it's a great one 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.090
 simple method and you need it 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.619
 just a zipper wool 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 depending on what your strength 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.970
 want to use and a crochet hook 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.760
 I want to fit in here 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.700
 colorful effective used that is acrylic 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.340
 wool with the strength 5 4 to 5 and that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.960
 is a very simple one which is suitable 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.300
 To crochet is easy to do 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.020
 and ways and how the whole thing works 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.610
 I show you now you need as 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.250
 First I have a zipper 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.199
 here this money accepted and in 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.539
 I make small incisions as 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.430
 this one with a sharp scissors in 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.370
 even distances can be that 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.420
 Mark all also great in between 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.309
 always about a centimeter and air 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.780
 I'll cut her the next time 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.439
 works best with a very sharp 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.439
 small scissors 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.110
 make small cuts 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.370
 Immediately the possibility through that me 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.370
 right now the wool through 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.009
 I distribute it here regularly 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:34.869
 The zipper orient me here 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.869
 at this line on the zipper 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.240
 and that's what I do on both sides 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.610
 the pages in parallel so if 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.180
 I do one here then then 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.370
 you're always doing pretty well and so on 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.010
 I edit first both sides of the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.030
 zipper I got that 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.480
 zipper now in here 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:09.090
 regular intervals and cut 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.460
 I take my thread now and start 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.580
 on one side 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.519
 We'll pick one in each one 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.439
 go through the thread and take 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:24.010
 then I make two more air meshes 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.999
 1 2 around the space between the cuts 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.250
 to bridge 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:31.500
 then again a mesh and again doctor 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.380
 mesh again here pierce the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.380
 thread high 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.310
 puncture bottles again thread 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.939
 namely making air 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.860
 the whole thing looks like that first 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.950
 so i work the complete page first 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.920
 let's go so I am now at the end of 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.230
 row and make more here 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.329
 air masses not hp the 2 I do 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.459
 additional 3 around here once around 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:06.409
 come 23 then I'll do two more 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.099
 So I did a total of seven 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:13.700
 and then I would have to stay in this 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:18.769
 So hole seven in total 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.989
 to bridge the page and then 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.159
 every day here in the holes exactly 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.159
 continue as usual 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.390
 I now have the zipper 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.770
 completely umhäkelt here in the second 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.430
 I did the same thing as 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.370
 here 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.540
 i just have them here in the air 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.900
 taken and the whole then the 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.450
 Handbag connected and now I start 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.820
 to crochet normal to the bag 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.220
 I would have air in each one now 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.230
 mesh sections here three half 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:53.380
 Chopsticks for me an envelope go here 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.820
 through and disgust simply trinity chopsticks 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.820
 in the air mass section 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.290
 first package here also three pure 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.940
 it's just the number of stitches 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.069
 not here then each crocheted around it 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.030
 have that is the mesh that lies here 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.130
 through the whole with the zipper 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.329
 is connected and then the two 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.329
 air masses in between 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.510
 and I would have that complete now 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.750
 in the round on the sides disgusting too 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.820
 the corresponding number is 7 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.430
 which I made here for bridging 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.630
 So I have these sections daily 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.580
 in each case seven air masses the 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:47.610
 seven air masses a day seven half 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:50.280
 chop around sorry so the 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.200
 first right round in half chopsticks 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.500
 is finished now as I said 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.860
 here around the pages also each seven 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.840
 crocheted half-half sticks and me 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.960
 start now with the second round 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.910
 I go for it here in the first stitch 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.790
 I'll take my bag now 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.120
 an air mass and increase by the height 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:16.710
 get directly in the same mesh 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:19.590
 still one and a half a tight mesh and 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.710
 work now completely in the round 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:26.550
 always half-sticks that I work 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.360
 completely as long and as far as pocket 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.520
 should be 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.290
 I'm not going to have any further here 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.330
 On the side of it we are simply told 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.940
 only always closed round crocheted 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.120
 and yes, I'll show you right away 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.040
 make important conclusion I am now 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.510
 I'm back at my green bag 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.600
 I already regulated more 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.220
 I have the thread here now 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.200
 cut off and pulled out and 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.590
 Now I'll show you how to get that bag 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.660
 So close down makes the bottom 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.420
 or the two sides really connects 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.860
 the bag does not really have any in the bottom 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.710
 and I stand here now once 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.700
 laterally through through both sides of the 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.020
 bag and start now again raise 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.599
 I'll get it 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.490
 have the thread here through here 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.370
 I create a new one that I put 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.110
 directly parallel to the other side like that 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.110
 that I blatantly 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:38.819
 You see, I always sting through both 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:45.809
 top stitch through and hegel the 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:48.509
 whole here comes the tail of the 

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:52.429
 actual bag because I count 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.429
 that I also blatantly 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.970
 You can easily do that here as well 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.970
 stitch 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.550
 I want that all over now 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:11.930
 the complete bag over the complete 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.930
 floor is so open 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:16.360
