Sounders so to access the communication
settings<00:00:15.949> just<00:00:16.699> go<00:00:16.880> down<00:00:17.000> to<00:00:17.029> configure<00:00:17.570> and

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
settings just go down to configure and

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.690 
settings just go down to configure and
what<00:00:18.140> communication<00:00:18.740> settings<00:00:19.100> are<00:00:19.220> for<00:00:19.490> is

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
what communication settings are for is

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.650 
what communication settings are for is
for<00:00:20.090> your<00:00:20.720> NEMA<00:00:21.110> output<00:00:21.740> to<00:00:21.980> your<00:00:22.040> DSC<00:00:22.940> capable

for your NEMA output to your DSC capable

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.310 
for your NEMA output to your DSC capable
radio<00:00:24.110> or<00:00:24.650> to<00:00:25.100> an<00:00:25.220> auto<00:00:25.430> helm<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.240> where<00:00:27.230> you

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
radio or to an auto helm and where you

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.340 
radio or to an auto helm and where you
find<00:00:27.620> that<00:00:27.770> is<00:00:27.890> just<00:00:28.039> down<00:00:28.220> here<00:00:28.250> under

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
find that is just down here under

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.049 
find that is just down here under
communications<00:00:30.350> just<00:00:30.680> select<00:00:31.160> it<00:00:31.400> and<00:00:31.550> then

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
communications just select it and then

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.970 
communications just select it and then
we<00:00:32.270> have<00:00:32.449> a<00:00:32.480> few<00:00:32.809> options<00:00:33.050> we've<00:00:33.649> got<00:00:33.860> our

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
we have a few options we've got our

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.170 
we have a few options we've got our
serial<00:00:34.340> port<00:00:34.670> one<00:00:35.739> serial<00:00:36.739> port<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:37.280> our<00:00:37.610> NEMA

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
serial port one serial port to our NEMA

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.110 
serial port one serial port to our NEMA
0<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:38.630> III<00:00:38.870> set<00:00:39.230> up<00:00:39.380> in<00:00:39.560> our<00:00:39.710> NEMA<00:00:39.950> 2000<00:00:40.700> setup

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
0 and III set up in our NEMA 2000 setup

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.889 
0 and III set up in our NEMA 2000 setup
so<00:00:41.420> if<00:00:41.720> we<00:00:42.050> go<00:00:42.200> into<00:00:42.350> serial<00:00:42.829> port<00:00:43.130> 1<00:00:43.750> we<00:00:44.750> could

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
so if we go into serial port 1 we could

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.930 
so if we go into serial port 1 we could
set<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:45.260> up<00:00:45.380> to<00:00:45.590> nema<00:00:45.829> standard<00:00:45.950> NEMA

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
set it up to nema standard NEMA

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.510 
set it up to nema standard NEMA
high-speed<00:00:47.720> and<00:00:48.020> then<00:00:48.649> also<00:00:48.829> garmin<00:00:49.309> data

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
high-speed and then also garmin data

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.580 
high-speed and then also garmin data
transfer<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:50.300> we<00:00:50.390> could<00:00:50.540> actually<00:00:50.630> transport

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
transfer so we could actually transport

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.190 
transfer so we could actually transport
data<00:00:51.800> through<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:52.910> port<00:00:53.300> I<00:00:53.540> recommend<00:00:54.140> just

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
data through that port I recommend just

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.260 
data through that port I recommend just
using<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.739> memory<00:00:55.130> card<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.670> transfer<00:00:56.120> your

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
using a memory card to transfer your

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.600 
using a memory card to transfer your
data<00:00:56.420> though<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.079> then<00:00:58.070> standard<00:00:58.460> in

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
data though and then standard in

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.889 
data though and then standard in
high-speed<00:00:58.880> is<00:00:59.300> just<00:00:59.480> going<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.690> be<00:00:59.780> the

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
high-speed is just going to be the

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.020 
high-speed is just going to be the
different<00:01:00.260> baud<00:01:00.500> rate<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.340> everything's

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
different baud rate so everything's

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.810 
different baud rate so everything's
gonna<00:01:02.239> operate<00:01:02.780> on<00:01:03.410> a<00:01:03.440> different<00:01:03.829> pod<00:01:04.189> rate<00:01:04.519> so

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
gonna operate on a different pod rate so

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.199 
gonna operate on a different pod rate so
either<00:01:05.140> 4800<00:01:06.140> or<00:01:06.259> 9600<00:01:07.039> baud<00:01:07.219> usually<00:01:07.880> on<00:01:08.030> your

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:08.209 
either 4800 or 9600 baud usually on your

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.349 
either 4800 or 9600 baud usually on your
boat<00:01:08.829> so<00:01:09.829> let's<00:01:10.069> just<00:01:10.340> back<00:01:10.549> out<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.789> here<00:01:11.179> then

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:11.359 
boat so let's just back out of here then

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:13.959 
boat so let's just back out of here then
we<00:01:11.450> got<00:01:11.600> our<00:01:11.689> serial<00:01:12.079> port<00:01:12.409> 2<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.159> we

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
we got our serial port 2 and we

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.330 
we got our serial port 2 and we
basically<00:01:14.240> have<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:14.869> same<00:01:15.139> settings<00:01:15.979> except

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
basically have the same settings except

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.559 
basically have the same settings except
for<00:01:16.520> an<00:01:16.609> old<00:01:16.729> garment<00:01:17.119> data<00:01:17.689> transfer<00:01:19.359> we<00:01:20.359> have

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
for an old garment data transfer we have

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.379 
for an old garment data transfer we have
our<00:01:20.749> NEMA<00:01:20.990> 0<00:01:21.499> 183<00:01:22.069> setup<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.939> this<00:01:23.029> is<00:01:23.209> where

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:23.389 
our NEMA 0 183 setup and this is where

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:26.289 
our NEMA 0 183 setup and this is where
we're<00:01:23.539> going<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:24.139> select<00:01:25.069> what<00:01:25.340> messages<00:01:25.999> are

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
we're going to select what messages are

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.629 
we're going to select what messages are
going<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.659> be<00:01:26.749> outputted<00:01:27.380> from<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.920> device<00:01:28.279> to

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
going to be outputted from the device to

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:32.499 
going to be outputted from the device to
the<00:01:29.439> external<00:01:30.439> device<00:01:31.130> like<00:01:31.520> Auto<00:01:31.729> helm<00:01:32.090> and

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
the external device like Auto helm and

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.739 
the external device like Auto helm and
so<00:01:33.349> on<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:33.979> if<00:01:34.039> we<00:01:34.130> go<00:01:34.249> sounder<00:01:34.880> what<00:01:35.630> it's

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
so on so if we go sounder what it's

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:37.539 
so on so if we go sounder what it's
going<00:01:35.899> to<00:01:35.959> allow<00:01:36.259> us<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.469> do<00:01:36.770> is<00:01:36.889> turn<00:01:37.069> on<00:01:37.130> and

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
going to allow us to do is turn on and

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:45.249 
going to allow us to do is turn on and
off<00:01:37.609> different<00:01:37.880> sounding<00:01:38.599> messages<00:01:44.049> we<00:01:45.049> have
