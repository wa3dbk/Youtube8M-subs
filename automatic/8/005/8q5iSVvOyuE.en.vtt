00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.980 
you said before we were talking like the
detachable<00:02:02.219> hip<00:02:03.000> belt<00:02:03.210> systems<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.840> end

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
detachable hip belt systems and you end

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.719 
detachable hip belt systems and you end
up<00:02:04.110> losing<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.530> hip<00:02:04.680> belt<00:02:04.829> absolutely

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
up losing the hip belt absolutely

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.380 
up losing the hip belt absolutely
misplace<00:02:06.119> entering<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.869> foot

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
misplace entering a foot

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.480 
misplace entering a foot
easier<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.840> stuff<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.619> we<00:02:08.830> easier<00:02:09.130> just<00:02:09.369> to

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
easier to stuff it we easier just to

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.919 
easier to stuff it we easier just to
fold<00:02:09.789> them<00:02:09.940> back<00:02:10.149> in<00:02:10.390> place

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
fold them back in place

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.110 
fold them back in place
also<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.590> can<00:02:11.830> shove<00:02:12.069> gloves<00:02:12.430> in<00:02:12.670> there<00:02:12.850> and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
also you can shove gloves in there and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.210 
also you can shove gloves in there and
you<00:02:13.390> can<00:02:13.540> run<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.690> handset<00:02:14.290> from<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.620> radio<00:02:14.950> down

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
you can run a handset from a radio down

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.760 
you can run a handset from a radio down
and<00:02:15.520> there<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.000> can<00:02:16.180> reach<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.540> easily

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
and there so you can reach it easily

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.630 
and there so you can reach it easily

plaster<00:02:32.770> you<00:02:32.860> have<00:02:33.010> one<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.280> goes<00:02:33.430> in<00:02:33.580> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
plaster you have one that goes in the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.479 
plaster you have one that goes in the
top<00:02:33.820> for<00:02:34.180> your<00:02:34.270> back<00:02:34.480> yep<00:02:35.020> one<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.830> bottom

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
top for your back yep one in the bottom

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.370 
top for your back yep one in the bottom
for<00:02:36.700> your<00:02:36.790> lumbar<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.569> goes<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.900> opposite<00:02:38.319> way

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
for your lumbar it goes the opposite way

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.960 
for your lumbar it goes the opposite way
so<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.830> gives<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.069> little<00:02:39.220> bit<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.459> car<00:02:39.820> they

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
so it gives a little bit of car they

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.440 
so it gives a little bit of car they
both<00:02:40.180> overlap<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.170> they<00:02:41.770> can<00:02:41.950> adjust<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:43.300> your

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
both overlap and they can adjust to your

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.600 
both overlap and they can adjust to your
actual<00:02:43.959> back<00:02:44.230> length<00:02:44.590> by<00:02:44.860> inserting<00:02:45.340> that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
actual back length by inserting that

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.120 
actual back length by inserting that
frame<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.750> then<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.260> have<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.620> ability<00:02:47.739> to

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
frame and then you have the ability to

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.020 
frame and then you have the ability to
either<00:02:48.900> adjust<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.170> tall<00:02:50.410> or<00:02:50.739> short<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.880> this

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
either adjust it tall or short and this

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.020 
either adjust it tall or short and this
is<00:02:52.090> generally<00:02:52.840> done<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.440> your<00:02:53.860> back<00:02:54.100> you

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
is generally done on your back you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.030 
is generally done on your back you
fasten<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.630> hip<00:02:55.780> belt<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.290> your<00:02:56.440> waist<00:02:56.680> and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
fasten the hip belt to your waist and

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.850 
fasten the hip belt to your waist and
then<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.459> friend<00:02:57.790> just<00:02:58.090> pulls<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.630> out<00:02:58.870> so

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
then a friend just pulls this out so

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.610 
then a friend just pulls this out so
that<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.340> frame<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:01.209> basically<00:03:01.750> right<00:03:02.410> at<00:03:02.530> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
that the frame is basically right at the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.470 
that the frame is basically right at the
top<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:03.010> your<00:03:03.100> shoulder<00:03:03.550> blade<00:03:03.820> right<00:03:04.150> about

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
top of your shoulder blade right about

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.979 
top of your shoulder blade right about
there

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
there

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.470 
there
that's<00:03:05.500> meant<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:05.890> support<00:03:06.130> mm-hmm<00:03:07.000> now<00:03:07.269> we

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
that's meant to support mm-hmm now we

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.080 
that's meant to support mm-hmm now we
have<00:03:07.750> taken<00:03:08.019> this<00:03:08.380> basic<00:03:08.920> design<00:03:08.950> because<00:03:09.910> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
have taken this basic design because the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.039 
have taken this basic design because the
bag<00:03:10.330> gives<00:03:11.140> us<00:03:11.380> access<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:12.130> everything<00:03:12.820> and<00:03:13.750> we

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
bag gives us access to everything and we

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.350 
bag gives us access to everything and we
came<00:03:14.320> up<00:03:14.350> with<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:15.040> new<00:03:15.340> version<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.940> we<00:03:16.239> are

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
came up with a new version that we are

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.210 
came up with a new version that we are
able<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.630> put<00:03:16.900> on<00:03:17.019> our<00:03:17.170> larger<00:03:17.410> nice<00:03:17.860> frame

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
able to put on our larger nice frame

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.270 
able to put on our larger nice frame
okay<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:19.660> design<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:21.760> built<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:23.280> we

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
okay and this design is built so that we

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.280 
okay and this design is built so that we
can<00:03:24.489> separate<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.360> upper<00:03:25.480> part<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.079> bag

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
can separate the upper part of the bag

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.069 
can separate the upper part of the bag
from<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:26.980> frame<00:03:27.370> we<00:03:27.880> can<00:03:28.060> also<00:03:28.209> lock<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.930> in

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
from the frame we can also lock it in

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.479 
from the frame we can also lock it in
tightly<00:03:29.560> but<00:03:30.450> this<00:03:31.450> was<00:03:31.720> really<00:03:32.200> inspired<00:03:32.489> by

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
tightly but this was really inspired by

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.380 
tightly but this was really inspired by
watching

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
watching

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.080 
watching
marine<00:03:35.200> after<00:03:35.680> marine<00:03:36.040> after<00:03:36.519> marine<00:03:36.820> and

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
marine after marine after marine and

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.050 
marine after marine after marine and
mortar<00:03:37.390> teams<00:03:38.070> strapping<00:03:39.070> base<00:03:39.430> plates<00:03:39.790> to

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
mortar teams strapping base plates to

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.910 
mortar teams strapping base plates to
the<00:03:40.150> outside<00:03:40.630> of<00:03:40.810> their<00:03:40.959> pack<00:03:41.200> in<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.680> worst

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
the outside of their pack in the worst

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.910 
the outside of their pack in the worst
possible<00:03:42.700> place<00:03:42.940> for<00:03:43.390> carry<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.110> alone<00:03:44.380> right

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
possible place for carry and alone right

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.750 
possible place for carry and alone right
and<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:46.000> occurred<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.329> me<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:47.049> know<00:03:47.760> if

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
and it occurred to me that you know if

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.020 
and it occurred to me that you know if
we<00:03:49.030> simply<00:03:49.480> built<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:50.280> with<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.430> nice<00:03:51.610> frame

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
we simply built this with the nice frame

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.330 
we simply built this with the nice frame
so<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.540> we<00:03:52.690> could<00:03:52.959> pop<00:03:53.920> it<00:03:54.100> off

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.390 

detach<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.910> frame<00:03:58.209> from<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.660> bag<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.650> put<00:04:00.250> in

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
detach the frame from the bag and put in
