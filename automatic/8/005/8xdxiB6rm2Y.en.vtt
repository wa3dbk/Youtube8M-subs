eraser and move it up to your stylus and
allow<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.149> stylus<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.930> punch<00:02:07.170> into<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.459> do

allow the stylus to punch into it and do
this<00:02:08.759> two<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.030> three<00:02:09.149> times<00:02:09.860> method<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this two or three times method one is a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.850 
this two or three times method one is a
little<00:02:12.510> bit<00:02:12.629> more<00:02:12.810> dangerous<00:02:13.020> than<00:02:13.470> method

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
little bit more dangerous than method

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
little bit more dangerous than method
-<00:02:14.010> which<00:02:14.310> I'll<00:02:14.490> explain<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.060> second<00:02:15.480> but

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
- which I'll explain in a second but

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.410 
- which I'll explain in a second but

method two but method one you have to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.800 
method two but method one you have to
make<00:02:24.870> sure<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.970> not<00:02:27.000> move<00:02:27.480> the
