cycle for over two hours and basically
it's<00:00:23.640> not<00:00:23.820> heating<00:00:24.449> I've<00:00:25.080> tested<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.890> with<00:00:26.099> my

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
it's not heating I've tested it with my

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.339 
it's not heating I've tested it with my
amp<00:00:26.609> meter<00:00:26.910> already<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.900> not<00:00:28.109> drawing

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
amp meter already and it's not drawing

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.410 
amp meter already and it's not drawing
any<00:00:28.650> current<00:00:29.070> I'll<00:00:29.429> show<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.090> at<00:00:30.300> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
any current I'll show you that at the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.630 
any current I'll show you that at the
end<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.929> video<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.369> we're<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.610> to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
end of the video so what we're going to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970 
end of the video so what we're going to
do<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.910> let<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.149> Machine<00:00:33.480> empty<00:00:33.899> switch<00:00:34.829> it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
do is let the Machine empty switch it

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.670 
do is let the Machine empty switch it
off<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.430> power<00:00:35.579> supply<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:37.020> undo

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
off from the power supply and then undo

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.880 
off from the power supply and then undo
the<00:00:38.129> back<00:00:38.579> panel<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.149> gain<00:00:39.690> access<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the back panel to gain access to the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.700 
the back panel to gain access to the
element<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.270> video<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.050> used<00:00:43.500> on

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
element now this video can be used on

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
element now this video can be used on
other<00:00:44.100> makes<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> lot<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.329> washing<00:00:45.719> machines

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
other makes as a lot of washing machines

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.369 
other makes as a lot of washing machines
have<00:00:46.289> NTC<00:00:46.950> sensors<00:00:47.460> fitted<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.989> washing

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
have NTC sensors fitted and all washing

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.260 
have NTC sensors fitted and all washing
machines<00:00:49.680> nearly<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> heating<00:00:51.180> element

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
machines nearly have a heating element

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.389 
machines nearly have a heating element
fitted<00:00:53.840> now<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.289> at<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> bottom<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.039> we

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
fitted now just at the bottom there we

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.319 
fitted now just at the bottom there we
have<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.149> heating<00:00:57.510> element<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:57.899> NTC<00:00:58.649> sensor

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
have the heating element and NTC sensor

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.330 
have the heating element and NTC sensor
so<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.600> said<00:01:00.780> earlier<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.379> safety<00:01:01.859> always

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
so as I said earlier for safety always

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.889 
so as I said earlier for safety always
make<00:01:02.550> sure<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.059> unplug<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.809> appliance

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
make sure you unplug the appliance

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.690 
make sure you unplug the appliance
before<00:01:04.320> working<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> from<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
before working on it from the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
before working on it from the
electricity<00:01:06.270> supply<00:01:07.250> now<00:01:08.250> we're<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
electricity supply now we're going to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.170 
electricity supply now we're going to
remove<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.350> two<00:01:10.740> cables<00:01:11.189> which<00:01:11.610> go<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
remove the two cables which go to the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.649 
remove the two cables which go to the
heating<00:01:12.600> element<00:01:14.000> setting<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> meter<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
heating element setting the meter to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.460 
heating element setting the meter to
continuity<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.060> we'll<00:01:18.060> test<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.869> resistance

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
continuity and we'll test for resistance

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
continuity and we'll test for resistance
across<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.220> element<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:22.009> as<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.340> see<00:01:23.580> we

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
across the element and as you can see we

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.280 
across the element and as you can see we
have<00:01:24.540> resistance

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
have resistance

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.420 
have resistance
so<00:01:25.710> therefore<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.369> element<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.939> good<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.430> now

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
so therefore the element is good and now

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.700 
so therefore the element is good and now
we're<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> test<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.630> NTC<00:01:31.380> sensor<00:01:33.710> now

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
we're going to test the NTC sensor now

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.260 
we're going to test the NTC sensor now

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
video on how NTC sensors work now I've

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
video on how NTC sensors work now I've
actually<00:01:50.670> got<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:51.329> test<00:01:51.810> connection

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
actually got a little test connection

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.310 
actually got a little test connection
block<00:01:53.159> which<00:01:54.000> allows<00:01:54.299> me<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:54.869> onto<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
block which allows me to get onto the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.499 
block which allows me to get onto the
terminals<00:01:55.890> without<00:01:56.280> messing<00:01:56.549> around<00:01:56.790> because

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
terminals without messing around because

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.749 
terminals without messing around because
the<00:01:57.750> terminals<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.469> very<00:01:58.890> small<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.700> very

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the terminals are very small and very

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.620 
the terminals are very small and very
hard<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.329> get<00:02:00.479> your<00:02:00.659> probe<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:02.479> now

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
hard to get your probe on now

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.260 
hard to get your probe on now
I've<00:02:05.260> got<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.680> two<00:02:05.860> clubs<00:02:06.190> on<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.970> actual

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
I've got the two clubs on to the actual

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.380 
I've got the two clubs on to the actual
center<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:08.500> we<00:02:08.530> are<00:02:09.040> getting<00:02:09.280> no<00:02:09.700> reading<00:02:09.970> at

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
center but we are getting no reading at

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.780 
center but we are getting no reading at
all<00:02:10.750> now<00:02:11.320> your<00:02:11.530> meter<00:02:11.800> must<00:02:12.160> be<00:02:12.280> set<00:02:12.520> on<00:02:12.550> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
all now your meter must be set on the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.110 
all now your meter must be set on the
ohms<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.360> do<00:02:13.510> a<00:02:13.540> test<00:02:13.840> on<00:02:14.050> an<00:02:14.200> NTC<00:02:14.500> sensor<00:02:15.120> but

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
ohms to do a test on an NTC sensor but

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.250 
ohms to do a test on an NTC sensor but
this<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:17.080> open<00:02:17.830> circuit<00:02:18.370> now<00:02:19.210> I'll<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:19.720> do<00:02:20.230> a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
this is open circuit now I'll just do a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.370 
this is open circuit now I'll just do a
test<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.280> new<00:02:21.490> one

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
test on the new one

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.860 
test on the new one
now<00:02:23.380> all<00:02:23.740> NTC<00:02:24.460> sensors<00:02:25.090> have<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> tolerance

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
now all NTC sensors have a tolerance

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.260 
now all NTC sensors have a tolerance
level<00:02:26.470> which<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.830> only<00:02:27.070> given<00:02:27.700> out<00:02:27.850> by<00:02:28.240> the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
level which is only given out by the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.070 
level which is only given out by the
manufacturer<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:30.160> NTC<00:02:30.790> sensor<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.480> also

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
manufacturer of the NTC sensor and also

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.780 
manufacturer of the NTC sensor and also
the<00:02:32.260> appliance<00:02:32.740> manufacturer<00:02:33.340> no<00:02:33.610> only

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the appliance manufacturer no only

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.020 
the appliance manufacturer no only
usually<00:02:34.030> distributed<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.470> engineers<00:02:36.040> but

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
usually distributed to the engineers but

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.020 
usually distributed to the engineers but
this<00:02:37.470> NTC<00:02:38.470> sensor<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.950> know<00:02:39.130> has<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> tolerance

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
this NTC sensor I know has a tolerance

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.270 
this NTC sensor I know has a tolerance
level<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:40.900> around<00:02:41.590> 6000<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:43.020> as<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.710> was

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
level of around 6000 and as I was

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.200 
level of around 6000 and as I was
holding<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.120> NTC<00:02:46.660> sensor<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.880> value<00:02:48.880> was

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
holding the NTC sensor the value was

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.510 
holding the NTC sensor the value was
dropping<00:02:49.810> which<00:02:50.470> means<00:02:50.770> it's<00:02:51.040> working

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
dropping which means it's working

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.570 
dropping which means it's working
correctly<00:02:51.880> as<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.990> NTC<00:02:53.560> sensor<00:02:53.800> gets<00:02:54.250> warm

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
correctly as the NTC sensor gets warm

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.850 
correctly as the NTC sensor gets warm
the<00:02:54.850> tolerance<00:02:55.300> level<00:02:55.510> drops<00:02:55.959> but<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.680> can

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
the tolerance level drops but you can

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.190 
the tolerance level drops but you can
see<00:02:57.040> all<00:02:57.190> this<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:58.120> more<00:02:58.300> detailed<00:02:58.750> video

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
see all this in the more detailed video

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.190 
see all this in the more detailed video
and<00:02:59.790> as<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.970> can<00:03:01.090> see<00:03:01.150> as<00:03:01.390> I'm<00:03:01.540> not<00:03:01.720> touching

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
and as you can see as I'm not touching

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.020 
and as you can see as I'm not touching
it<00:03:02.290> now<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:02.860> going<00:03:03.430> up<00:03:03.580> slightly<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.970> know

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
it now it's going up slightly and I know

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.020 
it now it's going up slightly and I know
this<00:03:07.300> new<00:03:07.510> NTC<00:03:08.020> sensor<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.560> perfect<00:03:08.950> anyway<00:03:09.190> so

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
this new NTC sensor is perfect anyway so

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.290 
this new NTC sensor is perfect anyway so
to<00:03:10.540> fit<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.200> new<00:03:11.350> NTC<00:03:11.890> sensor<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.610> need<00:03:12.910> to

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
to fit the new NTC sensor you need to

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.350 
to fit the new NTC sensor you need to
remove<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:14.320> nut<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.850> middle<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.239> the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
remove the nut in the middle of the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.660 
remove the nut in the middle of the
element<00:03:16.750> but<00:03:17.260> not<00:03:17.530> all<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:18.190> way<00:03:18.340> off<00:03:18.610> the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
element but not all the way off the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.300 
element but not all the way off the
thread<00:03:19.330> you<00:03:19.690> just<00:03:19.900> need<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.380> leave<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.769> on<00:03:20.890> the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
thread you just need to leave it on the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.759 
thread you just need to leave it on the
end<00:03:21.489> there<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:23.100> then<00:03:24.100> with<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.910> screwdriver

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
end there and then with a screwdriver

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.110 
end there and then with a screwdriver
just<00:03:26.769> tap<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.580> in<00:03:27.750> yeah<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.940> will

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
just tap it in yeah and that will

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.820 
just tap it in yeah and that will
release<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.450> pressure<00:03:31.989> off<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.530> seal

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
release the pressure off the seal

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.640 
release the pressure off the seal
allowing<00:03:33.820> you<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.180> get<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.480> element<00:03:34.989> out<00:03:35.170> now

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
allowing you to get the element out now

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.550 
allowing you to get the element out now
sometimes<00:03:36.250> these<00:03:36.550> are<00:03:36.910> very<00:03:37.300> sticky<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:37.959> you

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
sometimes these are very sticky and you

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.380 
sometimes these are very sticky and you
might<00:03:38.800> have<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.160> use<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.310> small<00:03:39.670> stumpy

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
might have to use a small stumpy

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.110 
might have to use a small stumpy
screwdriver<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.170> prise<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.530> out<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.820> there<00:03:45.970> we

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
screwdriver to prise it out and there we

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.470 
screwdriver to prise it out and there we
go

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
go

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.900 
go
we<00:03:46.600> have<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.989> element<00:03:47.350> a<00:03:47.530> little<00:03:47.910> bit

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
we have the element a little bit

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.860 
we have the element a little bit
clothing<00:03:49.480> wrapped<00:03:49.989> on<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:51.269> now<00:03:52.269> here's<00:03:52.660> the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
clothing wrapped on it now here's the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.710 
clothing wrapped on it now here's the
NTC<00:03:53.410> sensor<00:03:53.730> now<00:03:54.730> we've<00:03:55.000> taken<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.480> pressure

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
NTC sensor now we've taken the pressure

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.860 
NTC sensor now we've taken the pressure
off<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.260> seal<00:03:56.590> we're<00:03:57.430> able<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:58.000> prise<00:03:58.300> out<00:03:58.630> the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
off the seal we're able to prise out the

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.670 
off the seal we're able to prise out the
old<00:03:59.050> NTC<00:03:59.739> sensor<00:04:03.480> we<00:04:04.480> can<00:04:04.510> discard<00:04:05.080> this<00:04:05.380> and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
old NTC sensor we can discard this and

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.720 
old NTC sensor we can discard this and
we'll<00:04:06.430> fit<00:04:06.670> the<00:04:06.820> new<00:04:06.970> one<00:04:07.180> I<00:04:08.430> always<00:04:09.430> recommend

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
we'll fit the new one I always recommend

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.300 
we'll fit the new one I always recommend
just<00:04:10.209> putting<00:04:10.300> a<00:04:10.630> touch<00:04:10.959> of<00:04:11.230> very<00:04:11.650> liquid<00:04:12.130> or

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
just putting a touch of very liquid or

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.150 
just putting a touch of very liquid or
something<00:04:12.700> on<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:13.120> end<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.570> and<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:15.040> will

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
something on the end of it and it will

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.920 
something on the end of it and it will
help<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.579> slide<00:04:15.790> into<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.450> rubber<00:04:16.630> easily

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
help it slide into the rubber easily

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.640 
help it slide into the rubber easily
and<00:04:18.639> then<00:04:19.639> it's<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:19.910> good<00:04:20.090> idea<00:04:20.509> to<00:04:20.900> clean<00:04:21.380> up

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
and then it's a good idea to clean up

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.659 
and then it's a good idea to clean up
the<00:04:21.979> surface<00:04:22.729> of<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.090> seal<00:04:24.340> get<00:04:25.340> all<00:04:25.460> the

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
the surface of the seal get all the

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.330 
the surface of the seal get all the
limescale<00:04:26.120> off<00:04:26.539> it<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:28.750> then<00:04:29.750> again<00:04:30.289> just<00:04:30.590> dry

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
limescale off it and then again just dry
