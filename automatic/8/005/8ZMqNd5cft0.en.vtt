00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.580
 good how about mercadolibre friends in 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.610
 this case we will see the review of what 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.030
 that is the iron rock of nextel is the 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.820
 new device that came out of the excel 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.280
 with its 4.3 screen comes very very very 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.810
 good size the advantages is that it is multi 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.210
 touch 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.990
 in other characteristics that they have is 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:30.160
 a very light weight the diameter is something 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.320
 something very very thin the advantages that 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.210
 they are super good is that they are three outputs 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.489
 micro hdmi 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.199
 then you can connect if you want 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.900
 watch a football game or movies in 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.989
 line this phone is the excellent 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.390
 option being that really in excel 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.970
 always makes pure or pure 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.489
 phone crap this I think so 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.440
 filled as my expectations and gave me 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.930
 a good taste in your mouth 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.960
 bringing other things radio fm camera 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:04.199
 8 megapixel double camera which is the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.199
 front camera and internal camera 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.460
 obviously this is 1.3 and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.870
 this is 8 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.659
 this is what technology is 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.580
 evolution whether you have it 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.330
 phone has the advantage that it handles what 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.150
 what is the chip 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.180
 two chips that is 3 the forgiveness in 3g 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.560
 evolution and the air in excel then 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.190
 you can put it in your internet plan 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.900
 so they're supposed to weave 100 in 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.240
 this case we see what 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.130
 and there are the applications is very 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.080
 fluid compared to phones 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.370
 previous that Nextel manages with 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:45.150
 android and it is also rotary 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.380
 and among the great advantage it has is that 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.439
 it has very good audio 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.479
 and all the applications that work 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.799
 without any problem here for example 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.400
 let's see what the circuit 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.440
 closed 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.140
 and what we are moving is loading a 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.790
 remote closed circuit and we see that without 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.690
 any problem work 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.200
 and we can 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.070
 of check anything we're not going to see the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.070
 greetings is 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:20.260
 then of options I think it's a 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.260
 excellent option in multiple 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.580
 applications that is what we're going to see 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.170
 in the tutorials that come prepared 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.620
 let's start with the tutorials by 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.129
 example of movies in hd can be that 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.239
 type of software is completely free 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.989
 that's why we're going to start with what is 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.200
 free here we are going to put a movie 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.270
 latina that we can talk for example 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.450
 of stress that is a new movie 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.130
 that we can see movie will ask us 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.660
 in what quality we want to see if the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.970
 we want to see on a TV obviously 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.280
 we select 720 quality in that case 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.600
 we normal quality and depending on the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.760
 connection that you have is what is going to 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.270
 take to charge approximately until 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.690
 30 to 40 seconds to take care of what 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.700
 is some kind of movie online 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.760
 but from then on out it's not going to happen to you 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.620
 in no time then the truth if 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.610
 I highly recommend it, I've had what 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.400
 that was the titanium excel the east and one and 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.440
 yeah yeah I liked this quite yet 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.840
 the data plan I do not have it until I 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.810
 it's my contract renewal this he 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.849
 was acquired by own account 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.920
 preferably if they could not grab the 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.290
 contract so what better option because 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.420
 really if it's worth the team there 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.880
 we see what the movie is 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.880
 I'm from the volume there is 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.910
 and it has excellent excellent quality 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.250
 video and friend that showed mostly 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.000
 It was the size has very good size 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.180
 then he does not ask anything from some of 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.180
 the telephones 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.810
 if you win more connect this hdmi cable to 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:09.650
 your TV sets you see species 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.630
 in fact on Saturday until it happened I have 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.780
 a very good application that is to see 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.650
 football online is we throw ourselves a 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.739
 League game of mx and no problem 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.450
 I can work among others 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.450
 applications obviously then let's see 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.230
 for example facebook works very well what 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.270
 what is the front camera 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:37.130
 let's see what the cameras are 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.130
 take takes very good pictures 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:43.870
 automatic flash and what is here 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.409
 we change what the screen is 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.929
 already 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.319
 there we see where my camera support is 

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:50.319
 a trophy 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.570
 so 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.680
 brings very very good applications 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.750
 obviously from android that works in 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.960
 all the applications had if by 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.880
 There is not going to ask for anything, for example 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.600
 we are going to open a game of light of the most 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.600
 heavy there are
