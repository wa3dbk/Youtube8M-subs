00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.719
 you are going to see then he showed you how 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.879
 make a bow confuse how are you 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.620
 I have here you see that it is very easy 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.620
 cheer up and here you have the video 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.690
 to make a bow confuse the only 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.300
 what we need will be a little 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.300
 fondant and a roll to extend 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.610
 and we will start extending the end 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.160
 we will extend to 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.600
 two 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.460
 ah 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.390
 i 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.040
 and let's have 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.080
 we cut the ends 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.720
 and the magicians so that we stay 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.720
 It is a rectangle 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.730
 when we already have the rectangle what 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.990
 we will do 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.009
 to tight 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.009
 center 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.540
 and once you have it 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.180
 you take the edge 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.840
 and he does 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.840
 a faithful 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.880
 and you take a piece of paper 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.790
 the filming 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.250
 and the loins inside for the replacement 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.250
 take your shape and we'll break 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.099
 and we do the same with the other 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.350
 the mild 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.930
 and we take it inside 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.599
 and now what you can 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.830
 and you do like a trickle you do not need 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.740
 that is perfect will simply be for 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.700
 get prepared 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.700
 of the tie 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.230
 over 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.520
 It is a little bit so that you 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.490
 and we would have 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.000
 our tie the paper you leave it for a while 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.510
 so that we do not get crushed in the background 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.550
 until you see how easy 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.680
 and now what we could do if 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.529
 would you like to put the last one on the top 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.709
 found 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:01.489
 would be to make two strips as if they were 

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:01.489
 the two braces 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.420
 and for that 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.420
 we will take a little fondant 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.220
 we extend it 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.890
 and 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.890
 Y 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.150
 Y 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.830
 and you make two strips 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.380
 cut those ends 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.479
 and the sides 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:12.759
 and now we would cut 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.759
 a strip 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:21.740
 we will put this enzyme to make the 

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:24.580
 Same size 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.580
 and we cut 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.490
 since you do it like a triangle 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.090
 to look for 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.169
 the strips of an area 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.169
 the same side 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.000
 is to place is one on top of the other 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
 the 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.530
 and we would have our bond for 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.229
 put them in fondant cake mode or whatever 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:14.050
 that you want, you can see that it is very easy and 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:15.789
 that does not have any complication I hope 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.479
 that you try it at home and see you in the 

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:18.479
 next video
