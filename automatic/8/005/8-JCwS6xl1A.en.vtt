00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.369
 April 

00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:06.160
 in also edited in doubt about foreigners in economics and 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.850
 charges 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.819
 per cent who have family responsibilities 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:12.669
 I am the one who recently have contracts are Chilean for all legal effect 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:13.930
 and the fia efe 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.830
 is that they arrive round everywhere his secretary typed with the charges 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.100
 family members who have not been declared to the employee 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.230
 clear clemente lake 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.119
 If she does not see clearly, she got worse, she did not take the artisans 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.200
 it does not matter if you do not have the papers on day 30 and 100 of the important 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.140
 there was the causer 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.900
 what she can not do was a burden on a son who was born in the month of January 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.539
 because the law says to December 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:41.570
 he said there 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.410
 for the causes to count 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.660
 all the causes are 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.750
 the dependent children of an adult 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.850
 are the vivid mothers who live at the expense of a son 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.150
 they are abandoned children 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.950
 of parents who will be in charge of the grandparents 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.950
 they are the institutional homes that are in charge of the children 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.020
 children are mentally ill for 18 years because you get pension 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.390
 disability 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.450
 and are all children between the time they are born act 18 years that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.010
 studied in powder study 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 and if it happens within 18 24 years has to be studying rod that is charged 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.130
 family 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.530
 and the last burden family feels least likely important 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.310
 is for everyone the concept is that someone depends on others 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.790
 It is the concept 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.110
 a firewood and that until here for impositions by the minimum 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.000
 and that you have a child in college as a charity you have the right not to 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.300
 work insist insist voluntarily 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.600
 remember that the latest law in the pension reform allows the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.090
 voluntary taxation and therefore imposes are voluntary and have a burden 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.340
 familiar in the new law 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.860
 as long as it is up to date 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.970
 and have also accredited their family burden and if I choose tackling clear that 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.330
 has family burden 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.610
 for this question more or less the same because I did as a burden is credited 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.220
 in the case of independent workers that so directly to the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.030
 a st 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.649
 exactly relativizes it before the fp 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.490
 in that case and the fep in which you have to prove 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.250
 the family load under the requirements that lara has requested documentation 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.319
 respective study now gives what corresponds 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.709
 your secretary so far contains inconvenience you have found this 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.149
 agile general 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:22.229
 that you think it is important to communicate and clarify Syria the first 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:23.769
 inconvenient 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.879
 is that 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.989
 many people did not have a family load per day 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:32.189
 and because he did not have a day because we remember that salaries close to 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.599
 4 142 thousand pesos the family charge is only one thousand pesos 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.569
 then it is not a benefit 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.259
 that the people were attractive to him the base was found with a bonus 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.759
 what the resource will start pivot or is the first problem 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.979
 the second problem I would go to many 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:53.020
 efe the small companies that have workers 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.740
 p made statements and did not stop 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.589
 it is a major problem 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:02.989
 and there is a complex problem to handle in the case of temporary workers who 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.249
 the peasants then are like the three big problems that wolf 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:06.959
 found 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.799
 I'm still here for this 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.939
 we enabled varied physics with the compensation boxes madeline vega 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.279
 precisely to speed up the process 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.309
 because this law, unlike other 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:22.079
 defines that the requirement that is fulfilled even if it is not accredited 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.870
 legally and that's why we saw that this final month of term 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.829
 min 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.579
 hence the person who is unemployed who was laid off in December and has 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.109
 load to pass 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.110
 with these people 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.369
 I am receiving the bonus his holiness 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.199
 for unemployment insurance if you have the right 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.419
 either because it was in force 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.179
 his status as a worker now 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.959
 I want December I was unemployed at 30 and 100 break 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.010
 I told 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.510
 that he was working so I want 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.719
 skips from the first of January as a result the previous employer rules 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.620
 that is clarifying 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.840
 that is unemployed from September to December this is needed in this 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.220
 period in that period he was already being charged unemployment insurance 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.920
 if it is up to you because both safe and sanitary leave are 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.150
 part of the ongoing work was affected by this law in both sectors if 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.150
 corresponds factors we are going to see another questionable headquarters here in the blog of the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.680
 iceet in dollars in dgt exam has cheered social welfare percent 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.180
 the undersecretary 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.909
 for that came not 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:29.289
 is to catch each high risk or indirect text for something new is very green 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.090
 sector 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.960
 7 I am completely that they are all case passed to a total of 15 each question 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.449
 for your particular case then sometimes it becomes difficult to respond to 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:39.370
 each one that 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.450
 we recognize the pingo used with contract must in a nana with contract 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.240
 of November 1, 2008 and made the processing of family cargo in 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.240
 January 2000 9 is entitled to the bonus 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.370
 not because it requires the average six months 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.909
 of work 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:59.469
 in consecuense 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:02.800
 it's not because of the work problem you see governance is started to work 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.009
 now that he is consulted 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:06.969
 complex 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.030
 consultation gives me some doubt I think it would be good if the lady will consult 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.639
 I encourage doubt 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.150
 for problems the temporality not for the problem to the load in April 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.280
 because it means that the shortage before 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.159
 never though he has done it 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.529
 excuse me for having done it after January 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.889
 p the benefit and city ended the mere by the temporality of inclusion 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.460
 they are forbidden to doubt that question 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.930
 de Andrea says the advisor of the home and my son with payment of taxes and salaries 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.389
 minimums are within the benefit not because tÃ³th family burden is not at 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.110
 direct beneficiary 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.599
 the average of the taxable salary considers overtime 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:45.550
 those of the fruit 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.520
 attitude so much everything that are with him in the concept of gross considers 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.550
 but remember that the average over six months not only a month 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.400
 and if that has positions so your gross salary clear 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.089
 it is considered part no 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:01.939
 depends how this done to the income statement 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:05.150
 this beneficial not only for those who are working 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.689
 what happens with the voters probing tracing informally 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:12.049
 this formal suit and do not do position is strong bonus why that 

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:14.009
 we talked earlier 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.009
 that these delicate ones being informal little reaping certain benefits 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.520
 a bonus to the worker 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.909
 except for three conditions 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:23.759
 1 chile solidarity 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.579
 the chilean family solidarity for this bond is considered a unit 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.530
 because it is a benefit for a segment that is absolutely inti signed 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.580
 as of extreme poverty are 98 thousand families solidarity solidarity in Chile at 31 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.980
 of December in that case does not run its condition of worker po 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.990
 independent of their children 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.710
 because he was paid a family and not by charge in that case 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.450
 because there is no dependence on work puebla can be a person 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.860
 work in informal terms pour solidarity chile that has no contract 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:56.330
 but most likely and that was how he calculated that we did 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.809
 and that family is charging their only family subsidy 

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:03.229
 because in a poor family it is better for them to have their family burden because 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:04.300
 maltos uf 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.180
 and here the family that is right 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.139
 if they have this
