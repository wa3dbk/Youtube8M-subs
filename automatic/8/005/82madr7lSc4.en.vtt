00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.570
 this makes a video response to 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.570
 inherent in the desire to meet the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.000
 my favorite hunting idol 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.160
 call it what you want 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.090
 my soccer idol claudio 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.260
 marchisio 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.480
 I can say I succeeded for a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.010
 indeed for a simple reason for a 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.540
 beautiful reason why I think the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.150
 desire fulfilled because it is me 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.000
 loved it like the simonetta 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.940
 is committed to making the vizier 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.860
 first person schon unknown to her but 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.010
 as it does with all other people 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.610
 really liked a commitment there 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.000
 consistency, in short, everything 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:08.020
 what he put to allow the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.560
 realization of this desire to which 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.190
 I wanted so much and so this 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.630
 really worth saying would be the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.720
 ticket price 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.400
 there was no ticket to pay 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.110
 this is worth something more and that 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.729

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.729
