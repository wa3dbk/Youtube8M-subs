00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.950
 so hello today we will put 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.190
 heated nissan pulsar g15 engine yes 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.719
 and what we need for this we 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.789
 need a pipe 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.580
 folders to connect to 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.920
 radiator directly to you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:29.970
 clamps are required you will need a crane 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.759
 in order to shut off the liquid but 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.540
 it will be a little further also to us 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.530
 need tee to enroll in 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.899
 network and also we will like big 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.370
 tee we also need himself 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.579
 heater i chose him alexei 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.649
 Chinese with pomp today will be it 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.890
 set and see how it will 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.500
 work and also we will need 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.510
 coolants more precisely antifreeze 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.290
 red so let's get started 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.680
 gloating and doing things and so here is our 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.460
 engine 15 yes, where do I plan to 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.979
 bump we need to take the top one 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.020
 pipe and put a tee in this place 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.939
 in order to bring here 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.130
 how would the liquid go here 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.979
 where do we need to take a fence 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.350
 coolant on the idea here in 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.119
 drain plug in the cooling unit 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.310
 liquids would have to be put there 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.530
 fitting as a fitting I could not 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.170
 pick yes and unscrew in the winter somehow 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.009
 reluctance I decided that I would bump into 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.890
 the return of the stove is this lower hose 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.189
 we begin work on the street -15 voices 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.729
 hoarse but we start doing things 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.229
 let's go half a year didn't we 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.299
 put here our wanderer 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.460
 that for this we used we 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.549
 used 5 clamps tee itself 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.719
 half new hose half 2 hose 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.759
 tube and cut off the new hose that is 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.930
 it turns out we put it 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.090
 now the thing sticks us down and so 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.840
 we did it, we crashed into 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.200
 radiator inlet 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.120
 check him hose to our preheating 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.190
 life in China made 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.150
 lies us right where you see 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.239
 so green 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.060
 and so what is the scheme we got 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:38.939
 took the fence from the stove reverse 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.109
 up to our tape i have this info i'm up to this 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:46.470
 branch pipe and garden and embedded ball valve 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:48.540
 so what we need we need to 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.519
 nipples which will go up to ours 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.099
 the heaters were as short as possible and 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.650
 the heating itself was as low as possible 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.319
 as far as possible that is here y 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.700
 my hose goes under the stove 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.819
 about 30 centimeters to the very 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.000
 infu I have all tightened clamps 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.069
 and since I didn't find the place anywhere, I just 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.989
 fixed him on such ordinary white 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.410
 hose clamps 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.209
 itself the most important thing is to 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.910
 the system had no air since the first 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.829
 since I put it a little differently everything 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.560
 I made a hose I saw a video 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.120
 passed up and he was here in 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.730
 this place is not why it was 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.609
 airing system part repartition 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.430
 conducted an experiment perfectly warm by the way 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:39.449
 for an hour heats the motor completely even 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.319
 such a pattern of fluid intake and supply and 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:46.049
 back to the chain so to speak like me 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:50.190
 let the air out of the system warmed up 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.379
 good engine and twisted this one 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.329
 hose clamp 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.829
 there will be a characteristic hiss and then 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.440
 I twist back to not open 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.220
 the cap also needs to be in the barrel 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.949
 extender 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.169
 there was a coolant thanks for 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.919
 attention who watched this video with you 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.940
 was stanislav 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.940
 goodbye
