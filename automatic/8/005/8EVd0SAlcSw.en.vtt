you can't gain a switch like I can I'm
going<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.509> show<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.810> progression<00:00:06.990> first

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
going to show you the progression first

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.530 
going to show you the progression first
so<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.550> know<00:00:08.580> what<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:08.849> looks<00:00:09.030> like<00:00:09.179> then<00:00:09.420> I'll

explain it all right so in that clip you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.790 
explain it all right so in that clip you
saw<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> phases<00:00:57.719> phase<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:59.030> stationary

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
saw the phases phase one stationary

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.429 
saw the phases phase one stationary

these J step swing through swing through

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.270 
these J step swing through swing through
and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:18.390> swing<00:01:18.630> through<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> kit<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:23.009> progress

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and then swing through a kit to progress

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.640 
and then swing through a kit to progress
through<00:01:23.670> each<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.299> those<00:01:24.420> phases<00:01:24.689> you're

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
through each of those phases you're

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.170 
through each of those phases you're
going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.280> master<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> first<00:01:26.970> step

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
going to have to master the first step

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.420 
going to have to master the first step
which<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> standing<00:01:29.750> swing<00:01:30.750> right<00:01:31.259> there

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
which is the standing swing right there

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.170 
which is the standing swing right there
master<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:33.500> then<00:01:34.759> probably<00:01:35.759> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> spin

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
master that then probably going to spin

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.289 
master that then probably going to spin
like<00:01:36.329> maybe<00:01:37.250> me<00:01:38.250> about<00:01:38.430> thirty<00:01:38.729> minutes<00:01:38.939> doing

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
like maybe me about thirty minutes doing

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.760 
like maybe me about thirty minutes doing
that<00:01:39.540> over<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> over<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.290> over<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.650> over

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
that over and over and over and over

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.590 
that over and over and over and over
maybe<00:01:41.490> days<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:42.150> know<00:01:42.210> everybody's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
maybe days I don't know everybody's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.030 
maybe days I don't know everybody's
everybody<00:01:43.020> learning<00:01:43.290> everyone's<00:01:43.890> learning

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
everybody learning everyone's learning

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.889 
everybody learning everyone's learning
pattern<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.460> different<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.479> once<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> get

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
pattern is different but once you get

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.130 
pattern is different but once you get
that<00:01:46.079> every<00:01:46.680> time<00:01:46.710> give<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> bus<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.140> do

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that every time give you the bus to do

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.380 
that every time give you the bus to do
the<00:01:49.259> J<00:01:49.439> step<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.829> gonna<00:01:49.950> feel<00:01:50.189> different<00:01:50.579> but

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the J step it's gonna feel different but

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.030 
the J step it's gonna feel different but
you<00:01:51.509> think<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.840> same<00:01:52.049> thing<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.920> more

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
you think the same thing just get more

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.429 
you think the same thing just get more
height<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.680> give<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> chase<00:01:56.009> step<00:01:57.439> right

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
height so give you the chase step right

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.850 
height so give you the chase step right
there<00:01:58.969> once<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.060> get<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.299> J<00:02:00.450> step<00:02:00.689> part<00:02:00.899> then

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
there once you get that J step part then

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.990 
there once you get that J step part then
you're<00:02:02.070> gonna<00:02:02.159> start<00:02:02.490> swinging<00:02:02.670> throwing

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
you're gonna start swinging throwing

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.030 
you're gonna start swinging throwing
kicking<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:04.079> may<00:02:04.259> take<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.619> couple<00:02:04.680> days

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
kicking this may take you a couple days

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.219 
kicking this may take you a couple days
to<00:02:05.610> get<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> where<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.450> every<00:02:07.049> time
