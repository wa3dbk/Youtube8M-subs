00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
this is new Mombasa and we're going to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.659 
this is new Mombasa and we're going to
show<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.500> proof<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.489> minute

but way back in the background there you
can<00:00:34.620> actually<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.579> prophet<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.180> regrets

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.729 

you<00:00:55.300> can<00:00:55.449> see<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.749> orbital<00:00:56.199> tether<00:00:56.440> in<00:00:56.649> the

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
you can see the orbital tether in the

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.160 
you can see the orbital tether in the
background<00:00:57.159> there<00:00:57.429> as<00:00:57.699> the<00:00:57.940> UNSC<00:00:58.510> ships<00:00:58.899> are

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
dropping the ODST pods just before the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.389 
dropping the ODST pods just before the
prophet<00:01:02.140> of<00:01:02.229> regret<00:01:02.530> jumps<00:01:02.920> into<00:01:03.039> slipspace

prophet of regret jumps into slipspace

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:12.080 
prophet of regret jumps into slipspace
and<00:01:03.820> destroys<00:01:04.239> all<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:04.689> New<00:01:04.809> Mombasa<00:01:10.770> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and destroys all of New Mombasa and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.789 
and destroys all of New Mombasa and
right<00:01:13.090> here<00:01:13.509> we<00:01:13.630> have<00:01:13.869> kind<00:01:14.229> of<00:01:14.289> a<00:01:14.380> cryptic

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
right here we have kind of a cryptic

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.200 
right here we have kind of a cryptic
message<00:01:14.830> we're<00:01:15.369> not<00:01:15.520> really<00:01:15.700> sure<00:01:15.880> what<00:01:16.119> it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
message we're not really sure what it

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.240 
message we're not really sure what it
means<00:01:16.530> who's<00:01:17.530> Maddie<00:01:17.860> we<00:01:18.700> have<00:01:18.970> no<00:01:19.600> idea<00:01:19.960> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
means who's Maddie we have no idea and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.550 
means who's Maddie we have no idea and
then<00:01:21.250> we<00:01:21.399> immediately<00:01:21.820> stop<00:01:22.179> again<00:01:22.479> in<00:01:22.720> this

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
then we immediately stop again in this

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.210 
then we immediately stop again in this
frame<00:01:23.890> there's<00:01:24.220> actually<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:24.880> date<00:01:25.350> 10<00:01:26.350> 609

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
frame there's actually a date 10 609

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.630 
frame there's actually a date 10 609
january<00:01:27.909> six<00:01:28.210> 2009<00:01:29.110> maybe<00:01:29.409> it<00:01:30.280> would<00:01:30.490> make

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
january six 2009 maybe it would make

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.550 
january six 2009 maybe it would make
sense<00:01:30.670> as<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.240> release<00:01:31.569> date<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:32.049> is<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.229> tuesday

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
sense as a release date it is a tuesday

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.699 
sense as a release date it is a tuesday
so<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:33.310> definitely<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:33.850> possibility<00:01:37.259> at<00:01:38.259> the

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
so it's definitely a possibility at the

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:40.199 
so it's definitely a possibility at the
very<00:01:38.890> end<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.310> video<00:01:39.429> we<00:01:39.880> see<00:01:40.060> the

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
very end of the video we see the

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:42.180 
very end of the video we see the
superintendent<00:01:40.990> program<00:01:41.380> trying<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:41.979> come<00:01:42.159> to

superintendent program trying to come to

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.469 
superintendent program trying to come to

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
grips with what's happened to new

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.840 
grips with what's happened to new
Mombasa<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.229> there's<00:01:44.770> one<00:01:44.979> final<00:01:45.220> drop<00:01:45.580> pod

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
Mombasa and there's one final drop pod

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.609 
Mombasa and there's one final drop pod
that's<00:01:46.149> landing<00:01:46.600> after<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.259> massive

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
that's landing after the massive

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.710 
that's landing after the massive
explosion<00:01:48.159> this<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:48.729> probably<00:01:49.209> the<00:01:49.450> main

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
explosion this is probably the main

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.840 
explosion this is probably the main
