00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.070
Ideas for books come in many ways.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.800
Most of them are just sudden insights.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.030
I remember when I wrote Brown Bear, I was
riding on a train.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.940
I heard, "Brown bear, brown bear, what do
you see?"

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.759
And I grabbed my pen.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.480
I didn't have anything to write on, but I
did have a newspaper.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.869
I folded the newspaper and wrote crosswise,
"Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?"

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:33.790
I thought for a minute, and I either heard
or imagined, "I see a red bird looking at

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.730
me.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.200
Red bird, red bird, what do you see?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.390
I see a yellow duck looking at me."

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.730
The pattern is there.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.530
The book was broken.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:58.030
All I had to

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:12.530
do

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:32.520
was

00:01:32.520 --> 00:02:02.780
write it out.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:29.670
It was 
finished in 15 minutes.
