 of tropical fruits with fresh milk to 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.380
 what are we starting we're going 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.370
 start with guava 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.650
 we will remove the little ones 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.780
 a place that are not very pretty huh 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.349
 and then is cut into four all 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.269
 simply 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.590
 if the guava are the big ones we can 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:34.780
 a little more here we are going to put that 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:34.780
 in the mixer we will put some water 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.750
 that's enough and we do everything 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.010
 now we're going to go into the 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.900
 strainer to remove seeds 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.680
 regulation this beautiful pink color of the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.810
 guava 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.620
 it's wonderful essay full of 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.620
 vitamins and its central to guava huy 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.800
 it smells very strong we put our juice 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:08.420
 guava in the blender we washed on 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:11.150
 add sugar 1 that's the end and 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.880
 after we see if there are these sugars if we 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:23.600
 do not have enough we add 1 and then 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:27.230
 good fresh milk we add the ice cubes and 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.280
 our juice is ready I keep this beautiful 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.900
 color is appetizing this fact left 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.090
 vitamins and then it makes you want to 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.160
 wood if you have fluids and milk 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.010
 at home you can go trade winds 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.390
 those we do not like guava 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.130

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.510
 now with passion fruit 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.220
 we can not make it turn big 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.260
 speed because the glitches get 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.290
 disintegrates so you have to rotate it 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.580
 a little speed so that the flesh gets 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.580
 detaches pips 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.820
