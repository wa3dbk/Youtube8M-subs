00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.929 
introduced that whole bullet drop where
you<00:00:27.810> would<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.199> shoot<00:00:28.529> an<00:00:28.740> enemy<00:00:29.099> well<00:00:29.849> if

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
you would have to shoot an enemy well if

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.519 
you would have to shoot an enemy well if
you<00:00:30.029> were<00:00:30.179> sniping<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:30.810> shooting<00:00:31.140> an<00:00:31.230> enemy

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.170 
you were sniping or shooting an enemy
you<00:00:32.070> would<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.369> shoot<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:32.880> bit<00:00:33.090> in

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
you would have to shoot a little bit in

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.760 
you would have to shoot a little bit in
front<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.540> them<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:34.050> bit<00:00:34.260> above<00:00:34.530> them

depending<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> shot<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.300> you're<00:00:36.450> trying

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
depending on the shot that you're trying

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.900 
depending on the shot that you're trying
to<00:00:36.780> take<00:00:36.989> because<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.559> more<00:00:37.770> realistic

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
where they still got that realistic

a little bit of the reversal part of it
where<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> was<00:01:56.460> getting<00:01:56.729> shot<00:01:56.939> at<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.600> would

where I was getting shot at and I would

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.590 
where I was getting shot at and I would
feel<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.430> noticed<00:01:59.790> a<00:02:00.119> couple<00:02:00.299> sex

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
later if I died I didn't even know I was

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.590 
later if I died I didn't even know I was
still<00:02:02.520> getting<00:02:02.670> shot<00:02:02.909> at<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.180> they<00:02:03.270> still<00:02:03.479> need

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
still getting shot at so they still need

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.020 
still getting shot at so they still need
to<00:02:03.659> fix<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.200> overall<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.890> was<00:02:05.700> noticing

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
to fix that but overall I was noticing

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.969 
to fix that but overall I was noticing
everything<00:02:06.659> was<00:02:06.780> landing<00:02:07.170> for<00:02:07.560> me<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.920> think

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
everything was landing for me I think

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.100 
everything was landing for me I think
they<00:02:08.310> did<00:02:08.520> improve<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.090> game<00:02:09.270> because<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
they did improve the game because the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.110 
they did improve the game because the
beta<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.679> all<00:02:10.830> assume<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.580> that's<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
beta we all assume like that's it the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.580 
beta we all assume like that's it the
fucking<00:02:12.660> games<00:02:12.840> coming<00:02:13.050> out<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.260> two

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
fucking games coming out in two

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.229 
fucking games coming out in two
for<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.860> month<00:02:14.099> like<00:02:14.340> that's<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.790> full<00:02:15.060> game

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
for a month like that's the full game

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.809 
for a month like that's the full game
now<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.840> think<00:02:16.410> they<00:02:16.650> improved<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.069> lot<00:02:17.220> if<00:02:17.580> they

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
now I think they improved a lot if they

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.309 
now I think they improved a lot if they
kind<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.180> made<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> controls<00:02:18.870> way<00:02:19.080> more

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
kind of made the controls way more

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.050 
kind of made the controls way more
smaller<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.680> feel<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.129> gunplay<00:02:20.459> is<00:02:20.670> more

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
smaller I feel like the gunplay is more

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.119 
smaller I feel like the gunplay is more
smooth<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.629> this<00:02:21.780> game<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.110> shots<00:02:22.349> are<00:02:22.830> more

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
smooth in this game the shots are more

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.440 
smooth in this game the shots are more
smooth<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.670> game<00:02:23.819> but<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.120> i<00:02:24.239> said<00:02:24.269> i

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
smooth in this game but like i said i

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.820 
smooth in this game but like i said i
don't<00:02:24.629> feel<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.170> true<00:02:25.379> battlefield

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830

I'm<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.239> little<00:02:42.420> bit<00:02:42.660> ahead<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.870> them<00:02:43.049> above

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
I'm a little bit ahead of them above

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.080 
I'm a little bit ahead of them above
them<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.860> game<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.129> could<00:02:44.580> do<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.910> same

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
them in this game you could do the same

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.110 
them in this game you could do the same
but<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:45.989> feel<00:02:46.230> uh<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.920> snipers<00:02:47.790> don't<00:02:47.970> do

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
but I feel uh the the snipers don't do

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.059 
but I feel uh the the snipers don't do
as<00:02:48.239> much<00:02:48.269> damage<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.079> it's<00:02:49.260> not<00:02:49.349> as<00:02:49.530> rewarding

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
as much damage and it's not as rewarding

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.979 
as much damage and it's not as rewarding
when<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.340> catch<00:02:50.519> an<00:02:50.670> enemy<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.120> don't<00:02:51.930> know

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
when you catch an enemy I don't know

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.630 
when you catch an enemy I don't know
it's<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.349> way<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.799> hitmarker<00:02:53.370> looked

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
it's just the way that hitmarker looked

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.330 
it's just the way that hitmarker looked
in<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.030> way<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.329> guns<00:02:54.630> set<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.260> sniper<00:02:55.980> sets

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
in the way the guns set the sniper sets

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.789 
in the way the guns set the sniper sets
on<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.519> enemy<00:02:56.849> I'm<00:02:57.690> not<00:02:58.019> really<00:02:58.260> feeling<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.709> i

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
on the enemy I'm not really feeling it i
