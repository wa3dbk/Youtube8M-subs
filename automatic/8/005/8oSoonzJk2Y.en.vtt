 a smartwatch while wearing a 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.379

 hello to all we are on thursday 21 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:28.500
 November 2013 and this is the french news of 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:30.090
 day it's gone the connected watches 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.710
 become fashionable objects that's it 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.870
 sure but not only because some 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.010
 are really useful and successful and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.600
 that's probably the case of the one that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.399
 could be the ultimate smartwatch 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.930
 her name is neptune pays and goes out 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.760

 19 year old engineer she is connected 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.600
 and autonomous so unlike the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.340
 galaxy gear the apple watch or the sony 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.079
 straw neptune smartwatch is not a 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.940
 companion object for a smartphone she 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.170
 works alone thanks to a map 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.730
 sim and we could besides the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.380
 consider as a smartphone of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.610

 his rear camera have more than 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.289
 the device before its screen is 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.159
 obviously touch is rather 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.569
 nice to use 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.979
 presented through a project 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.689
 kickstarter it will not have needed more 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.740
 half a day to gather the hundred 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.170
 thousand dollars needed to launch 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.399
 of this watch so promising if the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.139
 neptune they interest you know 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.149

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:22.499
 Canadian on kickstarter and that one 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.479
 should hear about it 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.859
 it was one of the most 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.119
 popular on windows since its release 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.889
 15 years ago he is going 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.020
 disappear winamp whose popularity 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:32.759
 was growing in the 90s in 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.409
 same time as the mp3 format which he 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.849
 was the most well known player and is 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.959
 developed by nullsoft it allowed 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.909
 also stream and radios in 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.380
 line and its lightness and ability to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.880
 change appearance with thousands 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.649

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.419
 development of its success and the app has 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.700
 been bought by aol for 80 million 

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:48.929
 dollars in 2002 but aol has therefore decided 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.950
 it was time to turn the page 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.079
 today it is true that the market 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.219
 mp3 player is driven by itunes 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.200
 spotify or deezer 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.849
 even if winamp was available on mac 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.709

 microsoft she is called google 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.670
 it has only one purpose to denounce the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.660
 excess and abuse of his more serious 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.280
 google competitor 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.600
 the redmond company has indeed 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.700
 decided to denounce all sides 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.800
 pernicious of the google system and this of 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.360
 totally explicit way microsoft 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.310
 google told us how 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.080
 google spies us with his bed pubs 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.850
 in our emails with google gmail com 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.320
 shopping indicates false results of 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.430
 research that are actually derived from a 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.170
 classic price comparator 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.790

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.470
 strong since these are now the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.580

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.440
 google sides 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.850
 these products should have some 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.560
 success in the redmond area in 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.150
 the state of washington is a lot less 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.670

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.110
