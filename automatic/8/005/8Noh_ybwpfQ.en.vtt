so I'm guessing he's a um a fast
attacker<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.829> he<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.129> attack<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
attacker and like so he can attack and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.639 
attacker and like so he can attack and
deal<00:00:57.000> damage<00:00:57.149> really<00:00:57.480> fast<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:58.609> be<00:00:59.609> a<00:01:00.620> like<00:01:01.620> a
