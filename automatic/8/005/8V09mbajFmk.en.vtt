00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.040 
thing here and I look at it pretty
quickly<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.440> goin<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.520> challenges

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
quickly is the goin to the challenges

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.730 
quickly is the goin to the challenges
come<00:03:25.050> on<00:03:25.170> what<00:03:25.290> are<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.410> going<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
come on what are you going to the

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.190 
come on what are you going to the
challenges<00:03:26.100> baby<00:03:26.810> recording<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:27.900> after<00:03:28.170> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
challenges baby recording this after the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.230 
challenges baby recording this after the
fact<00:03:28.290> alright<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.010> then<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.700> challenges

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
fact alright and then in the challenges

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.480 
fact alright and then in the challenges
there<00:03:30.480> are<00:03:30.630> prestige<00:03:31.440> challenges<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.310> there

there are prestige challenges in there
so<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:33.300> presumably<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:34.050> is<00:03:34.200> going<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.500> help

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
so then presumably this is going to help

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.500 
so then presumably this is going to help
me<00:03:34.800> level<00:03:34.950> up<00:03:35.190> faster<00:03:35.730> this<00:03:35.880> time<00:03:35.940> around<00:03:36.240> than

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
me level up faster this time around than

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.180 
me level up faster this time around than
the<00:03:36.630> first<00:03:36.870> given<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.530> I'll<00:03:37.709> be<00:03:37.860> getting<00:03:38.010> new

problem in black ops 2 and on the right
the<00:04:29.099> solution<00:04:29.849> to<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.270> it's<00:04:30.900> not<00:04:31.080> completely

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
the solution to it it's not completely

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.529 
the solution to it it's not completely
perfect<00:04:31.919> but<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.310> helps<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.639> lot<00:04:32.849> especially<00:04:33.210> in

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
perfect but it helps a lot especially in

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.869 
perfect but it helps a lot especially in
