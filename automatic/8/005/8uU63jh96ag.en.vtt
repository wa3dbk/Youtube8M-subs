put everything in there and just I'll

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.129 
put everything in there and just I'll
just<00:03:16.489> add<00:03:16.819> it<00:03:16.849> to<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.180> recipe<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.569> kind<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:17.959> just

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
just add it to the recipe I kind of just

just add it to the recipe I kind of just
mix<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:18.560> up<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.799> little<00:03:18.919> bit<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:19.519> that<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:20.030> my

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
mix it up a little bit so that in my

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.440 
mix it up a little bit so that in my
mind<00:03:20.419> is<00:03:20.690> like<00:03:20.840> sort<00:03:21.139> of<00:03:21.230> sifting<00:03:21.650> sifting<00:03:22.099> it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
mind is like sort of sifting sifting it

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.319 
mind is like sort of sifting sifting it
but<00:03:23.450> if<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.599> have<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.780> sifter<00:03:24.079> please<00:03:25.060> do<00:03:26.060> that

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
but if you have a sifter please do that

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.270 
but if you have a sifter please do that
because<00:03:26.569> that's<00:03:26.959> what<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.380> recipe<00:03:27.829> calls<00:03:28.130> for

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
because that's what the recipe calls for

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.909 
because that's what the recipe calls for
so<00:03:29.269> I'm<00:03:29.329> going<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.569> mix<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:29.989> up<00:03:30.139> in<00:03:30.290> here<00:03:30.530> just<00:03:30.829> a

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
so I'm going to mix it up in here just a

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.470 
so I'm going to mix it up in here just a
little<00:03:31.069> bit<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.549> I'm<00:03:31.639> going<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.269> add<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.810> to

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
little bit and I'm going to add it to

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.120 
little bit and I'm going to add it to
the<00:03:35.480> wet<00:03:35.720> mixture<00:03:36.049> now<00:03:36.319> in<00:03:36.470> reason<00:03:36.859> and<00:03:37.069> I'm

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
the wet mixture now in reason and I'm

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.819 
the wet mixture now in reason and I'm
doing<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.609> in<00:03:37.760> this<00:03:37.970> way<00:03:38.269> is<00:03:38.660> because<00:03:39.230> when<00:03:39.680> you

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
doing it in this way is because when you

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.240 
doing it in this way is because when you
try<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.549> blend<00:03:41.060> it<00:03:41.299> with<00:03:41.870> your<00:03:42.109> hand<00:03:42.410> mixer<00:03:42.709> it

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
try to blend it with your hand mixer it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.690 
try to blend it with your hand mixer it
gets<00:03:43.489> it's<00:03:44.269> so<00:03:44.569> dense<00:03:45.010> that<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:46.069> can't<00:03:46.519> you

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
gets it's so dense that you can't you

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.229 
gets it's so dense that you can't you
can't<00:03:47.000> do<00:03:47.299> it<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.660> get<00:03:47.750> stuck<00:03:48.139> on<00:03:48.319> the

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
can't do it and get stuck on the

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.659 
can't do it and get stuck on the
blades<00:03:50.239> of<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.840> hand<00:03:51.139> mixer<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.340> doesn't

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
blades of the hand mixer so it doesn't

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.849 
blades of the hand mixer so it doesn't
work<00:03:52.819> out<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.060> well<00:03:53.510> so<00:03:53.870> just<00:03:53.930> go<00:03:54.290> ahead<00:03:54.319> and

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
work out so well so just go ahead and

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.830 
work out so well so just go ahead and
you<00:03:55.280> know<00:03:55.400> use<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.970> hand<00:03:56.209> mixer<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.569> blend

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
you know use the hand mixer to blend

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.809 
you know use the hand mixer to blend
some<00:03:57.079> wet<00:03:57.319> and

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
some wet and

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.149 
some wet and
but<00:03:58.819> after<00:03:59.330> you've<00:03:59.540> done<00:03:59.780> that<00:03:59.840> then<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.739> step

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
but after you've done that then you step

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.920 
but after you've done that then you step
away<00:04:01.340> from<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.120> just<00:04:02.269> do<00:04:02.720> it<00:04:02.840> the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
away from that and just do it the

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.110 
away from that and just do it the
old-fashioned<00:04:03.530> way

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
old-fashioned way

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.759 
old-fashioned way
so<00:04:05.120> we<00:04:05.269> just<00:04:05.390> want<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.690> mix<00:04:05.870> this<00:04:06.080> in<00:04:06.440> here

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
so we just want to mix this in here

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:15.180 
so we just want to mix this in here
really<00:04:07.430> well<00:04:10.390> really<00:04:11.390> dense<00:04:11.959> recipe<00:04:12.799> so<00:04:13.610> as

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
really well really dense recipe so as

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.349 
really well really dense recipe so as
