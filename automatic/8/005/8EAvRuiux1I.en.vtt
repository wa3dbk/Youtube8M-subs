I'm going to show you another technique

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.230 
I'm going to show you another technique
so<00:00:05.370> first<00:00:05.549> I'm<00:00:05.640> just<00:00:05.670> going<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:05.940> start<00:00:06.120> off<00:00:06.180> by

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
so first I'm just going to start off by

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.330 
so first I'm just going to start off by
dry<00:00:06.629> brushing<00:00:07.020> my<00:00:07.109> gel<00:00:07.350> this<00:00:07.799> basically<00:00:08.250> just

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
dry brushing my gel this basically just

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.160 
dry brushing my gel this basically just
means<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:08.849> have<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> very<00:00:09.599> small<00:00:09.870> amount<00:00:09.929> of

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
means that I have a very small amount of

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.749 
means that I have a very small amount of
product<00:00:10.410> on<00:00:10.590> my<00:00:10.650> brush<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.280> I'm<00:00:11.429> really

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
product on my brush and I'm really

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.310 
product on my brush and I'm really
pressing<00:00:12.059> hard<00:00:12.210> just<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.719> work<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.990> into<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
pressing hard just to work it into the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.020 
pressing hard just to work it into the
nail<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.679> I'm<00:00:14.040> also<00:00:14.219> using<00:00:14.370> two<00:00:14.910> different

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
nail and I'm also using two different

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.120 
nail and I'm also using two different
colors<00:00:15.260> after<00:00:16.260> i<00:00:16.289> cure<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.650> then<00:00:16.830> I'm<00:00:16.920> going<00:00:17.100> to

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
colors after i cure it then I'm going to

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.650 
colors after i cure it then I'm going to
apply<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.369> clear<00:00:17.789> gel<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> same

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
optional you can completely omit this

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.300 
optional you can completely omit this

step and do it one flat color or nothing
at<00:00:26.400> all<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.210> meanwhile<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.660> want<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> make<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
at all so meanwhile you want to make a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.540 
at all so meanwhile you want to make a
transparent<00:00:28.380> white<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.460> just

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
transparent white so to do that you just

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.950 
transparent white so to do that you just
want<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.760> take<00:00:29.880> your<00:00:30.029> white<00:00:30.240> gel<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.660> mix<00:00:30.840> that

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
want to take your white gel and mix that

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.380 
want to take your white gel and mix that
with<00:00:31.140> either<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.470> clear<00:00:31.859> base<00:00:32.070> or<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> top<00:00:33.120> gel

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
with either a clear base or a top gel

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.139 
with either a clear base or a top gel
but<00:00:33.660> don't<00:00:33.870> care<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.230> yet<00:00:34.640> next<00:00:35.640> taking<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
but don't care just yet next taking the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.400 
but don't care just yet next taking the
liner<00:00:36.329> brush<00:00:36.570> you're<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.079> dip<00:00:37.260> that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
liner brush you're going to dip that

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.950 
liner brush you're going to dip that
into<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:37.860> clear<00:00:38.129> base<00:00:38.340> or<00:00:38.640> top<00:00:38.969> gel<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.239> now

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
into your clear base or top gel and now

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.799 
into your clear base or top gel and now
drop<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.800> onto<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> nail<00:00:41.520> thus<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.450> droplet

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
drop it onto the nail thus the droplet

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.959 
drop it onto the nail thus the droplet
technique<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.320> FY<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.789> with<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
technique and FY you can do this with a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
technique and FY you can do this with a
dotting<00:00:45.360> tool<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.260> want<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> make<00:00:46.620> sure

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
dotting tool but you want to make sure

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.170 
dotting tool but you want to make sure
that<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.070> don't<00:00:47.250> actually<00:00:47.430> touch<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that you don't actually touch the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.029 
that you don't actually touch the
surface<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> nail<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.620> dotting<00:00:50.010> tool

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
surface of the nail with a dotting tool

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.069 
surface of the nail with a dotting tool
because<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.910> will<00:00:51.030> leave<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> mark<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.719> that's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
because it will leave a mark so that's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.689 
because it will leave a mark so that's
why<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> prefer<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> liner<00:00:52.800> brush<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.309> with

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
why I prefer the liner brush and with

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
why I prefer the liner brush and with
the<00:00:53.820> brush<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.570> control<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> shape<00:00:55.050> you

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the brush you can control the shape you

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
the brush you can control the shape you
don't<00:00:55.890> actually<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.789> make<00:00:56.969> circles

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
don't actually just have to make circles

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.209 
don't actually just have to make circles
so<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.050> technique<00:00:58.410> isn't<00:00:58.620> exclusive

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
so really this technique isn't exclusive

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.799 
so really this technique isn't exclusive
to<00:00:59.250> making<00:00:59.550> water<00:00:59.760> effects<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.600> any

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
to making water effects you can do any

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.689 
to making water effects you can do any
type<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.079> design<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.590> want<00:01:01.710> now<00:01:02.399> you'll<00:01:02.550> also

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
type of design you want now you'll also

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.130 
type of design you want now you'll also
notice<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.149> sometimes<00:01:03.390> when<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:03.809> working

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
notice that sometimes when I'm working

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.810 
notice that sometimes when I'm working
in<00:01:04.199> an<00:01:04.320> area<00:01:04.500> I'll<00:01:04.860> actually<00:01:05.070> move<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
in an area I'll actually move to a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.789 
in an area I'll actually move to a
different<00:01:06.210> spot<00:01:06.450> that's<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> give<00:01:07.590> those

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
different spot that's just to give those

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.670 
different spot that's just to give those
drops<00:01:08.130> times<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.760> expand<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> spread<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.530> that

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
drops times to expand and spread so that

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.530 
drops times to expand and spread so that
I<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.979> where<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> actually<00:01:11.670> need<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> fill<00:01:12.360> in

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
I know where I actually need to fill in

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.330 
I know where I actually need to fill in
the<00:01:13.140> more<00:01:13.320> product<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.799> brush<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the more product on your brush the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.920 
the more product on your brush the
bigger<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> circle<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.150> vice<00:01:15.390> versa

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
bigger the circle and vice versa

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.240 
bigger the circle and vice versa
so<00:01:16.229> once<00:01:16.380> you're<00:01:16.500> happy<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> look<00:01:17.100> you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
so once you're happy with the look you

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.340 
so once you're happy with the look you
can<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.490> ahead<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.880> cure<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.270> again<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.020> want

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
can go ahead and cure and again I want

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.780 
can go ahead and cure and again I want
to<00:01:19.409> add<00:01:19.500> some<00:01:19.680> 3d<00:01:19.830> elements<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.490> I'm<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
to add some 3d elements so I'm going to

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.179 
to add some 3d elements so I'm going to
take<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.180> soak<00:01:21.479> off<00:01:21.659> builder<00:01:22.080> gel<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> use<00:01:22.950> that

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
take a soak off builder gel and use that

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.820 
take a soak off builder gel and use that
to<00:01:23.400> adhere<00:01:23.759> these<00:01:24.030> crushed<00:01:24.420> shells<00:01:24.720> these<00:01:25.590> are

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
to adhere these crushed shells these are

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.160 
to adhere these crushed shells these are
pretty<00:01:26.070> heavy<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.700> they're<00:01:26.850> also<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
pretty heavy and they're also not the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.600 
pretty heavy and they're also not the
finished<00:01:28.530> product<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.070> should<00:01:29.189> put<00:01:29.460> on

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
finished product that you should put on

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.130 
finished product that you should put on
your<00:01:29.640> nails<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.450> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> apply<00:01:31.079> these

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
your nails so I'm going to apply these

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.990 
your nails so I'm going to apply these
and<00:01:31.560> then<00:01:31.680> I'm<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:31.979> go<00:01:32.159> back<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.790> with

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and then I'm going to go back in with

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
and then I'm going to go back in with
more<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.509> gel<00:01:33.840> after<00:01:34.079> curing<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.770> first

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
more of that gel after curing the first

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
more of that gel after curing the first
layer<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.250> course<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.850> I'm<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
layer of course and I'm just going to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.069 
layer of course and I'm just going to
basically<00:01:37.110> encapsulate<00:01:37.890> those<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> taking<00:01:39.990> a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
basically encapsulate those so taking a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.810 
basically encapsulate those so taking a
generous<00:01:40.560> amount<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.920> gel<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.670> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
generous amount of gel I'm going to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
generous amount of gel I'm going to
apply<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.479> top<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> nail<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
apply this to the top of the nail and

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.859 
apply this to the top of the nail and
then<00:01:43.680> I'm<00:01:43.799> basically<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.369> making<00:01:44.869> very

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
then I'm basically just making very

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.660 
then I'm basically just making very
small<00:01:46.020> contact<00:01:46.649> with<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> gel<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.430> can

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
small contact with the gel so that I can

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.749 
small contact with the gel so that I can
float<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.240> over<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:49.140> cuticle<00:01:49.560> area<00:01:49.759> sweeping

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
float it over the cuticle area sweeping

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.520 
float it over the cuticle area sweeping
it<00:01:50.880> from<00:01:51.090> side<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.360> side<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.110> apply<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
it from side to side just to apply it to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.830 
it from side to side just to apply it to
the<00:01:52.740> nail<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.130> then<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.700> actually<00:01:54.000> go<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.570> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the nail and then I actually go in and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.929 
the nail and then I actually go in and
smooth<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.439> over<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> entire<00:01:56.640> nail

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
smooth it down over the entire nail

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.749 
smooth it down over the entire nail
plate<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:58.350> now<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> nail<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.890> completely<00:01:59.340> even

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
plate so now the nail is completely even

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.550 
plate so now the nail is completely even
and<00:02:00.000> flush<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.719> there's<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.930> smooth<00:02:01.259> shine

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and flush so there's a smooth shine

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.139 
and flush so there's a smooth shine
across<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.070> surface<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.909> touch<00:02:03.119> it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
across the surface and if I touch it

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.420 
across the surface and if I touch it
it's<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> snag<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:05.009> after<00:02:05.250> you've

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
it's not going to snag so after you've

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.830 
it's not going to snag so after you've
cured<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.850> layer<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.060> course<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:06.689> want

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
cured that layer of course you then want

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.050 
cured that layer of course you then want
to<00:02:06.930> apply<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> top<00:02:07.259> gel<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.860> then<00:02:08.099> you're<00:02:08.610> done

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
to apply a top gel and then you're done

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.760
