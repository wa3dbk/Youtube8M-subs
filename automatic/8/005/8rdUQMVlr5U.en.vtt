00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.350 
it work the chance of getting that is
really<00:00:33.480> low<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> quarter<00:00:35.340> chance<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:36.239> it

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
really low like a quarter chance but it

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.389 
really low like a quarter chance but it
you<00:00:36.690> will<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> by<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.440> timing<00:00:40.190> I'll<00:00:41.190> just

turn like 12 or 13 unless your unless

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.420 
turn like 12 or 13 unless your unless
you<00:00:51.989> only<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.440> rely<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you only to rely on that and you have a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.860 
you only to rely on that and you have a
bunch<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.789> drug<00:00:54.030> cards<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> little

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
bunch of drug cards and it's a little

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:04.179 
bunch of drug cards and it's a little
different<00:00:54.989> but<00:00:55.800> generally<00:00:56.219> speaking<00:00:56.280> a

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.950 

quarter<00:01:05.189> chance<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> right<00:01:06.210> turn<00:01:06.600> 12

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
quarter chance to have it right turn 12

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
quarter chance to have it right turn 12
or<00:01:07.140> 13<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.650> usually<00:01:08.040> gimmies<00:01:08.340> decide<00:01:08.670> by
