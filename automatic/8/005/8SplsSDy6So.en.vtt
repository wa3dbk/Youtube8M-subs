00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.760 

okay<00:00:01.890> so<00:00:02.490> this<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.909> the<00:00:03.090> theta<00:00:03.300> printer<00:00:03.780> it's<00:00:04.589> a

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
okay so this is the theta printer it's a

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.970 
okay so this is the theta printer it's a
3d<00:00:05.250> printer<00:00:05.609> with<00:00:05.790> four<00:00:06.089> extruders<00:00:06.770> it<00:00:07.770> gets

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
3d printer with four extruders it gets

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.560 
3d printer with four extruders it gets
its<00:00:08.160> name<00:00:08.340> from<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.760> fact<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.120> it<00:00:09.330> uses

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
its name from the fact that it uses

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.839 
its name from the fact that it uses
polar<00:00:10.170> coordinates<00:00:10.830> instead<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.400> Cartesian

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
polar coordinates instead of Cartesian

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.870 
polar coordinates instead of Cartesian
coordinates<00:00:12.860> because<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.340> spinning

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
coordinates because of the spinning

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.040 
coordinates because of the spinning
platter<00:00:17.090> anyways<00:00:18.090> what<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> wanted<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:19.020> a

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
platter anyways what I wanted was a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.609 
platter anyways what I wanted was a
machine<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.740> could<00:00:19.890> print<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:21.410> bunch<00:00:22.410> of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
machine that could print a bunch of

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.420 
machine that could print a bunch of
different<00:00:22.980> materials<00:00:23.519> at<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> same<00:00:24.119> time<00:00:25.430> so

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
different materials at the same time so

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.910 
different materials at the same time so
cuz<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:28.130> most<00:00:29.130> 3d<00:00:29.460> printers<00:00:30.679> even<00:00:31.679> if<00:00:31.769> they

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
cuz I with most 3d printers even if they

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.389 
cuz I with most 3d printers even if they
have<00:00:32.040> multiple<00:00:32.219> extruders<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:34.160> prints<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
have multiple extruders a prints for a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
have multiple extruders a prints for a
little<00:00:35.640> bit<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.120> extruder<00:00:36.690> then<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
little bit with one extruder then it

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.959 
little bit with one extruder then it
switches<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.890> other<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.399> switches<00:00:38.790> back

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
switches to the other and switches back

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.450 
switches to the other and switches back
so<00:00:39.300> you're<00:00:39.450> not<00:00:39.480> really<00:00:39.780> printing

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
so you're not really printing

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
so you're not really printing
simultaneously<00:00:41.780> but<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> theta

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
simultaneously but with the theta

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
simultaneously but with the theta
printer<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.250> use<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.940> four<00:00:45.390> extruders

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
printer you can use all four extruders

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.690 
printer you can use all four extruders
running<00:00:47.280> at<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> same<00:00:47.760> time<00:00:48.140> to<00:00:49.140> either<00:00:49.700> print

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
running at the same time to either print

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.670 
running at the same time to either print
four<00:00:51.000> different<00:00:51.360> materials<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.230> could

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
four different materials or you could

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.110 
four different materials or you could
have<00:00:52.829> them<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.160> printing<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:56.250> same<00:00:56.520> material

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
have them all printing the same material

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.459 
have them all printing the same material
four<00:00:57.660> times<00:00:57.960> fast

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
four times fast

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.770 
four times fast
so<00:01:01.469> other<00:01:01.949> advantages<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.090> design<00:01:03.510> are

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
so other advantages of this design are

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
so other advantages of this design are
that<00:01:03.960> there's<00:01:04.199> less<00:01:04.559> moving<00:01:05.040> mass<00:01:05.250> which

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that there's less moving mass which

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.060 
that there's less moving mass which
means<00:01:05.909> better<00:01:06.210> excellent<00:01:06.840> acceleration<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
means better excellent acceleration and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.539 
means better excellent acceleration and
higher<00:01:08.340> print<00:01:08.700> speeds<00:01:09.650> also<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.369> much

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
higher print speeds also you get much

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.820 
higher print speeds also you get much
finer<00:01:11.850> resolution<00:01:12.150> near<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> center<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
finer resolution near the center of the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.499 
finer resolution near the center of the
build<00:01:14.010> platform<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:17.640> software<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> designed

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
build platform the software is designed

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.050 
build platform the software is designed
to<00:01:18.900> emulate<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.439> standard<00:01:20.070> Cartesian<00:01:20.490> printer

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
to emulate a standard Cartesian printer

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
to emulate a standard Cartesian printer
so<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.659> use<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.229> whatever<00:01:22.530> slicer

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
so you can use it with whatever slicer

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.330 
so you can use it with whatever slicer
you<00:01:23.400> want<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.140> all<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.350> regular<00:01:25.500> RepRap

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
you want and all your regular RepRap

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.740 
you want and all your regular RepRap
software<00:01:27.890> in<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.220> video<00:01:29.610> I'm<00:01:29.909> demonstrating

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
software in this video I'm demonstrating

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.069 
software in this video I'm demonstrating
printing<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.229> hexagon<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:32.070> two<00:01:32.340> print<00:01:32.640> heads

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
printing a hexagon with two print heads

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.870 
printing a hexagon with two print heads
but<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> objects<00:01:34.710> don't<00:01:34.740> necessarily<00:01:35.700> need

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
but the objects don't necessarily need

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.580 
but the objects don't necessarily need
to<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.090> symmetrical<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.170> even<00:01:37.200> round<00:01:39.590> right

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to be symmetrical or even round right

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.859 
to be symmetrical or even round right
now<00:01:40.619> I'm<00:01:40.979> using<00:01:41.130> standard<00:01:41.850> extruders<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
now I'm using standard extruders on it

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.080 
now I'm using standard extruders on it
but<00:01:43.380> people<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.829> started<00:01:44.130> selling<00:01:44.729> bowden

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
but people have started selling bowden

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.230 
but people have started selling bowden
extruders<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.990> multiple<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:47.070> hot<00:01:47.759> ends<00:01:48.090> on

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
extruders with multiple a hot ends on

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.920 
extruders with multiple a hot ends on
them<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.439> imagine<00:01:49.649> sticking<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.930> quad

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
them so you can imagine sticking a quad

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.649 
them so you can imagine sticking a quad
hot<00:01:52.229> end<00:01:52.439> extruder<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.310> each<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.210> these<00:01:54.299> print

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
hot end extruder up each of these print

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.240 
hot end extruder up each of these print
heads<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.170> suddenly<00:01:55.530> you're<00:01:55.710> talking<00:01:55.740> about

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
heads and suddenly you're talking about

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.410 
heads and suddenly you're talking about
not<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:58.130> materials<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.520> eight<00:02:00.090> or

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
not just for materials but eight or

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.030 
not just for materials but eight or
sixteen<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:03.659> rotating<00:02:04.200> design<00:02:04.560> also<00:02:04.829> makes

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
sixteen the rotating design also makes

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.460 
sixteen the rotating design also makes
it<00:02:05.399> perfect<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.060> building<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.600> 3d<00:02:07.259> scanner
