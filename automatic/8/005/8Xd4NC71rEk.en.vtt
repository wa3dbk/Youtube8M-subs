00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.419
 Hi everyone this is only 45 for my second video commented in May 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.299
 general and on a turf this time 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.890
 so I would like to start following barber mercier all those who have me 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.130
 encouraged% with their comments on youtube and on for the topic what I have 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.800
 done on gamesvideo com 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.289
 it's really fun and it really makes you want to continue so 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.140
 I hope that this second video will please you as much or more 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.649
 that the first that's it you say it 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.230
 You choose 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.540
 and so for this video I take I write them 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.090
 a machine gun the p90 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.090
 a scr catalyst 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.320
 marathon 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.450
 unopposed and perrine young and pro 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.670
 so it's mediatouch happy days on my classes pretty much not what I'm going 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.310
 have to 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.540
 and I like discreetly 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.800
 marathon because it's the machine gun and then by dint of blows because me 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.640
 I think it's a little ambiguous 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.400
 at n1 who basically do not know what we are going to bind them we will try to kill him 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.720
 flo 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 this is done three in a row grateful in return for justice of 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.800
 common right 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.170
 like any limited series 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.300
 gilles drouet 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.490
 the messiah predator and she has arrived 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.230
 some water games in fact that of fucking 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.020
 haas found the enemies 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.640
 and even more on the agenda the inter also high-savoie iron or fireplace that 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.700
 these lands 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.640
 and there for example I know that hand in the corner so he initiates 2010 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.580
 can not blow to take me from behind but hey I'll wait and 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.560
 I am I know 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.189
 so apparently the enemy is on the other side a convoy of forces 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.990
 americans for africa why she 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.010
 and I try to inculcate a series of five eliminations in a row 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.430
 so that would surely end up on a groom 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.600
 we will see this predators 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.219
 see that there are still some enmities in the house I make you 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.189
 than what I saw that the window 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.020
 etc is put on the balcony 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.830
 - in europe the right has worked but no we will see them in person 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.739
 laurent gbagbo in person 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.190
 in addition to christian hiller we may be the one where went to the side 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.670
 our children of the southern camp reserves 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.670
 in touch the bo same handle in the corner was too his mandate 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.819
 so we'll do it there anyway 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.839
 see this trial 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:46.109
 and in addition they want him to miss this predator a boat no luck rare 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.039
 so we go bankrupt 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:51.759
 that's like yesterday I think he was inside 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.759
 morin and we will go he is Shiite 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:00.559
 we continue 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.889
 for francophone africa in this country the 90 minutes 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.359
 for her it was a bliss brand new big loaders 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.639
 it was really 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.499
 qatra tic on this plane 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:14.670
 in addition it's him who since are affected is really a good weapon 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.290
 com had asked to play athenes 16 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.940
 in fact I tried but% what is not good I did not do 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.929
 very very good parts 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:28.069
 but I preferred to return to a weapon 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.119
 I did not really know 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:35.039
 I played three times in the year and this during this topic is played 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:38.579
 so I can not what freshness that composed great maximum what I'm going 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.189
 start this morning 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.029
 cooke 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:48.689
 the qg and judged that jean lasserre you can do for the 160th 150 dogs etc 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.459
 I think that if I 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.159
 actually behind entire 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.949
 if you play your commune or so go very powerful but she has 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.949
 answered I can not shoot better in the feet as employers 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.510
 and yeah that's surely in that sense bush 2007 the inverted 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.459
 budget see the gaec useless 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.599
 actually daughter my angel were not ceasing 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:20.319
 these chibanis testers but hey I think that fufu revolutionized the community 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.250
 of modern warfare 2 using that's the thing that make 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.800
 unless one possible 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.240
 i believe that m the community is now obvious 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.210
 gravelines victor is needed 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.210
 like it's all year long 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.160
 and even if they use morphine and then for me we're going to finish like that 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.870
 short as much of Corsica 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.100
 I hesitate also there is no cod4 because apparently yes but 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.740
 only at my cousin's home where I discovered the call of duty m series 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.050
 and the chu had not taken the step on the list of everything we would see 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.040
 loops baget site I do not know if you advise me to power 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.289
 I still hesitate 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.439
 especially the better world at his post 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.680
 I do not really know 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.870
 and aiming to see it if you see it really does not play time will use 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:18.089
 42nd series of five parades 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:22.599
 before swinging a little wait hoping to do a smash 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:23.720
 this time 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.379
 it would be a plus 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:28.029
 as is normal 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.800
 here are the numbers I'm lucky 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.800
 to enter polaris provence not super important as countries 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.839
 this thing against rage that we do not have a criterion of this 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.909
 in these cases nothing 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:47.029
 at the time when we will return to his grave I remain open 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.529
 flammarion 5 for once 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.379
 performed in the back 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.020
 farrah gray 80 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.699
 if I'm not wrong flag 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.110
 a goal a bath 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.110
 allik yet in that corner 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.099
 for the pride of the commando but yet it is not the case 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.449
 it's weird I skied africa command 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.930
 by cons a year ago 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.469
 16 we saw well 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:24.529
 bavay and son asks if I quoted for no tears m in the hands it's a 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:26.740
 faithful sonic retro strung 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.740
 I think that it changes the movement would have to check that 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.370
 head that's why it's feasible for the leaf is well dead cowards 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.229
 limits one must use a tool that followed then when i did both 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.749
 every time I suddenly have a knife in my back 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:45.589
 not very nice 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:49.309
 because yesterday france is still following we will not be a gift either 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:50.110
 no 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.990
 after 5% 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.360
 this project 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.360
 this skate finally find themselves without a roof 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.889
 a resident 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.889
 356 that's what I said earlier 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.039
 it's a little sentence shaped to do the ola 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:13.389
 already over 420 minutes it was happening very quickly and I'm doing a 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:17.059
 set of three for the penultimate kilometer and that's choice the choice and 

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:20.059
 my right our moments it should not be there as just now 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:23.710
 go more than one last to do 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.159
 that jupp after the intervention I'm not concerned in more pointed 

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:33.060
 it's useless and here is a kit all that to finish this part 

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:36.249
 at the base of everything 

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:39.680
 I hope it will continue we will continue to comment it was 

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:41.960
 a dream that you will like this second video 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.370
 here is hi
