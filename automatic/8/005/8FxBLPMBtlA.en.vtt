00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
all the buttons feel great - though I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.430 
all the buttons feel great - though I
don't<00:02:20.400> care<00:02:21.090> for<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.390> default<00:02:21.690> placement<00:02:22.260> of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
don't care for the default placement of

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.350 
don't care for the default placement of
the<00:02:22.530> strong<00:02:22.800> attacks<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.460> triggers<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.150> I

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
the strong attacks on the triggers so I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.420 
the strong attacks on the triggers so I
change<00:02:24.960> them<00:02:25.080> over<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.500> face<00:02:25.710> buttons<00:02:26.010> but

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
change them over to the face buttons but

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.550 
change them over to the face buttons but
overall<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.180> game<00:02:27.240> controls<00:02:27.840> really<00:02:28.230> nicely

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.170 
I love the way this game looks it has
almost<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.350> grimy<00:02:34.709> gritty<00:02:35.310> look<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:35.970> with<00:02:36.150> a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
almost a grimy gritty look to it with a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180 
almost a grimy gritty look to it with a
more<00:02:36.420> muted<00:02:36.720> color<00:02:37.140> palette<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.680> very<00:02:37.980> odd

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
more muted color palette and very odd

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.610 
more muted color palette and very odd
selection<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.820> levels<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.440> fighters<00:02:40.440> all

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
selection of levels the fighters all

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.740 
selection of levels the fighters all
look<00:02:40.860> really<00:02:41.190> good<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.490> their<00:02:41.610> SNK<00:02:42.090> style<00:02:42.450> and

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
look really good in their SNK style and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.190 
look really good in their SNK style and
the<00:02:42.990> animations<00:02:43.680> all<00:02:43.950> run<00:02:44.280> very<00:02:44.640> smoothly<00:02:45.200> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
the animations all run very smoothly the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.380 
the animations all run very smoothly the
music<00:02:46.530> on<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.800> other<00:02:46.920> hand<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.400> another<00:02:47.910> story

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
music on the other hand is another story

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.130 
music on the other hand is another story
it's<00:02:48.690> very<00:02:49.430> forgettable<00:02:50.720> but<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.900> sound

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
it's very forgettable but the sound

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.870 
it's very forgettable but the sound
effects<00:02:52.500> are<00:02:52.709> among<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.100> best<00:02:53.250> I've<00:02:53.489> heard<00:02:53.700> in

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
effects are among the best I've heard in

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.280 
effects are among the best I've heard in
the<00:02:53.970> fighting<00:02:54.180> game<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.750> punching<00:02:55.140> kicking

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
the fighting game the punching kicking

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.050 
the fighting game the punching kicking
acts<00:02:55.680> really<00:02:55.980> sound<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.430> something<00:02:56.910> out<00:02:57.030> of

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
acts really sound like something out of

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.570 
acts really sound like something out of
an<00:02:57.239> old-school<00:02:57.480> kung<00:02:57.900> fu<00:02:58.080> movie<00:02:58.530> at<00:02:58.620> times<00:02:58.920> and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
an old-school kung fu movie at times and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.430 
an old-school kung fu movie at times and
the<00:02:59.970> character<00:03:00.300> voices<00:03:00.510> are<00:03:00.840> all<00:03:00.959> really<00:03:01.260> good

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
the character voices are all really good

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.380 
the character voices are all really good
though<00:03:01.800> most<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.430> them<00:03:02.550> remain<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:02.910> Japanese

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390
