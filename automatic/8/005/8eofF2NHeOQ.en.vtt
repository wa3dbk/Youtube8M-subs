00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello everyone is alexander today 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.970
 we find ourselves for a small video 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.670
 so here I am going to make a door 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.500
 cane for float tube so here I go 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.450
 to go to the Kabbalah and with my father 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.679
 me this lighter that for me 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.400
 shows the few steps and then we get 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.320
 will join for the end to see the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.590
 result 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.590
 Let's go 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.010
 I 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.560
 roy 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.690
 finished so here we will go on the 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.660
 practical part and we will twist all that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.240
 then we will make holes and then we will 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:32.590
 attach all the gear that is given to the 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.990
 we end up here we are 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.800
 finished purging the first parts 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.880
 that's what's going to happen on the south 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.360
 that after that will be like that we will put 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.390
 the cases on here we find ourselves 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.390
 that we finished making all 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.090
 the sasp racing in the Puerto Rican final 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.460
 fence so there while my father he 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.460
 in the process of determining all that 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.510
 I ride my cat their train 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.260
 make some small edits here 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.479
 I have about six hours 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.180
 I am found some small screens 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:36.560
 some small fish 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:38.620
 nice swimmers yeah I find 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.620
 trust 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.740
 we finished the first part so 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:20.319
 here it is the assembly of the two sub 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:22.569
 by basic first part there in front of 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.819
 finish the second and learn to ride 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:28.210
 the 2 so we get together when we have 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.860
 finished I wear what is it 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.319
 so here we just finished the door cane 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.319
 flow on it so here is the result 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:40.659
 so we put it on the tube and that 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:42.460
 gives a result rather not bad so we 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:50.050
 tried we have the weekends on so 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:52.840
 it gives a result rather we are in 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.199
 had for a whim 20 euros to 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.199
 break everything 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.780
 so we took small ones 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.669
 road pod supports 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.229
 which is simpler and afterwards in view 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.610
 we did not have it at all we did 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:10.090
 the recovery has been learned from species of tips 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.250
 rubber that we have put two 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.800
 forms make media weekends on 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.800
 see where it cane support 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.130
 Practical float tube cheap 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.750
