00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.389 

okay<00:00:01.170> now<00:00:01.469> let's<00:00:01.680> have<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.800> think<00:00:02.040> about<00:00:02.220> some

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
okay now let's have a think about some

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.340 
okay now let's have a think about some
river<00:00:02.580> transportation<00:00:03.030> processes<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:03.990> other

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
river transportation processes in other

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.349 
river transportation processes in other
words<00:00:04.589> how<00:00:04.920> do<00:00:04.980> rivers<00:00:05.339> move<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.730> material<00:00:06.240> or

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
words how do rivers move the material or

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.000 
words how do rivers move the material or
load<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:07.200> they've<00:00:07.350> eroded<00:00:07.770> further

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
load that they've eroded further

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.100 
load that they've eroded further
upstream<00:00:08.340> we've<00:00:09.210> got<00:00:09.330> four<00:00:09.570> process<00:00:10.019> we're

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
upstream we've got four process we're

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.419 
upstream we've got four process we're
going<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.260> talk<00:00:10.469> about<00:00:10.500> we're<00:00:11.160> going<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.340> do

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
going to talk about we're going to do

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.400 
going to talk about we're going to do
these<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.730> size<00:00:11.940> or<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> first<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.960> all<00:00:13.080> we're

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
these in size or the first of all we're

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.650 
these in size or the first of all we're
going<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.620> talk<00:00:13.740> about<00:00:13.769> traction<00:00:14.660> attractions

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
going to talk about traction attractions

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.420 
going to talk about traction attractions
you<00:00:15.809> can<00:00:15.900> see<00:00:16.020> by<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.230> diagram<00:00:16.619> moves<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
you can see by the diagram moves the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.279 
you can see by the diagram moves the
biggest<00:00:17.880> bits<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.480> material<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.960> biggest

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
biggest bits of material the biggest

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.160 
biggest bits of material the biggest
rocks<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:20.430> by<00:00:20.580> accident<00:00:21.080> on<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
rocks and it's not by accident on the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.019 
rocks and it's not by accident on the
lower<00:00:22.410> part<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> river<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.730> riverbed

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
lower part of the river on the riverbed

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.279 
lower part of the river on the riverbed
because<00:00:24.420> they<00:00:24.510> don't<00:00:24.689> actually<00:00:24.810> leave<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
because they don't actually leave the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.259 
because they don't actually leave the
riverbed<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.279> force<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.730> water<00:00:26.880> gets

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
riverbed so the force of the water gets

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.330 
riverbed so the force of the water gets
behind<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.840> rock<00:00:28.050> or<00:00:28.410> gets<00:00:28.740> behind<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.130> boulder

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
behind a rock or gets behind a boulder

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.569 
behind a rock or gets behind a boulder
and<00:00:29.609> rolls<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.449> end<00:00:30.660> over<00:00:31.199> end<00:00:31.289> down<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and rolls it end over end down the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.580 
and rolls it end over end down the
riverbed<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.239> that's<00:00:33.780> how<00:00:33.899> traction<00:00:34.410> works

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
riverbed and that's how traction works

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.470 
riverbed and that's how traction works
essentially<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.760> imagine<00:00:35.850> it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
essentially and as you can imagine it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.060 
essentially and as you can imagine it
works<00:00:36.690> best<00:00:36.989> when<00:00:37.140> there's<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> lot<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.800> power

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
works best when there's a lot of power

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.920 
works best when there's a lot of power
in<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> river<00:00:38.550> it'll<00:00:39.149> work<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.719> lower

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
in the river it'll work when it's lower

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.869 
in the river it'll work when it's lower
in<00:00:40.590> terms<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.950> energy<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.370> will<00:00:41.460> only<00:00:41.579> move

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
in terms of energy but will only move

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.000 
in terms of energy but will only move
smaller<00:00:42.270> stones<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.379> energy<00:00:43.800> situation

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
smaller stones in this energy situation

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010 
smaller stones in this energy situation
but<00:00:44.730> when<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.149> flood<00:00:45.360> situation<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:45.930> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
but when in a flood situation with a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.810 
but when in a flood situation with a
very<00:00:46.289> high<00:00:46.500> flow<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> move<00:00:47.579> very

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
very high flow it's going to move very

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.959 
very high flow it's going to move very
very<00:00:48.030> large<00:00:48.180> boulders<00:00:49.070> okay<00:00:50.070> next<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.489> we're

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
very large boulders okay next up we're

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.549 
very large boulders okay next up we're
going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> talk<00:00:51.360> about<00:00:51.390> saltation<00:00:52.110> which<00:00:52.410> is

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
going to talk about saltation which is

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.069 
going to talk about saltation which is
the<00:00:52.680> next<00:00:53.039> size<00:00:53.510> process<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the next size process down and when I

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.290 
the next size process down and when I
say<00:00:55.260> size<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.800> mean<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> amount<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> size

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
say size I mean the amount on the size

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
say size I mean the amount on the size
of<00:00:57.510> material<00:00:58.020> individually<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> saltation

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
of material individually the saltation

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
of material individually the saltation
can<00:00:59.520> move<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.449> see<00:01:00.539> again<00:01:00.780> we've<00:01:00.989> got

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
can move and you can see again we've got

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.100 
can move and you can see again we've got
smaller<00:01:01.500> material<00:01:01.710> moved<00:01:02.489> by<00:01:02.640> saltation<00:01:03.110> it's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
smaller material moved by saltation it's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.420 
smaller material moved by saltation it's
the<00:01:04.170> same<00:01:04.350> process<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.769> moves<00:01:05.040> sound<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the same process that moves sound in a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.359 
the same process that moves sound in a
desert<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.540> particle<00:01:06.979> will<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.070> moved

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
desert and a particle will be moved

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.250 
desert and a particle will be moved
along<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.000> river<00:01:09.150> profile<00:01:09.540> by<00:01:09.689> bouncing

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
along the river profile by bouncing

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.050 
along the river profile by bouncing
along<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> riverbed<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.400> river<00:01:11.640> hasn't<00:01:11.939> got

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
along the riverbed the river hasn't got

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000 
along the riverbed the river hasn't got
enough<00:01:12.210> energy<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.689> carry<00:01:13.080> along<00:01:13.350> completely

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
enough energy to carry along completely

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.289 
enough energy to carry along completely
without<00:01:14.250> searching<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.700> banks<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> bed

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
without searching the banks or the bed

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.410 
without searching the banks or the bed
so<00:01:15.900> individual<00:01:16.619> items<00:01:17.130> then<00:01:17.460> bounce<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
so individual items then bounce up and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.140 
so individual items then bounce up and
down<00:01:18.630> along<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> river<00:01:19.710> profile<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.400> what

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
down along the river profile and what

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.240 
down along the river profile and what
can<00:01:21.330> happen<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.110> particle<00:01:22.500> strikes

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
can happen is as one particle strikes

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.640 
can happen is as one particle strikes
the<00:01:23.939> bed<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.299> river<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.659> might<00:01:24.900> impact<00:01:25.409> on

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the bed of the river it might impact on

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.109 
the bed of the river it might impact on
several<00:01:25.920> others<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.369> cause<00:01:26.549> them<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.939> shoot

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
several others and cause them to shoot

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.520 
several others and cause them to shoot
out<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> bit<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> chain<00:01:28.500> reaction

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
out and it's a bit like a chain reaction

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.420 
out and it's a bit like a chain reaction
so<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.490> saltation<00:01:30.950> okay<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> next<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.340> we

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
so that saltation okay the next one we

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
so that saltation okay the next one we
talk<00:01:32.579> about<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.939> suspension<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.140> exceed

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
talk about is suspension and exceed

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.999 
talk about is suspension and exceed
suspension<00:01:35.070> over<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:36.409> suspension<00:01:37.409> moves<00:01:37.650> a

flow of the river and the way this

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
flow of the river and the way this
typically<00:01:56.850> looks<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.869> these<00:01:57.990> particles

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469

typically looks is that these particles
that<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.189> see<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> diagram<00:01:59.640> they

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
that you can see in the diagram they

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.910 
that you can see in the diagram they
would<00:02:00.479> make<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> river<00:02:01.140> look<00:02:01.320> very<00:02:01.500> murky

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
would make the river look very murky

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.910 
would make the river look very murky
very<00:02:02.100> muddy<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.659> orangie<00:02:04.229> brownie<00:02:04.590> color

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
very muddy as of orangie brownie color

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.380 
very muddy as of orangie brownie color
and<00:02:05.189> that's<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.490> sign<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> rivers<00:02:06.180> got<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and that's a sign that the rivers got a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.300 
and that's a sign that the rivers got a
lot<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.810> suspended<00:02:07.200> sediment<00:02:07.710> carrying<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.220> by

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
lot of suspended sediment carrying it by

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.360 
lot of suspended sediment carrying it by
suspension<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:10.500> last<00:02:10.709> method<00:02:10.920> talk<00:02:11.160> about<00:02:11.280> is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
suspension the last method talk about is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.309 
suspension the last method talk about is
solution<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:11.940> similar<00:02:12.660> word<00:02:12.840> offs<00:02:13.080> it's<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
solution and similar word offs it's the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.850 
solution and similar word offs it's the
same<00:02:13.500> word

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
same word

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.740 
same word
as<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.040> river<00:02:14.400> erosion<00:02:14.550> process<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.600> is

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
as a river erosion process and this is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.650 
as a river erosion process and this is
where<00:02:15.960> material<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.340> so<00:02:17.550> small<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.480> can

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
where material that is so small it can

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.960 
where material that is so small it can
actually<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:19.290> dissolved<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.490> in<00:02:20.790> the

actually be dissolved in the in the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.580 
actually be dissolved in the in the
river<00:02:21.150> flow<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.990> let's<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.200> carry<00:02:22.380> along

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
river flow and let's just carry along

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.500 
river flow and let's just carry along
completely<00:02:23.250> invisible<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> naked<00:02:24.000> eye<00:02:24.330> so

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
completely invisible to the naked eye so

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.510 
completely invisible to the naked eye so
the<00:02:25.080> four<00:02:25.290> methods<00:02:25.620> again<00:02:25.890> we've<00:02:26.490> got

traction with very large material we've

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.770

got<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> saltation<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:29.970> small<00:02:30.270> material<00:02:30.690> that

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
got a saltation with small material that

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.440 
got a saltation with small material that
bounces<00:02:31.260> we've<00:02:31.800> got<00:02:31.920> suspension<00:02:32.310> with<00:02:32.970> very

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
