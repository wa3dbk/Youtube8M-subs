00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.349
 Belarusian wrestlers returned with 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.860
 the world championships at the airport met 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.860
 Our correspondent Andrei Ivanov

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.409
 just look how much you need 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.619
 was played in turkey 21 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:22.420
 completed 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.880
 Belarusians successfully that my every fourth 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.770
 pedestal overall our team 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.720
 ranked fifth for comparison 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.800
 the Russians were the first to win 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.070
 ten medals 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.550
 however comparison is not quite 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.910
 correct given 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.150
 human resource

 our eastern neighbors 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.270
 the last day of the tournament bout 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.140
 heavyweights always cause elevated 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.520
 interest is especially when on the carpet 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.980
 triple champion 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.610
 Russian Bilyal Machs weight category 120

 shows awards and is recognized 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.460
 no luck 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.920
 in this life should not be lucky 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.810
 throughout my career I considered myself 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.270
 so it does not mean rubles 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.960
 we performed my favor 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.940
 I probably you yourself ugly 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.260
 how I trained this year this 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.240
 really in all the same preparing for 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.130

 coach water coach Sergey Karelia results 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.909
 I was satisfied with my athletes 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.650
 said we will try to add 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.679

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.860
 gold medal on that 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.170
 and as planned but more of course 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.430
 a little bit failed 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.470
 according to Rosstat at the judges 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.260
 inspector gpn but in general it was worth 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.980
 fighting good guys seem very even 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.710
 not bad at will nightmare decided who 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.580

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.369
 results showed fighters against Turkey 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.709
 certainly deserve respect 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:10.620
 but 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.390
 Many Belarusian athletes have achieved 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.050
 make a name for yourself on the wrestling mat 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.420

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.180
