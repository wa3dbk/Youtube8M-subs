to balance things out but once you get
into<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.739> area<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.180> processing<00:02:39.180> foods<00:02:39.530> there

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
into the area of processing foods there

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.759 
into the area of processing foods there
is<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:41.069> dietary<00:02:41.970> change<00:02:42.269> taking<00:02:43.049> place<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
is a dietary change taking place and

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.900 
is a dietary change taking place and
furthermore<00:02:44.610> we<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.720> recognize<00:02:46.230> that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
furthermore we have to recognize that

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.750 
furthermore we have to recognize that
the<00:02:47.910> American<00:02:48.450> diet<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.349> Western<00:02:49.890> diet<00:02:50.130> has

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the American diet the Western diet has

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.729 
the American diet the Western diet has
been<00:02:50.790> dramatically<00:02:51.540> changing<00:02:52.319> in<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.470> area

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
been dramatically changing in the area

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.819 
been dramatically changing in the area
of<00:02:52.769> animal<00:02:53.459> products<00:02:54.380> we<00:02:55.380> have<00:02:55.470> seen<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.769> the

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
of animal products we have seen in the

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.180 
of animal products we have seen in the
last<00:02:56.010> 100<00:02:56.610> years<00:02:56.640> an<00:02:57.239> almost<00:02:58.049> doubling<00:02:58.739> of<00:02:58.920> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
last 100 years an almost doubling of the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.490 
last 100 years an almost doubling of the
intake<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.760> animal<00:03:00.030> products<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.230> course

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
intake of animal products and of course

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.720 
intake of animal products and of course
animal<00:03:01.829> products<00:03:02.190> are<00:03:02.250> largely

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
animal products are largely

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.940 
animal products are largely
the<00:03:03.420> source<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:04.049> cholesterol<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.620> only

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
the source of cholesterol the only

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.160 
the source of cholesterol the only
source<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.280> cholesterol<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.170> furthermore

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
source of cholesterol and furthermore

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.140 
source of cholesterol and furthermore
most<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.280> animal<00:03:08.519> products<00:03:08.790> are<00:03:08.910> fairly

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
most of the animal products are fairly

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.809 
most of the animal products are fairly
high<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:09.720> fat<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:11.190> when<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.430> look<00:03:11.549> at<00:03:11.579> a

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
high in fat so when you look at a

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.890 
high in fat so when you look at a
sausage<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.989> may<00:03:13.140> have<00:03:13.260> 80%<00:03:13.910> of<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.329> calories

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
sausage you may have 80% of the calories

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.410 
sausage you may have 80% of the calories
in<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.170> sausage<00:03:16.500> coming<00:03:17.069> from<00:03:17.340> fat<00:03:17.670> learn<00:03:18.329> in

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
in that sausage coming from fat learn in

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.559 
in that sausage coming from fat learn in
your<00:03:18.480> best<00:03:18.660> interest<00:03:19.109> fat<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:21.690> wear<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:23.569> you

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
your best interest fat you wear it you

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.140 
your best interest fat you wear it you
carry<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.170> when<00:03:26.069> you<00:03:26.160> look<00:03:26.280> at<00:03:26.430> salon<00:03:26.790> steak

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
carry it when you look at salon steak

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.539 
carry it when you look at salon steak
next<00:03:27.540> time<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:28.319> think<00:03:28.530> about<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:28.980> it's<00:03:29.400> not

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
next time just think about it it's not

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.550 
next time just think about it it's not
so<00:03:29.880> much<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.209> protein<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.139> have<00:03:31.290> been

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
so much the protein that you have been

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.530 
so much the protein that you have been
brainwashed<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.400> think<00:03:32.430> about<00:03:32.850> when<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.510> look

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
brainwashed to think about when you look

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.520 
brainwashed to think about when you look
think<00:03:33.930> about<00:03:34.170> this

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
think about this

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.129 
think about this
sirloin<00:03:34.950> steak<00:03:35.340> you're<00:03:35.850> looking<00:03:36.120> at<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.269> 75

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
sirloin steak you're looking at a 75

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:42.109 
sirloin steak you're looking at a 75
percent<00:03:37.430> fat<00:03:38.430> glob<00:03:39.420> right<00:03:39.840> there
