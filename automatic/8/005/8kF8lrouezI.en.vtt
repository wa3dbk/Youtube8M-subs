00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.939
 I would have all this is Nicolas Sarkozy 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.660
 and today we will present level 6 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.160
 Legend 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.710
 if like but kindly invited to turn 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.680
 an episode and the streams came to the setting one 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.350
 drank coffee and told me why you 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.129
 introduce to mention the hot well 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.340
 nice 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.339
 so here I say yes but which one and from 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.559
 coup I chose the v6 legends 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.110
 with pokemon like what makes them 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.329
 pokemon and augured at meetings when 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.820
 what I was doing a little bit of china 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.239
 and suddenly play pokemon is removed 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.379
 will stay I wanted very high 6 2 the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.460
 favorite young people and then that's what he 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.149
 is able to do 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.979
 let's go we'll put the match 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:13.740
 sicot then he sends a little splash 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.950
 he gets thunder almost ko but this 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.420
 which is extraordinary is that they 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.899
 have some pv to place the pieces 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.330
 rock 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.670
 and frankly it's really a 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.250
 incredible prowess and there they send 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.590
 creignou it's my favorite starter of the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.410
 and cij and it will place at night repair 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.550
 picchu dont put ko here it's a 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.340
 once again his payments 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.610
 it's really good on the part of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.039
 true gently the idea ko but note 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.560
 that there is still a layer of pieces 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.739
 rock and toxic pikes layers 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.840
 I usually place toxic peaks 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:54.420
 when I play hard on what I have 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.170
 had time to remake six times pokemon 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.970
 pokemon x 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.130
 and there he sends his chagny terminus 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.489
 necessarily and who will resist a pv 1% 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.959
 same and who will do what to jean and that 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.190
 will not be enough to put mac bones 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.540
 os x does not matter it does not matter the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.940
 everything he's going to do he's going to send our 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:22.319
 decisions to spend at SUMCO but karcher 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.620
 it's not going to be safe but with the 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.069
 peyrie juice that's okay going to smoke 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.170
 where the situation is calm but the 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.980
 weigh and suddenly we will take the opportunity to 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.810
 place a little to slam what that which 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.780
 it's still important to displaced 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.630
 boost the tech worst risks 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.470
 if the start taking and there it pays 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.430
 takes a risk 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.569
 are you cutting rigaud and chaos to coggia do not 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.790
 not enough to put them too do not 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.010
 Would it not serious it does not matter to you 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.000
 the situation in hand I was president 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.450
 of the republic and suddenly we are going 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.650
 to calm down 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.590
 ice bim 80% if it's not bad and the drac 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.350
 to the meteors and hurts me a lot we are 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:13.549
 well, I have more than govou 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:13.549
 govou whose english name and mode keep 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.380
 to withdraw 42% and so the opposite is going 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.470
 return it to his skin that fly 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.530
 casto can you here it is said and he 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.329
 will send late salted and at that moment 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.109
 if I had a word to say it's really 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.450
 unbelievable 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.590
 it's not okay with me too if 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.489
 you agree with me 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.100
 at this stage of the match recover 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.370
 the entirety almost his life on a 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.049
 berit us 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.480
 it's amazing and one is there with 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.370
 the little crazy water we will put ko the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.920
 late room while we were three 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.940
 against one we will finally arrive a 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:58.379
 duel because chip that at the end and there is 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.879
 really a fratricidal choice to make 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.569
 since these are two high choke who 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.480
 clash 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.489
 but do not panic if what finally 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.650
 who will win that critical 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.780
 it's really the magic of fighting 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.849
 pokemon finally lic cuckolds trick 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.609
 feel the blows of fate that make 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:20.350
 switch the scale on one side or 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:25.270
 the other and with with yes I say well 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.850
 with toxic peaks placed by pomegranate 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.630
 previously in the match we're going 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.960
 to win the victory and even if the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.539
 one-eyed even though it burns me and is in 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.729
 self it's really a shame should not 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.160
 not burn me we agree, but 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.479
 but it's destiny 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.460
 we will agree on it 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:51.010
 finally global will put ko carapuce 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.050
 and girl to prevail and did not 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.460
 do you really have a crazy match 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:00.150
 I pushed that chi when I saw the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.700
 match and jg easily wanted to comment 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.150

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.360
 from sycamore he will see me in the video 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.420

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.300
 blue it's always fun at the club 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.800
 of the ump but also to share the 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.690

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.670
 comment 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.480
