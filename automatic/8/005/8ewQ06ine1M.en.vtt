below knit one knit one below knit one
below<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.030> start<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
below and you can start to see the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.890 
below and you can start to see the
pattern<00:01:38.210> showing<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.329> where<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.810> an

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
pattern showing up where you see an

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.499 
pattern showing up where you see an
alternate<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:41.189> burgundy<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.270> gray

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
alternate the burgundy and the gray

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.990 
alternate the burgundy and the gray
stitches<00:01:42.930> are<00:01:43.079> kind<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.350> alternating<00:01:44.000> because

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
stitches are kind of alternating because

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.660 
stitches are kind of alternating because
you<00:01:45.540> know<00:01:45.659> at<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> back<00:01:46.259> you've<00:01:47.189> essentially

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
you know at the back you've essentially

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.200 
you know at the back you've essentially
um<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.220> when<00:01:50.670> you're<00:01:50.790> knitting<00:01:50.939> one

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
um you know when you're knitting one

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
um you know when you're knitting one
below<00:01:51.479> you're<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:52.049> slipping<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.799> stitch<00:01:53.040> but

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
below you're not slipping a stitch but

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.030 
below you're not slipping a stitch but
you've<00:01:53.399> dropped<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:55.439> other<00:01:55.560> stitch<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.009> well

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
you've dropped the other stitch as well

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.780 
you've dropped the other stitch as well
so<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.360> nice<00:01:57.719> technique<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.790> creating

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
so this is a nice technique for creating

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.149 
so this is a nice technique for creating
like<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> really<00:02:00.479> loose<00:02:00.689> fabric<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.500> vertical

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
like a really loose fabric and vertical

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.430 
like a really loose fabric and vertical
stripes
