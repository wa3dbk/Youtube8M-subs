00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the manual says 11 watts carrier on high

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.290 
the manual says 11 watts carrier on high
and<00:00:30.990> 1<00:00:31.230> watt<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.679> low<00:00:31.920> there's<00:00:32.910> only<00:00:33.030> one

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and 1 watt on low there's only one

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
and 1 watt on low there's only one
adjustment<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.050> carrier<00:00:34.440> inside<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> radio

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
adjustment for carrier inside the radio

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.150 
adjustment for carrier inside the radio
and<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.570> make<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.780> 11<00:00:37.260> watts<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.770> low<00:00:37.950> power

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and if we make it 11 watts the low power

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.310 
and if we make it 11 watts the low power
doesn't<00:00:38.610> go<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.420> goes<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.780> three

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
doesn't go to one it goes to like three

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500 
doesn't go to one it goes to like three
and<00:00:41.160> that's<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.460> low<00:00:41.700> enough<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> lot

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and that's not low enough for what a lot

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
and that's not low enough for what a lot
of<00:00:42.540> people<00:00:42.690> want<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> drive<00:00:43.320> things<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
of people want to drive things with and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.150 
of people want to drive things with and
stuff<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.850> order<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.570> keep<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.930> down<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> one

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
stuff so in order to keep it down to one

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.190 
stuff so in order to keep it down to one
I've<00:00:47.730> brought<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> high<00:00:48.300> power<00:00:48.600> carrier<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I've brought the high power carrier to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.220 
I've brought the high power carrier to
eight<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.710> think<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:50.309> fine<00:00:50.520> buddy<00:00:51.230> about

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
eight I think that's fine buddy about

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.369 
eight I think that's fine buddy about
eight<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.680> half<00:00:52.710> there<00:00:53.870> all<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:54.989> all<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
eight and a half there all right all the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.400 
eight and a half there all right all the
way<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.899> could<00:00:58.109> bring<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> power

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
way up and then I could bring the power

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.500 
way up and then I could bring the power
down

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.950 

-<00:01:02.079> one<00:01:02.260> one

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
- one one

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.300 
- one one
okay<00:01:04.910> peak<00:01:05.910> pal<00:01:06.830> let's<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:07.980> ahead<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.220> show

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
okay peak pal let's go ahead and show

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.410 
okay peak pal let's go ahead and show
you<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.490> peak<00:01:08.610> power<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.120> all<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> way

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you the peak power with it all the way

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.760 
you the peak power with it all the way
down<00:01:09.950> 50<00:01:10.950> watt<00:01:11.130> scale<00:01:11.870> we<00:01:12.870> use<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.530> middle

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
down 50 watt scale we use in the middle

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:24.100 
down 50 watt scale we use in the middle
there<00:01:13.950> 10<00:01:14.760> 20<00:01:15.300> and<00:01:15.450> 30

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.910 

so<00:01:25.040> about<00:01:25.220> 12<00:01:25.580> watts<00:01:26.410> turn<00:01:27.410> out<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.650> be<00:01:29.920> about

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
so about 12 watts turn out to be about

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.290 
so about 12 watts turn out to be about
12<00:01:31.250> watts<00:01:31.460> all<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.700> way<00:01:31.760> down<00:01:31.910> let<00:01:32.000> me<00:01:32.090> put<00:01:32.210> the

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
12 watts all the way down let me put the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.260 
12 watts all the way down let me put the
power<00:01:32.480> back<00:01:32.540> all<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:32.990> way<00:01:33.080> up<00:01:34.120> again<00:01:35.120> we're

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
power back all the way up again we're

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.480 
power back all the way up again we're
looking<00:01:35.300> at<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.660> middle<00:01:35.930> scale<00:01:36.170> 20<00:01:36.710> 30<00:01:36.950> 40<00:01:37.340> 50

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
looking at the middle scale 20 30 40 50

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.080 
looking at the middle scale 20 30 40 50
Oh<00:01:39.730> Jake<00:01:40.730> Jake<00:01:40.970> Jake<00:01:41.290> audio<00:01:42.790> things<00:01:43.790> that<00:01:43.970> oh

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
Oh Jake Jake Jake audio things that oh

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.610 
Oh Jake Jake Jake audio things that oh
there<00:01:44.330> was<00:01:45.370> put<00:01:46.370> in<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.640> hundred<00:01:46.940> watts<00:01:47.180> lug<00:01:47.620> it

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
there was put in a hundred watts lug it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.290 
there was put in a hundred watts lug it
just<00:01:48.830> barely<00:01:49.040> gets<00:01:49.340> over<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.670> 50<00:01:50.000> it's<00:01:50.150> like

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
just barely gets over the 50 it's like

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.469 
just barely gets over the 50 it's like
not<00:01:50.480> worth<00:01:50.690> switching<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.440> slugs<00:01:51.770> more<00:01:55.479> now

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
not worth switching the slugs more now

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:04.300 
not worth switching the slugs more now
we're<00:01:56.720> reading<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.470> bottom

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310
