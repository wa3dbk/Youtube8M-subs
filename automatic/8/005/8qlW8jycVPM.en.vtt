00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.180
 the tour auto optic 2000 begins its 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.840
 third step from 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.030
 Clermont-Ferrand 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.410
 a very dense day is coming 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.140
 new for car drivers 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.970
 historic 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.800
 on the menu of the day a special to rio but 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.630
 this mountain in the cantal then hull to 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.430
 estaing in the aveyron and finally a 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.660
 race on the albi circuit before that 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.920
 the caravan settles its quarters 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.920
 in the city step of toulouse 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.190
 the crews receive their restraint 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.750
 just before the special stage the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.100
 co-drivers have short moments to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.230
 familiarize with their roadmap 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 which accurately signals all 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.950
 step difficulties their role is 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.080
 primordial in these fast specials 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.080
 often winding and mountainous 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.130
 it's going so fast that you really have to 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.050
 go to the basics and I even note them 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.750
 directions cissed left right to be 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.500
 sure not to make a mistake and 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.020
 I'm really announcing all the curves 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.510
 well to the advanced visual piloting except 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.580
 to be announced with the distance that 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.720
 separates difficult things only 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.430
 things a bit complicated from 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.960
 turns that are really well prepared we 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.440
 gives the direction and the trend of 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.780
 turn 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.970
 hey he says to me 100 m 50 m now 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.020
 so I always know where I am when 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.740
 she says nothing that means I'm doing 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.740
 that at sight and I think 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.780
 special after special chemistry grown up 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.040
 between drivers and co-drivers and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.040
 adrenaline is waiting for you 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.630
 every day the terrain changes and the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.340
 competitors play musical chairs 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.909
 at the top of the ranking in the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.909
 different categories 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.729
 after three days of racing the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.240
 rankings actually starts to get 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.890
 specify 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.030
 the auto tour often reserves 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.030
 just surprises 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.370
 among vehicles built between 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.620
 1972 and 80.2 christophe van ryn on 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.970
 forge and didier circus / auto maso se 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.970
 compete for first place overall 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.410
 today's circuit I think it 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.690
 will have the advantage that it is a circuit 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.340
 very fast he has more power and 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.000
 on the other hand the circuit of tomorrow for 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.380
 arnaud that we should before so 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.380
 will have to see it will be tight until the end 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.470
 the race continues to albi circuit one 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.090
 historic circuit that reopens 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.230
 and reconnects with its roots in 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.230
 welcoming the auto tour again 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.700

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.890
