00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello , belyaev evgeny, we continue with you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.350
 our mobile repair course 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.690
 and now I will talk about the problem which 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.080
 often found on flooded cellular 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.900
 phones are when due to corrosion 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.980
 at the microcircuit raise legs like this 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.430
 should look right and workers 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.260
 contacts 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.570
 This is how contacts look like 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.980
 battered by water now forty times 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.510
 I will show the approximation better 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.210
 see will give the right contact which 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.309
 principle not working but this thing is possible 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 fix as there are stumps on the most 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.989
 motherboard and contact is on 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.350
 the chip itself 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.829
 first thing we need to clean from 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.140
 soot from corrosion from the old behind 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.750
 rusting metal for this we 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.780
 use ordinary flux do not use 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.390
 active fat soldering because he 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 too strong can he finish ours 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.439
 all the good beginnings caused fluxes 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.770
 Soldering iron worked on the contact to 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.720
 all the new dirt is gone from him 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:17.009
 further ordinary alcohol on a cotton swab 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:23.240
 we put it and we clear all soot all 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:26.970
 we help the dirt with a needle 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 We do clean very carefully with 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.630
 motherboard contact is protected and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.439
 given and also we clean the contact on the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.110
 microchip 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.960
 Now you can see clearly that there are two 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.130
 contact on the chip and on the mother 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.310
 the board basically only remains 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.630
 Solder this thing is nothing complicated here 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.049
 no only 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.200
 neatness and thin soldering iron 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.880
 must be very thin like a needle this 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.469
 here the scale seems like a soldering 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.469
 great actually a soldering iron very 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.939
 very very thin soldering iron should 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.060
 be so thin so he 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.730
 at the same time could touch and contact 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.270
 microchip and contact on the mother 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.470
 board 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.920
 that's actually 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.660
 that's the whole subtlety here 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.740
 By and large, more to me here 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.290
 there is nothing to tell to watch the video 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.360
 subscribe to the channel look for 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.300
 updates every thursday new video 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:40.080
 cell phone repair 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:43.110
 Well, you see, yes, that I am here 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.300
 several times I apply the flux sealed by 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.030
 several times because the work is so 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.030
 sometimes it takes up to 20 minutes for one 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.340
 contact disappear that everything is neat 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.890
 well gone and sometimes fast 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.690
 it turns out sometimes hard here 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.350
 long enough I sat picking with 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.300
 these contacts but now everything is there 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.190
 was slain 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.990
 clean up this matter from flux 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.020
 protect after all flux and here such 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.910
 will be the end result and see on the left 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.090
 contact well zaboalsya and right 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.810
 fully contact working thanks for 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.890
 Attention 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.890
 good not to you
