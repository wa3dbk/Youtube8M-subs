00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.150
 How to wear a whole set of four-piece hair pieces 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.250
 First, letâ€™s start with the first film from the back. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.150
 So we picked up a block in the back 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:38.200
 Probably about 3 to 4 cm from the hairline is a line like this 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.050
 We picked up the first piece of hair that is three buckles. 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.250
 First open all the buttons 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.150
 Snap in the middle of the button 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:56.050
 The way to buckle is a small circle around the size of the coin. 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.100
 Extend to both sides 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.050
 Soon the first film is complete. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.250
 Next, the second piece of hairline is tilted. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.200
 Line method like this 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.050
 Such a line and wearing method 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.050
 Can make your own real hair and worn hair pieces without faults 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.150
 The length will not form a significant drop 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.000
 The other side is the same way 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.100
 Next, the hair piece I took was four buckles. 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.200
 First we start from the right and start with the first button on the right. 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.250
 The starting position starts at about 1~2 cm from the hairline. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Buckled from the front to the back like this 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.050
 The third piece is also fixed from the first position on the left side of the other side. 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.000
 The last button will be crossed over the second piece. 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.200
 Put the hair above and comb it with your hand 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.150
 At the same time, do the split line at this position. The split line here is a little elliptical. 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.000
 Fix the hair first 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.100
 The last piece of hair is a five-button 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.250
 The method of buckle is to buckle from the middle 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.050
 The way of buckle is the same as the first button around a coin size 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.100
 Wrap around a small circle and extend to both sides 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.150
 Because of this way, she will feel more secure 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.250
 Finally put the top down 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 This is a very simple set of four-piece hair pieces is completed.
