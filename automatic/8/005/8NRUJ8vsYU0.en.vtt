00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 I got my hands on quite 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.670
 common but no less 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.940
 interesting portable field telephone 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.700
 devices a-57 abbreviation you and this 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.210
 understandable phone 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.890
 A-57 is the year it began production 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.560
 1957 by virtue of its simplicity and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.090
 unpretentiousness and reliability of this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.609
 telephone set was used 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.170
 military of different states though why 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.689
 He has still been used. 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.560
 used but it was used 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.030
 also in civilian needs such as 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.370
 oil and gas and geological 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.920
 works let's take a look at the phone 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.440
 closer here and so it looks at the handset 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.750
 it has a button when clicked 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.340
 turn on the microphone by the way here 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.250
 used by electromagnetic 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.590
 differential microphone you rmsh 1a 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.230
 case of failure or other 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.180
 reasons, the tube is easy to replace because 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.809
 what is used here is 5 pin 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 connector 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.770
 which is quite easily retrieved and 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.660
 set but to try this 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.180
 the phone in fact I need two such 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 I have them for luck 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.750
 combining these phones to me 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.869
 you need a cable and a battery 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.640
 crown for voice transmission well 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.100
 that let's give phones 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.100
 working position open the case and 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.610
 remove logging so they do not bother me 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.590
 and connect the connecting wires to 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.520
 real conditions almost all 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.799
 and happening 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.990
 by the way to translate the machine 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.560
 very little is required in the working position 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.630
 of time 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.119
 that in real combat conditions can 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 save lives well and while i connect 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.659
 cable and I would like to point out that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.820
 maximum communication range in 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.810
 depending on the type of cable used 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.850
 ranges from 35 to 170 kilometers while 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.310
 using the amplifier range can 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.619
 increase significantly and by the way weight 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.960
 complete set of this phone including 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.330
 native battery 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.530
 Get no more than three kilograms now 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.530
 we put the cable in place 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:14.300
 close the cases and put the phone on 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.870
 switch case top button we 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.459
 get two business phone call 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.190
 subscriber is carried out using 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.410
 rotation of the inductor knob which is essentially 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.780
 is a ringing current generator and 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.950
 by the way quite often used not by 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.269
 purpose of rotation of the handle at 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.470
 the called party is ringing a 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.480
 now you can see clearly 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.580
 ac voltage generated 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.590
 inductor by the way as much as possible to us 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.110
 managed to achieve 173 volts then you 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.290
 hear my voice from the other side so 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.320
 how did I turn on the recorder one two three 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.320
 four five times two three 4 5 as heard 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.730
 if you want to see photos t57 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.769
 and also download detailed instructions in 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.810
 which by the way is the scheme of the device 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.000
 come on my forum smokes point ru 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.030
 the link will be in the description 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.160
 All by the way if you are interested in a video about 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.470
 like it military equipment 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.930
 I recommend to watch my other video about 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.090
 laptop baguette and by the way on the internet I 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.780
 nowhere found another video about it 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.820
 a laptop 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.950
 so it can be said that it is their illusion 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.989
 and also in that video I briefly told 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.420
 about the mobile system of the armed forces 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.120
 which is used in this laptop well 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.440
 Well, thank you for watching all of you 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.440
 bye and good luck
