red dot you're going to cut your going
to<00:01:17.580> cut<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> wire<00:01:19.040> right<00:01:20.040> there<00:01:21.590> if<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.770> have

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
to cut the wire right there if you have

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.660 
to cut the wire right there if you have
a<00:01:22.890> blue<00:01:23.159> dot<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.640> cut<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.060> wire<00:01:25.610> okay<00:01:26.610> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
a blue dot you cut this wire okay so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.390 
a blue dot you cut this wire okay so
we're<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> cut<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.600> wire<00:01:28.310> once<00:01:29.310> you

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
we're going to cut that wire once you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.859 
we're going to cut that wire once you
cut<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.700> wire<00:01:29.939> off<00:01:32.030> get<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> sharpie<00:01:33.659> out

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
cut that wire off get the sharpie out

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.450 
cut that wire off get the sharpie out
the<00:01:34.140> wire<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.590> cut<00:01:34.860> off<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:37.400> yeah<00:01:38.400> you

the wire that you cut off and yeah you
sharpie<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.990> wire<00:01:40.229> thing<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
sharpie the the wire thing that the

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.520 
sharpie the the wire thing that the
thing<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.600> wire<00:01:42.750> was<00:01:42.960> attached<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.409> you

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
thing that the wire was attached to you

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.520 
thing that the wire was attached to you
sharpie<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.570> cause<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> electrical

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
sharpie that cause for the electrical

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.899 
sharpie that cause for the electrical
cords<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.479> mathematical<00:01:48.479> five<00:01:48.990> ca-7<00:01:49.920> when<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
cords of mathematical five ca-7 when you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.850 
cords of mathematical five ca-7 when you
put<00:01:51.240> sharpie<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.170> helps<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
put sharpie on it it helps with the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.319 
put sharpie on it it helps with the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
electrical singable minglee sim user in

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.480 
electrical singable minglee sim user in
your<00:01:57.360> channel<00:01:57.719> time<00:01:58.110> down<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.500> then<00:02:01.490> you're

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
your channel time down and then you're

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.060 
your channel time down and then you're
done<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> sharpie<00:02:03.299> oh<00:02:03.680> yeah<00:02:04.680> about<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
done with the sharpie oh yeah about the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.530 
done with the sharpie oh yeah about the
tape<00:02:06.680> you're<00:02:07.680> gonna<00:02:07.860> tape

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.150 

you're<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.750> take<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:15.000> Sharpie<00:02:15.480> thing

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
you're going to take the Sharpie thing

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.589 
you're going to take the Sharpie thing
right<00:02:17.160> there<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.840> cast<00:02:22.080> hold<00:02:22.680> on

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
right there and then the cast hold on

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.229 
right there and then the cast hold on
you're<00:02:24.599> going<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.170> attach<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.209> then

attach that touch it all right after you
touch<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:43.160> you're<00:02:44.160> going<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.340> put<00:02:44.579> this<00:02:44.970> back

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
touch it you're going to put this back

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.220 
touch it you're going to put this back
on<00:02:45.569> after<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.620> attach<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.099> put<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.430> back<00:02:47.700> on

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
on after you attach it put this back on

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:56.300 
on after you attach it put this back on
just<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:53.690> all<00:02:54.690> right<00:02:55.190> once<00:02:56.190> you

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
just like this as so all right once you

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.930 
just like this as so all right once you
do<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:56.760> you've<00:02:57.420> completed<00:02:57.870> all<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.440> steps

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
do this you've completed all the steps

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:07.460 
do this you've completed all the steps
once<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.060> plug<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.390> into<00:03:00.540> your<00:03:00.690> thing<00:03:06.470> it

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
once you plug it into your thing it

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:15.379 
once you plug it into your thing it
should<00:03:07.829> start<00:03:08.099> working<00:03:14.000> all<00:03:15.000> right

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
should start working all right
