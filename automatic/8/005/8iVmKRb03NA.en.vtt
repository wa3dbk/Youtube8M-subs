the only real problems I have are

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.569 
the only real problems I have are
towards<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.259> end<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> film<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
towards the end of the film or at the

end there was one death that was
questionable<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.540> my<00:01:51.659> opinion<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.350> because

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
questionable in my opinion just because

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.510 
questionable in my opinion just because
it<00:01:54.229> doesn't<00:01:55.229> seem<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> could<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.310> been

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it doesn't seem like it could have been

it doesn't seem like it could have been
done<00:01:56.759> naturally<00:01:57.320> but<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.439> doesn't<00:01:58.680> seem<00:01:58.799> like

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
done naturally but it doesn't seem like
