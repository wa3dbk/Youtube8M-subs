00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.920
 hello how about dx md friends the day 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.590
 today we are going to do a tutorial something 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.150
 curious but quite interesting what 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.919
 let's do is connect the latter 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.070
 out of the wii console we control 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.419
 sorry to our samsung galaxy s2 and what 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.360
 good can be used in any 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.559
 phone that has android and that 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.730
 obviously good meet the 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:32.349
 specifications that are necessary 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.520
 we are going to need our windows 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.950
 obviously and the applications of 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.630
 Weymouth controller and the application of 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.220
 droid snes that you can find in the 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.280
 android market for free 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.900
 and already what I think we're going to do is 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.810
 learn our bluetooth in our 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.900
 device and we're going to put it 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.290
 available for the view to be visible more 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.000
 all right 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.740
 once done this we will access 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.810
 quickly to the guild application 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.130
 control and we're going to press on the 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:08.310
 option that says in it and connect and to 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.830
 same time we have to press the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.290
 zinc button that comes the back 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.840
 no xxi takes off the weymouth cap what 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.420
 we press and let go so that the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.290
 phone recognize it in this way a 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.160
 Once this is done let's see what it says down 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.020
 and we see that the control is illuminated in the 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.820
 player one blue color landmark that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.270
 we have here was if we press on 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.800
 the option select we controller my 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.630
 select the option win controller m 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.880
 once this is done we can leave 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.040
 the application and we're going quickly to 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.940
 the droid snes application that good 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.940
 I was trying 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.409
 but we will not leave quickly 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.380
 we go to where it says half 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.090
 and here we are and we're going to go to the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.060
 settings option that is the option 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.420
 number 3 and we're going to go to the option 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.090
 which says input in this option 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.330

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.209

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.790
 wi controller and emme and on this screen 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.700
 what we are going to do is configure the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.099
 windows controls so they can 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.069
 be used to mention that for 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.819
 get to use this application is 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.379
 necessary to have an emulator that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.900
 an application that allows the 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.790
 control configuration let's start 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.340
 to configure for the control see 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.740
 we select 2 we are going to go to the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:46.120
 option of x we â€‹â€‹press to 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.490
 and we press see what is the control 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.360
 back now we 're going to go where 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:59.150
 it says down good if we select up 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:02.670
 down and we select below from left 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.090
 right right 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.050
 the controls of start axial control of 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.110
 more and the select control that is the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.700
 control less once done this but 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.190
 we have two main buttons 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.959
 configured we are going to load a room that 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.660
 I had previously passed on to me 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.030
 phone that you give by mario world the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.310
 we have here is by mario world the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:32.010
 we open and we are going to put the phone here 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:35.640
 so they can see how it works 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.069
 this is going to open it 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.580
 and we can move the camera a little bit 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.620
 to make it look better there is 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.050
 let's select it let's see how 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.190
 we move is working 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.190
 the controls correctly 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:57.230
 and there it is 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.630
 comfortable to see that once this is done 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.480
 is what we are going to do 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.470
 we will play a little for 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.240
 see how it works 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.860
 there it jumps correctly 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.710
 the truth is that the gameplay is 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.740
 quite pretty good and it's much better 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.470
 to be playing with the controls 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.420
 touch that come there on the screen because 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.180
 good the use of fingers because it takes away 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.360
 a lot of visibility and sometimes it 's 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.190
 tired and annoying not but we can see 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.410
 that with windows control so 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.410
 easy we can play 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.060
 be light this game super mario world and 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.000
 without any problem we can do it 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.650
