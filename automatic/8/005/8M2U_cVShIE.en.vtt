00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
pull them off the edge it's actually not

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.630 
pull them off the edge it's actually not
that<00:01:14.780> hard<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.259> get<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.829> can<00:01:15.979> actually<00:01:16.310> start

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
that hard to get you can actually start

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.149 
that hard to get you can actually start
getting<00:01:16.909> some<00:01:17.630> kills<00:01:17.900> right<00:01:18.260> in<00:01:18.500> that<00:01:18.770> area

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
getting some kills right in that area

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.410 
getting some kills right in that area
where<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.430> get<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.700> rope<00:01:19.880> arrow<00:01:20.120> for<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
where you get the rope arrow for the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.120 
where you get the rope arrow for the
first<00:01:20.630> time<00:01:20.900> but<00:01:21.500> one<00:01:21.680> thing<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:22.010> I'm

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
first time but one thing that I'm

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.410 
first time but one thing that I'm
finding<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:22.700> if<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.000> can<00:01:23.150> get<00:01:23.270> the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
finding is that if you can get the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.030 
finding is that if you can get the
shantytown<00:01:24.080> which<00:01:24.290> is<00:01:24.440> later<00:01:24.620> on<00:01:24.830> in<00:01:24.950> the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
shantytown which is later on in the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.760 
shantytown which is later on in the
campaign<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.150> is<00:01:26.360> right<00:01:26.540> after<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:27.020> get<00:01:27.620> the

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
campaign this is right after you get the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.920 
campaign this is right after you get the
medical<00:01:28.130> supplies<00:01:28.460> from<00:01:28.760> the<00:01:28.880> chopper<00:01:29.360> you

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
medical supplies from the chopper you

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.960 
medical supplies from the chopper you
come<00:01:30.200> through<00:01:30.500> it's<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:31.040> second<00:01:31.610> part<00:01:31.640> of

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
come through it's the second part of

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.880 
come through it's the second part of
shantytown<00:01:32.659> so<00:01:33.020> there's<00:01:33.200> actually<00:01:33.530> like<00:01:33.680> two

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
shantytown so there's actually like two

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.800 
shantytown so there's actually like two
parts<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.340> shantytown<00:01:34.880> if<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:35.479> can<00:01:35.600> get<00:01:35.690> to

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
parts to shantytown if you can get to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.320 
parts to shantytown if you can get to
the<00:01:35.900> second<00:01:36.320> part<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.620> shantytown<00:01:37.220> then<00:01:37.580> you

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
the second part of shantytown then you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.550 
the second part of shantytown then you
can<00:01:38.450> there's<00:01:38.630> actually<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.020> spot<00:01:39.320> where
