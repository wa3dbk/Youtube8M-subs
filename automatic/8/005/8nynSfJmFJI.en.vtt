00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
think yeah it's a bit of both

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.810 
think yeah it's a bit of both
I've<00:00:34.710> seen<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.250> pitch<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.550> I've<00:00:35.640> seen

it<00:00:35.910> off<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> pitch<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.540> yeah<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:37.050> it's

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
it off the pitch so yeah I think it's

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.709 
it off the pitch so yeah I think it's
it's<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.800> bit<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.040> both<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.550> yeah<00:00:39.510> I've<00:00:39.660> been

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719

imagine that's what you wanted do the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.530 
imagine that's what you wanted do the
the<00:01:46.680> players<00:01:47.310> believe<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.450> be

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the players believe now that that can be

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
the players believe now that that can be
achieved<00:01:48.829> yeah<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.890> think<00:01:50.130> we're<00:01:50.369> always<00:01:50.460> done

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
achieved yeah I think we're always done

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.429 
achieved yeah I think we're always done
of<00:01:51.119> course<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.630> lose<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.110> look<00:01:52.259> different

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
of course if you lose you look different

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.990 
of course if you lose you look different
but<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.920> win<00:01:53.100> again<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.670> close<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
but if you win again it's so close to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.719 
but if you win again it's so close to
your<00:01:54.350> yeah<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.619> everything<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.520> still

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
your yeah that everything can can still

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.639 
your yeah that everything can can still
happen<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.600> everybody<00:01:58.170> still<00:01:58.380> has<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
happen I think everybody still has to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.859

focus<00:01:58.860> its<00:01:59.399> aggressive<00:01:59.640> Kemsley<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.600> that's

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
focus its aggressive Kemsley and that's

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.359 
focus its aggressive Kemsley and that's
