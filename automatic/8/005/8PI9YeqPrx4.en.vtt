00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
plants in the cold frame they don't need

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.749 
plants in the cold frame they don't need
as<00:01:49.110> much<00:01:49.290> water<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:50.430> gonna<00:01:50.490> grow

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
as much water you're gonna grow

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.050 
as much water you're gonna grow
extremely<00:01:51.210> slowly<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.579> happen<00:01:53.729> is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
extremely slowly and what will happen is

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.880

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
as the light gets stronger they'll start

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.590 
as the light gets stronger they'll start
growing<00:01:58.290> again<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.189> start<00:01:59.399> enjoying
