00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.180

 Today I'll show you how 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:25.380
 use and even if you have 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.230
 months of ring fingers lot known 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.330
 gold name of empower is me and the others 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.690
 at risk this white mote in your 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.570
 request because this enamel is from the collection 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.879
 year by uncles that changes color in the sun 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.960
 This is the day and night until white in the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:48.440
 shadow and on the sof case you go too 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:54.469
 need brush palette from behind long 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.079
 jewelry for June is the top first coat 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.750
 drawing the stripes on the streets is using 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.750
 a back brush away that way 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:12.480
 I think it gives 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.450
 you can water the brush directly on the 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.170
 enamel glass is very easy to 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.170
 apply and so on 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.970
 This one 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.830
 Sam and I went there to repeat the process 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.830
 other cat lines 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.630
 now this 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.630
 the jeans the success 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.799
 I thought my knee 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.439
 now let's apply the jewelry 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.799
 to stay tightly clawed the ideal is 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.829
 adapt the first as I did with this 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:12.649
 she came to hold on like this here you 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.649
 You need to leave the tub as you said it. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.630
 the iberia 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.210
 and if you apply it to the nail the way you 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.290
 she comes but pontificated raised and 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.290
 will end up loosing 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.030
 looks like it fits nicely into the nail with 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.030
 this curvature 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.650
 to make the adjustment is easy but it is already 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.700
 but metal is very thin and handle gem 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.530
 carefully 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.680
 I'm going to make small donuts with the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.680
 nails 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.940
 the test to see if it's getting good 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.939
 be sure to do it when it's just 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.709
 from where they are dry 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.939
 you can leave one prepared with 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.489
 advance 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:30.040
 the adaptation will be good when you do not 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:34.819
 no more dots raised later 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.599
 apply a bit of continuous top and 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.439
 caution 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.439
 I applied game 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.790
 press with the help of a toothpick to 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.790
 that is good to be of the union 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.989
 I think I lose 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.599
 repeat the process on the other line 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.400
 and it 's mine 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:18.790
 then apply a layer of topics 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:23.139
 one more of a limpadinha in the corners 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.139
 so I had sunshine 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.689
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.280
