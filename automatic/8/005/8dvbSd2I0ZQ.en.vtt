00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:11.759
 there a ray there guys think sampa 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.070
 You guys but the day was commented and the video 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.630
 of today is again about copper goals 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.640
 one more time to talk about the 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.830
 multiplayer of the game and I have to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.960
 show you here today are the maps 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.910
 of the game is undoubtedly none of the parties 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.189
 most important of the multiplayer mode to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.289
 I think the maps of the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.539
 multiplayer code defines a lot of 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.790
 with that code and if not like it 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.920
 It's going to be for me, but how fast or not. 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.239
 I'm going to get sick of that code 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.219
 I think it greatly influences 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.320
 the map is the best it has been 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.390
 The harder maps are for you. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.960
 feeling sick about playing these things 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.460
 all 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.640
 anyway it's always good to have good ones 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 maps maps with the right mep design right and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.010
 Anyway, we have until now 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.370
 confirmed by the infinity ward 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.890
 only six maps right this already counting 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.320
 with a gossip it's good to see it okay 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.270
 So we already have nine more maps to 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.619
 to know why he faced 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.290
 confirmed to us that the game will 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.689
 bring 14 maps but football of year 15 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.369
 right then he missed moving maps even though 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.110
 have not been officially confirmed by the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.939
 Inffinito hours however already have several 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.500
 trailers revealed the game both crisis 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.750
 multiplayer mode with all modes 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.790
 frames the things all right and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.680
 stars appear several map scenes 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.240
 dipp that seem to be quite different 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.820
 of the maps that we already know 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.280
 based on that blog and intel made a 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.560
 quite a nice point is joining the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.060
 image of those maps that do not look like 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.549
 with which we already know 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.229
 're putting it there possible names for 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.090
 these maps according to the images that 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.070
 we have and put together similar images 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.630
 to judge is that the images are from 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.490
 even pink you will understand I'm going 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.630
 show you could only have a notion 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.180
 more or less than we can 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.899
 wait for the local maps nine 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.490
 goals 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.619
 ok on the map that we already know 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.479
 are they the tall white that the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.130
 forest full of snow takes 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.560
 quite open well different from the standard 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.509
 of claudio the other ok tank is the one that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.030
 there is that gas station that 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.340
 falls in the middle of the match is a part 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.810
 interactive map has an upgrade zone 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.369
 which promises to be one of the best maps of 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.840
 game was a fairly shown map 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.120
 especially when they revealed 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.800
 local multiplayer of taste have a downfall 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.470
 that was where he used 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.560
 to reveal is that portal mode 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.690
 right there in eurogamer has a python 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.890
 kingdom that was one of the last was the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.180
 last indeed be confirmed 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.100
 officially by infinity ward yet 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.870
 do not have and play on this map but already have 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.220
 official images in a certain way that 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.410
 passing the castle has a part 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.120
 quite open also ok 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.340
 the map was focus says we also 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.680
 does not have images in games only has only 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.300
 one're developing training and 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.010
 from here comes the images that 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.230
 may be the other possible ones 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.760
 maps of the beagle channel just remembering 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.830
 that some of the images will show that 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.630
 can also be part of maps that have already 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.190
 were confirmed only when seen from another 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.690
 that everything I'm going to spend here is 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.610
 assumption 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.740
 the first map it would be this 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.560
 map where the blog is calling series 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.360
 life is just to make it clear is the names 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.880
 that you are here of the possible maps is 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.800
 everything also supposes the blog 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.750
 already in relation already the images that they 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.370
 supported that they are of the map understood that 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.260
 nor did this map he called light 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.180
 which is satellite because it has a satellite 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.860
 in the background such generally the map names 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.810
 are very simple and have to do with 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.760
 with its scenario itself but also all 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.900
 assumption only fills in key a form of 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.100
 how to call the map 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.280
 what we wanted and two kindergartens 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.500
 From this map you can not see much more. 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.880
 it seems to me an open ta map should not 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.739
 have many places of leather and you 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.630
 this not only by the images themselves 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.360
 as well as the map beyond if you 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.130
 you can see that the map is quite 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.970
 Merchant Spacing Just For You 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.890
 walk and such 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.750
 I do not think it's a very complicated map. 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.500
 maybe not even on small maps 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.270
 about the game 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.000
 Okay, we'll have to wait and see the 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.680
 next map would be hertha hortal map 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.420
 and if we had many pictures in the 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.920
 multiplayer trailer of the game was the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.880
 first trailer that came out of the way 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.180
 multiplayer 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.340
 ok it also looks like a map is only open 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.350
 that he is already a little closer to 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.930
 many passages I remember even a little 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.239
 in the w2 favela with many places 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.700
 broken many walls local places 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.800
 maybe to climb right then too 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.750
 it seemed like an interesting map but 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.760
 it's not too much the way I do not go 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.709
 wait for the game to come out to be sure 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.100
 next would just be the chip in 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.640
 container on the second ooo own blog 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.590
 huh 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.880
 and this name comes precisely because the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.400
 people can see that there are several 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.169
 on the map, this team has the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.090
 face of a medium-sized map maybe 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.830
 but this is also 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.600
 is also another fairly narrow map 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.120
 Yeah, with lots of ways for you. 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.790
 accessing various locations routes 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.740
 Okay , I already liked that. 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.510
 map by image I'm very fan of 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.280
 maps that have a large container of 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.590
 Such a way enough for you. 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.699
 funk to the enemies and it seemed to me map 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.160
 this style 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.479
 ok the next striker would have much 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.240
 probably should be a big map 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.280
 what is the forrest map is that map them 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.080
 you can see that it is quite weedy and such is 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.210
 by the images also seems quite a 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.550
 open and to me it has a lot of face to be 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.800
 one of the big maps of the game is not 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.720
 always have these maps so usually 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.010
 are the maps most hated by the galley 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.630
 Let's see if it's infinite, we'll go. 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.389
 can do a good job at it 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.000
 ok the map itself would be an urban map o 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.520
 what is the blog gave this name because it is a 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.010
 map that seems to go in a city 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.169
 It is a city in ruins actually also 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.479
 An interesting map appears to me. 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.460
 face of a medium-sized map is 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.500
 full of debris and this also me 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.419
 It looks like a map with plenty of places 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.280
 you do not need to see that 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.630
 There are parts that you are. 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.580
 not submerged but you are in a 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.960
 flooding is full of water in other 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.060
 you're in the middle of the 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.070
 wreckage finally also seemed a 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.990
 map 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.700
 then we have a Syrian map the reem 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.680
 that we have a single image of this 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.270
 map that came out not feeling right and felt 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.650
 any problem 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.960
 but it was not long ago we managed to 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.099
 this image is and also seems to pass 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.740
 in a city ​​a little town 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.780
 the futurist is in the middle of a 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.849
 we have a lot to talk about this map 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.470
 This is even why the blog gave 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.660
 this name is ciro in which means the 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.760
 city ​​is where it's raining from rainy 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.020
 Rain in the city, something like that, right? 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.169
 and finally we have a map that 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.060
 they baptized the edict that 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.580
 also theoretically it would happen in a 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.550
 This city also has the face of a 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.930
 map a little shorter a little more 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.310
 tight but if you look for yourself 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.139
 also gives a little of this 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.280
 but on another map that also 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.380
 It's not like we knew too much until 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.360
 present only have this image for now 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.550
 right then and no more is this are these 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.110
 the maps that the blog was able to verify 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.750
 just remembering is all 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.639
 guess both the name of the maps as 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.349
 to the junction of images can have many 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.880
 images that I have shown are that 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:37.440
 people thinking that it is a certain map but 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.210
 which is actually from another is not for 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.560
 another angle of the type what the 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.060
 connection confirmation 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.040
 the maps and such people will only have 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.900
 when the game comes out on the 5th of 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.250
 November beauty but all that's there 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.840
 animal I wanted to bring it to you 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.730
 I hope you have enjoyed it if you 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.650
 liked the flashes on your Egyptian side
