 this year are welcome to the of the criticism especially in the case of one 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.160
 Seemingly absolutely worth seeing was not in vain for 8 out of that 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.439
 nominates Wessels &amp; Network 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.429
 otherwise it would be a case for a week in which not so much about me 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.459
 I think it's okay as well as each of you 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.730
 Facebook is something that has been recorded via almost in some regions 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.550
 it drives dictators to be overthrown Facebook is just one thing 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.380
 the modern ones do not find that much changed 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.359
 the social network as the title says that also looked in the cinema very popular 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.640
 deals specifically with the story of Mark Zuckerberg 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.110
 as it is called the emergence of Facebook we came to it is Mark 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.930
 Pile of sugar 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.830
 Today one of the youngest more talked about is now 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.040
 my faith I believe in hard percent whereby the trip is one 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.300
 House with its full no big claims of short half of his 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.680
 Wealth donated 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.360
 all interesting character percent not much played by Jesse 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.980
 Eisenberg that she is a mountain 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.650
 who's acting in Cannes maybe the last one but also a great one 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.799
 funny movie 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.799
 only to promote but aims at the city 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.230
 Although a certain arrogance to Nr also earned a certainty in the character 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.030
 that it really is 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.550
 to see the big clou because it suits their position in the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.750
 Endgame resumed producing the film the report will be a proper one 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.729
 Battle »Right time realized that you do not necessarily have to raise every child 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.700
 she is responsible 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.020
 and this story around this femo wonderful characters Sean Parker for 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.119
 Example the former inventor 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.799
 more that's always bad Inventor of Justin Timberlake is also percent 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.710
 to see a great performance 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.729
 just created a wonderful time of history under Facebook 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.729
 alone 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.940
 it was said 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.740
 We knew that we have the Internet under control individually 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.429
 this 70 percent increase 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.999
 to 17 at the 8 as outliers on the 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.799
 I'm talking about putting all the social experiences in college online 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.209
 are 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.249
 22 degrees 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:34.629
 Like the Italian central bank, we go to the century of our era 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.469
 have been astonished 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.199
 a minority 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:47.549
 what's on the track I'm just overjoyed 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.409
 heartily and introduced her to the refined the fire department I would have 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.009
 Do not make anything you want to tell me is a handicap man 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.739
 have agreed 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.739
 Dr for the hits 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.189
 Dr 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.859
 KH clarified the allegations 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.749
 the daily I get some recognition for these bodies 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.709
 finally goes 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.429
 I do not want to like which part 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.009
 2 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.009
 2 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.850
 So the coach promises a lot 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.480
 In this movie, you can really just say that everyone is part of it 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.530
 That's why this movie is especially close to Facebook 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.319
 In addition one can already expect that the quality particularly lifted it 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.429
 Dolphin creates 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.889
 responsible for the director Ellen Denny Fischer 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.499
 Known for watching movies when one of the culprits left Ben Jelloun waiting 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:57.829
 or even if you have big milestones 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.420
 Case clear or 7 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.349
 that is why you can say that there is quality in the 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.530
 Bacon has to be responsible that Kevin Spacey is at the whole Zechner himself 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.099
 also that quality is behind it otherwise this is not for again 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.650
 Interesting as everyone is watching straight for the modern internet world 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.289
 social platforms like Facebook 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:15.689
 Interested 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.799
 Basically, you can only recommend this movie as an actor 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.260
 the very interesting performance of really young young actors 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.800
 but also absolute high form Jesse Eisenberg and so look at her 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.930
 I especially like our country a great achievement 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.819
 Woody Harrelson had delivered 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:34.339
 and also the national Gerhard all-rounder that did not make it easy 

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:37.650
 And in the case later, that was not the first time a movie 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.909
 an absolutely magnificent figure 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.999
 and that's a really interesting movie overall 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.769
 it was not a special action let that you can think of or 

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:47.999
 especially funny or especially crazy 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:49.510
 because the template is simple 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.499
 so this is but Lyon figure Mark Zuckerberg 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:56.729
 The Taliban that certain arrogance with this giant talent finder's PC 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.830
 it's a feast for the eyes 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.499
 I can explain the reason for them to look at them 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:04.940
 there is that burdened me 8 from that one with the WN 7 4 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.229
 the Förderverein 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.150
 but actually 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.999
 I would like to have less Tabea Lust has a look at this movie 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.259
 the world is certainly not regret on my Steiner smooth 8 points
