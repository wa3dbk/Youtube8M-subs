00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.190
 yes of course you can order pizza or 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.210
 China is if you don't feel like it 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.410
 Cook 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.849
 but how do you go again for half an hour 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.940
 to wait 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.000
 or you make within fifteen minutes 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.150
 this is much tastier and also healthy 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.150
 I 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.730
 today we make it in 15 minutes 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.490
 stir-fry dish with chicken 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.960
 bok choy and noodles and this lightning fast 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.370
 noodle dish there you have the following 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.650
 for invites 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.970
 chicken breast noodles coriander spring onions 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:00.180
 bok choy and lime chilli peppers 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.040
 cashew nuts and oyster sauce or we start 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.030
 fry with the chicken and boil the water 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.010
 for the noodles and we do that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:14.250
 at the same time 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:19.440
 heat the oil in the pan and turn on the water 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.270
 put a child in it I already have 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.810
 bought pre-cut saves quickly 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.810
 again the action 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:43.060
 no i would not have that do we go 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.550
 and grab sorry cutting and if you do that 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.950
 then keep the green part separate from it 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.240
 the white part that green part 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.720
 That is because it has much less time 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.880
 required 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.610
 and I want a bit of a cross with you 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.610
 in doing so will add separately later 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:24.660
 cut the first seeds into red pepper 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:24.660
 cut out spring onions into rings 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:36.640
 the coriander that you just cut 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:39.060
 very or typical you almost go foxo you 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.060
 to do 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:49.290
 remove the red pepper goes with it 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.290
 from 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.850
 cashew nuts are added 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.270
 so this goes on a bit in the meantime 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.270
 my brothers were captivated 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.970
 while the noodles are cooking 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:42.800
 we go there nice outings and the green 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:44.600
 portion of the bok choy and days at it 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.080
 juice of half a lime and the 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.080
 Oyster sauce 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:21.060
 in the meantime you pour it off and it can go there 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:23.480
 you always have a moment to make like 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.480
 moving in 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.410
 well they are just ready for the noodles 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.600
 how you serve the 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.160
 coriander through it and you had one 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.160
 a little bit behind for the garnish 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.969
 and a finishing touch 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.969
 coriander the op 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 I am very curious about what you do 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.990
 makes if you don't feel like an evening 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.069
