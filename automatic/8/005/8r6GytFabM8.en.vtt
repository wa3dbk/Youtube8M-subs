00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:14.000
 yes, here is your energy drink again 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:20.150
 Stefan and I are currently drinking rockstar 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.170
 energy plus mango orange that and perpetrated 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:28.670
 it is only 32 so the perfect time 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.670
 to consume an antique 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.530
 to initiate it earlier in the water 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.670
 energy drink a bit difficult 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.040
 there was only red bull this impossible 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.660
 dishwater that somehow only successful 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.000
 Now as any action 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.030
 Crazy by the stratosphere 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.320
 catapult meanwhile is 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 but that is very wide 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.440
 diversified and one does not know why 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.410
 you decide and for me it was 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.809
 clear that rockstar is my drink 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.240
 alone from the image well I have 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.159
 only started with the youtube channel 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.229
 but success is always right 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.909
 i have a subscriber friends i 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.290
 of course I have with the consequences of cases 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.979
 But do not count on them 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:25.049
 dimensions are practical in the years 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.590
 National football team fits very well 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.270
 me 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.540
 apart from an incredible 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.320
 performances in sport in the artistic 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.430
 Area 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:40.189
 as a young professional and ambitious 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.220
 student and for a great experience 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:52.259
 we come to learn - score of 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:55.259
 rockstar is energy once it stops 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.649
 really awake, I have to say that 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.130
 in my opinion has the biggest 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.200
 alertness effect of energydrinks I 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.509
 Of course, that's where it's important 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.560
 that you are responsible somewhere 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.539
 consumed 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.400
 on the other side of the energy drinks 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.500
 consume responsibly make-up 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.750
 understood or so if then I breathe 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.630
 that a teacher packs away yes again 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.410
 to be really awake so that I know 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.640
 somehow people died or something 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.870
 in the best I say no 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.440
 somehow arise on your character 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.440
 hired or died of an overdose roger 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.470
 Wise at 27 years is best 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.440
 Dirigent community rejoice 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.390
 Well, apart from that I carry my heart 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.920
 or so I like these defibrillators 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.610
 somehow now on too 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.440
 energy again and again he is already 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.410
 somehow did no position to do 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.510
 Well, apart from that, of course, is 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.040
 a very good alternative to crystal 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.780
 meth of course christel keeps up to 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.580
 makes twelve hours of rockstar can 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.610
 Of course, not quite keep up 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.860
 but depending on the amount of something inherently amounts 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.480
 and above all, the advantage is one sees 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.100
 After two years rock constantly 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.390
 once principle ago for example by 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.790
 friends come if you could 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.049
 same as the game types founder each 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.269
 take a smoke 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.579
 Just bring this rockstar me 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.000
 my say, let's say ten twelve 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.980
 or so you can not smoke here 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.489
 as to handle more light as to 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.420
 rotate 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.639
 some no longer a tip 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:43.769
 you know you are consuming away 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:48.530
 neither of them probably wanted from 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:54.530
 manufacturer does not recommend the product 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:59.069
 so no children to give what i want 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.470
 to be questionable because the children 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.130
 just great for the sugar and everything 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.600
 head should be used to it 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.709
 even just a bit of tolerance 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.930
 develop 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.850
 Now imagine that they are 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.380
 then tolerated later in working life 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.810
 for the less caffeine than theirs 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.519
 Colleagues and the rates actually 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.780
 inevitably into the social 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.209
 offside 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.370
 and I do not mean that the company yet 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.160
 for his children for example i have 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.990
 now a two-year-old nephew too 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.610
 of course rockstar in again and again 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.740
 his little bottle because I mean the picture 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.020
 Also think about it until 34 o'clock at night 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.070
 helplessly there and then helpless 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.820
 otherwise, of course, that's important 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.530
 drink to enjoy but that is 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.560
 actually no big problem with 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.480
 German summer so if somehow 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.130
 I want to hand it over 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.570
 Just let the blood out on the 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.669
 brander and then also has its minus 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.669
 five degrees yes it is the big problem 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.220
 Of course it worked too 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.460
 competitive products such as 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.290
 relentless the small advantages have like 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.660
 for example, that you can relentless through 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.930
 this has on the closable closure 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.880
 yes so you can plug it in 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.580
 and somehow it will continue to increase later 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.290
 yes very practical but a mini lakers 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.650
 No , just do not know shit 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.650
 tastes 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.150
 Now maybe I can get the little one - 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.840
 points 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.710
 it has a longer standing sugar here 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.419
 at the brother on the third nourishment 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.250
 second place even the ingredients list it 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.020
 is quite okay but could be my view 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.110
 after all, in the first place 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.740
 stand in front of water because I just like 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.660
 the sÃ¼wag then I always do it 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.729
 can manually even as intact dice even 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.750
 So the problem is you get it 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.160
 Of course, always a bit here 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.960
 heavy but the opening 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.360
 That's why I recommend it to you 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.890
 Subject to Nazi 11 I'll push you 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.990
 always with a pen still 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:04.680
 in and then finally a bit 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.360
 and then it tastes the same 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.669
 twice as good should sugar 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.980
 the caffeine is indeed faster on the 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.580
 blood 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.300
 maybe a second point of criticism 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.190
 there are none of these people 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.110
 preservatives and no 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.470
 artificial citric acid and artificial 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.120
 vitamins and I recommend them 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.240
 easy to wait for an energy drink 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:31.140
 made of tofu base and equipment again 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:34.790
 rauskommt comes with friends a lot 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.790
 have fun with your exciting life 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.370
 otherwise a conclusion it is a great 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:49.310
 energy drink so you are above all 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:51.210
 also the mango orange and you can taste it 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:55.140
 maybe check it out what does one mean 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.590
 couple ever flight aracoeli out of it 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.970
 learned 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.090
 which one the passion for notes 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:05.430
 probably not so up 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:08.430
 rockstar energy is the best 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:11.670
 alternative jokes hello kitty energy 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.810
 I wish you much fun with it again 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.510
