 nature and contador andy schleck and 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.559
 Contador Dropped Contador Dropped Now 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.570
 cédric absolutely to laurent and thierry 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.980
 the contador loss did not really 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.269
 looks very comfortable and there I have 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.830
 the impression that he is unfortunately 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.869
 letting go they do not arrive 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.910
 not to follow the pace imposed by the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.529
 yellow jersey group he's distanced from the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.000
 tony gallopin's group has visibly had 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.189
 this day for the runners you 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.410
 know this climb is difficult with 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.720
 the sister category it's going to hurt a lot 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.980
 tonight is sure it's more than 3 1 they 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.410
 are more than 3 especially that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.570
 richie door saw alberto contador in 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.370
 difficulty alejandro valverde also tony 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.050
 gallopin stone rolland and watch 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.000
 chip horde that helps 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 christopher froome and rockin talât ne 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.140
 do not move a finger and it was john 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.670
 keep in the second of the general who is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.739
 imbued with doing the fees well 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.980
 look at this picture maybe it's a 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.780
 mano to mano which will be summarized this turn 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.969
 of France between the British 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.649
 christopher froome and columbia 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.510
 the kintana hérault because the stage of the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.760
 day it cogit nothing she launches the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.680
 verdict for the moment nibali and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.659
 contador are not up to this 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.250
 duo there lipids tana I have the impression 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.750
 that he is not very comfortable there she 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.040
 not very easy it clings to the wheel 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.170
 from christopher not sure he 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.060
 happens to hold passion in train station 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.880
 reindeer as usual one who manages his 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.920
 effort in the climbs difficult tab 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 attack proves a backup tag then 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.080
 What is the attack? 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.210
 yellow jersey in person christopher 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.830
 froome who is catching up with the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.720
 Tour de France the year 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.790
 hit on the tour de france on his 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.680
 albert fert main no one 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.900
 can follow the yellow jersey none 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.240
 tannins that goes in a progressive way that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.530
 did not try to follow the wheel on the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.460
 change of pace to christopher 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.780
 froome who gave a while ago 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.360
 the impression of doing a little accordion 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.870
 and finally who found a second 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.210
 breath 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.680
 able to change pace and who wants 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.520
 push the nail in this first 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.360
 mountain stage 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.670
 6km further from the summit it will make some 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.040
 big gaps the christopher puppy froome 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.600
 with a hero clint annakhil this is 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.070
 not in the red trying to come back 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.140
 he bought a quick look once 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.240
 twice in this right turn we 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.490
 see we were the Colombian who goes 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.190
 as a dancer but undeniably 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.920
 well that's a terrible blow that is 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.570
 still undergoing fuzzy two 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.830
 very different styles or even sitting on 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.510
 the saddle that grind enormously and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.240
 nairo quintana with a pedal stroke a 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.610
 little heavier a little bit more 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.280
 strength but nevertheless still effective 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.380
 see the distance and stay six 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.650
 km2 without which of the two will hold this 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.459
 pace to the end and handles 45 info or 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.860
 brainwashing 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.890
 for now info christopher froome 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.720
 in yellow confirms that it is for 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.100
 the moment above everyone 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.410
 above all his opponents 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.000
 watch the second of the general here already dj 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.000
 keep ballaro
