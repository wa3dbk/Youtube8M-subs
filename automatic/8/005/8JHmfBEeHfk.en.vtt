00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
 in this video we will explain the operation of the prs axis obvious draw 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.839
 system as well as the differences between the old and the 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:10.839
 new technologies for using said platform 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.309
 in any of the two conditions 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.480
 the starting point is the trees and the place where your alarm is installed 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.420
 with all that pose a team of radio times basically a cell phone has 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.470
 ready to use the data transmission channel you use 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.919
 usually 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.789
 that transmitter equipment for gprs 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.699
 achieves communication via radio waves to the telephone antenna 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:33.640
 mobile 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.039
 closer this step is given in the new and old technologies 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.100
 we explain you here 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.860
 in a second instance 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.530
 the gprs 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.650
 transmit via ip or internet protocol 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.930
 what is the communication used on the internet 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.830
 in this way a connection is made through a radio link 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.139
 wireless only to the nearest antenna 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:01:01.520
 since from there it will be transmitted by network intent be it by internet 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.520
 that's why there will be no long distance cost 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.410
 When the service performed from a central monitoring the communication 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.820
 prevent the use of equipment specially prepared to receive 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.870
 these signals from the gs rs device that is installed in said central 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.780
 with an internet connection that we can love obereÃ±a or is not professional and 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.550
 where it is also required to have a physical ite address it is worth clarifying that 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.020
 this connection suffers from many defects compared to connections 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.480
 professionals later we will delve into the subject 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.250
 the collection is that they start from the internet cloud towards the team 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.180
 specially prepared to receive those signals 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.800
 subsequently establish communication with a computer that is responsible for 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.240
 process the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.900
 On that computer there are high and low subscribers who have the service dgt rs 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.820
 then from that same sd said signal is directed towards another team that forwards it 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.320
 internet exactly where the monitoring servers are 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.360
 against these servers is currently working on dotcom monitoring for 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.470
 operate events will give high or low subscribers is ethereal 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.159
 in the transition to pointcom monitoring from the monitoring center 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.330
 From the past 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.010
 we have sought to forward the events coming from the signals dgp rs 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.659
 to reach the dotcom monitoring servers 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.909
 the monitoring is done on the internet 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.359
 with which those events that come from the axis prsa the special teams 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.239
 ready to link these signals have to be received by a 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.889
 connection ip home and inia and blue forwarded by a connection of the 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.649
 same characteristics 

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:47.399
 any inconvenience in the phases cut and the pressure would be introduced that 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.759
 the event does not follow the servers 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.340
 The more phases up 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.080
 more chances to spend 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.080
 they will exist 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.589
 what happens point monitoring with 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:03.509
 dotcom monitoring we find servers on the internet where they operate 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:04.559
 the centers 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.759
 that was achieved with the abate team 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.439
 that the team directly has two iterated addresses 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.819
 that together 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.809
 are two addresses of two servers on the internet 

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:18.259
 in this way the event travels directly to a server 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:22.279
 avoiding excessive communications that increase the risk of losing service 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.729
 because the same monitoring program gives the subscriber high and low 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.290
 plus 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.199
 the connections and you where the servers are are professional connections 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.199
 what we say with professional connections 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.029
 the machine that resides the event is the same server that is a machine 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:42.949
 professional not a computer clone 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.939
 they are computer servers in a data center 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.059
 in optimal conditions and with professional connections that only have 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:51.340
 fixed interest 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.080
 minimizing the risks of integrating speak of the connection 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.909
 homely 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.059
 the service will never be interrupted 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.920
 serves and seven years servant the subscriber will connect with another 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.510
 with which the event will be done anyway 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.730
 One of the great advantages that teams have to beat between 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.540
 other things 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.760
 write scheduled in advance 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.940
 so that the only thing the technician will do is connect the five rural 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:15.539
 the signal 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:16.719
 caution 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:20.799
 you must go to the physical place where the equipment will be installed and gprs 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.180
 before requesting it 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.250
 and corroborate that to that signal from the cell phone company 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.309
 in turn, the equipment to beat present another great advantage 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:33.390
 when connecting the equipment with the alarm 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.880
 he himself leads the subscriber number of this one and automatically it will remain 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.840
 configured with that number with which there will be no need to program anything if 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.780
 I had to do it 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.909
 for making a modification of the helmsman 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.159
 that is, the program within the team 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.729
 can be done by ite connection 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.129
 thus reducing the inconvenience they have paid 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.050
 it's because of all this that we say that the new teams to the scholarships are the most 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.029
 secure and reliable that exists to monitor events by gp rs 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.960
 Despite this technology, a direct communication protocol was created 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.520
 to work with servers without so many steps
