00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.509
 hello and hundreds welcome to a new 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.700
 video in this community thanks for 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.799
 tune in our channel today we are going to 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.269
 work with our samsung galaxy no 4 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.880
 we are going to install a rom that has been 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.470
 in 12.1 mode but is developed by 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.880
 temasek let's go into what is the 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.710
 rom and we will proceed to install what 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.240
 it is also the kernel since the card 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.160
 will allow us to have better performance at 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.660
 our battery before continuing with the 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.310
 installation is necessary is the backup 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.419
 from your fs folder as well as in 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.309
 Android backup so we avoid 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.469
 Post-installation problems 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.149
 once these suggestions of 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.260
 security we are going to download from the 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.610
 description of the video files 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.890
 necessary to realize what is the 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.510
 installation well the only thing that we have 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.489
 what to do is turn off our device 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.140
 and enter very recovery persie nougat you 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.480
 allows you to enter directly you can 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.820
 do as you can see mine if we go to 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.620
 enter recovery let's give it to accept 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.050
 for those who ask me what rom 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.160
 I have currently is the maya rom is a 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.710
 of the best rom I've tried in 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.660
 this device on samsung galaxy 14 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.070
 well as you can see we are already in 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.080
 the advanced recovery we're going to go to 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.580
 white now we are going to be advanced and 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.160
 let's select the 4 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.330
 and what are we going to need to do 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.410
 a clean installation more 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.780
 select dalÃ­ and we will select 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.150
 system + select data and finally 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.100
 select cache it is necessary to do it 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.600
 It's cool when we install a new rom 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.010
 on our device since as is 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.450
 this way we can achieve what the 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.580
 maximum performance of our 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.200
 device once selected 24 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.270
 white we just move and start 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.470
 to do the formatting of the device as 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.700
 you can see we have already 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.200
 finished cleaning our 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.330
 device we just go back 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.760
 now let's go to our 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.260
 microsd memory where we have what it is 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.790
 in the files that we discard from the 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.560
 description of the video we are going to enter 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.270
 our microsd memory 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.680
 here we have good, I have a 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.450
 folder that is called rom test is a 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.920
 folder that I have to be able to add 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.540
 all the roms that we are testing in 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.890
 the channel first we are going to iron 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.050
 what is the rom we are going to select 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.550
 this procedure will be treated a little 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.040
 so I recommend you have at least 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.630
 minus 70% battery so they do not have 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.970
 no problem no cut in the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.650
 the course of the installation as they can 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.090
 observe we have already finished the process of 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.710
 installation now only touches us 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.570
 return us back and we will proceed 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.220
 install what the glasses are 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.330
 we select and hope that it 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.650
 install 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.510
 Now let's proceed to install what 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.070
 is the kernel that has developed the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.170
 same developer of the rom that 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.790
 temasek to be able to optimize more the 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.870
 battery performance just what 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.640
 we select and wait for it to be installed 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.500
 once the process of 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.750
 installation we go back and we go 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.190
 back now let's go white 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.049
 to select advanced we are going to 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.090
 select let's do what is the 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.069
 dalvik hy we are going to select cache 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.120
 these two whitecross after that 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.480
 let's install the robla 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.769
 and the kernel we're going to do this by white 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.150
 we simply move once it is 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.010
 finalize what is the process of 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.629
 installation and full formatting of 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.220
 our device only touches us 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.680
 restart and asia the configurations 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.290
 relevant to be able to use this rom 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.680
 which is based on the google code 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.680
 ep 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.390
 well as you can see we have already 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.830
 finished the configuration of the rom 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.180
 and it works without any problem now I'm going 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.069
 to do a little review of the rom 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.690
 let's start with the adjustments of 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.010
 desk let's go in what are the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.840
 wallpapers that we can 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.340
 observe these funds are those that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.920
 they use whatever they are today in mode fits 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.870
 point out that this rom uses a rom 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.880
 base of cyanogenmod but it is developed 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.080
 By subject, it is a little more optimized 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.060
 widgets will depend on the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.739
 applications that we currently have in 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.970
 our device should be noted that no 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.830
 I have no additional application 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.630
 simply google services 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.970
 here we create a direct access to the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.680
 adjustments as you can observe this rom the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.120
 We can customize with the themes that 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.400
 It is a section that many people 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.959
 they like in the design issues and in 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.819
 mont should be noted that some are 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.590
 payment and others are free 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.989
 also the developer has decided 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.610
 you can add an adjustment package 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.860
 additional to optimize a little 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.200
 more what the visual aspect of the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.849
 device is the most settings 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.250
 they are the same ones that use the rom 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.349
 this side s &amp; p which are those released by 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.150
 google and they do not have much difference 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.610
 we are going to move this information from 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.829
 phone here we can contact what 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.270
 version although variant of no 43 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.820
 using in the smn 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.890
 efe and we are running the last 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.530
 Android version known that 5.1.1 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.910
 lollipop for this device what is 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.950
 the kernel information and some other 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.140
 information provided by the rom 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.459
 in this section 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.560
 now let's move to 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.430
 applications is a section that many 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.620
 people 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.870
 they care or they are worried at the time 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.400
 that they install a new rum and it is to see how 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.140
 manages the rom what are the resources 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.930
 of the device as we can see here 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.850
 we have free gigas 1.9 in 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.800
 this device should be noted that this 3 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.710
 gigas of ram memory so you have 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.920
 used a gig for what is the 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.570
 operating system of android 5.1.1 and what 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.160
 what are the services of google and we 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.110
 two gigabytes of memory remain 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.760
 free to use it by installing 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.140
 additional applications the camera 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.910
 it works without any problem 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.830
 you can use this camera or 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.990
 use the google but really 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.400
 this camera has been improved a lot and 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.200
 the truth can work without any 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.550
 problem now we move to the 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.220
 task manager as you can see 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.840
 here we have it , they add what is the 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.460
 Complete cleaning button as they can 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.360
 see here we can clean it without any 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.550
 problem now we turn to the 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.560
 been as I already have some occasion I've already 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.090
 done a review of this here we can 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.430
 access what are the different networks 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.289
 that we can also access the 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.629
 devices that we can connect to 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:26.360
 through the bluetooth and some other 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:28.219
 accesses as you can see eladio audio fx 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.780
 which is a sound equalizer that 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:31.879
 adds what 'are fashionable today to your 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.490
 rom which works correctly me 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.259
 more than ever if not used 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.550
 is block the change at the time of 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.960
 reproduce what music is not 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.580
 as long as you use what are the 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.780
 headphones with this we finalized the 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.460
 today's video you already know that if they have 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.569
 Any question or concern with relation 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.520
 to this video you can leave it in the 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.400
 comments of the same one and I will be pending
