loyalty<00:00:51.159> but<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.519> loyalty<00:00:51.969> didn't<00:00:52.359> feel<00:00:52.569> like

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
loyalty but the loyalty didn't feel like

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.239 
loyalty but the loyalty didn't feel like
it<00:00:52.809> meant<00:00:53.140> anything<00:00:53.589> because<00:00:53.739> it<00:00:53.829> was<00:00:53.920> just<00:00:54.100> to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249 
it meant anything because it was just to

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:56.399 
it meant anything because it was just to
see<00:00:54.429> if<00:00:54.550> I<00:00:54.609> could<00:00:54.789> bang<00:00:54.940> him<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.329> then<00:00:56.079> it<00:00:56.319> was

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
see if I could bang him and then it was

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.379 
see if I could bang him and then it was
like<00:00:56.559> maybe<00:00:57.249> I'll<00:00:57.460> just<00:00:57.640> jump<00:00:57.969> and<00:00:58.179> do<00:00:58.269> the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:58.389 
like maybe I'll just jump and do the

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:01.500 
like maybe I'll just jump and do the
suicide<00:00:58.809> mission<00:00:59.199> right<00:00:59.379> away<00:00:59.649> and<00:01:00.389> but<00:01:01.389> that

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
suicide mission right away and but that

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.700
