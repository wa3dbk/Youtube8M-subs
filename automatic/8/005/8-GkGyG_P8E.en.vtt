00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello and well today I want 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.540
 do a video on so well with you 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.730
 and therefore obviously players still 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.039
 port guinea pigs that you can 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.880
 easily make at home that asks 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.550
 very little material and therefore practical 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.869
 so to do for this if you need 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.970
 a roll of toilet paper for 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.250
 all see that I will quote you 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.739
 will need your toilet paper 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 so I guess everyone has it 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.260
 at home what is otherwise I 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.340
 ask with what 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.539
 so that's so you'll need a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.469
 piece of toilet paper and a pair 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.550
 decision that you also have everything that 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.829
 we see there you do not need to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.140
 hardware in addition so finally to do 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.030
 see it in itself after I'm going to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.829
 to say some improvements for this 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.680
 first flight you will have to flatten the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.200
 roll of toilet paper not to flatten 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.659
 apathy before it's pretty much 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.299
 like that's it's what I call 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.850
 flattens and so you'll cut out 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.310
 strips 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.939
 so wait i'm going to cut a I'm going 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.200
 show you the size it takes 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:27.060
 here you go to cut bundles to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.320
 pretty much like that and I'll do you 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.040
 all the toilet paper work as 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.040
 that's good I'll do it 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.540
 So here so do not try to 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.690
 calculate precisely so that all 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.420
 face strips the same size have 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.660
 not tried it's not worth it 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.690
 is about the same size as 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.820
 so you're going to take two 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.490
 and you're just fine 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:10.420
 snap like this so you see that 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.420
 you do little cross 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.510
 so far so good so you go 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.270
 continue to annoy them 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.320
 so the little cross you go there the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.590
 tighten up you will put in a 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.590
 other 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.220
 there it makes you an emergency cross the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.230
 the blue cross that we see on some 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.670
 payments and you will start again 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.710
 until it makes a tight thing when 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.840
 I say it's true you will understand 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.840
 I mean by tight 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.939
 after that you do something like 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.680
 that then for the series even more you 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.969
 take the one that's all the way down 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.090
 down all the way down to the 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:03.920
 base you're going to press on it's at 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.780
 say the cross from the beginning you go the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.069
 inflate and so that'll make you some 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.310
 thing like that after you can put 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.780
 basic treats so have to see the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.780
 video I did on the treats 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.230
 so here are second games always my 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.290
 toilet paper always a trick at 6o 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.349
 finally turn targets this time you 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.239
 do not go flatten it so here you are at 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.950
 cut out two big strips 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:39.200
 I will show you about the same 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.720
 here is the jelly even cut a little 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:49.250
 bigger too bosses cut it 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:50.780
 a little smaller and so you go 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.190
 once you have these two 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.680
 big strips you will make 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:04:02.449
 small demand small strips 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.769
 went normal what this time 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.909
 you will fit them but of a 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.069
 different way 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.709
 your scissors you see he did a 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:13.400
 price anyway but the more he is there and 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:16.519
 where I put my two fingers and so 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.500
 its folds actually you go them 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.419
 you're going to put your fingers of it yourself 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.880
 go like that flatten and put the 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.460
 masters people was beating that way 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.220
 there so that's fine 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.139
 always a cross but it's easy 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.940
 there is one that the fold here and the other 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.699
 in fifteen years that she pilat and a 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.500
 other calculation like that that makes it 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:47.270
 inflate even more a little trick 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.159
 that I found so here is actually there 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.500
 this time we will do the realization 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:55.500
 of a ball announced that it is rather 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:59.430
 well done so that's learning world 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:03.450
 of a toilet paper role trick 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:07.010
 you do something like that so 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.450
 that's normally we can do two 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.120
 with a roll of toilet paper 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.870
 I will not do it in front of you I want 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.240
 pass right away 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.320
 still a new look for this player 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:25.070
 always a roll of toilet paper 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.070
 Here you will fold inwards 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.800
 sorry but here I learned I'm filming with 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.470
 a camera so I can not 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.880
 really show you what I know this 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:42.900
 that I do but the principle is that the 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.520
 principle fell back as it was 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.260
 folded so they do not have spaces 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:55.220
 there must not be spaces and 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:59.030
 it gives you that after on the other side 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.030
 you cut 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:08.820
 you're going to do that you 're going to corsa 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:10.800
 all along the pier and so here goes 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.950
 is very fine so his senses better 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.300
 so it's on the end I got a little 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.100
 released because I told myself that 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.479
 you were getting bored that 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.460
 should not be far from the truth 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:25.550
 yes and you wanted her folded one by one it 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.510
 give you something like that 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.100
 you can put something to 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.860
 inside because that wall's path has 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:36.090
 all pillars so that was it 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.350
 for calves so you can also 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:44.220
 to foil in terracotta or wood 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:46.200
 so there is no problem and so 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.740
 so that's game about this I tell you at 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.990
 meet again 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.729
 please put a little help 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:55.830
 green is to subscribe to my channel so 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.070
 goodbye and see you soon for new 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.070
