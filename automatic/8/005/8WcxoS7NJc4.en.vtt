 That's no doubt 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.879
 It's a difficult partner 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.610
 Do you intend to leave him alone 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.810

 Even if the next Shinnosuke 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.790
 You should hold the handle as you think 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.790
