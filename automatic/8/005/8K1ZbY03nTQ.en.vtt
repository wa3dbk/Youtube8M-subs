00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
another difference is that this one is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.880

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
with turbo boost it's actually going up

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.850 
with turbo boost it's actually going up
to<00:03:42.520> 2.3<00:03:43.360> gigahertz<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:46.170> yeah<00:03:47.170> let's<00:03:47.680> take<00:03:47.830> a

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
to 2.3 gigahertz and yeah let's take a

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.160 
to 2.3 gigahertz and yeah let's take a
look<00:03:48.040> at<00:03:48.190> device<00:03:48.940> then<00:03:49.210> down<00:03:49.720> here<00:03:49.930> we<00:03:50.050> have

the Windows Start button that's gonna be

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.350 
the Windows Start button that's gonna be
very<00:03:53.290> useful<00:03:53.650> for<00:03:53.680> Windows<00:03:54.130> 8<00:03:54.310> up<00:03:54.520> here<00:03:55.180> we
