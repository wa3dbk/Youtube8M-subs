didn't happen on Monday Night Raw a few
weeks<00:01:07.799> ago<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.280> would<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.640> been<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
weeks ago what would have been the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.969 
weeks ago what would have been the
build-up<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.720> match<00:01:09.990> besides<00:01:10.830> were

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
build-up for this match besides were

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.830 
build-up for this match besides were
just<00:01:11.130> being<00:01:11.310> champion<00:01:11.850> versus<00:01:12.210> champion<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
just being champion versus champion it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.960 
just being champion versus champion it
seems<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.650> speculation<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.700> around

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
seems that all the speculation is around

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.950 
seems that all the speculation is around
Cena's<00:01:15.360> nose<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:17.150> I'm<00:01:18.150> not<00:01:18.330> sure<00:01:18.360> they

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
Cena's nose but I'm not sure they

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.600 
Cena's nose but I'm not sure they
announced<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.439> contract<00:01:19.950> signing<00:01:20.340> she<00:01:20.460> had

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
announced the contract signing she had

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.920 
announced the contract signing she had
to<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.000> Cena<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.720> there

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
to think that Cena was going to be there

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870 
to think that Cena was going to be there
but<00:01:22.140> honestly<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.619> my<00:01:22.680> mind<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.580> was<00:01:23.759> almost

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
but honestly in my mind it was almost

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.609 
but honestly in my mind it was almost
like<00:01:24.150> Rollins<00:01:24.600> was<00:01:24.720> almost<00:01:24.900> surprised<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
like Rollins was almost surprised that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.399 
like Rollins was almost surprised that
Cena<00:01:25.860> was<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.310> basically<00:01:27.229> relatives<00:01:28.229> in

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
Cena was there basically relatives in

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.020 
Cena was there basically relatives in
the<00:01:28.439> ring<00:01:28.710> basically<00:01:29.189> saying<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.460> John<00:01:29.790> Cena

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the ring basically saying that John Cena

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.609 
the ring basically saying that John Cena
was<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.329> disease<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.170> only<00:01:31.290> cure

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
was the disease and the only cure

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.730 
was the disease and the only cure
because<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.009> disease<00:01:32.600> was<00:01:33.600> was<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.560> Seth

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
because the disease was was with Seth

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.230 
because the disease was was with Seth
