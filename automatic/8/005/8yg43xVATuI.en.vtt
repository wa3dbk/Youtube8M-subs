00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:23.259
 we are here now on our second day 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:25.899
 and with at least one dog 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.749
 seeing is faithful is already an advance in the idea 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:30.970
 compared to a difficult team but I will 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.270
 power if for example the guy signaled 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.550
 that I wanted to go, right? 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.270
 helton thank you 1.0 and this despite the a 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.100
 tire 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.860
 if it goes well but why the lady who 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.570
 suffered overtaking that could lead to 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.570
 torch most people I did 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.110
 sopot no pit 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:34.910
 there the staff 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.670
 we arrived after 36 hours of travel 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.100
 thousand 477 kilometers rolled to people 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.910
 reached our destination which was rivera 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.030
 here in Uruguay that seals the rivera 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.890
 when I said I said live in the post 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.350
 offensive with diego rivera 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.340
 finally stay there the way it's best for you 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.740
 reader, the important thing to say is that 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.700
 stretch between erechim is our last 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.920
 video 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.740
 no serious problem so far 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.600
 making a came out very well explained 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.280
 not register any legal problem 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.750
 context of the staff who could 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.030
 choose reverse right 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.130
 our idea was to cross the same team 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.170
 Uruguay to cross to the country 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.700
 practically city is along with 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.310
 running free you have a 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.560
 nothing you enter that is a 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.380
 avenue you turn right doing 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.670
 was very funny and while 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.989
 attack continued with good consumption the letter 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.239
 pleasing is in fact that part of the 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.560
 video stayed going to stay is a little loose 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.540
 because then there was no unforeseen 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.760
 nothing new behavior 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.280
 global energy than expected was good 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.540
 It's good, so I'd say the car up to 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.700
 so perfect 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.870
 I think now is preparing to go back 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.230
 to sÃ£o paulo 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.660
 our degree is only to contextualize the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.970
 staff now comes this here vera 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.040
 in uruguay if even curitiba little more 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.440
 1,200 kilometers where I was traveling 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.130
 our idea is to test the 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.290
 only in this displacement do not see how 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.239
 he behaves in this game a problem 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.750
 something that we will stay in 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.430
 minimum 14 hours and a half at direct entrance 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.660
 so it's going to be one more challenge that 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.350
 I make anp 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.090
 the more people stay this stays 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.100
 indication suggestion the city is 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.050
 very cool to really see how 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.120
 I spoke the city is so troubled 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.600
 here in Spanish and Portuguese are mixed 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.970
 on here 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.260
 You never speak a good day, a teacher who 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.750
 I do not know if she's going to answer Spanish. 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.820
 Portuguese, but it's really cool, it's the tip. 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.920
 for those who want to know the Uruguayan valley 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.920
 The trip just waits for the road to enter.
