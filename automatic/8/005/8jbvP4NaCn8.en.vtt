00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hi guys, I'm finally going to record 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.630
 abu kishk the tag you wanted to know 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.610
 I hear that now finally I 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.429
 I decided to record it, I'll let you know. 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.770
 that I do not hear practically anything 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.439
 current my cell playlist 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.869
 she's practically the whole 80's 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.859
 70 back then kind of music 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.140
 giving 50 years 60 most of them 90% of them 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.260
 I'm already telling you not to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.239
 scared because it will not fall much 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.480
 thing not to fall if something 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.620
 but it is very rare it is difficult to place 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.690
 here at random to say that I saw this 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.070
 tag the first time in the office of 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 they were themselves 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.030
 translated to leave the link here 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.770
 underneath I laughed a lot of that video of them 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.789
 My goodness, we are the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.680
 probability of only falling 2008 that I hope 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:09.540
 which I do not expect will not fall because 90% 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:16.850
 on cell phone r 12 first obviously fell 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.850

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.500

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.340
 I'm going to put this book by this 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:58.100

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.100

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:22.710

 in the beattles' career the last song 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:31.320
 the tag and look how cute people are 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.090
 First of all, I 'm sorry, because I 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.800
 I hear practically nothing that you 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.040
 currently listening 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.230
 You like animals, a kiss to 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.380
 You listen to 80's songs. 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.150
 70 also a kiss for you but no 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.310
 I have musical prejudice with anyone. 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.710
 He did not respect or listen to the backcountry 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.320
 not me 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.180
 but that 's what I really enjoyed doing the tag 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.100
 even with your foot behind you 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.500
 do not know in a song that I 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.210
 I fell on my cell phone but I stayed 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.040
 super happy, I hope you have 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.380
 I liked it a lot and had fun 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.020
 God damn funny spectacles. 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.280
