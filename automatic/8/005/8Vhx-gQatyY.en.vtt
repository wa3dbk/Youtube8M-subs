replace Obamacare which we think is a
job<00:03:46.709> killer<00:03:46.950> we<00:03:47.190> think<00:03:47.340> it's<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.519> to

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
job killer we think it's going to

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.580 
job killer we think it's going to
increase<00:03:47.970> health<00:03:48.209> care<00:03:48.420> costs<00:03:48.660> blow<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.320> hole

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
increase health care costs blow a hole

increase health care costs blow a hole
in<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.829> deficit<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.790> creating<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.180> new

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
in the deficit it's creating a new

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.569 
in the deficit it's creating a new
entitlement<00:03:51.600> that's<00:03:51.959> not<00:03:52.140> paid<00:03:52.350> for<00:03:52.650> we<00:03:53.310> think

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
entitlement that's not paid for we think

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.009 
entitlement that's not paid for we think
we<00:03:53.700> can<00:03:53.730> replace<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.329> with<00:03:54.450> consumer-directed

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
we can replace it with consumer-directed

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.810 
we can replace it with consumer-directed
patient-centered<00:03:55.829> health<00:03:55.890> care<00:03:56.190> which<00:03:56.670> hits
