00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
yeah you can detach and it looks really

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.820 
yeah you can detach and it looks really
fine<00:04:59.760> on<00:04:59.910> the<00:04:59.970> back<00:05:00.150> so<00:05:00.480> I<00:05:00.510> do<00:05:01.020> suggest<00:05:01.290> you<00:05:01.620> put

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
fine on the back so I do suggest you put

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.990 
fine on the back so I do suggest you put
this<00:05:01.980> on<00:05:03.200> and<00:05:05.840> what<00:05:06.840> he<00:05:07.020> comes<00:05:07.260> with<00:05:07.500> is<00:05:08.000> the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
this on and what he comes with is the

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.810 
this on and what he comes with is the
assault<00:05:09.450> rifle<00:05:09.900> which<00:05:10.290> was<00:05:10.530> another<00:05:10.950> gun<00:05:11.460> that

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
assault rifle which was another gun that

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.390 
assault rifle which was another gun that
many<00:05:12.060> people<00:05:12.450> wanted<00:05:13.130> because<00:05:14.130> they<00:05:14.340> were

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
many people wanted because they were

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.230 
many people wanted because they were
lacking<00:05:14.910> and<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.570> was<00:05:15.750> kind<00:05:15.990> of<00:05:16.050> like<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.380> halo

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
lacking and it was kind of like the halo

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.860 
lacking and it was kind of like the halo
iconic<00:05:18.240> weapon<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:21.060> detail<00:05:21.390> on<00:05:21.420> is<00:05:21.660> pretty

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
iconic weapon the detail on is pretty

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.430 
iconic weapon the detail on is pretty
good<00:05:22.080> it's<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.620> is<00:05:22.890> missing<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.520> back<00:05:24.440> but

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
good it's it is missing the back but

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.740 
good it's it is missing the back but
they<00:05:25.860> cut<00:05:26.100> it<00:05:26.250> out<00:05:26.370> because<00:05:26.670> that's<00:05:27.570> the<00:05:27.720> only

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
they cut it out because that's the only

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.770 
they cut it out because that's the only
way<00:05:27.990> of<00:05:28.350> minifig<00:05:28.800> hold<00:05:29.250> it<00:05:29.400> or<00:05:30.330> else<00:05:30.480> it<00:05:30.660> would

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
way of minifig hold it or else it would

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.860 
way of minifig hold it or else it would
look<00:05:30.930> really<00:05:31.170> awkward<00:05:31.850> um<00:05:34.760> overall<00:05:35.760> I<00:05:36.150> think

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
look really awkward um overall I think

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.010 
look really awkward um overall I think
this<00:05:37.200> oh<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.830> i<00:05:38.760> don't<00:05:39.210> have<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.510> chart<00:05:39.780> with

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
this oh and i don't have the chart with

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.920 
this oh and i don't have the chart with
me<00:05:40.230> but<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.280> is<00:05:41.400> essentially<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.150> same<00:05:42.270> as<00:05:42.510> the

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
me but it is essentially the same as the

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.130 
me but it is essentially the same as the
goshawk<00:05:43.670> or<00:05:44.670> the<00:05:45.090> gauss<00:05:45.270> one<00:05:45.570> that<00:05:45.900> you<00:05:45.990> get

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
goshawk or the gauss one that you get

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.030 
goshawk or the gauss one that you get
from<00:05:46.760> from<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:48.270> rate<00:05:48.450> set<00:05:48.780> except<00:05:49.440> it's<00:05:49.710> not<00:05:49.890> a

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
from from the rate set except it's not a

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.790 
from from the rate set except it's not a
GOST<00:05:50.460> er<00:05:50.760> it's<00:05:51.090> a<00:05:51.300> turret<00:05:51.870> from<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.290> first

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
GOST er it's a turret from the first

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.050 
GOST er it's a turret from the first

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
warthog my machine gun turret and got a

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.090 
warthog my machine gun turret and got a
green<00:05:57.480> base<00:05:57.750> instead<00:05:58.140> of<00:05:58.200> it<00:05:58.410> yet<00:05:58.530> a<00:05:58.650> white<00:05:58.920> one

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
green base instead of it yet a white one

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.220 
green base instead of it yet a white one
and<00:05:59.640> it's<00:06:00.030> but<00:06:00.450> it<00:06:00.570> still<00:06:00.750> has<00:06:00.900> the<00:06:01.020> same

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
and it's but it still has the same

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
and it's but it still has the same
mechanism<00:06:01.860> off<00:06:02.040> the<00:06:02.310> stand<00:06:02.900> right<00:06:03.900> here<00:06:04.250> which

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
mechanism off the stand right here which

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.040 
mechanism off the stand right here which
seems<00:06:05.640> to<00:06:05.850> appear<00:06:06.120> more<00:06:06.300> and<00:06:06.450> more<00:06:06.600> often<00:06:06.780> than

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
seems to appear more and more often than

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.500 
seems to appear more and more often than
replacing<00:06:07.410> the<00:06:07.620> old<00:06:07.830> one<00:06:08.070> which<00:06:08.250> was<00:06:08.510> really

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
replacing the old one which was really

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:15.950 
replacing the old one which was really
easy<00:06:09.750> to<00:06:09.930> fall<00:06:10.170> off<00:06:11.090> so<00:06:12.170> this<00:06:13.170> scent<00:06:14.540> was<00:06:15.540> for

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
easy to fall off so this scent was for

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.130 
easy to fall off so this scent was for
about<00:06:16.290> twelve<00:06:16.650> dollars<00:06:17.040> as<00:06:17.750> much<00:06:18.750> as<00:06:18.930> the

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
about twelve dollars as much as the

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.040 
about twelve dollars as much as the
ghost<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:20.100> the<00:06:20.190> upcoming<00:06:20.760> war<00:06:21.090> Mongoose

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
ghost and the upcoming war Mongoose

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.400 
ghost and the upcoming war Mongoose
which<00:06:22.350> all<00:06:22.530> get<00:06:22.770> in<00:06:22.860> a<00:06:22.890> bit<00:06:23.070> I<00:06:24.140> say<00:06:25.140> you<00:06:25.200> should

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
which all get in a bit I say you should

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.680 
which all get in a bit I say you should
buy<00:06:25.440> it<00:06:25.560> the<00:06:25.860> brute<00:06:26.520> chopper<00:06:27.030> is<00:06:27.150> a<00:06:27.180> really

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
buy it the brute chopper is a really

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.350 
buy it the brute chopper is a really
good<00:06:27.870> looking<00:06:28.380> vehicle<00:06:29.150> compared<00:06:30.150> to<00:06:30.270> the

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
good looking vehicle compared to the

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.000 
good looking vehicle compared to the
other<00:06:30.480> ones<00:06:30.570> could<00:06:30.900> fit<00:06:31.260> like<00:06:31.440> the<00:06:31.680> first

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
other ones could fit like the first

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.280 
other ones could fit like the first
ghost<00:06:32.340> I<00:06:32.760> thought<00:06:33.240> it<00:06:33.390> was<00:06:33.450> really<00:06:33.630> ugly<00:06:33.870> so<00:06:34.260> I

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:34.290 
ghost I thought it was really ugly so I

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.130 
ghost I thought it was really ugly so I
didn't<00:06:34.530> buy<00:06:34.680> it<00:06:34.850> so<00:06:35.850> i<00:06:36.120> got<00:06:36.419> the<00:06:36.600> Arctic<00:06:36.960> hog

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
didn't buy it so i got the Arctic hog

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.879 
didn't buy it so i got the Arctic hog
and<00:06:37.470> that<00:06:37.740> goes<00:06:37.950> that<00:06:38.250> so

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
and that goes that so

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.499 
and that goes that so
I<00:06:39.009> didn't<00:06:39.729> really<00:06:39.849> care<00:06:39.969> about<00:06:40.210> the<00:06:40.389> garage

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:40.509 
I didn't really care about the garage

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.260 
I didn't really care about the garage
minifigs<00:06:41.169> so<00:06:41.560> I<00:06:41.800> got<00:06:42.099> that<00:06:42.129> and<00:06:42.520> the<00:06:42.879> new<00:06:42.999> Ghost

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
is very more sleek and more advanced

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.450

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
looking so these things actually look

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.529 
looking so these things actually look
very<00:06:51.669> a<00:06:51.909> lot<00:06:52.240> better<00:06:52.810> and<00:06:53.460> I<00:06:54.460> d<00:06:54.909> suggest<00:06:55.419> you

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.219 
very a lot better and I d suggest you
buy<00:06:55.749> this<00:06:55.810> because<00:06:56.379> if<00:06:57.370> you<00:06:57.909> are<00:06:58.509> not<00:06:58.900> allowed

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
Wraith having a set something this small

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.860 
Wraith having a set something this small
would<00:07:05.650> be<00:07:05.800> good<00:07:05.949> enough<00:07:06.099> for<00:07:06.460> a<00:07:07.389> lot<00:07:07.719> of<00:07:07.749> people
