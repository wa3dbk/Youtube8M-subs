00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.080
 accompaniment or even as a dish 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:18.630
 main with a salad for this we 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:23.300
 we will need habilitaã ã egg 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.199
 flour of which a yeast tomato 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:33.090
 short, seedless green smell 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:36.120
 olive onion and grated cheese 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.250
 it is very practical and easy to do 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:49.039
 First we have to start talking. 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:52.260
 zucchini on thick grater latein 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.039
 after the grated and extreme fight all 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.109
 to get the water out of her here today prime 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.520
 table is already well dried 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.899
 So we're going to leave for 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.960

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.189
 besides the sequoia 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.500
 important first because otherwise you will 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.040
 give a drink pie will be saved 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.040

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:39.740
 Here we show the onion the tomato 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:43.430
 it is also seedless because the seed 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:49.390
 also gives a lot of water and we do not want to 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.390
 our bobbin our cake hatch 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.140

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.200
 I'm going to put a little olive 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.560

 chili is to taste and a little bit of 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:19.250
 grated cheese and put an egg can be 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:28.160
 slightly to make it easier to 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:37.959
 add it just to stay more 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.959
 easy to add mix 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.270

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:58.340
 then we will add the 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:03:00.739
 yeast is very practical easy to make 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.349
