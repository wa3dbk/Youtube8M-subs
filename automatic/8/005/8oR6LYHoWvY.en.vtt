00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.510 

so<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.210> rate<00:04:55.509> this<00:04:55.629> game<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:56.199> 9<00:04:56.470> out<00:04:56.650> of<00:04:56.680> 5<00:04:56.949> 9<00:04:57.370> out

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
so I rate this game a 9 out of 5 9 out

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.640 
so I rate this game a 9 out of 5 9 out
of<00:04:57.550> 10<00:04:59.639> simply<00:05:00.639> because<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:02.110> graphics<00:05:02.500> could

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
of 10 simply because the graphics could

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.600 
of 10 simply because the graphics could
have<00:05:02.740> been<00:05:02.830> a<00:05:02.860> little<00:05:02.979> bit<00:05:03.159> better<00:05:03.280> they<00:05:03.580> could

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
have been a little bit better they could

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.869 
have been a little bit better they could
have<00:05:03.849> done<00:05:04.830> had<00:05:05.830> some<00:05:06.069> 3d<00:05:06.310> effects<00:05:06.699> on<00:05:06.849> the

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:06.879 
have done had some 3d effects on the

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.589 
have done had some 3d effects on the
character<00:05:07.409> that<00:05:08.409> are<00:05:09.219> in<00:05:09.639> the<00:05:09.759> pc<00:05:10.180> port<00:05:10.419> of<00:05:10.539> the

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
character that are in the pc port of the

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.860

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870
