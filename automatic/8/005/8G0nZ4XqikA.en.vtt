00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
sound

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.469 
sound
first<00:00:53.440> off<00:00:53.680> I'm<00:00:54.039> playing<00:00:54.309> on<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.579> Dylan<00:00:55.269> Les

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479 
first off I'm playing on a Dylan Les

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:57.779 
first off I'm playing on a Dylan Les
Paul<00:00:55.780> into<00:00:56.199> my<00:00:56.350> box<00:00:56.680> valve<00:00:56.979> atronics<00:00:57.339> and

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
Paul into my box valve atronics and

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:04.210 
Paul into my box valve atronics and
fender<00:00:58.180> 15<00:00:58.570> are<00:00:58.750> and<00:00:59.079> here's<00:00:59.559> my<00:00:59.800> clean<00:01:00.129> sound

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:25.640 

Oh

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:02:41.540 

okay

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.490 

so<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.700> detune<00:02:43.090> mode<00:02:43.360> sounds<00:02:43.870> absolutely

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
so the detune mode sounds absolutely

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.979 
so the detune mode sounds absolutely
great<00:02:44.860> even<00:02:45.220> with<00:02:45.370> distortion<00:02:46.090> though<00:02:46.660> I'd

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
great even with distortion though I'd

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.660 
great even with distortion though I'd
make<00:02:47.230> sure<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.470> keep<00:02:47.920> your<00:02:48.069> distortion

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
make sure you keep your distortion

00:02:48.670 --> 00:03:10.860 
make sure you keep your distortion
before<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.450> Harmonist<00:02:49.959> in<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.379> case

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:04:01.150 

you

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.220 

you
