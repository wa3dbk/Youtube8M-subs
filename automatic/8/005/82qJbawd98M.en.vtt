00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.020
 all part of the first visit that you 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.340
 I made Diego when I met him and he told me 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.689
 a bit like the experiences that 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.300
 He had with him prostheses 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.310
 they served as if a lot to grab a 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.500
 glass and take it but I did not see it as 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.180
 no end and he preferred not to use them 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.180
 yes I realized it was that he was a musician 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.820
 he has his room full of posters of his 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.920
 favorite bands and certainly he 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.870
 He said how I want to play guitar 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.480
 so if we are going to develop a 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.290
 prosthesis so that they facilitate me the subject 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.290
 to play guitar 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.940
 and I tell you 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.060
 well the mission of diego was never to have 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.700
 a prosthesis that would act as 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.770
 hand but simply have a 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.730
 tool a piece of design that will 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.960
 allowed to play guitar that could 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.120
 design it the way I wanted to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.760
 your favorite colors according to the 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.680
 music trends that he followed the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.570
 aesthetics of its artists that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.210
 became in a certain way part of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.260
 he will like to use it that does not 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.260
 they were worth using it 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.409
 Y 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:37.100
 or 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.020
 3d printing arrives to revolutionize 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.179
 the ways in which things occur 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.469
 and this was our first step and what 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.390
 we wanted to do through a 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:48.069
 tool that was useful and that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.069
 will improve the quality of life of diego 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.350
 from our starting point 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.710
 generate a platform through the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:00.090
 what are we going to do that technology 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.090
 easy access for people
