to do that so hopefully this video will
help<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.289> out<00:00:31.579> so<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.669> reason<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.030> happens

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
help you out so the reason this happens

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.970 
help you out so the reason this happens
is<00:00:34.040> these<00:00:35.040> are<00:00:35.219> yamaha<00:00:35.670> pivot<00:00:36.120> screws<00:00:36.980> and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
is these are yamaha pivot screws and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.060 
is these are yamaha pivot screws and
let's<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:39.290> make<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> contrast<00:00:40.890> so

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
let's see if I can make the contrast so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.360 
let's see if I can make the contrast so
that<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.309> shows<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:42.829> okay<00:00:43.860> might<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.280> little

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
that it shows up okay might be a little

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.709 
that it shows up okay might be a little
bit<00:00:44.550> hard<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:46.700> these<00:00:47.700> pivot<00:00:48.450> screws

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
bit hard to see but these pivot screws

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.100 
bit hard to see but these pivot screws
have<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:50.100> channel<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.480> side<00:00:52.550> into<00:00:53.550> which<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
have a channel in the side into which a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.970 
have a channel in the side into which a
plastic<00:00:55.789> insert<00:00:56.789> has<00:00:57.180> been<00:00:57.510> put<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.980> this

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
plastic insert has been put and this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.180 
plastic insert has been put and this
plastic<00:00:59.190> insert<00:00:59.760> acts<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> thread<00:01:00.719> Locker

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
plastic insert acts as a thread Locker

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.980 
plastic insert acts as a thread Locker
when<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.340> screwed<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:05.600> is<00:01:06.600> kind<00:01:06.960> of

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
when it's screwed in it is kind of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.440 
when it's screwed in it is kind of
forced<00:01:07.320> into<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.710> threads<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:09.210> hold

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
forced into the threads and will hold

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
forced into the threads and will hold
the<00:01:09.750> screw<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.560> place<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.320> used<00:01:13.950> on

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the screw in place and this is used on

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.810 
the screw in place and this is used on
some<00:01:14.729> yamaha<00:01:15.509> pivot<00:01:15.840> screws<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.439> all<00:01:17.220> yamaha

resistance<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> screw<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> older

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
resistance to the screw on the older

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
resistance to the screw on the older
Yamaha<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.180> screws<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.780> one

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
Yamaha if it screws like this one

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.230 
Yamaha if it screws like this one
without<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.409> head<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.180> be

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
without a head on it that can be

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.050 
without a head on it that can be
disastrous<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.590> work<00:01:35.490> its<00:01:35.670> way<00:01:35.820> way

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
disastrous as it can work its way way

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.510 
disastrous as it can work its way way
too<00:01:36.119> far<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.689> or<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> way<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.189> new

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
too far in or all the way out on the new

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.429 
too far in or all the way out on the new
Yamaha<00:01:39.150> pivot<00:01:39.479> screws<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.869> not<00:01:39.990> quite<00:01:40.259> so

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
Yamaha pivot screws it's not quite so

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.560 
Yamaha pivot screws it's not quite so
bad<00:01:40.490> because<00:01:41.490> usually<00:01:41.700> they<00:01:41.970> set<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
bad because usually they set it so the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.510 
bad because usually they set it so the
screw<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.079> screwed<00:01:43.500> most<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> way<00:01:44.220> in

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
screw is screwed most of the way in

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.630 
screw is screwed most of the way in
anyways<00:01:45.180> all<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> way<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> head<00:01:46.640> but

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
anyways all the way up to the head but

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
anyways all the way up to the head but
it<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.880> still<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.240> real<00:01:48.600> pain<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.110> butt

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
it can still be a real pain in the butt

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.460 
it can still be a real pain in the butt
if<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.799> working<00:01:49.979> correctly<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.350> way

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
if it's not working correctly so the way

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.039 
if it's not working correctly so the way
to<00:01:52.520> fix<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.759> problem<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.570> pivot<00:01:54.810> screws

gap let's see right on the top on this

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.970 
gap let's see right on the top on this
one<00:03:39.329> I've<00:03:39.840> actually<00:03:39.959> already<00:03:40.319> done<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.799> one

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
one I've actually already done that one

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.589 
one I've actually already done that one
and<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:43.310> upper<00:03:44.310> left<00:03:44.699> on<00:03:44.910> this<00:03:45.090> one<00:03:45.269> which

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
and on the upper left on this one which

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.159 
and on the upper left on this one which
I've<00:03:45.750> also<00:03:45.930> already<00:03:46.230> done<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.750> it'll<00:03:48.989> wick

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
I've also already done and it'll wick

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.129 
I've also already done and it'll wick
its<00:03:49.319> way<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.680> there<00:03:49.949> and<00:03:50.099> basically<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.660> screw

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
its way in there and basically the screw

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.170 
its way in there and basically the screw
will<00:03:52.319> still<00:03:52.530> turn<00:03:52.769> after<00:03:53.160> this<00:03:53.609> stuff<00:03:53.849> sets

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
will still turn after this stuff sets

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.789 
will still turn after this stuff sets
but<00:03:54.569> it<00:03:54.750> just<00:03:54.900> takes<00:03:55.079> a<00:03:55.230> little<00:03:55.319> bit<00:03:55.470> more

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
but it just takes a little bit more

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.399 
but it just takes a little bit more
force<00:03:56.220> than<00:03:56.609> it<00:03:56.730> did<00:03:56.849> before<00:03:57.079> which<00:03:58.079> means

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
force than it did before which means

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.899 
force than it did before which means
that<00:03:58.739> while<00:03:58.980> you're<00:03:59.159> playing<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.549> saxophone

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
that while you're playing the saxophone

today so there's a pivot screw right
okay<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:40.920> can<00:04:41.100> see<00:04:41.310> pretty<00:04:41.490> clearly<00:04:41.760> that

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
okay and you can see pretty clearly that

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.300 
okay and you can see pretty clearly that
that's<00:04:42.690> what<00:04:43.680> this<00:04:44.160> is<00:04:45.050> now<00:04:46.110> this<00:04:46.890> curved

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
that's what this is now this curved

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.220 
that's what this is now this curved
surface<00:04:47.430> here<00:04:48.030> is<00:04:48.060> actually<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.720> bearing

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
surface here is actually a bearing

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.690 
surface here is actually a bearing
surface<00:04:49.680> that<00:04:49.890> goes<00:04:50.070> into<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.400> end<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.640> the

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
surface that goes into the end of the

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.270 
surface that goes into the end of the
key<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.480> key<00:04:51.630> rotates<00:04:52.110> around<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.620> so

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
key and the key rotates around it so

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.300 
key and the key rotates around it so
when<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.700> put<00:04:53.940> if<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:55.200> have<00:04:55.530> pivot<00:04:56.040> screws

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
that are loose and you're going to be

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.110 
that are loose and you're going to be
putting<00:04:57.630> any<00:04:57.840> thread<00:04:58.710> Locker<00:04:58.920> on<00:04:59.040> them<00:04:59.310> make

putting any thread Locker on them make

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
putting any thread Locker on them make

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
sure you put only a little tiny bit on

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.550 
sure you put only a little tiny bit on
the<00:05:04.140> head<00:05:05.010> of<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.760> pivot<00:05:06.540> screw<00:05:06.630> back<00:05:07.200> here

the head of the pivot screw back here
not<00:05:08.160> enough<00:05:08.520> so<00:05:08.790> that<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:09.060> will<00:05:09.150> wick<00:05:09.390> its<00:05:09.570> way

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
not enough so that it will wick its way

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.300 
not enough so that it will wick its way
all<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.260> way<00:05:10.290> to<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:10.620> front<00:05:10.890> because<00:05:11.070> the
