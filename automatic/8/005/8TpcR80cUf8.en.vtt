this<00:00:16.770> video<00:00:17.240> now<00:00:18.240> when<00:00:18.480> Scott<00:00:19.850> states<00:00:20.850> that

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
this video now when Scott states that

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.450 
this video now when Scott states that
these<00:00:22.050> fibers<00:00:24.320> get<00:00:25.320> lodged<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.890> between<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
these fibers get lodged in between the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.659 
these fibers get lodged in between the
teeth<00:00:27.470> to<00:00:28.470> me<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.859> seems<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.550> they<00:00:30.029> are

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
teeth to me it seems that they are

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.490 
teeth to me it seems that they are
congregating<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.960> saliva

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.049 

apart<00:00:37.500> from<00:00:37.620> there's<00:00:37.829> been<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> doubly<00:00:38.820> flawed

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
apart from there's been a doubly flawed

test

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.880 
test
I'd<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.329> actually<00:00:42.870> look<00:00:43.200> up<00:00:43.379> wine

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
I'd like you to actually look up wine

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.940 
I'd like you to actually look up wine
production<00:00:44.840> you<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:45.989> know<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.350> when<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
production you do know that when one is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
production you do know that when one is
produced<00:00:47.719> there's<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.840> certain<00:00:49.110> amount<00:00:49.170> of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
produced there's a certain amount of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.650 
produced there's a certain amount of
residue<00:00:49.860> within<00:00:50.550> left<00:00:50.969> within<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.329> bottle

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
residue within left within that bottle

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.959 
residue within left within that bottle
and<00:00:52.079> most<00:00:52.530> manufactures<00:00:53.160> reluctant<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
and most manufactures reluctant to

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
and most manufactures reluctant to
remove<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:55.170> residue<00:00:55.320> because<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.190> removes

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
remove the residue because it removes

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.939 
remove the residue because it removes
part<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.969> taste<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.559> as<00:00:58.559> much<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.739> possible

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
part of the taste so as much as possible

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.590 
part of the taste so as much as possible
is<00:00:59.280> left<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> bottle<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:02.030> this<00:01:03.030> consists

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
is left in the bottle and this consists

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.899 
is left in the bottle and this consists
of<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:04.549> grape<00:01:05.549> skins<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:07.380> yeast<00:01:07.590> cells

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
of like grape skins that yeast cells

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.270 
of like grape skins that yeast cells
and<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.659> fines<00:01:09.960> used<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.649> actually<00:01:10.770> clear<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and the fines used to actually clear the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.209 
and the fines used to actually clear the
wine<00:01:12.259> they<00:01:13.259> are<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.530> essence

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
wine they are in essence

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.090 
wine they are in essence
well<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.329> grape<00:01:15.810> skins<00:01:16.469> are<00:01:16.710> are<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:16.979> in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
well the grape skins are are are in

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.389 
well the grape skins are are are in
essence<00:01:17.960> fibers<00:01:18.960> wonder<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.890> would<00:01:20.130> like

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
essence fibers wonder we would like

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.609 
essence fibers wonder we would like
fibers<00:01:20.820> under<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> microscope<00:01:24.259> but<00:01:25.259> yeah<00:01:25.470> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
fibers under a microscope but yeah you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.410 
fibers under a microscope but yeah you
will<00:01:25.740> always<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:26.039> this<00:01:26.220> ver<00:01:26.700> energy<00:01:27.060> within

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
will always get this ver energy within

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.950 
will always get this ver energy within
the<00:01:27.840> wine<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.429> fact<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.780> more

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the wine and the fact that more and more

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.429 
the wine and the fact that more and more
seems<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.649> appear<00:01:32.130> as<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:33.720> go<00:01:33.899> on<00:01:33.929> in<00:01:34.170> within

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
seems to appear as you go on in within

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.700 
seems to appear as you go on in within
the<00:01:34.619> test<00:01:34.890> seems<00:01:35.850> obvious<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.329> me<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.630> well<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the test seems obvious to me as well the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.800 
the test seems obvious to me as well the
first<00:01:37.950> glass<00:01:38.189> huge<00:01:38.429> pink<00:01:38.640> will<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.539> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
first glass huge pink will have the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.440 
first glass huge pink will have the
least<00:01:39.990> amount<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.490> last<00:01:41.729> class<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.090> have

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
least amount the last class you have

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.980 
least amount the last class you have
actually<00:01:43.020> dreamed<00:01:43.259> would<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.729> most

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
actually dreamed would have the most

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.149 
actually dreamed would have the most
that's<00:01:45.990> because<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.439> residue<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.069> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
that's because the residue is in the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.839 
that's because the residue is in the
bottom<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> bottles<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:49.459> to<00:01:50.459> suggest

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
bottom of the bottles and to suggest

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.469 
bottom of the bottles and to suggest
that<00:01:51.030> most<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.140> fibrous<00:01:53.099> material<00:01:53.580> is

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
that most of this fibrous material is

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.370 
that most of this fibrous material is
collecting<00:01:55.020> within<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.349> slider<00:01:55.619> again<00:01:57.380> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
collecting within the slider again the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.559 
collecting within the slider again the
reason<00:01:58.679> is<00:01:58.770> simply<00:01:59.310> enough<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.970> just<00:02:00.209> swirl

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
reason is simply enough you just swirl

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.410 
reason is simply enough you just swirl
Guillen<00:02:00.899> life<00:02:01.110> around<00:02:01.880> with<00:02:02.880> bread<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.299> wine

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.720 

and<00:02:12.220> what<00:02:13.220> happens<00:02:13.640> here<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:15.550> I've<00:02:16.550> actually

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and what happens here is I've actually

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.820 
and what happens here is I've actually
done<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.920> several<00:02:18.920> times<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:21.140> actually

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
done it several times to actually

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.750 
done it several times to actually
demonstrate<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:23.980> one<00:02:24.980> tends<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.520> get<00:02:25.700> more

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
demonstrate that one tends to get more

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.320 
demonstrate that one tends to get more
as<00:02:27.010> one<00:02:28.010> goes<00:02:28.310> on<00:02:29.350> but<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.560> suggestion<00:02:31.330> has

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
as one goes on but the suggestion has

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.620 
as one goes on but the suggestion has
basically<00:02:33.050> been<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.850> there<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
basically been that there is a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.350 
basically been that there is a
relationship<00:02:36.470> between<00:02:36.980> these<00:02:37.459> particles

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
relationship between these particles

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.660 
relationship between these particles
coming<00:02:38.720> into<00:02:39.020> our<00:02:39.350> bodies<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:42.430> acting<00:02:43.430> as

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
coming into our bodies and acting as

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.500 
coming into our bodies and acting as

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
system might have been made but that's
