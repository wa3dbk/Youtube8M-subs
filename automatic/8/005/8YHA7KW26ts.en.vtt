you keep repeat offending on this I

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.770 
you keep repeat offending on this I
would<00:05:08.520> assume<00:05:08.850> that<00:05:08.910> they<00:05:09.270> would<00:05:09.479> put<00:05:09.660> your

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
would assume that they would put your

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.560 
would assume that they would put your
premium<00:05:10.320> up<00:05:10.729> but<00:05:11.729> it<00:05:11.850> sounds<00:05:12.180> like<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.300> really

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
premium up but it sounds like a really

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.710 
premium up but it sounds like a really
good<00:05:12.750> idea<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:13.199> should<00:05:13.470> encourage<00:05:14.720> the

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
good idea and should encourage the

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.990 
good idea and should encourage the
younger<00:05:16.080> driver<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:16.590> drive<00:05:16.800> more<00:05:17.280> safely<00:05:17.580> so

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
younger driver to drive more safely so

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.029 
younger driver to drive more safely so
good<00:05:18.360> technology<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.080> think<00:05:19.320> it's<00:05:19.410> a<00:05:19.500> really

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
good technology I think it's a really

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.370 
good technology I think it's a really
really<00:05:20.370> worthwhile<00:05:20.639> and<00:05:21.259> something<00:05:22.259> else

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
really worthwhile and something else

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.070 
really worthwhile and something else
with<00:05:22.830> regards<00:05:23.220> to<00:05:23.280> safety<00:05:23.580> in<00:05:24.000> cars<00:05:24.270> that

with regards to safety in cars that

with regards to safety in cars that
we're<00:05:25.229> definitely<00:05:25.470> going<00:05:25.919> to<00:05:26.009> look<00:05:26.280> at<00:05:26.490> having
