00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 m 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.430
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.060
 do a little video in french 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.910
 was a long time 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.350
 so this video is on google our them 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.390
 features that can be found 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.440
 so we already have some cards that 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.060
 appear here in relation to 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.200
 research that I did today by 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.910
 report to the weather this poster 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 automatically but also with respect to 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.520
 places I would have searched for more 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.739
 today so by clicking on a 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.180
 ship we have other cards that can 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.690
 work if I search for example 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.340
 places for the plane the weather the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.110
 public transport the flights the 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.910
 different sports the next appointment 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.010
 you translation the currencies the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.120
 hours in my country and it's finally 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.710
 that's not what will interest me 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.220
 today not too much cards but 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.400
 more then looking at level 6 at 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.800
 level 2 research pl not the 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.230
 okay so for research actually 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.770
 there are a lot of things that start to 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.530
 work the most it's the shipments of 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.190
 call sms to the people the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.970
 2.2 searches place and also the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.320
 navigation 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.810
 so I 'm going to do some small 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.020
 demonstrations so these parties have 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.370
 started by calling at a place called 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.370
 Paris city hall 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.120
 so here I hope so and the phone is going 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.080
 we see here the loading time so 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.160
 he may be right now I 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.010
 found he'll call all 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:45.890
 automatically the mayor of paris 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:46.940
 it's gone to put in a corner this 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.860
 just called the mayor of paris 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.270
 so it works very fascinating we can 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.600
 also send sms so for example 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.550
 here I'm going to send a message to 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.550
 mary nantes objects found 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.360
 so that's why we already have some 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.340
 that I was registering town hall nanteau 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.130
 I found normal to send directly 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.200
 messages to 7 at this address there we go 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.000
 test sent a message afterwards 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.690
 so we will do it 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.050
 sent a message to city hall 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.360
 nantes 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.990
 found objects hello how are you 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.380
 you but here I give it to you in time 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:27.880
 too much so the caravel word and its 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.840
 sent a message to mary nantes 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.000
 found objects 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.250
 how are you today go out 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.770
 you tonight so you have to put 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.760
 exactly the name of the person we 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.150
 will call how are you 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.860
 today 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.150
 so that 's not quite 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.610
 to work on Toulouse is maybe 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.230
 a little foot accent that came out 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.050
 so that's for sending sms 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:53.890
 we will also have the costs 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:55.090
 music listened vivo father lei has so by 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.840
 example there he will find the music 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.340
 automatically 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.080
 so that's what I have on my phone 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.000
 I have little in this one I downloaded 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.860
 pontins so the one proposes to continue 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.180
 with my different apps that 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.540
 I already have or with youtube 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.040
 so yeah but it's the only time so 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.590
 he finds in my in my list of 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.049
 music the music I have so that 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.120
 walk very easily for example we're going 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:21.310
 can also search for places so 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.680
 for example fr address bar paris so I 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.330
 looking for a bar in paris for example 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.100
 go out but if we are a search 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.209
 actually it does not work yet 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.280
 really but otherwise looking 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.630
 landed in paris so if not research 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.010
 all their research from the 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.820
 voice search works very very well 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.239
 we will go where relocations 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.640
 is the louvre in paris question to 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.870
 manal that one can ask oneself when one 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.850
 happened no it was heavy that I was a 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.220
 little like answer 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.220
 where is the louvre museum in paris 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.280
 yeah but that was not quite it 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.170
 no more ah yes it was something else 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.640
 what to say in fact it must be said where 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.400
 is located the louvre museum in east paris 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.780
 very important so there we get 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.570
 directly the address of the louvre museum 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.700
 in Paris so we have our hunter 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.530
 directly we can open a 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.840
 map for to go if not someone 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.510
 go straight to google maps ok 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.890
 left that we can also search by 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.380
 example to something else where is the stadium 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.910
 Velodrome 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.930
 I know but it's more a smile will make 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.669
 a few so we get directly 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.700
 the location of the velodrome stadium on 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:37.560
 can also do something else so by 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.460
 example go to the eiffel tower walk 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.410
 from where I am it's going to be a little 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.180
 not difficult we will say but it works 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.790
 when he recorded all things 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.110
 it was not going to the Eiffel Tower in 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.950
 foot so we mark go after andy 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.419
 where we want to go 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.470
 and what mode of transport so by 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.950
 example walk there he will make me 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.660
 search 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.180
 he'll even open normally all by himself 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.010
 but navigation so I will accept 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.520
 display allows location ok so 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:09.130
 wallace is gps we come back and there he goes 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.830
 to open my own voice assistant 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.930
 vignonet so here from my 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.160
 destination position to go to 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.960
 there the number of crimes is the stop 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.600
 everything so he does this to me automatically 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.540
 so that's something is mans 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.550
 2-2 very very simple very functional and 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.740
 very fast so it really works really 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.190
 alright so I just wanted to show these 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.990
 little things 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.700
 I hope this little video goes where 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.229
 you enjoyed I would have perhaps these 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.000
 four islands map how does it work etc 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.770
