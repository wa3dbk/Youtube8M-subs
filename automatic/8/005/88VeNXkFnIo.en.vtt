will<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:40.979> too<00:01:41.100> much<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.700> I'm<00:01:41.759> just

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
will be too much for this so I'm just

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.980 
will be too much for this so I'm just
gonna<00:01:41.939> add<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.150> little<00:01:42.180> bit<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.479> soft<00:01:42.720> light

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
gonna add a little bit of soft light

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.319 
gonna add a little bit of soft light
that<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:43.979> gives<00:01:44.159> us<00:01:44.310> some<00:01:44.490> nice<00:01:44.670> intensity

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
that just gives us some nice intensity

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.539 
that just gives us some nice intensity
here<00:01:45.570> flatten<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.590> layer<00:01:46.860> down<00:01:47.009> again<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
here flatten that layer down again in a

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.010 
here flatten that layer down again in a
buck<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.939> Dodge<00:01:48.090> tool<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.630> bring

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
buck to the Dodge tool and just bring

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.899 
buck to the Dodge tool and just bring
back<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.560> bit<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.799> green<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.759> use

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
back a little bit of green you know use

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.030 
back a little bit of green you know use
a<00:01:53.939> fairly<00:01:54.360> large<00:01:54.540> tools<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.350> don't<00:01:55.619> got<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
a fairly large tools here I don't got to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.709 
a fairly large tools here I don't got to
specific<00:01:56.520> onto<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:56.880> images<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.299> let<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.450> needs

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
specific onto my images and let it needs

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.319 
specific onto my images and let it needs
working<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.290> individually

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329

okay<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.479> little<00:02:03.689> bit<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.930> burn<00:02:04.110> tool<00:02:05.000> it's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
okay a little bit of a burn tool it's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.100 
okay a little bit of a burn tool it's
just<00:02:06.210> tighten<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.810> sky<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> little<00:02:07.350> bit

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:24.210 

and<00:02:15.310> go<00:02:16.310> back<00:02:16.490> into<00:02:16.880> color<00:02:17.630> FX<00:02:18.020> pro

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.010 

shots<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.450> where<00:02:25.660> there's<00:02:25.690> lots<00:02:25.840> of

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
shots like this where there's lots of

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.530 
shots like this where there's lots of
sky<00:02:26.320> and<00:02:26.470> lots<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.710> tree<00:02:26.920> area<00:02:27.160> really<00:02:28.090> benefit

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
sky and lots of tree area really benefit

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.990 
sky and lots of tree area really benefit
from<00:02:28.570> tunnel<00:02:29.470> contrast<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.580> I'm<00:02:30.700> going<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:30.880> go

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
from tunnel contrast so I'm going to go

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.320 
from tunnel contrast so I'm going to go
into<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.300> again<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:33.520> see<00:02:33.760> how<00:02:33.820> it<00:02:33.910> picks<00:02:34.060> out

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
into that again you see how it picks out

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.940 
into that again you see how it picks out
all<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.690> details<00:02:34.840> here<00:02:35.230> not<00:02:35.500> too<00:02:35.770> much

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
all the details here not too much

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.140 
all the details here not too much
because<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.400> can<00:02:36.580> work<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:36.850> it<00:02:36.970> too<00:02:37.120> much

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
because it you can work on it too much

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.340 
because it you can work on it too much
and<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:39.580> using<00:02:40.060> our<00:02:40.180> sliders<00:02:40.660> up<00:02:40.780> here<00:02:40.990> we<00:02:41.200> can

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
and we using our sliders up here we can

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.920 
and we using our sliders up here we can
control<00:02:41.800> how<00:02:42.670> much<00:02:42.730> mid-tones<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.570> have<00:02:43.750> much

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
control how much mid-tones and have much

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.600 
control how much mid-tones and have much
shadow<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.290> contrast<00:02:44.710> we<00:02:44.860> put<00:02:45.040> back<00:02:45.220> in<00:02:45.400> and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
shadow of contrast we put back in and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.610 
shadow of contrast we put back in and
again<00:02:45.820> saturation

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.770 

okay<00:02:52.620> so<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.100> use<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.550> highlight<00:02:53.970> contrast

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
okay so we use that highlight contrast

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.000 
okay so we use that highlight contrast
there<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.110> bring<00:02:55.260> back<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.590> dress<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> little

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
there to bring back to dress a little

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.480 
there to bring back to dress a little
bit<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.720> selectively<00:02:58.370> highlight<00:02:59.370> this

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
bit you can selectively highlight this

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.980 
bit you can selectively highlight this
area<00:02:59.910> just<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.150> bring<00:03:00.300> back<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.630> dress<00:03:00.810> and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
area just to bring back the dress and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.650 
area just to bring back the dress and
nothing<00:03:01.260> else<00:03:01.670> so<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.700> push<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.090> back<00:03:03.300> down<00:03:03.480> we

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
nothing else so I push that back down we

to go a touch into the face she has got

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.620 
to go a touch into the face she has got
a<00:04:32.900> false<00:04:33.110> town<00:04:33.350> on<00:04:33.500> here<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:34.430> girl<00:04:34.669> so<00:04:35.120> I'm<00:04:35.389> not

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
a false town on here the girl so I'm not

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.850 
a false town on here the girl so I'm not
going<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.840> try<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.050> clean<00:04:36.350> that<00:04:36.380> up<00:04:36.560> and

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
going to try and clean that up and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.140 
going to try and clean that up and
although<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.160> does<00:04:37.280> look<00:04:37.430> quite<00:04:37.580> bloody<00:04:37.850> so

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
although it does look quite bloody so

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.760 
although it does look quite bloody so
for<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.419> if<00:04:38.720> she<00:04:38.870> was<00:04:38.990> larger<00:04:39.350> in<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.530> frame

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
for you if she was larger in the frame

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.830 
for you if she was larger in the frame
and<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:39.979> probably<00:04:40.160> would<00:04:40.460> do<00:04:40.669> if<00:04:41.570> we<00:04:41.720> just

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
and I probably would do if we just

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.330 
and I probably would do if we just
people<00:04:42.139> getting<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.440> layer<00:04:42.650> again<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.160> go<00:04:43.280> to

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
people getting a layer again and go to

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.750 
people getting a layer again and go to
our<00:04:43.490> patch<00:04:43.850> tool<00:04:45.039> okay<00:04:46.039> we<00:04:46.190> can<00:04:46.370> grab<00:04:46.610> all

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.839 

just<00:04:56.680> spend<00:04:56.919> a<00:04:57.039> few<00:04:57.250> seconds<00:04:57.639> cleaning<00:04:58.120> it<00:04:58.240> up

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.760 

you<00:05:04.419> can<00:05:04.539> see<00:05:04.689> if<00:05:04.779> we<00:05:04.839> go<00:05:04.959> back<00:05:05.169> to<00:05:05.229> our<00:05:05.379> layers

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770
