00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.830
 the cameras are already so in all 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.530
 only go places itself in this market nera 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.139
 has sold more than 10 million units 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.199
 the action cameras are small light 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.180
 resistant to water and impact or 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.359
 perfect for recording extreme sports 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.279
 and also less radical things like you 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.920
 swimming in the pool during their 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.430
 vacation for example but with them is 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.430
 Better to find out we need 4 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.610
 we entered into three situations ever 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.950
 full hd and at 60 frames per second 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.290
 first a kate race to see 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.899
 as each camera leaves scenes of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.120
 speed to evaluate the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.579
 performance and underwater recording 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.680
 inside a swimming pool and we also 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.590
 a submerged scenario within a 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.559
 tub by tim we caught a scene 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.320
 little night light and often the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.559
 weak point of the cameras of our 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 first camera is go pro rio four of the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.580
 f10 is an act at the top of the gopro line and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.119
 ultra low resolution gb 4 car but 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.009
 only 30 frames per second, which is 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.409
 little for action scenes with 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.729
 movements, the image tends to 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.340
 lose sharpness 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.369
 so it is way better than the sea in fury 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.020
 because there the camera reaches 120 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.049
 West cadres 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.270
 the picture quality was excellent 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.180
 both in the speed test and in the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.600
 test submerged in the night scene 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.439
 the camera was ok it did not stand out but 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.439
 also did not compromise 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.470
 our next camera is sony fbr x 1000 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.040
 v 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.250
 she also has ultra hd resolution movie but 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.490
 also limited to 30 frames per second 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.130
 which is slow in full hd mode 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.149
 she shoots 120 frames per second which 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.130
 it's very good 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.860
 the camera had difficulty locating 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.500
 objects under water and the test of 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.459
 your microphone has picked up a lot 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.459
 wind noise 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.530
 on the other hand the night performance was 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.110
 better than gopro and the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.209
 impressive image stabilization 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.580
 it seemed that the cat was walking a 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.340
 pool table a neighbor 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.420
 the senator also broadcasts live by 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.489
 Internet 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.549
 your application ilczyszyn what is well 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.549
 cool 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:45.019
 Our next camera is go pro rio. 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.390
 I created silver 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.129
 it is the previous generation of gopro and 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.260
 is still on the market 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.480
 the main disadvantage is that it does not 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.760
 4k movie resolution 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.709
 But as we just said that 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.379
 not a problem since even the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.159
 Top cameras still do not record well in this 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.400
 resolution 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.310
 recording at full HD the reduction was 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.340
 excellent quality with practically 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.840
 identical to the top-of-the-line model with a 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.510
 big difference 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.720
 it costs less than half the price of 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:26.659
 other gopro and hard battery break 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:29.420
 well the oregon acc camera is very 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:32.269
 cheaper and much more modest than 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.099
 the other would not be fair to require it 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.530
 same image quality 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.319
 she was included in the test and has a 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.109
 very interesting novelty is the only one with 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.870
 two patients are facing forward and 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.690
 another turn back in the race of 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.139
 katso the image quality looks good 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.980
 acceptable in the night test and under 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.310
 Water 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.459
 no longer the concept of two lenses is 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.419
 very cool could be explored in the 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.419
 tail is better 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.310
 adding the pros and cons of each camera 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.150
 go pro rio three silver is the best 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.940
 option 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.310
 it does not record on another hd but this 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.840
 currently no top-of-the-line models 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.690
 make the right 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.620
 the ideal nowadays still filming in 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.050
 1080p full hd and in that the river pedrense 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.660
 Silva goes very well has the same 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.630
 most expensive sister image quality 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.480
 which costs less than half the price 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.790
 so it is the best option if it were 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.290
 With my money, I would buy it. 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.290
 hugs and see you next month
