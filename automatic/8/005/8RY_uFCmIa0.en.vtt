00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
would be a little bit longer now this is

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.629 
would be a little bit longer now this is
a<00:03:10.939> speed<00:03:11.510> up<00:03:11.659> double<00:03:12.049> effect<00:03:12.409> now<00:03:13.400> what<00:03:13.609> you

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
a speed up double effect now what you

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.939 
a speed up double effect now what you
would<00:03:13.879> do<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.780> would<00:03:14.900> either<00:03:15.109> right<00:03:15.469> click<00:03:15.500> on

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:15.949 
would do you would either right click on

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.819 
would do you would either right click on
your<00:03:16.069> clip<00:03:16.609> go<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.120> video<00:03:17.359> effects<00:03:17.829> whenever

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
your clip go to video effects whenever

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.309 
your clip go to video effects whenever
the<00:03:19.099> window<00:03:19.310> pops<00:03:19.549> up<00:03:19.730> scroll<00:03:20.510> down<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.719> speed

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
the window pops up scroll down to speed

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.099 
the window pops up scroll down to speed
up<00:03:21.409> double<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:21.889> click<00:03:22.849> add<00:03:23.000> four<00:03:23.479> times<00:03:23.720> or

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
up double and click add four times or

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.710 
up double and click add four times or
you<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.739> drag<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.099> click<00:03:25.669> and<00:03:25.819> drag<00:03:26.000> four

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
you can drag it click and drag four

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.710 
you can drag it click and drag four
times<00:03:26.979> this<00:03:27.979> would<00:03:28.699> increase<00:03:28.939> the<00:03:29.030> frame<00:03:29.449> rate

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
times this would increase the frame rate

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.460 
times this would increase the frame rate
up<00:03:29.989> four<00:03:30.889> times<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.340> mine<00:03:31.519> will<00:03:31.639> be<00:03:32.349> 120<00:03:33.349> frames

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
up four times so mine will be 120 frames

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.920 
up four times so mine will be 120 frames
per<00:03:33.680> second<00:03:34.189> and<00:03:34.310> that's<00:03:35.060> how<00:03:35.599> they<00:03:35.750> get

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
per second and that's how they get

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.020 
per second and that's how they get
didn't<00:03:36.680> like<00:03:37.040> their<00:03:37.189> fast<00:03:37.430> movements<00:03:37.909> and

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
didn't like their fast movements and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.619 
didn't like their fast movements and
stuff<00:03:38.799> guess<00:03:39.799> what<00:03:39.979> people<00:03:40.400> I'm<00:03:40.970> going<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.509> use
