 Speak there youtube gamers here who speaks 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.549
 It is more basic and today we see in 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.410
 It's happening there with dark souls. 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.020
 especially in the new parts is the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.529
 certain buggy and graphics 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.699
 sometimes it will give a magic is the effect of 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.800
 Maggi does not leave 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 I've already gotten a guy to give you a mule or 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.710
 I knew what he was the dark die is 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.219
 so I took this cooperative video that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.620
 I did with the comrade was any 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.870
 side left sign laelson on it and lend 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.890
 Watch this video guys when you loose 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.960
 the fire ball they do not appear then the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.660
 video I have dark world color case 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.510
 did not prove that I did not even know that the guy 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.550
 is in the tenth pitched was the plate 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.210
 It's not immediate, you do not know how to turn it on. 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.460
 works have already begun to get accustomed 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.000
 always wanted to roll in that 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.369
 area though they do not appear and and worst of all 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.650
 monster magic does not appear either 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.540
 So you know he is? 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.750
 by doing something, the master bypassing 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.150
 This is not disturbing me enough. 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.340
 I would like to know if you are 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.990
 The same thing is happening for sure. 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.240
 It must be but it is getting in the way. 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.700
 very much do you think it will be a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.229
 correction if you know of anything I 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.170
 I researched yet solves know that 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.790
 It is my very usual to my home to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.340
 elderly old does not appear 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.080
 she showed up so it's hard to play 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.940
 so the guys would like you 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.520

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.020

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.900
 reminding me that I'm playing on the console 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.240

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.120
 talking about this bug that happened in 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.620
 new and different areas are spells and 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.440
 special effects 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.920
