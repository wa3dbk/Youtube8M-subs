00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
so once I'm finished salting up the body

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.480 
so once I'm finished salting up the body

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
go in with my file and really sharpen up

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:26.730

those<00:01:14.890> edges

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.350 

proper<00:01:27.740> form<00:01:27.950> placement<00:01:28.520> is<00:01:28.610> essential<00:01:29.150> for

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680

the orange peel consistency is where

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.720 
the orange peel consistency is where
it's<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.270> most<00:02:36.569> easily<00:02:37.230> moldable<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.100> easy

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
it's the most easily moldable and easy

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.240 
it's the most easily moldable and easy
to<00:02:38.970> work<00:02:39.120> with<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.200> basically<00:02:40.530> what<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.800> do<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.130> I

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
to work with so basically what I do is I

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.130 
to work with so basically what I do is I
just<00:02:41.280> molded<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.090> show<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.480> cut<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.989> out

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
just molded in to show you cut it out

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.380 
just molded in to show you cut it out
and<00:02:43.440> then<00:02:43.830> brush<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:44.970> don't<00:02:45.209> have

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
and then brush so that you don't have

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.690 
and then brush so that you don't have
any<00:02:45.569> air<00:02:45.780> bubbles<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.350> your<00:02:46.410> white<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.160> then<00:02:47.640> I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
any air bubbles in your white and then I

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:59.480 
any air bubbles in your white and then I
start<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.090> sculpt<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.690> form<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.110> free<00:02:49.350> edge

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:21.940 

you

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.470

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
so after the nail is set take the corm

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.930 
so after the nail is set take the corm
off<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.959> then<00:03:25.560> go<00:03:25.739> into<00:03:25.890> your<00:03:26.010> filing<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.730> is

buffing<00:04:32.400> which<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.729> what<00:04:32.850> I've<00:04:32.970> done<00:04:33.150> here<00:04:33.840> but

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
buffing which is what I've done here but

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.180 
buffing which is what I've done here but
I<00:04:34.050> haven't<00:04:34.289> shown<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:34.949> video

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.890

basically<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.060> start<00:04:36.210> with<00:04:36.389> a<00:04:36.419> low<00:04:36.630> grit

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
basically you start with a low grit

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.450 
basically you start with a low grit
buffer<00:04:37.289> and<00:04:37.560> then<00:04:37.650> you<00:04:37.800> keep<00:04:37.979> working<00:04:38.220> your

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
buffer and then you keep working your

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.279 
buffer and then you keep working your
way<00:04:38.520> up<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.789> a<00:04:38.910> higher<00:04:39.180> grit<00:04:39.479> until<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:39.960> get<00:04:40.110> to

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
way up to a higher grit until you get to

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.110 
way up to a higher grit until you get to
a<00:04:40.320> shine<00:04:40.710> buffer

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
a shine buffer

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.420 
a shine buffer
