00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
strawberry scent we've got a few minutes

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.810 
strawberry scent we've got a few minutes
so<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.530> thought<00:01:13.829> we'd<00:01:14.009> make<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> vanilla<00:01:14.549> cream

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
so I thought we'd make the vanilla cream

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.090 
so I thought we'd make the vanilla cream
so<00:01:15.600> here<00:01:15.780> all<00:01:15.930> I've<00:01:16.079> got<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.409> some<00:01:16.649> double

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
so here all I've got is some double

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.309 
so here all I've got is some double
cream<00:01:17.280> about<00:01:18.090> 200<00:01:18.420> milliliters<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.959> here<00:01:19.139> I'm

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:19.319 
cream about 200 milliliters in here I'm

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:21.199 
cream about 200 milliliters in here I'm
gonna<00:01:19.409> whisk<00:01:19.709> it<00:01:19.889> up<00:01:19.979> until<00:01:20.249> it<00:01:20.369> gets<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.759> too

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:21.209 
gonna whisk it up until it gets not too

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:23.179 
gonna whisk it up until it gets not too
thick<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.079> this<00:01:22.229> obviously<00:01:22.619> starts<00:01:22.920> making

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
thick but this obviously starts making

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:33.980 
thick but this obviously starts making
some<00:01:23.399> stiff<00:01:23.639> peaks<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.240> we'll<00:01:24.359> give<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.600> go

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
too precise here so once you put that

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.600
