00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 the hunchbacks of popes are quite noble 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.580
 genuine leather cases first available for 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.280
 macbooks then came out for the iphone 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.559
 the iphone is quite a big success 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.010
 Rome was not bought 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.510
 and completely new level for ipad mini 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.770
 while gradually for her and her 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.260
 look closer and closer 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.180
 There are three different cases 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.769
 color variants I have the brown here 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.679
 winter sports is so a bit on 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.460
 old made that it and natural leather 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.840
 accordingly a little bit scarred 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.850
 and as it should be 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.190
 there are those in the very black that sees 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.290
 I find myself a bit strict 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.270
 I would rather like the brown one and I will one more 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.219
 little color accents it gives the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.629
 then also with the red here but 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.700
 even here, the red is so easy 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.800
 so set off three different 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.300
 color variations all around 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.739
 zipper with two tippers so 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.960
 not to make either side 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.489
 paper here to open and none 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.870
 papers to dry things in there the tu 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.350
 I'll go out and look like that 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.330
 I have to fit in here now 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.360
 back press-studs solve 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.369
 you see, so here are with the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.659
 this flap will be with snaps there 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.840
 held in the back 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.340
 this is a very very soft leather it 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.070
 she feels really good too much 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.689
 on all soft and I have here his 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.490
 performer if I now times since this 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:29.000
 more out and here comes my then 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.259
 ipad 3 my little one is staying here 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.820
 up here, the camera recess so 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.200
 make sure that it really rum in it 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.200
 is that pushing in there ? 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:51.270
 Everything is right here 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.890
 and just this lax rainer can be seen 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.400
 It probably will not make four now 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.750
 once a day but pack it once 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.000
 and lets it then in here since 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.190
 I have the recess for the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.250
 volume buttons the mute button here 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.450
 below you see, I hope I can imagine 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.000
 a bit sharp, I hope so too 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.580
 volume loud the speakers 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.620
 recess and the recess for the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.000
 lightning connection now i can do that 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.280
 But we'll come back here 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.600
 in front of it for a short while on this flap 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.040
 I also speak here 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.320
 possibility is a little bit like that 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.320
 stand to use for typing so 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:33.780
 she can easily stretched position 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.650
 and I can do that thing too 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.739
 put up 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.120
 to watch the video must now exactly 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.010
 look how I do that I know that 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.170
 Just go in there and have it 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.640
 a small stand integrated because 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.920
 It is only very important to mention 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.190
 that you just go backwards 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.470
 You can fold it so it was completely stupid 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.850
 if the thing always with the flap left 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.780
 you have to hold here the short 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.370
 lock up the troops again 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.720
 You can just flip it over in the back 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.810
 and you can do it here with one too 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.489
 Hand holding it is well I think so 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.079
 to mention very important indeed is a 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.540
 a little thicker then because just here 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.640
 the back there is from the cover 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.880
 but it also works well with one 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.310
 pension then act with the ipad yes 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.920
 do something once again 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.720
 and it is a reasonable high quality 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.690
 and robust protection I think for yours 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.030
 little ipad looks fancy and it 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.440
 actually still acceptable from the strength 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.230
 So here at the macbooks I found 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.070
 win very very vigorously important though 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.750
 This is still good for the ipad 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.230
 Just take it outside 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.239
 or the mini or at least need 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.390
 cookbook for ipad mini by treffs on 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.580
