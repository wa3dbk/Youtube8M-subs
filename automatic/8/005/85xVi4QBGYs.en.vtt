be our massive plugs that we can charge

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
be our massive plugs that we can charge
stuff<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:43.070> that's<00:00:45.350> alright<00:00:46.350> i'll<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
stuff with that's alright i'll have a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.760 
stuff with that's alright i'll have a
look<00:00:47.550> at<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:49.520> all<00:00:50.520> right<00:00:50.809> this<00:00:51.809> here<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.469> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
look at that all right this here is a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.520 
look at that all right this here is a
temperature<00:00:53.250> sensor<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.600> put<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
temperature sensor you can put it in a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.459 
temperature sensor you can put it in a
lipo<00:00:55.890> bag<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.809> charge<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.020> light<00:00:58.199> bulb

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
lipo bag if you charge on a light bulb

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.869 
lipo bag if you charge on a light bulb
and<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.359> s<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.660> audio<00:01:01.020> slide<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.879> this

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and so if it s you audio slide down this

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.920 
and so if it s you audio slide down this
is<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.199> risky<00:01:04.199> table<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.129> get<00:01:06.060> program<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> data

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
is a risky table to get program the data

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.600 
is a risky table to get program the data
or<00:01:07.260> program<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> charger<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.250> gather<00:01:08.369> data

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
or program the charger and gather data

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.320 
or program the charger and gather data
from<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.000> charger<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:10.580> this<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
from the charger here this here is the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.570 
from the charger here this here is the
balance<00:01:12.930> bluff<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.650> plug<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> sent<00:01:14.250> into

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
balance bluff so you plug the sent into

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.179 
balance bluff so you plug the sent into
the<00:01:14.610> charger<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.920> plug

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the charger here and then you just plug

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.429 
the charger here and then you just plug
your<00:01:17.220> battery<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.509> solve<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.960> yourself<00:01:19.229> or

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
your battery so to solve for yourself or

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.160 
your battery so to solve for yourself or
so<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.710> i<00:01:19.860> sell<00:01:20.159> 60<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.720> any<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.140> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
so if i sell 60 it's just any one of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.660 
so if i sell 60 it's just any one of
those<00:01:22.350> books<00:01:25.820> this<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.500> this<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:29.250> plug<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
