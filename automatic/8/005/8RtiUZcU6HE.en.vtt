 2k 15 kids so I bring news 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.120
 we started with them first in 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 the 2 k 16 has been confirmed that it will 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
 bring new new historical equipment 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 classic equipment such as the toronto 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.739
 raptors of the season 2000 in which 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.440
 they are vince carter and tracy mcgrady 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.090
 together the two cousins ​​for that bull 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.020
 of this Toronto team was very much 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.020
 very well bring the angels lakers the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.649
 2000-2001 season that you in forum 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.590
 champions and fear will bring the boston 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.120
 celtics of the 2007-2008 season that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.309
 they got the first elvis ring 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.770
 frame 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.340
 the truth that in that sense threw in 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.670
 lack equipment that has not included not 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 I know if during these days they will leave 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.659
 including more historical equipment but 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.729
 are the confirmed ones but I 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.039
 I miss for example teams like 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.830
 those of tristone of season 20 2004 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.920
 that front-end champions and even do not 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.930
 the miami heat of the 2005-2006 season 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.940
 conway fisac 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.150
 who were champions and not even 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.960
 be any year of those who were 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.760
 champions the san antonio spurs 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.190
 the hours that missed more equipment in 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.170
 that sense the generation of the 2000 but 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.780
 good to be aware if something of 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.909
 the days the next weeks will 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.290
 confirm more equipment has been has 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.680
 confirmed that now new animations 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.600
 in the game because they have graphically 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.030
 commented logical we can see it to 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.610
 simple view on the 215 that graphically 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.259
 because the game is fine so 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.300
 are focused on above all improving the 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.960
 gameplay theme the animations and 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.750
 issues of the players and good that then 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.170
 we hope not all of us hope that 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.050
 want to say that finally the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.640
 zig-zag if it's not clear that it's something that 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.420
 he has to correct that we all protest 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.400
 is something that many abuse and should be 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.810
 corrected so we hope you know 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.239
 the things that has been corrected him with 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.430
 theme of the new animations too 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.590
 The subject of modeling has been improved 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.280
 of the shoes supposedly has 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.200
 there were good scans of a lot of 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.209
 slippers which now of moderate 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.430
 it must be much better as I entered seeing 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.350
 on screen and then another topic that you have 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.980
 they have confirmed that they have improved is the 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.940
 of the public in the stands is worth 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.250
 supposedly new ones can be 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.590
 animations with which now then in 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.270
 certain moments of the match as 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.700
 they will be happier and more excited than 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.690
 never giving it at last with a 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.740
 more realistic touch not if it fits the public 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.080
 that the truth that was already deposed and 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.240
 pretty good so are the news 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.280
 that have been confirmed by mid 16 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.650
 I'm going to do and kids little by little 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.330
 as they go, they will be more 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.920
 news by leaders bringing to the channel 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.110
 so good 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.490
 if you liked this video is by vote 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.900
 I like products comment what has 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.390
 appeared these developments and that throws in 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.010
 missing and we'll see you in the next video 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.010
