00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.289
 - to the channel of fear b today we will visit 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:24.720
 It is a village today that I talk about 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.010
 monte rafael village and cinema from 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.160
 that came to me I saw that it was a 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:36.899
 book could not have no paper 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:39.540
 I'm not a fan of what's in Iraq and illustrated. 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.379
 and situations are very beautiful and combine 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.950
 much with then I say 70 and had a book 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.620
 IRS same role yesterday contains has not 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.140
 as but I need is that I go 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.300
 prefer paper anyway he still has 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.879
 seven points inside it 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.859
 rafael says he found and tells a 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.059
 story to make the rain in the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:08.040
 second set to berna is a lady who 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.260
 died and italy will do รณ he produced and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.229
 sold 67 conte that talk about one 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.380
 distant village that is going through 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.159
 a hunger and cold at the time of a war 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.900
 to finally have the seven meetings 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:28.200
 they fit very well and it's bizarre 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.939
 puzzle the book could in another 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.790
 order in health in the order that I 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.439
 even send an announcement in the book and in pain and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.930
 I think that 's perfect 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:47.030
 I do not know if it would fit in another 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:51.689
 form was only just a way to point 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.700
 fairies there a normal medium on the varzim 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.960
 only ordinary people but at the end 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.649
 surprising ended up in a very 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.119
 strong some even with core and you stay 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.380
 shocked and fascinated by the book is 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.360
 bright and the two situations with 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.710
 favelas without dog he with the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.200
 stories that is very perfect 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.420
 in an uncle's book again when the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.360
 book is coming in the most 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.710
 tense he has blood on some pages 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.840
 usually the pages we strong where the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.850
 thing gets more tense in the end that it was 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.980
 the doors to no longer so 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.740
 male book thing I found very good 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.810
 The day I was able to use the paste, it fit 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.270
 perfect in history it's hard to find a 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.270
 Book where heavy so the book is 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.600
 short it has less than 100 pages and 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.370
 makes you get it one day 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.700
 which is very good that you do not miss anything 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.340
 You with all the characters all 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.710
 those residents decided to retail the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.330
 region in their head so they all 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.810
 You get out of a story and give it to others. 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.880
 You already know one if I've already seen it 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.160
 time is also not accurate is 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.640
 happening the story tells what 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.650
 He went before and one after then huh 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.510
 Do you already know the character that happens to you? 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.820
 you know you have been through a situation that 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.190
 he will pass by another is everything very 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.950
 attached firmly fits the story 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.200

 about homes in this book such a fuck is 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.050
 bizarre and even slightly shocking is 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.450
 beginning to end is worth living 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.360
 whole without wanting all the words until 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.330
