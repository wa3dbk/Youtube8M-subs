00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.000
 the friends of youtube and today I'm going to 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.840
 teach how 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.170
 have a private number 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.830
 how to hide your phone number this 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.320
 it's here in 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.960
 [Music] 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.180
 is for mexico then and in some 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.500
 other countries will work 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.580
 but good we're going 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.580
 to the calling application 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.310
 and we will see in options 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.420
 let's go in configurations of 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.039
 calls 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.790
 our steps are for phones 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.970
 android 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.780
 let's go where it says configuration 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.780
 additional 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.570
 once the first option that comes out of 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.610
 Diamond 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.380
 here I'm lifting predetermined and the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.840
 default will show them the 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.030
 number of the person who is marked 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.110
 they give in hide number it will hide 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.879
 as is my case 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.930
 and if you give to show then obviously 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.930
 what is going to show 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.159
 suppose you have your 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.619
 Android phone 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.780
 but you can not find him in this option 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.210
 worry about this option you guys are going 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.429
 to activate to not be performing the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.920
 mark that I will show you every time 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.229
 that they are going to call but good if they are 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.730
 makes this configuration complicated is 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.130
 very easy 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.259
 we are going to select 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.729
 31 cat cat's phone number 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.010
 for example I live here nation of 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.840
 I will give him Mexico in 55 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.840
 and it will be the cell phone number days 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.150
 now the landline so in this case 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.920
 would be for example without a number that does not 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:59.020
 I would like 30 symbol cat 31 cat plus the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.750
 10 digits of the telephone number 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:08.509
 markariÃ¡n and automatically 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:12.380
 a call should be linked and 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.380
 will appear as a private number 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.909
 this is for 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.159
 movistar we can see here I have 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.819
 movistar between cel is not going to 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:26.359
 function 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.849
 but if you're interested in having a number 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.190
 private so I recommend you change to 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.830
 movistar 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.830
 I hope you have served this video 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.830
 regards
