00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
jazz it up a little bit this model is

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.170 
jazz it up a little bit this model is
called<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.919> tornado<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:55.669> I<00:04:55.700> figured<00:04:56.060> I<00:04:56.150> would

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
called the tornado so I figured I would

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.510 
called the tornado so I figured I would
just<00:04:56.479> call<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.590> f5<00:04:58.100> tornado<00:05:00.490> why<00:05:01.490> not
