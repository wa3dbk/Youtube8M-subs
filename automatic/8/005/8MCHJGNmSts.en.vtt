able<00:00:18.320> to<00:00:18.560> reproduce<00:00:18.830> Shakespeare<00:00:19.550> so<00:00:20.119> that's

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
able to reproduce Shakespeare so that's

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:21.939 
able to reproduce Shakespeare so that's
kind<00:00:20.900> of<00:00:20.960> what<00:00:21.110> i'm<00:00:21.199> trying<00:00:21.440> to<00:00:21.500> do<00:00:21.710> i'm

kind of what i'm trying to do i'm

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.990 
kind of what i'm trying to do i'm
creating<00:00:22.779> shakespeare<00:00:23.779> using<00:00:24.590> monkeys<00:00:25.010> but

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
creating shakespeare using monkeys but

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.540 
creating shakespeare using monkeys but
my<00:00:26.600> monkeys<00:00:27.170> have<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.710> be<00:00:27.800> virtual<00:00:28.250> i<00:00:28.369> don't

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
my monkeys have to be virtual i don't

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.279 
my monkeys have to be virtual i don't
have<00:00:28.760> a<00:00:28.789> million<00:00:29.060> monkeys<00:00:29.359> laying<00:00:29.810> around<00:00:30.080> i

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
have a million monkeys laying around i

don't<00:00:30.320> have<00:00:30.650> a<00:00:30.680> million<00:00:30.949> typewriters<00:00:31.359> so<00:00:32.359> i'm

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:32.479 
don't have a million typewriters so i'm

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.599 
don't have a million typewriters so i'm
using<00:00:32.689> technology<00:00:33.469> it's<00:00:33.979> a<00:00:34.100> technology

using technology it's a technology
called<00:00:34.789> Hadoop<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.359> that<00:00:35.989> allows<00:00:36.229> me<00:00:36.530> to

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
called Hadoop and that allows me to

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.599 
called Hadoop and that allows me to
distribute<00:00:38.269> and<00:00:38.539> create<00:00:39.079> a<00:00:39.289> large<00:00:40.039> amount<00:00:40.489> of

that's<00:00:45.559> what<00:00:45.679> this<00:00:45.799> project<00:00:46.069> is<00:00:46.429> doing<00:00:46.760> we're

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:46.999 
that's what this project is doing we're

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:49.419 
that's what this project is doing we're
we're<00:00:47.569> recreating<00:00:47.870> Shakespeare<00:00:48.649> randomly

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
we're recreating Shakespeare randomly

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.539 
we're recreating Shakespeare randomly
and<00:00:49.670> not<00:00:50.329> just<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.899> work<00:00:51.559> of<00:00:51.709> Shakespeare<00:00:52.190> I'm

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
and not just a work of Shakespeare I'm

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.039 
and not just a work of Shakespeare I'm
recreating<00:00:52.909> every<00:00:53.420> single<00:00:53.749> work<00:00:53.899> of

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.049 
recreating every single work of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.729 
recreating every single work of
Shakespeare<00:00:54.679> at<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:54.949> same<00:00:55.159> time<00:00:55.459> and<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:57.530> put

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
Shakespeare at the same time and to put

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.069 
Shakespeare at the same time and to put
this<00:00:57.999> amount<00:00:58.999> of<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.389> amount<00:00:59.569> of<00:00:59.690> work<00:00:59.869> into

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
this amount of the amount of work into

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.090 
this amount of the amount of work into
perspective<00:01:00.879> if<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:02.329> take<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.869> there<00:01:03.679> are

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
perspective if you take the there are

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.730 
perspective if you take the there are
five<00:01:05.000> point<00:01:05.360> five<00:01:05.570> trillion<00:01:06.170> different

five point five trillion different

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.290 
five point five trillion different
permutations<00:01:07.280> of<00:01:08.230> nine<00:01:09.230> characters<00:01:10.300> so

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
permutations of nine characters so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.210 
permutations of nine characters so
that's<00:01:11.780> what<00:01:11.960> we're<00:01:12.380> doing<00:01:12.410> we're<00:01:12.920> creating

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
that's what we're doing we're creating

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.340 
that's what we're doing we're creating
nine<00:01:13.400> character<00:01:13.880> sets<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.480> seeing<00:01:14.720> if<00:01:14.900> part

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
nine character sets and seeing if part

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.760 
nine character sets and seeing if part
of<00:01:15.410> that<00:01:15.590> matches<00:01:16.100> Shakespeare<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.440> so<00:01:18.440> far

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
of that matches Shakespeare and so far

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.970 
of that matches Shakespeare and so far
I've<00:01:19.070> done<00:01:19.400> about<00:01:19.640> 500<00:01:20.300> billion<00:01:20.540> as<00:01:20.900> of<00:01:21.170> the

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
I've done about 500 billion as of the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.630 
I've done about 500 billion as of the
August<00:01:22.910> 25th<00:01:23.530> so<00:01:24.530> that's<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:25.130> very

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
August 25th so that's a very

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.730 
August 25th so that's a very
insignificant<00:01:25.910> number<00:01:26.390> even<00:01:26.750> though<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
insignificant number even though the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.590 
insignificant number even though the
project<00:01:28.220> has<00:01:28.370> been<00:01:28.550> going<00:01:28.880> for<00:01:29.150> about<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.390> week

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
project has been going for about a week

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.160 
project has been going for about a week
or<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.050> and<00:01:30.460> as<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.700> mentioned<00:01:32.120> where<00:01:32.660> you<00:01:32.990> can

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
or so and as I mentioned where you can

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.590 
or so and as I mentioned where you can
look<00:01:33.500> at<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:33.770> website<00:01:34.160> and<00:01:34.460> if<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.480> weren't

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
look at the website and if you weren't

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.420 
look at the website and if you weren't
there<00:01:35.840> now<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.050> suggest<00:01:36.410> you<00:01:36.770> pause<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.100> video

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
there now I suggest you pause the video

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.230 
there now I suggest you pause the video
and<00:01:37.850> take<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.480> look<00:01:38.720> because<00:01:39.020> we're<00:01:40.010> going<00:01:40.340> the

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
and take a look because we're going the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.440 
and take a look because we're going the
website<00:01:41.810> actually<00:01:42.230> ties<00:01:42.620> in<00:01:42.920> with<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:43.909> is

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
website actually ties in with the and is

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.500 
website actually ties in with the and is
updated<00:01:44.870> by<00:01:45.590> Hadoop<00:01:46.190> by<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.640> technology<00:01:47.060> that

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
updated by Hadoop by the technology that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.440 
updated by Hadoop by the technology that
I'm<00:01:47.780> using<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.409> it<00:01:49.040> uploads<00:01:49.250> two<00:01:49.670> artifacts

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
I'm using and it uploads two artifacts

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.680 
I'm using and it uploads two artifacts
it<00:01:50.870> uploads<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:51.500> tabular<00:01:52.159> output<00:01:52.370> which<00:01:53.360> shows

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
it uploads a tabular output which shows

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.550 
it uploads a tabular output which shows
the<00:01:53.870> exact<00:01:54.230> number<00:01:54.620> of<00:01:55.570> characters<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
the exact number of characters that the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.469 
the exact number of characters that the
monkeys<00:01:57.979> have<00:01:58.159> found<00:01:58.430> as<00:01:58.700> well<00:01:59.180> as<00:01:59.360> the

have<00:02:08.749> been<00:02:08.899> found<00:02:09.079> by<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.349> monkeys<00:02:09.889> and<00:02:10.159> white

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
have been found by the monkeys and white

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.970 
have been found by the monkeys and white
by<00:02:11.150> what<00:02:11.389> to<00:02:11.900> show<00:02:12.079> what's<00:02:12.290> happened

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
by what to show what's happened

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.729 
by what to show what's happened
hasn't<00:02:13.340> happened<00:02:13.670> hasn't<00:02:14.060> been<00:02:14.300> found<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.840> so

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
hasn't happened hasn't been found and so

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.339 
hasn't happened hasn't been found and so
that's<00:02:16.190> broken<00:02:16.550> down<00:02:16.879> from<00:02:17.720> all<00:02:17.930> works<00:02:18.170> of

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
that's broken down from all works of

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.740 
that's broken down from all works of
Shakespeare<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:19.040> then<00:02:19.610> individual<00:02:20.360> works<00:02:20.540> of

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
Shakespeare and then individual works of

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.479 
Shakespeare and then individual works of
Shakespeare<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.530> can<00:02:21.680> check<00:02:22.129> out<00:02:22.280> your

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
Shakespeare so you can check out your

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.009 
Shakespeare so you can check out your
favorite<00:02:22.790> play<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.299> see<00:02:23.510> how<00:02:23.629> much<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
favorite play and see how much the

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.710 
favorite play and see how much the
monkeys<00:02:24.349> have<00:02:24.530> went<00:02:24.680> through<00:02:24.920> as<00:02:25.310> far<00:02:26.299> as<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
monkeys have went through as far as the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.949 
monkeys have went through as far as the
technology<00:02:27.110> at<00:02:28.099> an<00:02:28.819> explanation<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.780> what's

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
technology at an explanation of what's

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.500 
technology at an explanation of what's
happening<00:02:31.660> as<00:02:32.660> i<00:02:32.900> mentioned<00:02:33.230> i<00:02:33.290> don't<00:02:33.470> have

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
happening as i mentioned i don't have

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.170 
happening as i mentioned i don't have
monkeys<00:02:35.510> i<00:02:35.920> have<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.129> fertilize<00:02:37.670> those

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
monkeys i have to fertilize those

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.900 
monkeys i have to fertilize those
monkeys<00:02:38.629> so<00:02:38.870> each<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.890> those<00:02:40.010> monkeys<00:02:40.489> gets<00:02:40.760> a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
monkeys so each of those monkeys gets a

monkeys so each of those monkeys gets a
creates<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.540> virtual<00:02:41.930> output<00:02:42.349> a<00:02:42.379> random<00:02:43.190> output

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
creates a virtual output a random output

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.339 
creates a virtual output a random output
you<00:02:44.269> might<00:02:44.420> think<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.870> as<00:02:44.989> random

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
you might think of it as random

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.309 
you might think of it as random
gibberish<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.519> then<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.510> random<00:02:47.900> gibberish

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
gibberish and then that random gibberish

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.339 
gibberish and then that random gibberish
is<00:02:48.590> checked<00:02:48.890> against<00:02:49.370> what<00:02:50.239> every<00:02:51.049> work<00:02:51.230> of

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
is checked against what every work of

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.449 
is checked against what every work of
Shakespeare<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.190> if<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.329> piece<00:02:53.780> of

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
Shakespeare and if the piece of

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.369 
Shakespeare and if the piece of
Shakespeare<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:55.730> found<00:02:56.150> then<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:57.019> actually

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
Shakespeare is found then it's actually

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:58.869 
Shakespeare is found then it's actually

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
outputting the green as I mentioned

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.930 
outputting the green as I mentioned
before<00:02:59.680> for<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.709> little<00:03:01.040> explanation<00:03:01.489> of<00:03:01.790> the

technology behind it i was using i'm

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.449 
technology behind it i was using i'm
using<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.540> jean<00:03:06.109> luc's<00:03:06.349> mersing<00:03:06.829> twister<00:03:07.220> for

the pseudo-random number generator and
as<00:03:10.400> i<00:03:10.700> mentioned<00:03:10.730> before<00:03:11.090> hadoop<00:03:11.780> but<00:03:12.500> i<00:03:12.530> was

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
as i mentioned before hadoop but i was

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.160 
as i mentioned before hadoop but i was
using<00:03:13.040> i<00:03:13.459> was<00:03:13.760> originally<00:03:13.879> using<00:03:14.510> amazon<00:03:14.989> ec2

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
using i was originally using amazon ec2

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.190 
using i was originally using amazon ec2
for<00:03:15.799> this<00:03:15.920> project<00:03:16.160> but<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.329> problem<00:03:17.810> was<00:03:17.930> I

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
for this project but the problem was I

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.830 
for this project but the problem was I
didn't<00:03:18.980> have<00:03:19.250> enough<00:03:19.760> RAM<00:03:20.060> on<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.359> on<00:03:20.780> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
didn't have enough RAM on the on the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.089 
didn't have enough RAM on the on the
free<00:03:21.319> instance<00:03:21.739> of<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.769> virtual

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
free instance of the of the virtual

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.039 
free instance of the of the virtual
machine<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:25.639> I<00:03:25.669> had<00:03:25.849> to<00:03:25.880> start<00:03:26.630> running<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:26.989> on

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
machine so I had to start running it on

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.440 
machine so I had to start running it on
my<00:03:27.260> home<00:03:27.470> machine<00:03:27.620> so<00:03:28.579> my<00:03:28.730> home<00:03:28.910> machine<00:03:29.030> is

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
my home machine so my home machine is

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.839 
my home machine so my home machine is
running<00:03:29.599> a<00:03:29.840> single<00:03:30.200> note<00:03:30.380> i<00:03:30.680> do<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.160> uploading

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
running a single note i do and uploading

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.720 
running a single note i do and uploading
the<00:03:31.940> output<00:03:32.389> and<00:03:32.930> i<00:03:33.620> hope<00:03:33.769> that<00:03:33.859> explains<00:03:34.160> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
the output and i hope that explains the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.650 
the output and i hope that explains the
project<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.239> little<00:03:35.480> better<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:35.959> enjoy
