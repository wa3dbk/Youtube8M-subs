00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
second half and had a way better second

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.480 
second half and had a way better second
half<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.420> i<00:01:36.479> think<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:36.869> even<00:01:37.200> even<00:01:38.040> final

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
half but i think it was even even final

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.940 
half but i think it was even even final
I<00:01:38.670> think<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> way<00:01:39.630> Benfica<00:01:40.200> lost<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> bit

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
I think the way Benfica lost was a bit

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.240 
I think the way Benfica lost was a bit
harsh<00:01:41.159> man<00:01:41.490> 90<00:01:41.909> 92nd<00:01:42.750> minute<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.380> suffer<00:01:44.189> a

corner in the 92nd minute that that hurt

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.850 
corner in the 92nd minute that that hurt
the<00:01:46.829> reason<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> hurts<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.909> bad<00:01:48.149> was<00:01:48.390> because

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
the reason it hurts so bad was because

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.100 
the reason it hurts so bad was because
most<00:01:49.860> people<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.399> Benfica<00:01:51.390> suffer<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.840> go<00:01:51.990> in

my hat off the Chelsea I think they

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.750

figure<00:02:31.769> had<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> really<00:02:32.099> good<00:02:32.310> chance<00:02:32.489> at

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
figure had a really good chance at

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
figure had a really good chance at
winning<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.209> think<00:02:33.269> if<00:02:33.510> they<00:02:33.630> would<00:02:33.750> have

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
winning it I think if they would have

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.150 
winning it I think if they would have
been<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.959> better<00:02:34.200> bit<00:02:34.590> better<00:02:34.860> at<00:02:35.040> their

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
been a better bit better at their

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.820 
been a better bit better at their
finishing<00:02:35.550> they<00:02:35.819> would<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.620> they<00:02:37.620> would

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
finishing they would have they would

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.490 
finishing they would have they would
have<00:02:37.950> uh<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:39.870> probably<00:02:40.200> would<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.319> won<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
have uh it probably would have won the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.960 
have uh it probably would have won the
game<00:02:40.620> if<00:02:40.890> they<00:02:41.010> could<00:02:41.160> score<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.489> change<00:02:41.790> they

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
game if they could score to change they

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.220 
game if they could score to change they
had<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.269> first<00:02:42.420> half<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.080> know<00:02:43.170> it

think<00:06:33.130> that<00:06:33.550> our<00:06:33.669> managers<00:06:34.120> should<00:06:34.150> be<00:06:34.450> you

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
think that our managers should be you

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.300 
think that our managers should be you
know<00:06:34.750> not<00:06:35.320> resigned<00:06:35.830> or<00:06:35.979> anything<00:06:36.159> like<00:06:36.190> that

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
know not resigned or anything like that

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.370 
know not resigned or anything like that
because<00:06:36.610> even<00:06:37.000> though<00:06:37.120> Benfica<00:06:37.659> has<00:06:38.140> gone

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
because even though Benfica has gone

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.450 
because even though Benfica has gone
through<00:06:38.590> hard<00:06:38.770> times<00:06:38.830> I<00:06:39.219> think

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
through hard times I think

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.700 
through hard times I think
I<00:06:39.910> think<00:06:40.210> JJ's<00:06:40.660> gotta<00:06:40.900> stay<00:06:41.139> with<00:06:41.319> us<00:06:41.470> man<00:06:41.680> I

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
I think JJ's gotta stay with us man I

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.409 
I think JJ's gotta stay with us man I
think<00:06:41.919> they<00:06:42.009> have<00:06:42.039> to<00:06:42.220> resign<00:06:42.610> them<00:06:42.789> so<00:06:42.970> with
