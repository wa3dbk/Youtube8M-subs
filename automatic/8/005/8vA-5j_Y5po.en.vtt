00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
and of course that mushroom tops on the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.440 
and of course that mushroom tops on the
tip<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.290> lick<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.940> always<00:02:42.060> helps<00:02:42.270> to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
tip of the lick and that always helps to

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.730 
tip of the lick and that always helps to
ensure<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.930> flames<00:02:43.230> are<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.680> to
