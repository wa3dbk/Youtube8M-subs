00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
I'm going to show you some of the dry

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.320 
I'm going to show you some of the dry
fitting<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.719> I've<00:00:09.900> done<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.710> rest<00:00:10.950> will

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
fitting that I've done and the rest will

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.759 
fitting that I've done and the rest will
probably<00:00:12.330> be<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.780> surprise<00:00:13.320> because<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.650> don't

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
probably be a surprise because I don't

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.690 
probably be a surprise because I don't
want<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> give<00:00:14.070> everything<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.460> I'm<00:00:14.670> doing

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
want to give everything that I'm doing

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.630 
want to give everything that I'm doing
away<00:00:15.120> but<00:00:15.809> will<00:00:16.230> will<00:00:16.830> show<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.130> majority<00:00:17.609> of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
away but will will show the majority of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.179 
away but will will show the majority of
what<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.529> board's<00:00:19.529> essentially<00:00:19.949> going<00:00:20.070> to

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
what the board's essentially going to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.109 
what the board's essentially going to
look<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.310> all<00:00:21.000> right<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.480> um<00:00:22.730> there's<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
look like all right so um there's just a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.080 
look like all right so um there's just a
basic<00:00:24.420> overview<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:25.279> I<00:00:26.279> mean<00:00:26.699> there's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> lot

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
basic overview of I mean there's a lot

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.929 
basic overview of I mean there's a lot
of<00:00:27.119> things<00:00:27.269> missing<00:00:27.750> obviously<00:00:28.740> um<00:00:28.939> this

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
of things missing obviously um this

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.819 
of things missing obviously um this
iceberg<00:00:30.539> will<00:00:31.610> actually<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:33.149> level<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.680> you

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
iceberg will actually be level so if you

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.470 
iceberg will actually be level so if you
look<00:00:34.950> at<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.160> sort<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.579> from<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.239> don't

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
look at it sort of from here I don't

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000 
look at it sort of from here I don't
know<00:00:36.570> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> guys<00:00:36.840> can<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.829> will<00:00:37.950> be

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
know if you guys can see it it will be

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.950 
know if you guys can see it it will be
on<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.309> same<00:00:38.610> plane<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.600> there'll<00:00:39.809> be<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
on the same plane and then there'll be a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.139 
on the same plane and then there'll be a
couple<00:00:40.170> others<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.399> area<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:41.879> they<00:00:41.969> can

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
couple others in this area so they can

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.970 
couple others in this area so they can
cross<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.390> without<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.870> thing<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.860> can

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
cross that without a thing as you can

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.290 
cross that without a thing as you can
see<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.190> goes<00:00:44.309> depth<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:46.969> what's<00:00:47.969> all<00:00:48.120> this

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
see it goes depth so what's all this

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.760 
see it goes depth so what's all this
going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.690> all<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> other<00:00:49.110> space<00:00:49.469> well

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
going to be all the other space well

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.939 
going to be all the other space well
that's<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.460> guys<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> find<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.949> all

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
that's for you guys to find out all

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740 
that's for you guys to find out all
right<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.309> here's<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.640> bridge<00:00:53.879> someone<00:00:54.660> had

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
right so here's the bridge someone had

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.150 
right so here's the bridge someone had
asked<00:00:55.050> earlier<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> be

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
asked earlier if it was just going to be

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
asked earlier if it was just going to be
a<00:00:56.190> slab<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.789> said<00:00:56.969> no<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.050> look

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
a slab and I said no it's going to look

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.920 
a slab and I said no it's going to look
like<00:00:58.230> regular<00:00:59.100> um<00:00:59.390> when<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.539> all<00:01:00.629> glued

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
like regular um when it's all glued

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.290 
like regular um when it's all glued
together<00:01:01.100> but<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.670> dry<00:01:02.910> fitted

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
together but this is all just dry fitted

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.380 
together but this is all just dry fitted
so<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.040> water<00:01:05.400> obviously

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
so this will be like the water obviously

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.539 
so this will be like the water obviously
so<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.600> guys<00:01:06.750> know<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.220> i'll<00:01:08.520> just

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
so you guys know and then so i'll just

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.899 
so you guys know and then so i'll just
be<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.030> cohesive<00:01:09.510> things<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.350> cross

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
be one cohesive things so they can cross

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.539 
be one cohesive things so they can cross
if<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.030> guys<00:01:12.150> want<00:01:12.210> scale<00:01:12.780> purposes<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.650> think

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
if you guys want scale purposes I think

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.890 
if you guys want scale purposes I think
the<00:01:14.640> car<00:01:14.820> fix<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.119> actually<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> hold

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the car fix is actually going to hold

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.649 
the car fix is actually going to hold
this<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.350> yet<00:01:16.740> okay<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.180> how<00:01:18.210> big

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this up yet okay so you can see how big

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.140 
this up yet okay so you can see how big
you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.259> actually<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.890> know<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.250> Connor

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
you can actually get you know to Connor

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.210 
you can actually get you know to Connor
fixes<00:01:21.540> which<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.990> know<00:01:22.020> decent<00:01:22.619> offer<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
fixes which is you know decent offer a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.870 
fixes which is you know decent offer a
land<00:01:23.939> raider<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.330> go<00:01:24.450> across<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.750> um<00:01:25.880> super

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
land raider to go across that um super

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.490 
land raider to go across that um super
heavy<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.270> get<00:01:27.509> across<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> inside

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
heavy can get across it on the inside

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.499 
heavy can get across it on the inside
probably<00:01:30.890> yeah<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.159> there's<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.000> three<00:01:33.329> tier

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
probably yeah so there's a three tier

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.649 
probably yeah so there's a three tier
mountain<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:35.490> know<00:01:35.579> six<00:01:35.850> inches<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.299> height

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
mountain you know six inches of height

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.140 
mountain you know six inches of height
which<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.990> big<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.130> block<00:01:38.369> very<00:01:38.850> large

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
which is big so we can block very large

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.050 
which is big so we can block very large
things<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.689> either<00:01:39.900> side<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.560> then<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:42.000> you

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
things on either side and then so you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.819 
things on either side and then so you
guys<00:01:42.180> remember<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.780> overhangs<00:01:43.380> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> be

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
guys remember the overhangs going to be

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.179 
guys remember the overhangs going to be
right<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.310> um<00:01:45.380> that's<00:01:46.380> been<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> hardest

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
right here um that's been the hardest

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.109 
right here um that's been the hardest
thing<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.579> figure<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.000> how<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.259> look

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
thing to figure out how to get that look

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.620 
thing to figure out how to get that look
organic<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> ice<00:01:52.049> um<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:54.060> they'll<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.509> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
organic on the ice um this they'll be a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.590 
organic on the ice um this they'll be a
mountain<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.170> I'll<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.710> know

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
mountain here I'll be so you know

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.260 
mountain here I'll be so you know
there's<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.810> huge<00:01:58.640> inside<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.850> glacier

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
there's the huge inside of the glacier

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.580 
there's the huge inside of the glacier
and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> three<00:02:02.310> tiers<00:02:03.590> remember

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and then with the three tiers remember

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.139 
and then with the three tiers remember
that<00:02:04.770> there<00:02:04.950> will<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.369> really<00:02:05.880> small

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
that there will be like really small

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.290 
that there will be like really small
icebergs<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.140> are<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.300> essentially

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
icebergs that are on that essentially

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.740 
icebergs that are on that essentially
like<00:02:09.479> flat<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.140> okay<00:02:11.129> flat<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.580> water

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
like flat to this okay flat to the water

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.650 
like flat to this okay flat to the water
it<00:02:13.070> that<00:02:14.070> you'll<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.850> able<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.060> place<00:02:15.300> troops

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
it that you'll be able to place troops

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.750 
it that you'll be able to place troops
inside<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.650> them<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.640> little

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
inside here on them on the little

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.700 
inside here on them on the little
islands<00:02:18.210> think<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.450> all<00:02:18.630> some<00:02:18.960> like<00:02:19.110> lily<00:02:19.380> pads

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
islands think of all some like lily pads

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.740 
islands think of all some like lily pads
but<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> really<00:02:20.190> icebergs<00:02:20.700> all<00:02:21.390> right<00:02:21.540> and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
but the really icebergs all right and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.300 
but the really icebergs all right and
then<00:02:21.810> you'll<00:02:22.440> be<00:02:22.560> able<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.800> move<00:02:22.920> your<00:02:23.100> troops

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
then you'll be able to move your troops

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.450 
then you'll be able to move your troops
up<00:02:23.840> okay<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.530> know<00:02:25.620> from<00:02:25.800> tier<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.130> tier<00:02:26.160> two

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
up okay you know from tier to tier two

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.840 
up okay you know from tier to tier two
tier<00:02:26.490> um<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:28.040> wanted<00:02:29.040> this<00:02:29.220> because<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.610> wanted

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
tier um I wanted this because I wanted

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.449 
tier um I wanted this because I wanted
something<00:02:30.240> with<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.450> lot<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.690> depth<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.290> height

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
something with a lot of depth and height

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.210 
something with a lot of depth and height
and<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.840> mountain<00:02:34.140> over<00:02:34.350> there<00:02:34.410> you

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
and the mountain over there you

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.460 
and the mountain over there you
hopefully<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:36.390> will<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.630> tall<00:02:36.840> enough<00:02:36.870> I'm

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
hopefully it will be tall enough I'm

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.350 
hopefully it will be tall enough I'm
hoping<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.370> you'll<00:02:38.520> be<00:02:38.640> able<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.850> see<00:02:39.060> troops

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
hoping that you'll be able to see troops

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.550 
hoping that you'll be able to see troops
that<00:02:39.540> are<00:02:39.570> here<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:41.850> know<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:43.080> people<00:02:43.260> can't

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
that are here you know so people can't

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.050 
that are here you know so people can't
just<00:02:43.650> bunker<00:02:44.160> them<00:02:44.250> down<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.700> middle<00:02:44.850> I

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
just bunker them down in the middle I

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.030 
just bunker them down in the middle I
try<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.330> make<00:02:45.480> right<00:02:45.690> my<00:02:46.260> board<00:02:46.560> some<00:02:46.860> what

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
try to make right my board some what

try to make right my board some what
type<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> balanced<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.810> may<00:02:49.800> put<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.040> mountain

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
type of balanced I may put a mountain

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.390 
type of balanced I may put a mountain
over<00:02:50.580> here<00:02:51.980> that's<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.040> only<00:02:53.190> thing<00:02:53.310> I

thought about that i have not

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.990 
thought about that i have not
constructed<00:02:55.050> but<00:02:55.620> otherwise<00:02:55.890> everything<00:02:56.430> I

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
a little bit extra to the board and then

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.610 
a little bit extra to the board and then
after<00:03:09.660> i'm<00:03:09.750> done<00:03:09.870> with<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.110> board<00:03:10.350> i'm<00:03:10.470> going
