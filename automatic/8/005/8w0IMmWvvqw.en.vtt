00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:17.669 
April first I was kind of like

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.819 
April first I was kind of like
devastated<00:00:18.390> because<00:00:18.509> of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> fact<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.140> you

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:19.829 
devastated because of the fact that you

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.120 
devastated because of the fact that you
know<00:00:19.860> I'm<00:00:20.130> already<00:00:20.840> coming<00:00:21.840> into<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.829> school

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
know I'm already coming into this school

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.210 
know I'm already coming into this school
with<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.730> low<00:00:23.910> income<00:00:24.360> and<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.439> know<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
with a low income and you know the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.010 
with a low income and you know the
bridge<00:00:26.430> car<00:00:26.759> was<00:00:27.090> basically<00:00:27.419> something<00:00:27.689> for

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
bridge car was basically something for

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.159 
bridge car was basically something for
me<00:00:28.169> I<00:00:28.379> can<00:00:28.829> rely<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.129> especially<00:00:29.969> with<00:00:30.239> dealing

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
me I can rely on especially with dealing

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.990 
me I can rely on especially with dealing
with<00:00:31.349> groceries<00:00:31.800> no<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> don't<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.759> bridge

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
with groceries no I don't have a bridge

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
with groceries no I don't have a bridge
card<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.020> agree<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> new

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
card but I do agree with the new

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.670 
card but I do agree with the new
regulations<00:00:35.180> because<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.870> think<00:00:37.020> students<00:00:37.590> are

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
regulations because I think students are

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.830 
regulations because I think students are
taking<00:00:37.829> advantage<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.149> system<00:00:39.329> and

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
taking advantage of the system and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
taking advantage of the system and
essentially<00:00:40.469> these<00:00:40.739> are<00:00:41.190> taxpayers<00:00:41.789> dollars

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
essentially these are taxpayers dollars

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.850 
essentially these are taxpayers dollars
going<00:00:42.570> towards<00:00:43.110> students<00:00:43.500> who<00:00:43.710> don't

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
going towards students who don't

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.400 
going towards students who don't
necessarily<00:00:44.270> need<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.480> bridge<00:00:45.660> cards<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
necessarily need the bridge cards and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.330 
necessarily need the bridge cards and
the<00:00:47.340> new<00:00:47.460> regulations<00:00:48.150> will<00:00:49.010> help<00:00:50.010> reduce<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the new regulations will help reduce the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.200 
the new regulations will help reduce the
number<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.140> students<00:00:52.140> abusing<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.160> system<00:00:53.430> if

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
number of students abusing the system if

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.340 
number of students abusing the system if
they're<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.540> doing<00:00:54.630> it<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.870> all<00:00:54.960> students

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
they're just doing it for all students

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.110 
they're just doing it for all students
all<00:00:55.649> together<00:00:55.950> I<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:56.790> that's<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.030> little

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
all together I think that's a little

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
all together I think that's a little
unfair<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:57.809> some<00:00:58.170> students<00:00:58.470> support

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
unfair because some students support

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.870 
unfair because some students support
themselves<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.309> some<00:00:59.489> students<00:00:59.820> are

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
themselves and some students are

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.360 
themselves and some students are
supported<00:01:00.239> by<00:01:00.270> their<00:01:00.450> parents<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> me

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
supported by their parents so me

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.009 
supported by their parents so me
personally<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.059> support<00:01:03.360> myself<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:03.750> parents

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
personally I support myself my parents

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.030 
personally I support myself my parents
don't<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.229> help<00:01:04.379> me<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.710> school<00:01:04.799> or

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
don't really help me out of school or

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.450 
don't really help me out of school or
anything<00:01:05.219> at<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.509> I<00:01:06.540> hurts<00:01:07.350> me<00:01:07.649> but<00:01:08.399> I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
anything at all so I hurts me but I

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.190 
anything at all so I hurts me but I
understand<00:01:08.969> why<00:01:09.149> they<00:01:09.450> want<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> just

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
understand why they want to do it just

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.709 
understand why they want to do it just
because<00:01:10.290> abuse<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.490> system<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:12.000> feel<00:01:12.630> like

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
because abuse of the system I feel like

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:13.639 
because abuse of the system I feel like
they<00:01:12.840> should<00:01:12.869> look<00:01:13.079> into<00:01:13.259> it<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.469> little<00:01:13.560> bit

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
they should look into it a little bit

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.760 
they should look into it a little bit
more<00:01:13.890> since<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.729> don't<00:01:14.789> have<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.240> child<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:16.530> not

roommate who could easily buy groceries

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.080 
roommate who could easily buy groceries
without<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.200> bridge<00:01:34.529> card<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.219> she<00:01:35.520> uses<00:01:35.729> one

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
without a bridge card but she uses one

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.730 
without a bridge card but she uses one
anyway<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> don't<00:01:36.810> feel<00:01:36.959> she<00:01:37.139> needs<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.529> I

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
anyway and I don't feel she needs it I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.709 
anyway and I don't feel she needs it I
disagree<00:01:38.399> with<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> think<00:01:39.299> they<00:01:39.420> should<00:01:39.599> at

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
disagree with it I think they should at

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.699 
disagree with it I think they should at
least<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:42.420> know<00:01:42.539> allow<00:01:43.020> us<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.319> keep<00:01:43.529> them

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
least you know allow us to keep them

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.149 
least you know allow us to keep them
until<00:01:44.039> it's<00:01:44.520> proven<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.119> were<00:01:45.889> not<00:01:46.889> using

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
until it's proven that were not using

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.489 
until it's proven that were not using
them<00:01:47.369> properly<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:49.349> I<00:01:49.439> know

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
them properly so because I know

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.109 
them properly so because I know
personally<00:01:49.799> I'm<00:01:50.429> really<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:50.969> to<00:01:51.029> be

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
personally I'm really going to be

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.179
