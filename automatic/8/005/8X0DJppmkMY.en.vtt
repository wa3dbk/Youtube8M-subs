00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.790
 some people have been me 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.680
 asking how do I do the rhythms in the 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.800
 songs that I've been recording of 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.660
 tutorials on youtube the pace that I 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.060
 they use in most of the songs they 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.820
 can say that it is a unique rhythm 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.460
 truth I do not follow that we say a rhythm 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.200
 that we already know in churches like the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.480
 community las norteñas the salsa but that 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.820
 I was born a rhythm a little more 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.340
 different that he named it between a 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.210
 combination of rock and a little bit of 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.079
 Malaga and in Spanish if you know the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.079
 malagueño touches something like this 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.570
 and because the rock can be said to be a 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.570
 something like that 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.550
 then I will be an example if 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.930
 you have already seen the tutorial of I you 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.930
 I adore with all my being 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.320
 I'm going to give you that rhythm so that 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.590
 they understand more or less how he was 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.410
 playing the previous tutorials as 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.230
 I was telling you it's a unique style voice 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.540
 but there it goes more or less as it is 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.920
 what I do is this to put in my hand 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.320
 left my youngest with capo 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.770
 right hand basically what it does is 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.770
 low 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.530
 and do like a pat like that 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.520
 means to climb the ropes 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.609
 up and the rafael molina 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.590
 and of course at a faster speed it does not 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.070
 note but there goes more or less in the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.070
 speed 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.700
 do not 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.509
 and then occasionally I have to followed 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.509
 with all my fingers 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.140
 as I say in slow motion it would be like that 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.240
 at a speed you do not notice much now 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.160
 also my left hand will influence 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.069
 a little bit because what I do is lift 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.360
 the chord and drop it again for 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.360
 let me cut the sound 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:27.920
 once in a while I raise my fingers 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.140
 you also do not notice much but if I know a 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.500
 little bit is going away , the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.450
 neck and fingers that will help me 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.970
 this rhythm that I have told you that state 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.260
 using in the songs then 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:49.590
 it would be something like that look 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:53.239
 in slow motion they would be selected for 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.239
 slow and the song 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.239
 and the last note what I do is 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.610
 As I always tell you, finish with a 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.610
 taspe arpeggio 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.659
 in the last note there goes again 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.540
 everyone goes to the sea 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.760
 all day 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.540
 flowers 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.439
 from the heart 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:54.000
 Losail is once again in slow motion 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:58.130
 with pull up pearls and 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.170
 when your hand like the volca aha 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:07.530
 and with the left help a little 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:09.510
 here is something like an out beauty and as 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.930
 I told them to finish the last note with 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.930
 a jar 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.720
 and that's how he used most of the 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.759
 songs that are praise in the 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.889
 Coritos also used very similar 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.930
 I hope you have served this video 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.840
 have any questions that you can send 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.789
 an email here I leave it below and then 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.789
 here go ahead in the hour of God
