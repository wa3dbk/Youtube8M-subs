00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.600 
and then flatten it out so what you want
to<00:02:25.500> do<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.740> flatten<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.130> out<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.340> press<00:02:26.580> down

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
to do to flatten it out is press down

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.500 
to do to flatten it out is press down
and<00:02:28.190> just<00:02:29.190> yeah<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.670> press<00:02:29.850> down<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.330> and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
and just yeah just press down on it and

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.280 
and just yeah just press down on it and
you<00:02:30.570> can<00:02:31.530> see<00:02:32.180> there's<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.270> lot<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.630> access<00:02:34.110> all

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
you can see there's a lot of access all

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.380 
you can see there's a lot of access all
you<00:02:34.380> have<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.560> do<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.070> pull<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:35.910> inward

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
you have to do is just pull that inward

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.430 
you have to do is just pull that inward
into<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> mold<00:02:37.470> like<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.990> that's<00:02:43.170> what<00:02:43.320> it

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
into the mold like so and that's what it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.170 
into the mold like so and that's what it
should<00:02:43.590> look<00:02:43.620> like<00:02:43.740> after<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.850> still<00:02:45.030> see

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
should look like after you can still see

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.550 
should look like after you can still see
there's<00:02:45.390> some<00:02:45.750> places<00:02:46.170> where<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.440> haven't

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
there's some places where I haven't

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.470 
there's some places where I haven't
smoothed<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:46.980> out<00:02:47.070> yet<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.580> can<00:02:47.730> see<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.270> mold

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
smoothed it out yet you can see the mold

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.750 
smoothed it out yet you can see the mold
is<00:02:48.750> already<00:02:49.050> starting<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.410> push<00:02:49.830> out<00:02:50.130> into<00:02:50.550> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
is already starting to push out into the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.699 
is already starting to push out into the
polymer<00:02:51.090> clay<00:02:51.209> right<00:02:51.390> here<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.750> what<00:02:52.530> you

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
polymer clay right here and what you

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.760 
polymer clay right here and what you
would<00:02:53.130> need<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:54.300> toothpick<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.200> dotting

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
would need is a toothpick and a dotting

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.000 
would need is a toothpick and a dotting
tool<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:56.100> some<00:02:56.250> sort<00:02:56.550> or<00:02:56.840> even<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.650> skewer

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
tool of some sort or even like a skewer

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.000 
tool of some sort or even like a skewer
or<00:02:59.280> something<00:02:59.850> but<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:01.200> save<00:03:01.350> time<00:03:01.620> I'm<00:03:01.890> just

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
or something but to save time I'm just

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.720 
or something but to save time I'm just
gonna<00:03:02.220> use<00:03:02.730> what<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.450> have<00:03:03.510> right<00:03:03.780> now<00:03:04.730> because

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
gonna use what I have right now because

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.100 
gonna use what I have right now because
he<00:03:05.850> started<00:03:06.120> dirty<00:03:06.330> from<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.600> Plumber<00:03:06.840> clay

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
he started dirty from the Plumber clay

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.470 
he started dirty from the Plumber clay
so<00:03:07.739> what<00:03:07.950> you're<00:03:08.070> gonna<00:03:08.190> do<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.700> figure<00:03:09.360> out

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
so what you're gonna do is figure out

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.170 
so what you're gonna do is figure out
where<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:11.190> mold<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.580> starting<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.850> poke<00:03:12.030> out

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
where the mold is starting to poke out

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.570 
where the mold is starting to poke out
out<00:03:12.420> press<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> hole<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.410> middle<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.860> don't

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
out press a hole in the middle and don't

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.070 
out press a hole in the middle and don't
worry<00:03:14.790> you're<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.390> puncture<00:03:15.690> the

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
worry you're not going to puncture the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.920 
worry you're not going to puncture the
mold<00:03:16.320> just<00:03:16.640> don't<00:03:17.640> like<00:03:17.880> stab<00:03:18.360> down<00:03:18.630> on<00:03:18.780> it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
mold just don't like stab down on it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.380 
mold just don't like stab down on it
just<00:03:19.230> slowly<00:03:19.590> push<00:03:19.980> down<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.400> then<00:03:21.060> start

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
just slowly push down and then start

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.650 
just slowly push down and then start
rotating<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:22.050> as<00:03:22.440> you're<00:03:22.650> rotating<00:03:23.660> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
rotating and as you're rotating the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.009 
rotating and as you're rotating the
other<00:03:24.870> side<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.530> mold<00:03:25.739> should<00:03:26.100> be<00:03:26.220> showing

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
other side of the mold should be showing

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.070 
other side of the mold should be showing
so<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.110> can<00:03:28.260> see<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:30.300> side<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.720> mold<00:03:30.959> is

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
so you can see the side of the mold is

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.370 
so you can see the side of the mold is
peeking<00:03:31.769> out<00:03:31.890> there<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.330> after<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.019> do<00:03:34.200> both

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
peeking out there so after you do both

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.690 
peeking out there so after you do both
sides<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:35.010> should<00:03:35.190> have<00:03:35.340> something<00:03:35.550> like

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
sides you should have something like

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.979 
sides you should have something like
this<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.940> isn't<00:03:39.330> something<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.840> would

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
this this isn't something I would

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.320 
this this isn't something I would
recommend<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.860> immediately<00:03:41.640> take<00:03:42.000> out<00:03:42.209> your

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
recommend you immediately take out your

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.360 
recommend you immediately take out your
mold<00:03:42.570> because<00:03:43.230> when<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.680> take<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.070> out<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.220> the

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
mold because when you take it out of the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.630 
mold because when you take it out of the
mold<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.850> could<00:03:45.090> possibly<00:03:45.900> mess<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.709> up<00:03:46.800> here's

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
mold it could possibly mess it up here's

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.130 
mold it could possibly mess it up here's
an<00:03:47.760> example<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.330> what<00:03:48.510> would<00:03:48.600> happen<00:03:48.750> if<00:03:49.019> you

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
an example of what would happen if you

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.259 
an example of what would happen if you
were<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:49.530> take<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.800> out<00:03:49.950> instead<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.850> baking

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
were to take it out instead of baking

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.509 
were to take it out instead of baking
the<00:03:51.300> whole<00:03:51.510> thing<00:03:51.690> in<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.230> be<00:03:52.560> misshapen<00:03:53.160> and

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
the whole thing in it be misshapen and

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.400 
the whole thing in it be misshapen and
you're<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.210> gonna<00:03:54.360> spend<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.050> much<00:03:55.170> trouble

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
you're just gonna spend so much trouble

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.380 
you're just gonna spend so much trouble
just<00:03:55.710> trying<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.100> reshape<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.580> again<00:03:56.819> just

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
just trying to reshape it again just

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.940 
just trying to reshape it again just
don't<00:03:57.540> go<00:03:57.630> through<00:03:57.780> all<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:57.990> trouble

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
don't go through all that trouble

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.550 
don't go through all that trouble
so<00:03:59.190> take<00:03:59.490> this<00:03:59.640> into<00:03:59.910> the<00:03:59.940> oven<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.510> bake<00:04:00.569> it

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
so take this into the oven and bake it

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.350 
so take this into the oven and bake it
at<00:04:02.040> around<00:04:02.660> 260<00:04:03.950> 260<00:04:04.950> 275<00:04:05.610> according<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.209> your

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
at around 260 260 275 according to your

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.600 
at around 260 260 275 according to your
baking<00:04:07.050> directions<00:04:07.650> on<00:04:07.890> your<00:04:07.920> polymer<00:04:08.430> clay

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
baking directions on your polymer clay

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.640 
baking directions on your polymer clay
doesn't<00:04:09.090> really<00:04:09.300> matter<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.750> now<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.200> mold

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
doesn't really matter and now this mold

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.729 
doesn't really matter and now this mold
can<00:04:10.920> withstand<00:04:11.099> temperatures<00:04:12.080> around<00:04:13.080> 400

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
can withstand temperatures around 400

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.650 
can withstand temperatures around 400
degrees<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.520> don't<00:04:14.819> worry<00:04:14.910> about<00:04:15.030> it

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
degrees so don't worry about it

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.900 
degrees so don't worry about it
so<00:04:16.290> after<00:04:16.650> you're<00:04:16.769> done<00:04:16.859> baking<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.400> they<00:04:17.549> let

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
so after you're done baking it they let

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.460 
so after you're done baking it they let
the<00:04:18.060> mold<00:04:18.299> cool<00:04:18.540> down<00:04:18.720> because<00:04:18.900> it's<00:04:19.200> gonna<00:04:19.320> be

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
the mold cool down because it's gonna be

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.190 
the mold cool down because it's gonna be
really<00:04:19.680> hot<00:04:19.859> after<00:04:20.250> sun<00:04:20.519> cooling<00:04:20.790> down<00:04:21.200> be

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
really hot after sun cooling down be

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.750 
really hot after sun cooling down be
careful<00:04:22.410> when<00:04:22.800> removing<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.340> mold<00:04:23.490> because

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
careful when removing the mold because

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.150 
careful when removing the mold because
your<00:04:24.180> polymer<00:04:24.540> clay<00:04:24.660> may<00:04:24.900> be<00:04:24.960> fragile<00:04:25.260> so

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
your polymer clay may be fragile so

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.760 
your polymer clay may be fragile so
don't<00:04:26.400> take<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.760> out<00:04:27.060> like<00:04:27.389> don't<00:04:28.020> pop<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.620> out

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
don't take it out like don't pop it out

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.810 
don't take it out like don't pop it out
like<00:04:29.540> bending<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:31.190> because<00:04:32.190> if<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.400> bend<00:04:32.580> it

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
like bending it because if you bend it

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.909 
like bending it because if you bend it
the<00:04:33.150> polymer<00:04:33.510> clay<00:04:33.690> glasses<00:04:34.530> will<00:04:34.680> break

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
the polymer clay glasses will break

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.150 
the polymer clay glasses will break
since<00:04:35.280> it's<00:04:35.550> not<00:04:35.700> bendable<00:04:36.620> start<00:04:37.620> kind<00:04:37.979> of

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
since it's not bendable start kind of

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.870 
since it's not bendable start kind of
pulling<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.389> like<00:04:40.490> removing<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.669> from<00:04:41.700> the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
pulling it like removing you from the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.800 
pulling it like removing you from the
mole<00:04:42.150> just<00:04:42.419> like<00:04:42.630> start<00:04:43.110> releasing<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:44.720> so<00:04:45.720> you

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
mole just like start releasing it so you

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.840 
mole just like start releasing it so you
can<00:04:45.930> see<00:04:46.080> I'm<00:04:46.320> bending<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.160> mold<00:04:47.400> not<00:04:47.669> the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
can see I'm bending the mold not the

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.440 
can see I'm bending the mold not the
item<00:04:48.150> I'm<00:04:48.330> doing<00:04:48.690> this<00:04:50.000> when<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.150> finish

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
item I'm doing this when you finish

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.650 
item I'm doing this when you finish
doing<00:04:51.479> that<00:04:52.790> slowly<00:04:53.930> push<00:04:54.930> out<00:04:55.110> from<00:04:55.139> one<00:04:55.530> side

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
doing that slowly push out from one side

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.629 
doing that slowly push out from one side
be<00:04:57.660> mindful<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.889> polymer<00:04:59.190> clay<00:04:59.280> and<00:04:59.580> I

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
be mindful of the polymer clay and I

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.060 
be mindful of the polymer clay and I
feel<00:04:59.820> stuck<00:05:00.090> don't<00:05:00.479> try<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.840> pull<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.200> out<00:05:01.320> just

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
feel stuck don't try to pull it out just

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.900 
feel stuck don't try to pull it out just
try<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:02.280> loosen<00:05:02.639> it<00:05:03.680> there<00:05:04.680> and<00:05:04.890> there's<00:05:05.729> your

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
try to loosen it there and there's your
