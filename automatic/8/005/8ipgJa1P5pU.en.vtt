these<00:01:39.399> players<00:01:39.639> who<00:01:39.849> bought<00:01:40.029> it<00:01:40.179> bought<00:01:40.359> it<00:01:40.389> on

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
these players who bought it bought it on

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.149 
these players who bought it bought it on
the<00:01:40.689> main<00:01:40.869> accounts<00:01:41.349> which<00:01:41.709> they<00:01:41.979> had

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
the main accounts which they had

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.899 
the main accounts which they had
purchased<00:01:42.909> real<00:01:43.450> cards<00:01:43.869> for<00:01:44.229> real<00:01:44.709> money

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
purchased real cards for real money

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.370 
purchased real cards for real money
prior<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.149> starting<00:01:46.479> up<00:01:46.569> their<00:01:46.779> BOTS<00:01:47.020> so<00:01:47.229> it

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
prior to starting up their BOTS so it

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.769 
prior to starting up their BOTS so it
makes<00:01:47.560> some<00:01:47.919> kind<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.399> sense<00:01:48.479> some<00:01:49.479> kind<00:01:49.719> of

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:49.779 
makes some kind of sense some kind of

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:52.440 
makes some kind of sense some kind of
justice<00:01:50.319> though<00:01:50.950> again<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.520> softball<00:01:52.119> kind

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
justice though again the softball kind

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.139 
justice though again the softball kind
to<00:01:53.409> not<00:01:53.709> permanently<00:01:54.279> ban<00:01:54.520> their<00:01:54.729> accounts

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
to not permanently ban their accounts

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.300 
to not permanently ban their accounts
and<00:01:55.270> Blizzard<00:01:55.539> said<00:01:55.840> from<00:01:56.109> now<00:01:56.139> on<00:01:56.289> any<00:01:56.709> action

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
and Blizzard said from now on any action

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.120 
and Blizzard said from now on any action
of<00:01:58.179> botting<00:01:58.659> that's<00:01:58.869> caught<00:01:59.139> will<00:01:59.499> receive

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
of botting that's caught will receive

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.399 
of botting that's caught will receive
automatically<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.909> permanent<00:02:01.389> ban<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:01.840> that's

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
automatically a permanent ban so that's

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.260 
automatically a permanent ban so that's
pretty<00:02:02.590> much<00:02:02.770> their<00:02:02.950> future<00:02:03.219> policy<00:02:03.669> but<00:02:04.239> I

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
pretty much their future policy but I

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.620 
pretty much their future policy but I
wanted<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.749> go<00:02:04.929> over<00:02:04.959> a<00:02:05.259> few<00:02:05.799> things<00:02:06.009> because

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
wanted to go over a few things because

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.760 
wanted to go over a few things because
you<00:02:07.630> know<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.869> bots<00:02:08.229> thing<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.590> something

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
you know the bots thing is something

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.250 
you know the bots thing is something
that's<00:02:09.009> been<00:02:09.220> really<00:02:09.550> interesting<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.060> me<00:02:10.270> it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
that's been really interesting to me it

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260 
that's been really interesting to me it
just<00:02:11.440> seems<00:02:11.770> like<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.980> very<00:02:12.220> very<00:02:12.460> cool<00:02:12.730> topic

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
just seems like a very very cool topic

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.390 
just seems like a very very cool topic
of<00:02:13.530> comparing<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.650> player<00:02:15.010> playing<00:02:15.340> a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
me some information and I was thinking

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.610 
me some information and I was thinking
for<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> while<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.750> actually<00:02:33.810> start<00:02:34.320> up<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.440> bot

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
for a while to actually start up a bot

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.050 
for a while to actually start up a bot
just<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.100> what<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.460> maybe<00:02:35.910> give

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
just to see what it's like maybe give

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.150 
just to see what it's like maybe give
you<00:02:36.150> guys<00:02:36.300> some<00:02:36.540> updates<00:02:36.990> but<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.500> thought<00:02:37.950> that

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
you guys some updates but I thought that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.950 
you guys some updates but I thought that
might<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.580> pretty<00:02:38.910> awful<00:02:39.450> thing<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.660> do<00:02:39.840> at

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
might be a pretty awful thing to do at

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.420 
might be a pretty awful thing to do at
Blizzard<00:02:40.320> would<00:02:40.410> certainly<00:02:40.800> hate<00:02:41.040> me<00:02:41.190> for<00:02:41.400> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
Blizzard would certainly hate me for it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.520 
Blizzard would certainly hate me for it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
so we didn't go with that route but some

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.330

wood<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.680> can<00:03:16.830> even<00:03:16.980> set<00:03:17.250> up<00:03:17.340> your<00:03:17.460> own<00:03:17.610> tests

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
wood you can even set up your own tests

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.300 
wood you can even set up your own tests
to<00:03:18.300> make<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.810> bot<00:03:19.020> use<00:03:19.320> more<00:03:19.740> emotes<00:03:20.070> and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
to make the bot use more emotes and

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.640 
to make the bot use more emotes and
different<00:03:21.090> hovers<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.350> near<00:03:22.500> future

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
different hovers so in the near future

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.250 
different hovers so in the near future
it<00:03:23.010> will<00:03:23.220> be<00:03:23.520> nearly<00:03:23.910> impossible<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.750> spot<00:03:25.020> a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
it will be nearly impossible to spot a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.540 
it will be nearly impossible to spot a
bot<00:03:26.930> maybe<00:03:27.930> overbought<00:03:28.830> specific<00:03:29.310> missed

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.590 
plays but that could go bad player right
and<00:03:31.500> that's<00:03:31.620> that's<00:03:31.860> technically<00:03:32.430> true<00:03:32.600> even

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
and that's that's technically true even

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.660 
and that's that's technically true even
more<00:03:33.720> interesting<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.010> development<00:03:35.610> of

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
more interesting is the development of

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.110 
more interesting is the development of
the<00:03:35.760> bots

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
the bots

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.850 
the bots
AI<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.570> future<00:03:36.840> your<00:03:36.960> logs<00:03:37.200> are<00:03:37.470> sent<00:03:37.800> to

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
AI and the future your logs are sent to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.530 
AI and the future your logs are sent to
their<00:03:38.040> server<00:03:38.340> which<00:03:38.580> are<00:03:38.730> analyzed<00:03:39.180> to

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
their server which are analyzed to

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.620 
their server which are analyzed to
predict<00:03:40.020> enemy<00:03:40.680> plays<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.400> turn<00:03:41.670> let<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
predict enemy plays and in turn let the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.270 
predict enemy plays and in turn let the
bots<00:03:42.810> play<00:03:43.050> more<00:03:43.290> efficiently<00:03:43.740> according<00:03:44.220> to

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
bots play more efficiently according to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.970 
bots play more efficiently according to
situation<00:03:44.760> given<00:03:45.090> also<00:03:45.959> more<00:03:46.440> combos<00:03:46.830> are

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
situation given also more combos are

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.620 
situation given also more combos are
implemented<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.730> give<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.090> user<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.450> option

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
implemented to give the user the option

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.949 
implemented to give the user the option
to<00:03:49.260> use<00:03:49.640> more<00:03:50.640> difficult<00:03:51.120> decks<00:03:51.390> as<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.840> right

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
to use more difficult decks as of right

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.510 
to use more difficult decks as of right
now<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.170> bots<00:03:52.440> can't<00:03:52.740> handle<00:03:53.100> freeze<00:03:53.340> mage

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
now the bots can't handle freeze mage

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.370 
now the bots can't handle freeze mage
can<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.240> probably<00:03:54.630> means<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:54.959> can't

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
can it probably means that you can't

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.620 
can it probably means that you can't
handle<00:03:55.650> playing<00:03:56.160> as<00:03:56.490> a<00:03:56.550> freeze<00:03:57.120> mage<00:03:57.390> a

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
handle playing as a freeze mage a

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.060 
handle playing as a freeze mage a
miracle<00:03:58.260> rogue<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.709> bots<00:03:58.890> of

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
miracle rogue and the bots of

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.650 
miracle rogue and the bots of
difficulties<00:03:59.430> playing<00:03:59.670> around<00:03:59.970> secrets<00:04:00.510> of

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
difficulties playing around secrets of

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.780 
difficulties playing around secrets of
any<00:04:00.870> kind<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.590> that's<00:04:02.280> pretty<00:04:02.520> interesting

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
any kind so that's pretty interesting

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.990 
any kind so that's pretty interesting
message<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:04.220> later<00:04:05.220> on<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.490> got<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> message

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
message and later on I got a message

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.910 
message and later on I got a message
just<00:04:06.660> just<00:04:06.930> an<00:04:07.020> update<00:04:07.290> there's<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.680> lot<00:04:07.800> about

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
just just an update there's a lot about

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.730 
just just an update there's a lot about
this<00:04:08.070> but<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.310> thought<00:04:08.459> this<00:04:08.610> was<00:04:09.530> one<00:04:10.530> that

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
this but I thought this was one that

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.440 
this but I thought this was one that
that's<00:04:10.920> worth<00:04:11.220> mentioning<00:04:11.400> is<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.240> bot

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
that's worth mentioning is that the bot

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.030 
that's worth mentioning is that the bot
now<00:04:12.890> uses<00:04:14.270> neutral<00:04:15.270> networking<00:04:15.840> for<00:04:16.170> its

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
now uses neutral networking for its

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.340 
now uses neutral networking for its
draft<00:04:17.459> AI<00:04:17.670> so<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.060> lot<00:04:18.390> of<00:04:18.420> input<00:04:18.870> its<00:04:18.989> able<00:04:19.170> to

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
draft AI so a lot of input its able to

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.790 
draft AI so a lot of input its able to
learn<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.739> improve<00:04:19.830> in<00:04:20.459> picking<00:04:20.940> cards<00:04:21.800> if

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
learn and improve in picking cards if

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.409 
learn and improve in picking cards if
this<00:04:23.100> works<00:04:23.430> well<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:23.910> will<00:04:24.000> also<00:04:24.180> be

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
this works well it will also be

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.210 
this works well it will also be
implemented<00:04:24.780> in<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.200> bots<00:04:25.380> plane<00:04:25.800> so

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
implemented in the bots plane so

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.120 
implemented in the bots plane so
basically<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:27.360> bot<00:04:27.630> will<00:04:27.919> automatically<00:04:28.919> be

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
basically the bot will automatically be

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.060 
basically the bot will automatically be
getting<00:04:29.430> more<00:04:29.760> than

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
getting more than

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.130 
getting more than
intelligent<00:04:30.640> as<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.820> place<00:04:31.630> so<00:04:31.720> basically

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
intelligent as a place so basically

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.430 
intelligent as a place so basically
Skynet<00:04:32.710> is<00:04:32.890> totally<00:04:33.610> real<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.090> this<00:04:35.020> brings

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
Skynet is totally real and this brings

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.770 
Skynet is totally real and this brings
up<00:04:35.680> a<00:04:35.950> few<00:04:36.400> very<00:04:36.670> interesting<00:04:36.730> questions<00:04:37.630> in

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
up a few very interesting questions in

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.330 
up a few very interesting questions in
my<00:04:37.930> mind<00:04:37.960> that<00:04:38.320> I<00:04:38.380> thought<00:04:38.620> I'd<00:04:38.740> share<00:04:38.920> with

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
my mind that I thought I'd share with

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.950 
my mind that I thought I'd share with
you<00:04:39.520> guys<00:04:39.760> because<00:04:39.970> basically<00:04:40.450> this<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.930> a

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
you guys because basically this is a

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.170 
you guys because basically this is a
share<00:04:41.260> all<00:04:41.500> bot<00:04:42.340> chat<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:42.910> guess<00:04:43.410> so<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.970> first

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
share all bot chat I guess so the first

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.690 
share all bot chat I guess so the first
one<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.420> like<00:04:47.010> what's<00:04:48.010> really<00:04:48.400> going<00:04:48.610> to

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
one is like what's really going to

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.190 
one is like what's really going to
change<00:04:48.940> from<00:04:49.000> this<00:04:49.180> point<00:04:49.390> on<00:04:49.540> like<00:04:49.750> with<00:04:49.930> all

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
change from this point on like with all

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.870 
change from this point on like with all
the<00:04:50.350> people<00:04:50.530> who<00:04:50.680> were<00:04:50.800> caught

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
the people who were caught

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.480 
the people who were caught
bahding<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.810> I<00:04:53.050> can<00:04:53.800> assure<00:04:54.040> you<00:04:54.070> there<00:04:54.340> were

discussing<00:05:21.640> a<00:05:21.730> topic<00:05:21.760> of<00:05:22.210> bots

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
discussing a topic of bots

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.740 
discussing a topic of bots
since<00:05:23.650> really<00:05:24.100> they<00:05:24.280> they<00:05:25.180> were<00:05:25.240> banned<00:05:25.540> like

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
since really they they were banned like

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.110 
since really they they were banned like
months<00:05:26.110> ago<00:05:26.170> and<00:05:26.560> with<00:05:27.370> all<00:05:27.520> them<00:05:27.700> coming<00:05:27.970> back

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
months ago and with all them coming back

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.250 
months ago and with all them coming back
with<00:05:28.740> bots<00:05:29.740> still<00:05:30.130> going<00:05:30.430> on<00:05:30.580> that<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.810> lot<00:05:32.230> of

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
with bots still going on that a lot of

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.360 
with bots still going on that a lot of
people<00:05:32.470> aren't<00:05:32.620> even<00:05:32.860> aware<00:05:32.950> of

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
people aren't even aware of

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.150 
people aren't even aware of
I<00:05:34.140> don't<00:05:35.140> think<00:05:35.230> Blizzard<00:05:35.650> is<00:05:35.770> actually

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
I don't think Blizzard is actually

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.050 
I don't think Blizzard is actually
likely<00:05:36.370> to<00:05:36.550> do<00:05:36.790> anything<00:05:37.230> because<00:05:39.060> mainly

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
likely to do anything because mainly

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.510 
likely to do anything because mainly
from<00:05:40.840> what<00:05:41.020> I've<00:05:41.140> been<00:05:41.170> in<00:05:41.470> you<00:05:41.950> know<00:05:42.010> from<00:05:42.430> the

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
from what I've been in you know from the

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.710 
from what I've been in you know from the
information<00:05:42.730> I've<00:05:42.940> been<00:05:43.060> getting<00:05:43.330> it<00:05:43.450> doesn't

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
information I've been getting it doesn't

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.200 
information I've been getting it doesn't
seem<00:05:43.990> like<00:05:44.320> a<00:05:44.770> lot<00:05:45.430> of<00:05:45.460> players<00:05:45.820> really

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
seem like a lot of players really

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.630 
seem like a lot of players really
realize<00:05:46.750> when<00:05:47.470> they're<00:05:47.620> playing<00:05:47.890> the<00:05:48.010> bots<00:05:48.280> so

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
realize when they're playing the bots so

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.060 
realize when they're playing the bots so
there's<00:05:48.880> that<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.510> the<00:05:50.470> other<00:05:50.620> pretty

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
there's that and the other pretty

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.640 
there's that and the other pretty
interesting<00:05:51.670> thing<00:05:51.970> is<00:05:52.240> you<00:05:52.720> know<00:05:53.380> I<00:05:53.440> thought

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
interesting thing is you know I thought

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.980 
interesting thing is you know I thought
to<00:05:53.770> myself<00:05:53.890> is<00:05:54.160> like<00:05:54.190> does<00:05:55.150> it<00:05:55.270> really<00:05:55.570> matter

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
to myself is like does it really matter

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.760 
to myself is like does it really matter
like<00:05:56.800> if<00:05:57.010> bots<00:05:57.970> are<00:05:58.360> at<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:58.960> point<00:05:59.260> where<00:05:59.560> they

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
like if bots are at the point where they

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.200 
like if bots are at the point where they
match<00:06:00.190> or<00:06:00.460> exceed<00:06:00.670> the<00:06:02.640> ability<00:06:03.640> to<00:06:03.670> play<00:06:04.000> as

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
match or exceed the ability to play as

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.440 
match or exceed the ability to play as
well<00:06:04.480> as<00:06:04.660> an<00:06:04.810> actual<00:06:05.260> player<00:06:06.300> does<00:06:07.300> it

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
well as an actual player does it

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.840 
well as an actual player does it
actually<00:06:07.720> affect<00:06:08.260> the<00:06:08.710> game<00:06:08.920> negatively<00:06:09.670> and

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
actually affect the game negatively and

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.310 
actually affect the game negatively and
that's<00:06:10.030> that's<00:06:10.330> really<00:06:10.660> a<00:06:10.780> very<00:06:10.960> interesting

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
that's that's really a very interesting

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.770 
that's that's really a very interesting
question<00:06:11.620> because<00:06:12.000> you<00:06:13.000> know<00:06:13.030> when<00:06:13.480> you<00:06:13.570> queue

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
question because you know when you queue

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.600 
question because you know when you queue
up<00:06:13.870> the<00:06:13.900> game<00:06:14.170> yeah<00:06:14.530> you're<00:06:15.100> thinking<00:06:15.490> you're

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
up the game yeah you're thinking you're

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.650 
up the game yeah you're thinking you're
playing<00:06:15.850> against<00:06:16.120> opponents<00:06:16.600> but<00:06:18.660> honestly

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
playing against opponents but honestly

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.750 
playing against opponents but honestly
that<00:06:20.110> could<00:06:20.350> be<00:06:20.500> just<00:06:20.770> a<00:06:20.860> disguise<00:06:21.250> and<00:06:21.580> if

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
that could be just a disguise and if

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.970 
that could be just a disguise and if
you're<00:06:21.910> having<00:06:22.060> just<00:06:22.390> as<00:06:22.570> much<00:06:22.600> fun<00:06:22.810> and<00:06:23.260> the

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
you're having just as much fun and the

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.340 
you're having just as much fun and the
bots<00:06:24.160> aren't<00:06:24.550> really<00:06:24.880> hurting<00:06:25.300> too<00:06:25.930> much<00:06:26.110> as

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
bots aren't really hurting too much as

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.290 
bots aren't really hurting too much as
long<00:06:26.560> as<00:06:26.590> they're<00:06:26.950> not<00:06:26.980> all<00:06:27.430> you<00:06:27.880> know<00:06:27.910> see

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
long as they're not all you know see

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.000 
long as they're not all you know see
giant<00:06:28.600> Shamanov<00:06:29.140> playing<00:06:29.380> the<00:06:29.470> exact<00:06:29.770> same

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
giant Shamanov playing the exact same

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.430 
giant Shamanov playing the exact same
way<00:06:30.250> if<00:06:31.210> you<00:06:31.420> don't<00:06:31.510> realize<00:06:32.110> that<00:06:32.140> you're

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
way if you don't realize that you're

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.860 
way if you don't realize that you're
playing<00:06:32.650> a<00:06:32.800> bot<00:06:33.010> it<00:06:33.850> doesn't<00:06:34.240> seem<00:06:34.480> that<00:06:34.510> it

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
playing a bot it doesn't seem that it

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.120 
playing a bot it doesn't seem that it
has<00:06:35.530> too<00:06:35.980> much<00:06:36.160> harm<00:06:36.490> so<00:06:37.830> interesting<00:06:38.830> stuff

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
has too much harm so interesting stuff

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.560 
has too much harm so interesting stuff
just<00:06:39.730> thought<00:06:39.880> I<00:06:39.910> mentioned<00:06:40.120> that<00:06:40.270> kind<00:06:40.510> of

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
just thought I mentioned that kind of

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.380 
just thought I mentioned that kind of
stuff<00:06:40.780> and<00:06:41.070> you<00:06:42.070> know<00:06:42.160> maybe<00:06:42.850> it's<00:06:43.120> something

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.390 
stuff and you know maybe it's something

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.860 
stuff and you know maybe it's something
you<00:06:43.450> can<00:06:43.630> say

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
you can say

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.950 
you can say
I<00:06:43.930> think<00:06:44.800> because<00:06:45.790> it's<00:06:45.970> been<00:06:46.180> such<00:06:46.600> you<00:06:46.870> know

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
I think because it's been such you know

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.310 
I think because it's been such you know
on<00:06:47.110> the<00:06:47.230> download<00:06:47.740> with<00:06:47.890> the<00:06:47.980> bot<00:06:48.160> thing<00:06:48.490> that

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
on the download with the bot thing that

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.630 
on the download with the bot thing that
you<00:06:50.320> know<00:06:50.440> from<00:06:50.620> now<00:06:50.800> on<00:06:50.950> you<00:06:51.070> should<00:06:51.280> maybe

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640
