 with such a record of success this title of 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.060
 the european champion 2000 a particular flavor to the quran 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.050
 nasa a title it always has a particular flavor it's always a pleasure 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.220
 in e2 creeping but as a penalty because we hump for that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.300
 we start again when we are small we always dream of 5 over 10 years that 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.190
 that's always a pleasure 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.810
 thanks to yves bot who will see a little bit of it before karim is a 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.370
 derived from these packages specificity it caen his fray and this is what at 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.660
 international level going up more often than it is you leave 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.930
 from kibbutz there were only acts of genius acts 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.580
 when we had been very good taste of world champions european champions 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.090
 belt 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.060
 of champion do we have the impression that the combat sports in France are 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.150
 recognized for their fair value compared to other countries including the 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.040
 unfortunate but no unfortunately she compared to work that is 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.750
 provided and did not recognize its true value 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.150
 compared to our country to us who are just border where we are 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.920
 much more known the media mans and roanne is much longer 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.850
 we know now it's mine unfortunately france is not 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.110
 always behind 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.140
 do we have another one and when we have a track record like yours for 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.980
 is one of the two best European and Euro boxers 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.270
 all sides of the world's best it is necessary to box regularly 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.350
 that is to say we are paid at the stamp only populated for the tic for the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.940
 fights here exactly to trigger undertake books 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.179
 to my tastes at the start of boxing 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.830
 a sport that is still pretty hard is not immune to the injury 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.530
 so that on x-box not regularly comparing between parents and children 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.720
 to progress continue to decline in taste 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.990
 the beast and the boxing world was obviously thailand got 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.250
 did you go to Holland did you too 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.310
 this year so they have only one goal quite magic and would make 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.700
 again to prepare for the coming because thailand will make sure 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.820
 improve 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.970
 we'll improve the little flaws we have as it's really 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.820
 important to win I think I can progress 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.229
 it's harder as training is harder we're really in the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.539
 situation is 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.239
 here's typical training have made that his bank in Switzerland aim to make 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.899
 to improve technically is that and that's it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.489
 it is less comfortable is that in France the conditions of training the 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.589
 pour but it's not worse because I'm comfortable more c rer 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.929
 and more sober and it will be better for us 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.709
 ie those of the opposition who is strong it is the lifestyle that is 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.169
 more 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.709
 the glider if you teaching courses a day falls under the 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.480
 once hard mentally there is heat and is very very hot 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.340
 run in the morning to run the afternoon that can only strengthen mental 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.039
 it's not the same regime that you propose to train children to 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.659
 Strasbourg is% 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.650
 totally agree it's a little softer so for me I take care of the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.769
 March session near the base at 4 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.059
 of bazas the others so yes I have young people from the youngest and young people 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:49.309
 all ages so as we do not obviously do the same training because 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:53.189
 that it's true alain dreyfus but hey we teach them right away the basics that 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.999
 I had the chance to learn in London 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.539
 how can we attract young people like that to children or teenagers in 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:02.069
 combat sports without scare the programs in a few long vietnam me 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.529
 what I would like to tell them first and foremost is that Thai boxing is an art 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.599
 martial and it's a way of life 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.449
 it's not just banging on it 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:11.209
 he boxed at the request a lot of respect so there are often young people 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.019
 unemployed people coming to my room 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.959
 for he begins his show mixing redefine the session they are 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.620
 least help the most asked by the central suite by getting acquainted 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.479
 values ​​of Thai boxing 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.829
 what are these launch tests apart from the side this party was a place 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.669
 physical remains of human remains first and foremost there is respect for the rules and 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.569
 precisely a healthy lifestyle 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.399
 w a few tracks in English hiring also in quebec only 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.189
 consequences completely different from them 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.249
 of boxing feet-fists either bockstael them who informed us of a session 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.279
 a complement the boxing massage massa complement so I went back to 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:45.610
 boxing-club quibble here is a vest of three times a week 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.070
 and the five good complements because when we arrive in foot-fist oman air 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.000
 vision of the fight 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.720
 and since I'm seriously training in reasoning we're going 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.329
 to say I love you almost all filled points 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.820
 it's the same we can have goals 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.690
 it takes at your age 28 participatory years they ordered 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.530
 goals in boxing this is it's still a workout I could in 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.570
 to have but I'm not going to get to have some because that's who think at once 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.480
 by his lover all 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.519
 all these years we'll do I'll do it 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.019
 but first of all I really want to progress to be stronger in 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.009
 fists feet 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.909
 until the end of summer can go to the end of this recovery to the states 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.509
 continental in the different Thai boxing federations ben if you 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.680
 want at the level of the titles I pretty much won everything but I was able 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.680
 approve of belts I have plenty at home and even more classy 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.350
 but what I want is really met the mayors improve the 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.720
 world's best beating the best riders go up in rank that's what 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.830
 I am looking for everything 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.740
 it's the difficulty of the bbox and that is it or theft of several 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.300
 federations just like in boxing 1% but less co2 than the most we have 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.060
 hard to get together 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.870
 fillol clear the federation little more lead containing death currently 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.770
 the biggest federation still makes the wkn 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.509
 it is true that barely federation I am titled in four federations 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.490
 different 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.940
 so that's the goal of me what ever before everything is beat the champions 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.949
 obsessed for them is to gather a maximum of titles 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.930
 but as said it's not my thing and marc were severely beaten mr 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.050
 a next meeting dances and already fixed 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.419
