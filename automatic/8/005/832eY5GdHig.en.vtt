00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.570
 and 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.220
 and what's the point here is the code agent 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.430
 I welcome you to tutorial 7 of 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.110
 game development course with html5 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.420
 remember that we are probably 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.300
 seeing fundamentals and good in the day of 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.169
 today we are going to learn to draw pads in 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.380
 canvas for that we're going to use as 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.200
 example this face well the important thing 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.120
 it's not obviously not learning to draw 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.620
 what you are seeing on the screen but more 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.740
 well see how it works in vic impact and 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.830
 move to that are two methods that we are going to 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.610
 see well to start drawing 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.080
 let's call the viking path method 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.390
 so with that we started a new pack 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.020
 I'm going to place some methods for now 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.520
 to draw the eyes arq 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.430
 we will place the first one with the 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.430
 position as 50 as 50.10 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.609
 this is the pupil within a diameter 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:16.789
 of 10 and it's going to do a full circle 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:16.789
 then it will go from scratch 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.360
 360 and here we are going to put between the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.130
 old wise that is not so relevant 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.890
 well let's put it so that after 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.940
 there are no problems and then we will 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.930
 place good and what is the eye I'm going 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.090
 copy and paste this over here is 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.990
 worry about the tutorial, it's not about this 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.350
 because the arc method we already saw it 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.840
 before then I'm going to draw the 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.890
 the second pupils I 'll put it in 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.979
 the 150 x 50 coordinate of leads to 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.190
 have a diameter of 10 and perfect and 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.700
 finally he 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.590
 the second eye 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.590
 that will have a diameter of 30 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.890
 and I think it's going to be here from 90 and 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.100
 which is a false 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.000
 let's see what it is that draws 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.340
 we update so we forget that after 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.380
 that we put a method a pad 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.450
 to be able to draw the pad this already 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.060
 we saw earlier we used a method 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.880
 stroke we saw this in the tutorial 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.230
 passed well 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.120
 how can you tell 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.209
 this is not what we are 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.700
 looking for each time we move 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.010
 the context for the other side to 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.959
 draw the arc elsewhere what 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.530
 does canvas is to draw a line from 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:57.849
 from there and move it in fact it seems to me that 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:02.540
 the second and the second eye is wrong 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.909
 drawn but if we update there is 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.849
 you do not see anything right as I say good 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.730
 this line trace every time you move 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.209
 the context 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.350
 it's not at all at all what 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.250
 we 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.250
 we want 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.269
 all right 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.860
 and it seems that you have to move the second to 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.040
 180 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.890
 there it is there it's good there you can already see 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.569
 the eyes as I had them at the beginning 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.609
 but because he is drawing these lines 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.730
 He does this because every time he tries 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.200
 to make the stroke of a pad 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:47.410
 draw a line from the last point 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.390
 for example here draw the eye arch 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.970
 end here 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.740
 and then good drag it to draw 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.319
 the eye first we draw the eye of 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.300
 in the middle he pulls it to draw the eye 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.040
 big then pull it to draw the 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.120
 another in the middle and then pull it to 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.120
 draw the other govern 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.340
 the handling of pads has a method for 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.590
 that we avoid that and the how 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.330
 find the right coordinates for 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.150
 that the figures come out good is going to 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.850
 require that you are testing and playing 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.030
 a bit with the values ​​the method that 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.910
 serves to make the movement without 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.410
 a line is called move to and what 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.350
 what it does is simply move the 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.230
 context from one place to another for example 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.480
 here back the circle and before drawing 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.850
 the next arc moves the context and what 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.790
 place at this point and then if you already 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:45.560
 draw without plotting that horrible line no 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.590
 then let's see let's go back to 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.200
 apply every time we move the 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.050
 context 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.490
 the place where you have to move the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.280
 context is the place where you go to 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.350
 start drawing 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.720
 the next the next line in the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.650
 next stroke that in this case good 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.969
 these bows are pure but in other cases 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.249
 are going to be this lines 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.009
 and it's so perfect then we have 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:17.189
 the eyes 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:19.650
 for example we draw the arch from the 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:23.009
 point where it was finished looking for the 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.729
 we move it to the coordinate 50 x 80 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:29.159
 from there in 50 of x 80 that is this 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.080
 point begins to trace the bow and then 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.020
 we move it again to trace the 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.169
 next figure 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.470
 well perfect it looks pretty that you spend 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.460
 I after giving stroke I want to draw 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:47.250
 more things 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:50.099
 for example the smile 30 to radials that 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.970
 let's put 0 and again to radial 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:56.420
 and that we're going to place 180 and here's good 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.560
 let's see what happens 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:04.700
 so whenever you add something must 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.660
 call this so that even after 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.660
 that I give a stroke 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:12.760
 the figure comes back to trace another 

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:15.070
 stripe 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.470
 the solution that we can give you 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:21.040
 to that is 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:24.460
 one use again move to or another 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.920
 would start a new pack every time 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.870
 we started a new pad the context 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.880
 loses the information of the last point 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.490
 in which it was and well it draws the 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.700
 next circle the next stroke 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.940
 from the position in which we 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.440
 we are indicating then this is how 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.300
 the trace of irregular figures works 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.330
 in this case, everything is 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.270
 doing with bows but now other 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.820
 occasions when you have to use 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.820
 rectangles or others are 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.340
 other types of strokes so far the 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.509
 tutorial today I send you a greeting and to 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.509
 hernandez thank you very much
