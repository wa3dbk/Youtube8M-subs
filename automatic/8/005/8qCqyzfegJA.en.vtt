00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.140 

okay<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.920> on<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:03.200> 2000<00:00:04.580> Toyota<00:00:05.580> Camry

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
okay this is on the 2000 Toyota Camry

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.379 
okay this is on the 2000 Toyota Camry
and<00:00:06.649> it<00:00:07.649> calls<00:00:07.890> for<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.130> special<00:00:08.610> puller<00:00:08.880> for

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
and it calls for a special puller for

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.879 
and it calls for a special puller for
the<00:00:11.570> harmonic<00:00:12.570> balancer<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.200> get<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.559> off<00:00:13.679> if

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
the harmonic balancer to get it off if

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.560 
the harmonic balancer to get it off if
you're<00:00:14.009> doing<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.250> timing<00:00:14.639> belt<00:00:14.670> or<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.420> need

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
you're doing a timing belt or you need

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.960 
you're doing a timing belt or you need
to<00:00:15.599> replace<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:16.230> or<00:00:16.440> anything<00:00:16.650> like<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.970> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
to replace it or anything like that and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.429 
to replace it or anything like that and
if<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.390> don't<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.810> puller<00:00:19.080> or<00:00:19.199> you

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
if you don't have that puller or you

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.040 
if you don't have that puller or you
don't<00:00:19.560> want<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.830> buy<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.039> or<00:00:20.720> here's<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> quick

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
don't want to buy it or here's a quick

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.670 
don't want to buy it or here's a quick
tip<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:24.019> Toyota<00:00:25.019> Camrys<00:00:25.529> but

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
tip it's not just for Toyota Camrys but

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.410 
tip it's not just for Toyota Camrys but
you<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:25.920> use<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.310> principle<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> lot<00:00:27.300> of

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
you can use this principle with a lot of

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.290 
you can use this principle with a lot of
different<00:00:27.720> harmonic<00:00:28.130> balancers<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:30.060> just

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
different harmonic balancers you just

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.639 
different harmonic balancers you just
take<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> little<00:00:30.720> ratchet<00:00:31.439> strap<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:33.350> weed<00:00:34.350> one

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
take a little ratchet strap and weed one

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.209 
take a little ratchet strap and weed one
end<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> inside<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.739> what<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.860> want<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> do

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
end of it inside and what you want to do

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.280 
end of it inside and what you want to do
is<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.489> want<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> try<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> wrap<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.989> around<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
is you want to try to wrap it around the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.290 
is you want to try to wrap it around the
center<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:42.090> harmonic<00:00:42.899> balancer<00:00:43.910> on<00:00:44.910> PT

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
center of the harmonic balancer on PT

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.029 
center of the harmonic balancer on PT
Cruisers<00:00:45.719> you'll<00:00:45.930> notice<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.829> don't

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
Cruisers you'll notice that you don't

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.420 
Cruisers you'll notice that you don't
have<00:00:47.510> any<00:00:48.510> little<00:00:49.140> arms<00:00:49.500> inside<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.129> wrap<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
have any little arms inside to wrap it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.450 
have any little arms inside to wrap it
around<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.930> space<00:00:52.410> between<00:00:52.829> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
around but if you have space between a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.760 
around but if you have space between a
harmonic<00:00:53.910> balancer<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.289> timing<00:00:55.649> belt

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
harmonic balancer and the timing belt

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.849 
harmonic balancer and the timing belt
cover<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.670> back<00:00:56.899> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.050> still<00:00:58.320> wrap<00:00:58.620> one

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
cover in the back you can still wrap one

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.470 
cover in the back you can still wrap one
of<00:00:58.980> these<00:00:59.100> straps<00:00:59.430> around<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> whole

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
of these straps around the whole

of these straps around the whole
harmonic<00:01:01.410> balancer<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:04.220> then<00:01:05.390> do<00:01:06.390> what

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
harmonic balancer and and then do what

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.490 
harmonic balancer and and then do what
we're<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> show<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.110> here<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.470> just

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
we're going to show you here in just

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.350 
we're going to show you here in just
second<00:01:09.680> but<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.920> point<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.280> try<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> pull<00:01:12.150> on

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
second but the point is try to pull on

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.859 
second but the point is try to pull on
the<00:01:12.450> center<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.850> balancer<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.720> don't

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the center as the balancer so you don't

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.649 
the center as the balancer so you don't
bend<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> or<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.000> don't<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
bend it or so that you don't get that

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.370 
bend it or so that you don't get that
via<00:01:20.000> crank<00:01:21.000> or<00:01:21.210> anything<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
via crank or anything like that all in a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.980 
via crank or anything like that all in a
bind

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.690 

he's<00:01:27.590> went<00:01:27.740> through<00:01:27.890> one<00:01:28.040> side<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.580> he's

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
he's went through one side and he's

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.580 
he's went through one side and he's
going<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:28.880> go<00:01:29.000> through<00:01:29.270> another<00:01:29.900> side<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:30.470> he

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
going to go through another side so he

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.649 
going to go through another side so he
can<00:01:30.770> get<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:33.200> force<00:01:33.500> of<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.659> pulling

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
can get the the force of the pulling

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.680 
can get the the force of the pulling
power<00:01:35.840> on<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.290> center<00:01:37.150> if<00:01:38.150> you<00:01:38.240> have<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.420> slide

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
power on the center if you have a slide

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.510 
power on the center if you have a slide
hammer<00:01:38.930> that's<00:01:39.290> what<00:01:39.500> we're<00:01:39.619> going<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.860> use<00:01:40.130> to

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
hammer that's what we're going to use to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.480 
hammer that's what we're going to use to
to<00:01:41.390> pull<00:01:41.630> this<00:01:41.810> out<00:01:42.100> you're<00:01:43.100> going<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.310> notice

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
to pull this out you're going to notice

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.770 
to pull this out you're going to notice
that<00:01:43.640> it's<00:01:43.880> going<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.060> save<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.330> lot<00:01:44.479> of<00:01:44.509> time

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
that it's going to save a lot of time

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.660 
that it's going to save a lot of time
and<00:01:45.080> it's<00:01:45.409> super<00:01:45.950> super<00:01:46.880> easy<00:01:47.330> then<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:49.369> try<00:01:49.640> to

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
and it's super super easy then to try to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.580 
and it's super super easy then to try to
use<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.090> pullers<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.420> if<00:01:50.869> you've<00:01:51.020> ever<00:01:51.320> tried

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
use the pullers and if you've ever tried

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.700 
use the pullers and if you've ever tried
to<00:01:51.770> use<00:01:51.800> one<00:01:52.460> of<00:01:52.909> those<00:01:53.470> pullers<00:01:54.470> with<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
to use one of those pullers with the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.249 
to use one of those pullers with the
boats<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.550> go<00:01:55.759> into<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.240> two<00:01:56.420> threads

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
boats that go into the two threads

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.770 
boats that go into the two threads
inside<00:01:57.950> this<00:01:58.190> particular<00:01:58.820> harmonic<00:01:59.300> balancer

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
inside this particular harmonic balancer

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.430 
inside this particular harmonic balancer
you<00:02:00.590> will<00:02:00.860> notice<00:02:01.429> that<00:02:01.700> they<00:02:02.300> usually<00:02:02.660> break

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
you will notice that they usually break

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:12.150 
you will notice that they usually break
before<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.070> pulls<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.520> out<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:10.239> he's<00:02:11.239> getting

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
before it pulls it out so he's getting

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.040 
before it pulls it out so he's getting
see<00:02:13.160> what<00:02:13.310> he's<00:02:13.400> doing<00:02:13.610> over<00:02:13.670> here<00:02:17.050> just

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
see what he's doing over here just

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.720 
see what he's doing over here just
hooking<00:02:18.470> up<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.680> strap<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.519> way<00:02:19.670> you

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
hooking up the strap to it that way you

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.509 
hooking up the strap to it that way you
get<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.060> full<00:02:20.360> circle<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.050> could<00:02:21.200> also

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
get to full circle you could also

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.070 
get to full circle you could also
probably<00:02:22.519> tie<00:02:24.940> tie<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.269> this<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.810> kind

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
probably tie tie it but this just kind

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.309 
probably tie tie it but this just kind
of<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.680> lot<00:02:27.980> easier<00:02:28.420> or<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.480> could<00:02:29.870> get<00:02:29.989> a<00:02:30.050> a

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
of a lot easier or you could get a a

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.080 
of a lot easier or you could get a a
really<00:02:30.650> strong<00:02:30.920> rope<00:02:31.250> or<00:02:31.489> something<00:02:31.820> but<00:02:32.000> we

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
really strong rope or something but we

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.000 
really strong rope or something but we
like<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.269> use<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.660> straps<00:02:32.930> because<00:02:33.350> they<00:02:33.500> lay

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
like to use the straps because they lay

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.190 
like to use the straps because they lay
out<00:02:34.040> real<00:02:34.489> flat<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.209> they're<00:02:35.750> pretty<00:02:35.959> strong

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
out real flat and they're pretty strong

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.769 
out real flat and they're pretty strong
because<00:02:36.470> they're<00:02:36.620> woven
