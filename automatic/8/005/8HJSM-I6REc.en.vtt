00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.480
 le deep are a great multi exercise 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.580
 articular that stimulates above all 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.320
 triceps but also the chest especially 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.300
 the lower part at the shoulders in 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.160
 particular front deltoids is a 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.840
 great exercise was done well but 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.730
 first times it can give problems 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.829
 first because it is an exercise that can 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.750
 be really very hard on the shoulders 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.760
 could cause injury if you overdo it 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.380
 especially the first few times when i 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.059
 interested ligaments are not yet 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.470
 quite resistant 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.270
 second because it can be a little 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.160
 hard to learn you have to find 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.960
 the right balance to avoid 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.530
 swing excessively while you are 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.910
 place 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.520
 therefore the first few times it is necessary to have 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.530
 be patient so do it slowly with weights 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.180
 very light and very slowly for 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.650
 give time the shoulder muscles of 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.570
 get used to and find good 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.080
 balance always keep your back 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.880
 starboard 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.190
 the head high and for the whole movement 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.410
 keep the imposition shoulder blades adopts e 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.560
 the chest out concentrating on doing 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.210
 work your triceps well to start 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.130
 position the chairs so that 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.270
 backrests are a few centimeters from the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.740
 your hips 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.630
 if the chairs have a back a little 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.820
 inconvenient to hold used large 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.990
 gloves make sure the chairs don't 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.940
 can move 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.220
 I usually keep the first one attached 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.840
 on the wall is the second to the block with gods 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.670
 heavy discs started from this 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.710
 position with arms completely 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.570
 expanses started to descend slowly 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.000
 until arm and forearm 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.250
 will be about perpendicular not 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.420
 go down more to avoid soliciting 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.310
 excessively the ligaments of the shoulders 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.470
 ascents is then returned to the position 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.970
 starting when you are at the top 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.760
 wait a moment for the oscillations 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.240
 end up and be really still and then 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.159
 repeat if you already know how to work freely 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.060
 do many repetitions of this 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.119
 exercise 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.799
 you can add weight with a belt 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.409
 on the contrary if bodyweight not 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.640
 you still manage to do enough 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.840
 repetitions do only the portion 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.760
 negative for the year 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.280
 until you are strong enough to 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.920
 do the complete exercise 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.259
 go down very slowly too 34 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.580
 seconds and then help yourself with your legs to 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.580
 return to the starting position
