when you want to change direction pause

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.620 
when you want to change direction pause
you<00:00:31.800> retrieve<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.430> allow<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.969> head<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.300> flip

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
you retrieve and allow the head to flip

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.080 
you retrieve and allow the head to flip
then<00:00:34.350> resume<00:00:34.680> really

as<00:00:37.920> triggerfish<00:00:38.920> gets<00:00:39.160> closer<00:00:39.460> you<00:00:40.090> should

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
as triggerfish gets closer you should

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.300 
as triggerfish gets closer you should
lower<00:00:40.480> your<00:00:40.540> rod<00:00:40.840> tip<00:00:41.010> finishing<00:00:42.010> near<00:00:42.190> the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.250 

another<00:00:51.550> technique<00:00:51.790> is<00:00:52.239> to<00:00:52.300> real<00:00:52.690> very<00:00:52.960> slowly

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
another technique is to real very slowly

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.360 
another technique is to real very slowly
then<00:00:54.160> back<00:00:54.430> off<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.820> speed<00:00:55.090> slightly

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
then back off the speed slightly

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.440 
then back off the speed slightly
