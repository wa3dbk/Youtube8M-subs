00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.800
 Hello again 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.090
 afp some the service do not write that I want to share while working seen 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.619
 apart from the search engine with the 'save the strut' to the cover of the 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:14.689
 the motor 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.689
 because it is easier to remove it from the engine and the other components 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.099
 Well I recommend this stage in the coming days 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.759
 It is important 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.020
 decently mark where I was 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.810
 lala 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.259
 lala 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.370
 3 with a pencil or a lung 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.090
 because if we can put the remedies exactly where is it good that not 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.420
 will be dominating at the time of refueling Luis Serrano 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.280
 why not just because we want to go with your brand they propose us perfectly 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.480
 where it was 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.010
 another thing 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.129
 there they are installing hoses 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.289
 he assured that a company to put labels on each of these things 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.310
 to know 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.490
 where he was from and where they came from 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.690
 and so you may not be sure that we do not need anything 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.690
 also, mount that what we are discounting does not have to be returned to 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.290
 represent no side 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.570
 simply 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.940
 sense mark of cheese nor where they were going 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.530
 third 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.090
 for security it is very good 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.800
 that is to remove the gas that is left to the gas tank car 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.440
 and you can even get 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.510
 putting the swich with the fuel line disconnected and will speak in 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.400
 a deposit in a common dog 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.350
 puberty 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.390
 so that the same pump of the gas tank 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.800
 I pushed gasoline out 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.610
 It is much better to do it without gasol in the tank by safety fences of the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.990
 town that we are going to give 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.270
 disconnect and explained that the pampero 90 jobs in this car 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.390
 in we want to move also any weight that is not needed 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.150
 while more lightness in carlet and communes when it will give us 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.730
 ain this case is to have a car 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.080
 with the blocks he talked to with him and with the engine he can impose 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.790
 I hope it is in a range of soon if kilometers per charge 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.960
 avn noyola side 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 squares half of the Basques an art 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:16.719
 but of what he owes for coming soon a dollar 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.679
 i 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:21.069
 that is something extremely 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.209
 a fifth of the cost of units like this sale 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.809
 two months for reasons of economy it must be very good to have a car 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.659
 electric 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.549
 I'll decide what I want to show is I fortify this engine out now towards 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.799
 out and share my experiences while I did not like pain value 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:39.729
 human 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:40.919
 thanks
