factors that we have to improve and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.090 
factors that we have to improve and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
very important factor that we need to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.870 
very important factor that we need to
improve<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.350> reducing<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> costs<00:01:23.790> of

increase<00:02:23.219> in<00:02:23.760> growth<00:02:24.090> we've<00:02:24.599> also<00:02:24.810> figured

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
increase in growth we've also figured

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.860 
increase in growth we've also figured
out<00:02:25.499> how<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.969> engineer<00:02:26.969> out<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.329> to<00:02:27.450> make<00:02:27.629> more

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
out how to engineer out you to make more

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.839 
out how to engineer out you to make more
oil<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.500> at<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.889> time<00:02:29.129> that<00:02:29.189> we<00:02:29.519> want<00:02:29.670> to

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
oil so at the time that we want to

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.000 
oil so at the time that we want to
harvest<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.359> algae<00:02:30.719> will<00:02:31.349> induce<00:02:31.769> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
harvest the algae will induce the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.099 
harvest the algae will induce the
expression<00:02:32.609> of<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.879> gene<00:02:32.909> that<00:02:33.450> will<00:02:33.510> cause<00:02:33.780> all

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
expression of a gene that will cause all

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:35.869 
expression of a gene that will cause all
the<00:02:34.260> algae<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.620> stick<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.159> each<00:02:35.310> other

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
the algae to stick to each other

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.670 
the algae to stick to each other
settle<00:02:36.480> out<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.780> pond<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.079> then<00:02:37.349> we<00:02:37.469> pick

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
settle out of the pond and then we pick

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.190 
settle out of the pond and then we pick
them<00:02:37.829> up<00:02:37.950> maybe<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.639> last<00:02:38.879> reason<00:02:39.299> why<00:02:40.019> we

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
them up maybe the last reason why we

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.559 
them up maybe the last reason why we
like<00:02:40.349> algae<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.159> that<00:02:41.519> we<00:02:41.639> can<00:02:41.849> recycle<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
like algae is that we can recycle the

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.339 
like algae is that we can recycle the
nutrients<00:02:43.139> that<00:02:43.950> are<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.459> waste<00:02:44.849> waters<00:02:45.480> algae

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
nutrients that are in waste waters algae

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.330 
nutrients that are in waste waters algae
can<00:02:47.389> do<00:02:48.389> wastewater<00:02:48.989> treatment<00:02:49.319> better<00:02:49.949> than

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
can do wastewater treatment better than

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.849 
can do wastewater treatment better than
conventional<00:02:51.060> systems<00:02:51.299> so<00:02:51.989> why<00:02:52.199> not<00:02:52.379> take<00:02:52.650> an

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
conventional systems so why not take an

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.789 
conventional systems so why not take an
energy<00:02:53.310> intensive<00:02:54.239> expensive<00:02:55.019> process<00:02:55.319> and

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
energy intensive expensive process and

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.939 
energy intensive expensive process and
turn<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.159> into<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.819> energy<00:02:57.750> generating<00:02:58.500> system

00:02:58.939 --> 00:02:58.949 
turn it into a energy generating system

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.589 
turn it into a energy generating system
where<00:02:59.159> you're<00:02:59.310> getting<00:02:59.639> clean<00:02:59.969> water<00:03:00.269> and

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
where you're getting clean water and

liquid<00:03:01.169> fuels<00:03:01.530> as<00:03:01.859> your<00:03:02.099> two<00:03:02.280> products<00:03:02.909> and<00:03:03.090> do

liquid fuels as your two products and do

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.929 
liquid fuels as your two products and do
that<00:03:04.169> in<00:03:04.409> a<00:03:04.530> way<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.680> generates<00:03:05.400> revenue

that in a way that generates revenue

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.859 
that in a way that generates revenue
