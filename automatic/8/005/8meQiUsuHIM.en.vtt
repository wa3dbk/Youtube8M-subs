00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.330
 by the pastor nice that you watch your new episode of 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.649
 million hunt episode lf hierden chosen on suitcase with 13 people 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:07.240
 role 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.560
 master accident number but this time it's going to be your lucky suitcase 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.630
 we hope the briefcase number 13 what is in store for us 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.680
 10,000 for a serious relationship amounts to the head so far 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:20.409
 had 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.599
 I wonder if he can participate with which could improve steam 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.929
 we are going to see if it is the air to come up with something creative where 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.859
 I don't know what to do with 10,000 corus so I think so 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.020
 I just opened a bit of silver and let the rest sit 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.140
 what strikes me is that parliament is no 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.960
 belga tw 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.399
 attend those sexting every day 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.399
 the aex rose to is price 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.940
 8 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.149
 who very annoying normally did the mistake this has really been this is wide 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.019
 well 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.219
 bit difficult it is to get them ltd in our team the five door killer 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.889
 this is really sick maybe the next episode can grab kois and then 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:02.119
 the nicest diana beer team would be the winemakers so it would be pretty funny 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.690
 to play once welten what is that could have him in the club but 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.440
 so that was the perfect choice to put that coffee in the oven 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.130
 and just the ex friend player you beak that is in itself a blue dive 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.160
 market tackle every 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
 the silver are in the helicopter deck 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.060
 thank you 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.299
 We then go to the regular game play divisions maybe 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.100
 when in whistler she suffers 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.730
 we can found the opponent 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.160
 He has five defenders to be serious 84 label the team spirit Bayern 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.260
 munich team go with this is not the fastest the band is not the fastest xabi 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.649
 Alonso not the fastest that wouldn't be the fastest 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.579
 hopefully we can do a good job with stolen your team there 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.789
 drawings of the beech I think it is mostly ignored by his defense 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:44.820
 to try to run 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.240
 because it is all ball accelerated 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.100
 mean cool number ten is 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.770
 it was nice and true 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.770
 but from brook we genuinely had the ball 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.149
 japan goes 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.159
 Exactly that is to make a certain offense he also gets 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.219
 great right whatever is just right of psion so comes in sneaks it goes with 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.730
 teenagers than they had the one unfortunately holds 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:06.640
 per cent 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.850
 maybe 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.520
 the so incredibly bad 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.760
 yes of course that's the way it is going to be a difficult one 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.390
 episode be i hate my body yes now then right after the the penalty we 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.469
 have missed 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.329
 managed to score better 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.399
 today is not in a day 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.049
 are six years backwards every point where you let yourself be heard what this city 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.629
 mostly the zeeuwse road forecast 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:36.019
 I do not know if it is possible to tell church or not yet but I have exams 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:36.510
 school 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.480
 that is why it determines a little later than normal because it must of course also 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.820
 always did g4s make vt4 flavors that come on top saturday and sunday 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.919
 online 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.589
 so that's why I don't think it's on that weekend 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:51.889
 with the ladies an equally important must therefore focus on school hence I 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:52.270
 not 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.980
 so many chile videos can make me used to it I still had your buttocks 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.259
 bared thumb up wanting to leave tours super appreciated 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.429
 also in that period it is therefore a little less time to come and play now 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.219
 and hopefully you won't mind that 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:07.969
 that's the village 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.859
 come on small you also a little avro two games that that state law 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:12.419
 that this 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.999
 the law state that this 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:18.470
 the piece shorter yes always on again 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.030
 who what is stopping you 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.950
 after deliberation make themselves look then go and award that colonel 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.950
 money on eels will not be sidelined 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.019
 this is this every 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.119
 for sure no pin between concise and he goes yes with that score 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.179
 that's why i'm so stupid 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:42.179
 you pay your hd 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.990
 we also watch the man just nothing could always leave but just not 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.779
 to score 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.139
 this is every time warehouse hit her car 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.139
 newspaper 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:03:59.729
 what a party 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.289
 the match 

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:03.699
 45 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:04.789
 this year 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:08.799
 after the collision four serious three times scored and fattening times scored 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.640
 fortunately we are going to see what we cannot do second game 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.959
 the fight actually, however, is incredibly eleven points one of the most 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.029
 extince market players elton glasvegas region west 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.389
 and that pack opened a golden emtec new offers afternoon from the direction 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.249
 the new knee scores ten years 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:27.139
 that is compared to a hearse I hope you like the last one 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.369
 episode all team like button have pressed you for that 30 to 

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:32.479
 35 with a room 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.719
 and I find it annoying that I cannot do the amount of content for you 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.910
 poster that I normally do also play with us in the second game 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.999
 Boulez in the team but I feel that I always need my best 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.860
 an opponent because I want to try out a little more 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.550
 found it 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.210
 brown is you draw a line 9 i have 8 you got something stronger and he has too 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.349
 a mother who is the team 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.349
 brendan toni chose the ring 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.050
 Oscar Peterson 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.050
 the driven 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:02.979
 although 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.020
 shares the language melvin wins the head match 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.870
 picture 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.480
 audi what does it hold that what can stop nobody can stop him except 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.600
 the keeper because when you send ing you cannot see the very best work 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:24.259
 yeah what the njd characters inside I would be so angry if I this message 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.879
 with because in principle you can do this you take the ball off 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.879
 the player who is not in control then has it back to the opponent 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.810
 we are not there either, I wanted to say and with my own goal against the studios 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.690
 because 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.280
 quiet since 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.280
 can't stand up to it 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:44.550
 huppakee 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.639
 was that cost by doing something 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.509
 what a counter from us a corner and that chip 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.930
 yes whore hatch sometimes so the east turkish keeper was really bad 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.159
 positioning the file costs could very easily be done over it 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.159
 get beijing 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.659
 nijpels discount the whole project 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.639
 he really runs free for a long time in sweden 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.450
 every time here shoots right to the goalie it is dramatically sick or sick 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.160
 who is watching we scored three centuries but ltd in the game in it 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.889
 fifth steals you can be incredibly passionate to pass that negotiable 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:25.750
 pictures criticized 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.089
 the woman on 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:30.189
 I see your basket was half from another side I now know who it is 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:31.979
 not the good man 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.620
 believers meet 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.620
 won the first match 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:44.050
 ask 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.300
 you have to do that in advance 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.360
 Referees the last we won again said still undefeated 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.960
 just during the entire series of millions of hunts that is definitely over 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.530
 a blue thumb market 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.980
 the site is that we do before forgetting to do the next episode 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.419
 a focal point knowledge theft gives hope for a bit better than that 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.419
 people keep watching deliver 11 of millions of hunts 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:08.150
 like i said i'm so pretty busy with exams it's bastards 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.080
 for me to do the same amount of virus the woman ran normally 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.460
 conclusion that I hope you understand that I still chill about this 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.399
 The video that the viewer made and I told you later 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:18.109
 well guests too
