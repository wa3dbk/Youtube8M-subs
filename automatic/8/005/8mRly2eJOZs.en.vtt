advantages to this tip up number one you
can<00:00:24.810> use<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> wind<00:00:25.529> flag<00:00:25.800> there's<00:00:26.099> magnetic

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
can use as a wind flag there's magnetic

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.240 
can use as a wind flag there's magnetic
strip<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.180> there<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.199> pull<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:29.130> can

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
strip on there and when you pull you can

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.769 
strip on there and when you pull you can
push<00:00:29.490> pretty<00:00:29.820> hard<00:00:29.910> before<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.660> actually

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
push pretty hard before it actually

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.319 
push pretty hard before it actually
comes<00:00:31.289> off<00:00:31.500> that's<00:00:32.130> because<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:32.940> like<00:00:33.149> when

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
comes off that's because it's like when

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.540 
comes off that's because it's like when
you<00:00:33.450> pull<00:00:33.690> two<00:00:33.960> magnets<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.950> pulled<00:00:35.219> straight

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you pull two magnets you pulled straight

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.119 
you pull two magnets you pulled straight
apart<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.210> don't<00:00:36.420> come<00:00:36.600> apart<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.800> when<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
apart they don't come apart but when you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.819 
apart they don't come apart but when you
twist<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.969> take<00:00:39.660> away<00:00:39.960> from<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> magnetic

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
twist it you take away from the magnetic

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.729 
twist it you take away from the magnetic
field<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.879> real<00:00:42.149> easy<00:00:42.180> release<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
field it's a real easy release so the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.400 
field it's a real easy release so the
dick<00:00:44.010> lift<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.610> win<00:00:44.850> flags<00:00:45.149> number<00:00:45.510> one<00:00:45.690> number

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
dick lift we win flags number one number

take your electronics and let's say the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
take your electronics and let's say the
fish<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.670> sitting<00:01:14.939> 15<00:01:15.330> feet<00:01:15.600> down<00:01:15.780> does<00:01:16.409> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
fish are sitting 15 feet down does that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.289 
fish are sitting 15 feet down does that
mean<00:01:16.799> taking<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.280> weight<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.700> figuring<00:01:18.150> out

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.749 
mean taking a weight and figuring out
exactly<00:01:18.450> how<00:01:18.990> far<00:01:19.320> down<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.710> beat<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.310> I'm

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
exactly how far down that beat is I'm

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.730 
exactly how far down that beat is I'm
gonna<00:01:20.939> put<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> minnow<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:22.229> gonna<00:01:22.500> take

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
gonna put a minnow on I'm gonna take

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.050 
gonna put a minnow on I'm gonna take
that<00:01:22.860> minimal<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.430> gonna<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> first

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
that minimal it's gonna be the first

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.850 
that minimal it's gonna be the first
thing<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.450> enters<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.930> strike<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.560> I'm

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
thing that enters that strike so I'm

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890 
thing that enters that strike so I'm
gonna<00:01:26.100> go<00:01:26.220> down<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.549> 15<00:01:26.939> feet

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
gonna go down to 15 feet

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.960 
gonna go down to 15 feet
I'm<00:01:28.470> gonna<00:01:28.710> set<00:01:29.010> it<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:29.580> where<00:01:29.820> my

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I'm gonna set it because that's where my

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.700 
I'm gonna set it because that's where my
electronics<00:01:30.660> told<00:01:30.900> me<00:01:31.050> that<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.260> fish<00:01:31.530> are

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
electronics told me that the fish are

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.990

you set it down good hit son again once
you<00:01:36.180> hit<00:01:36.390> set<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.590> fish<00:01:37.830> takes<00:01:38.130> off<00:01:38.460> leg

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
you hit set and the fish takes off leg

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.050 
you hit set and the fish takes off leg
goes<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.750> takes<00:01:40.020> off<00:01:40.320> now<00:01:41.040> it'll<00:01:41.850> tell

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
goes up this takes off now it'll tell

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.910 
goes up this takes off now it'll tell
you<00:01:42.150> how<00:01:42.210> long<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> flag<00:01:43.050> has<00:01:43.230> been<00:01:43.260> up<00:01:43.620> and
