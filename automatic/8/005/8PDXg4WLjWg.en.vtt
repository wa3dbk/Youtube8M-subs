00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.020
 so much for our coconut chocolates 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.630
 they needed 250 grams of 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.430
 dark chocolate of course you can 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:30.850
 choosing also the milk depends 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:42.399
 from the tastes 50 g of butter 150 g of flour 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:46.499
 coconut 50 g icing sugar 100 ml 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:49.329
 already sweetened whipping cream 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.760
 first we use 150 grams of 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:58.149
 chocolate under a bain-marie for 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:00.100
 we have to do our molds 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.819
 so that the chocolate lends itself to 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.819
 well on the walls 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.480
 as soon as we are done with march you have 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:27.010
 we can turn the mold upside down so 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:30.250
 to eliminate excess chocolate e 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.420
 then we can make it stay in the freezer a 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.420
 10 15 minutes 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.180
 in the meantime we choose the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.180
 butter in cream 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:51.370
 then we put it in a large bowl 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:53.940
 add the coconut flour and it 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.940
 icing sugar 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.790
 begins to stir to fit everything in 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.830
 so that the coconut absorbs all of it well 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.119
 all the cream 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.290
 at this point we let it rest 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.800
 also this for enrico for about twenty 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.800
 of minutes 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.610
 we resume our molds and 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:30.820
 finally we add our free 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:33.820
 tweak that I'll use a simple one 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.820
 teaspoon 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.790
 then we close our chocolates 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:55.780
 with 100 grams of chocolate always 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.780
 melted in a bain-marie 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.280
 I use both the spoon and one 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.280
 small spatula 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.260
 and let them always rest freezer 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.260
 for 15 minutes 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.420
 here they are more fronts inserted the ditches with 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.790
 the tin box among other things are there 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.440
 of the cookies depicted above the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.880
 maximum of the contradiction but me 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:44.070
