00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.160 
lightweight was made for speed that was
the<00:01:46.380> original<00:01:46.530> intent<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.780> again<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.020> is

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the original intent of it again this is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.899 
the original intent of it again this is
the<00:01:49.229> last<00:01:49.439> shot<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> shot

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the last shot because this was the shot

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.289 
the last shot because this was the shot
he<00:01:51.030> made<00:01:51.149> against<00:01:51.479> Utah<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.140> game<00:01:52.530> six

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
he made against Utah and that game six

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.310 
he made against Utah and that game six
so<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.450> why<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:54.630> call<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.899> last<00:01:55.110> shot

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
so that's why they call it the last shot

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.570 
so that's why they call it the last shot
this<00:01:55.439> was<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580
