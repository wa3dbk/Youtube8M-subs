the<00:03:51.670> directions<00:03:52.209> this<00:03:52.330> work<00:03:52.599> in<00:03:52.810> right

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
the directions this work in right

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.559 
the directions this work in right
there's<00:03:53.560> these<00:03:53.770> really<00:03:53.830> great<00:03:54.430> terms<00:03:54.880> okay

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
there's these really great terms okay

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.089 
there's these really great terms okay
then<00:03:56.050> I'm<00:03:56.140> going<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.319> absolutely<00:03:56.590> skip

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
then I'm going to absolutely skip

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.979 
then I'm going to absolutely skip
because<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.700> stuff<00:03:57.970> doesn't<00:03:58.000> work<00:03:58.300> this<00:03:58.780> is

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
because that stuff doesn't work this is

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.350 
because that stuff doesn't work this is
this<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.860> how<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.099> works<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.790> show<00:04:00.819> you<00:04:01.060> all<00:04:01.239> the

this is how it works to show you all the

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.220 
this is how it works to show you all the
different<00:04:01.450> ways<00:04:01.690> I'm<00:04:01.870> gonna<00:04:01.989> show<00:04:02.050> you<00:04:02.140> the

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
both sides of the helmet now we're gonna

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.780 
both sides of the helmet now we're gonna
transfer<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.650> energy<00:04:38.770> right<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.700> they're

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
transfer the energy right and they're

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.129 
transfer the energy right and they're
gonna<00:04:39.880> move<00:04:40.120> into<00:04:40.270> different<00:04:40.540> areas<00:04:40.780> of<00:04:41.080> the

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
gonna move into different areas of the

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.170 
gonna move into different areas of the
body<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:41.560> protect<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.190> spinal<00:04:42.520> column<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.090> a

body and protect the spinal column and a
spinal<00:04:43.540> cord<00:04:43.750> huge<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:45.100> that<00:04:45.490> one<00:04:45.669> is<00:04:45.790> huge

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
spinal cord huge that that one is huge

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.450 
spinal cord huge that that one is huge
now<00:04:46.389> if<00:04:47.139> you<00:04:47.290> look<00:04:47.470> at<00:04:47.560> the<00:04:47.650> back<00:04:47.860> of<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.070> table

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
now if you look at the back of the table

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.610 
now if you look at the back of the table
you're<00:04:48.850> going<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.060> notice<00:04:49.210> this<00:04:49.780> upward<00:04:50.290> curve

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
you're going to notice this upward curve

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.469 
you're going to notice this upward curve
okay<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.610> is<00:04:51.820> there<00:04:52.060> for<00:04:52.090> a<00:04:52.300> very

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
okay and that is there for a very

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:53.900 
okay and that is there for a very
specific<00:04:52.780> reason

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
specific reason

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.960 
specific reason
if<00:04:54.910> you<00:04:55.120> impact<00:04:55.630> face<00:04:56.169> first<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:57.160> can<00:04:57.370> transfer

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
if you impact face first it can transfer

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.540 
if you impact face first it can transfer
energy<00:04:58.350> backwards<00:04:59.350> and<00:04:59.560> basically<00:05:00.190> try<00:05:00.520> to

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
energy backwards and basically try to

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.719 
energy backwards and basically try to
push<00:05:00.910> your<00:05:01.060> head<00:05:01.270> right<00:05:01.570> off<00:05:01.720> your<00:05:01.870> shoulders

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
push your head right off your shoulders

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.190 
push your head right off your shoulders
it's<00:05:03.729> easy<00:05:04.090> to<00:05:04.270> understand<00:05:04.720> how<00:05:04.930> that<00:05:04.990> could

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
it's easy to understand how that could

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.350 
it's easy to understand how that could
severely<00:05:05.500> damage<00:05:05.979> the<00:05:06.010> spinal<00:05:06.310> cord<00:05:06.700> no<00:05:07.090> doubt

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
severely damage the spinal cord no doubt

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.330 
severely damage the spinal cord no doubt
about<00:05:07.539> it<00:05:07.840> so<00:05:07.990> what<00:05:08.169> happens<00:05:08.500> here<00:05:08.560> is<00:05:08.919> the

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
about it so what happens here is the

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.640 
about it so what happens here is the
concept<00:05:09.820> is<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.030> back<00:05:10.300> of<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.539> helmet<00:05:10.780> we're

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
concept is the back of the helmet we're

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.710 
concept is the back of the helmet we're
trying<00:05:11.919> to<00:05:12.160> catch<00:05:12.520> that<00:05:12.789> edge<00:05:13.030> on<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.360> table

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
trying to catch that edge on the table

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.890 
trying to catch that edge on the table
and<00:05:14.440> prevent<00:05:14.860> that<00:05:15.070> motion<00:05:15.340> okay<00:05:16.300> there's

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
and prevent that motion okay there's

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.219 
and prevent that motion okay there's
pieces<00:05:17.470> on<00:05:17.650> this<00:05:17.860> that<00:05:18.820> can<00:05:19.330> be<00:05:19.479> damaged<00:05:19.900> in<00:05:20.139> an

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
pieces on this that can be damaged in an

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.400 
pieces on this that can be damaged in an
impact<00:05:20.590> okay<00:05:21.250> these<00:05:22.240> two<00:05:22.479> struts<00:05:22.810> back<00:05:23.110> here

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
impact okay these two struts back here

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.620 
impact okay these two struts back here
they<00:05:23.830> can<00:05:23.979> be<00:05:24.130> replaced<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:25.060> whole<00:05:25.210> thing<00:05:25.479> can

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
they can be replaced the whole thing can

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.230 
they can be replaced the whole thing can
be<00:05:25.750> rebuilt<00:05:26.130> right

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.439 

because<00:05:29.960> in<00:05:30.169> a<00:05:30.199> crash<00:05:30.500> it<00:05:31.490> can<00:05:31.669> absolutely<00:05:32.060> be

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
because in a crash it can absolutely be

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:33.909 
because in a crash it can absolutely be
damaged<00:05:32.840> and<00:05:33.110> that's<00:05:33.350> where<00:05:33.530> you<00:05:33.590> know<00:05:33.770> that

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
damaged and that's where you know that

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.650 
damaged and that's where you know that
it<00:05:34.039> certainly<00:05:34.340> did<00:05:34.520> its<00:05:34.669> job<00:05:34.729> if<00:05:35.419> there's

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
it certainly did its job if there's

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.809 
it certainly did its job if there's
pieces<00:05:35.990> that<00:05:36.199> are<00:05:36.410> damaged<00:05:36.770> we're<00:05:37.580> gonna<00:05:37.669> go

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
pieces that are damaged we're gonna go

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:39.939 
pieces that are damaged we're gonna go
now<00:05:38.000> to<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.270> most<00:05:38.389> key<00:05:38.840> part<00:05:39.229> of<00:05:39.470> this<00:05:39.650> brace

these<00:06:57.229> are<00:06:57.409> the<00:06:57.470> size<00:06:57.710> large<00:06:58.039> extra-large

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
these are the size large extra-large

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.939 
these are the size large extra-large
unfortunately<00:06:59.900> we<00:06:59.960> don't<00:07:00.080> have<00:07:00.199> a<00:07:00.349> 2x<00:07:00.590> here

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:00.949 
unfortunately we don't have a 2x here

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:02.260 
unfortunately we don't have a 2x here
for<00:07:01.220> to<00:07:01.370> give<00:07:01.520> him<00:07:01.699> a<00:07:01.729> try

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
for to give him a try

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.089 
for to give him a try
perhaps<00:07:02.930> that<00:07:03.139> would<00:07:03.289> make<00:07:03.500> the<00:07:03.650> difference

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:04.099 
perhaps that would make the difference

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:05.559 
perhaps that would make the difference
perhaps<00:07:04.400> it<00:07:04.550> win<00:07:04.699> it<00:07:04.819> but<00:07:04.939> you<00:07:05.060> see<00:07:05.240> the<00:07:05.389> big

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:05.569 
perhaps it win it but you see the big

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:07.390 
perhaps it win it but you see the big
gap<00:07:05.780> right<00:07:05.810> here<00:07:06.349> and<00:07:06.620> the<00:07:06.949> way<00:07:07.099> that<00:07:07.280> it's

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
gap right here and the way that it's

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.339 
gap right here and the way that it's
interacting<00:07:08.030> with<00:07:08.060> this<00:07:08.360> suit<00:07:08.659> is<00:07:09.050> not

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:12.070 
interacting with this suit is not
necessarily<00:07:10.090> this<00:07:11.090> is<00:07:11.300> not<00:07:11.479> what<00:07:11.689> you'd<00:07:11.870> want

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
necessarily this is not what you'd want

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.929 
necessarily this is not what you'd want
to<00:07:12.139> achieve<00:07:12.259> you<00:07:12.800> need<00:07:12.979> to<00:07:13.099> have<00:07:13.280> this<00:07:13.460> resting

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:13.939 
to achieve you need to have this resting

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:15.790 
to achieve you need to have this resting
on<00:07:14.060> this<00:07:14.210> meaty<00:07:14.509> portion<00:07:14.810> right<00:07:15.110> here<00:07:15.169> so<00:07:15.770> I

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 
on this meaty portion right here so I

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.499 
on this meaty portion right here so I
would<00:07:16.099> not<00:07:16.250> advise<00:07:16.610> him<00:07:16.879> to<00:07:16.909> go<00:07:17.120> ride<00:07:17.270> this

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:17.509 
would not advise him to go ride this

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:19.029 
would not advise him to go ride this
he'd<00:07:17.750> be<00:07:17.780> uncomfortable<00:07:18.409> and<00:07:18.620> it<00:07:18.710> would<00:07:18.860> not

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 
he'd be uncomfortable and it would not

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.129 
he'd be uncomfortable and it would not
work<00:07:19.099> correctly<00:07:19.520> for<00:07:20.360> that<00:07:20.449> reason<00:07:20.810> I<00:07:20.870> didn't

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:21.139 
work correctly for that reason I didn't

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:25.390 
work correctly for that reason I didn't
write<00:07:21.289> in<00:07:21.439> and<00:07:21.620> I<00:07:21.680> was<00:07:21.830> really<00:07:23.620> trying<00:07:24.620> it<00:07:24.860> but

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 
write in and I was really trying it but

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.649 
write in and I was really trying it but
the<00:07:25.520> reality<00:07:25.669> is<00:07:26.060> for<00:07:26.270> me<00:07:26.389> it<00:07:26.449> would<00:07:26.539> have<00:07:26.599> been

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:26.659 
the reality is for me it would have been

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:29.260 
the reality is for me it would have been
more<00:07:26.870> dangerous<00:07:27.289> to<00:07:27.409> ride<00:07:27.590> in<00:07:27.680> the<00:07:27.770> brace<00:07:28.270> than

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.270 
more dangerous to ride in the brace than

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.390 
more dangerous to ride in the brace than
it<00:07:29.389> would<00:07:29.539> have<00:07:29.569> been<00:07:29.740> do<00:07:30.740> not<00:07:30.889> worry

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
it would have been do not worry

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.249 
it would have been do not worry
so<00:07:31.729> for<00:07:31.909> that<00:07:31.969> reason<00:07:32.030> that<00:07:32.300> chose<00:07:32.539> not<00:07:32.750> to<00:07:32.810> and

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:33.259 
so for that reason that chose not to and

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:34.360 
so for that reason that chose not to and
will<00:07:33.469> move<00:07:33.620> forward<00:07:33.889> I'm<00:07:34.129> gonna<00:07:34.219> get
