drawing<00:00:01.560> splines<00:00:02.659> let's<00:00:03.659> take<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.870> look<00:00:04.110> at

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
drawing splines let's take a look at

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.769 
drawing splines let's take a look at
what<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.380> spline<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.850> can<00:00:06.000> find<00:00:06.210> spline<00:00:06.540> in

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
what a spline is you can find spline in

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.320 
what a spline is you can find spline in
the<00:00:07.230> draw<00:00:07.440> panel<00:00:07.680> here<00:00:08.040> you<00:00:08.220> have<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.030> extend

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the draw panel here you have to extend

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.870 
the draw panel here you have to extend
it<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.570> bit<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:10.410> then<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:10.950> see<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
it a bit and then you can see we have a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.220 
it a bit and then you can see we have a
spline<00:00:12.450> fit<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:14.040> spline<00:00:14.340> CV<00:00:14.960> let's<00:00:15.960> first

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
spline fit and a spline CV let's first

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.109 
spline fit and a spline CV let's first
see<00:00:16.379> what<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.650> spline<00:00:16.920> fit<00:00:17.190> does<00:00:17.369> I'll<00:00:17.789> go

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
see what the spline fit does I'll go

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.450 
see what the spline fit does I'll go
ahead<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.390> select<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.050> now<00:00:19.680> go<00:00:20.340> ahead

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
ahead and select that and now go ahead

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.259 
ahead and select that and now go ahead
and<00:00:20.550> specify<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.779> few<00:00:22.020> points<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:23.000> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.119> see

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and specify a few points as you can see

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.689 
and specify a few points as you can see
I'm<00:00:24.420> getting<00:00:24.600> curved<00:00:24.990> lines<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:29.400> allows<00:00:29.670> for

going to pan over to the side just a
little<00:00:44.789> bit<00:00:46.160> I'll<00:00:47.160> go<00:00:47.399> ahead<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.730> draw<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
little bit I'll go ahead and draw and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.139 
little bit I'll go ahead and draw and
then<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.890> spline<00:00:50.640> CV<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.829> again<00:00:52.829> I'll<00:00:53.789> click<00:00:54.000> a

then do spline CV and again I'll click a
few<00:00:54.300> points<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.370> this<00:00:56.370> time<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.760> notice<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
few points and this time you notice that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.959 
few points and this time you notice that
the<00:00:57.420> points<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.750> I'm<00:00:57.870> clicking<00:00:58.879> aren't<00:00:59.879> on

are being controlled with different

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.630 
are being controlled with different
vertices<00:01:07.110> than<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.100> before

all we head and press enter and now I
have<00:01:11.369> two<00:01:11.670> splines<00:01:12.320> now<00:01:13.320> let's<00:01:13.590> look<00:01:13.710> at<00:01:13.860> how

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
have two splines now let's look at how

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.429 
have two splines now let's look at how
we<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.549> edit<00:01:14.760> those<00:01:14.939> I'll<00:01:15.810> go<00:01:16.200> ahead<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
we can edit those I'll go ahead and

the grips for editing I can go ahead and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.830 
the grips for editing I can go ahead and
grab<00:01:22.860> any<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.310> these<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.729> stretch<00:01:24.720> it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
grab any one of these and stretch it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.999 
grab any one of these and stretch it
around<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.259> needed<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:27.619> if<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.710> hover<00:01:28.829> over

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
around as needed and if you hover over

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
around as needed and if you hover over
them<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> second<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.390> see<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.630> have

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
them for just a second you see you have

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.899 
them for just a second you see you have
additional<00:01:31.170> options<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.490> remove<00:01:32.759> the

additional options here to remove the
fit<00:01:33.090> point<00:01:33.770> we<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.920> go<00:01:35.009> ahead<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.159> stretch

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
fit point we can go ahead and stretch

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.100 
fit point we can go ahead and stretch
this<00:01:35.579> out<00:01:37.430> hover<00:01:38.430> over<00:01:38.479> we<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.630> add<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> fit

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
this out hover over we can add a fit

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.510 
this out hover over we can add a fit
point<00:01:41.479> click<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> new<00:01:42.810> location<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.340> can

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
point click on a new location and I can

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.850 
point click on a new location and I can
also<00:01:44.700> change<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> first<00:01:45.479> spline<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.110> was<00:01:46.829> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
also change the first spline that was a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.510 
also change the first spline that was a
fit<00:01:47.159> into<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:48.270> CV<00:01:48.750> spline<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.860> control<00:01:50.189> points

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
fit into a CV spline with control points

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.999 
fit into a CV spline with control points
as<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.689> now<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.320> points<00:01:52.680> two<00:01:52.799> at

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
as you can see now we have points two at

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.149 
as you can see now we have points two at
different<00:01:53.460> locations<00:01:54.649> I'll<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.920> ahead<00:01:55.979> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
different locations I'll go ahead and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.590 
different locations I'll go ahead and
adjust<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.700> little<00:01:56.820> bit<00:01:56.939> more

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.399 

I<00:02:01.010> can<00:02:02.010> also<00:02:02.130> use<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.460> menu<00:02:02.729> here<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.320> fit<00:02:04.320> it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
I can also use this menu here to fit it

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.580 
I can also use this menu here to fit it
back<00:02:05.420> I'll<00:02:06.420> go<00:02:06.600> ahead<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.810> hit<00:02:06.900> escape<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
back I'll go ahead and hit escape to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.889 
back I'll go ahead and hit escape to
deselect<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.670> we'll<00:02:09.360> look<00:02:09.479> at<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.869> over

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
deselect and we'll look at this one over

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.930

I'll<00:02:11.940> change<00:02:12.300> some<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.570> these<00:02:12.690> control<00:02:13.020> points

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
I'll change some of these control points

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.230 
I'll change some of these control points
around<00:02:16.550> stretch<00:02:17.550> them<00:02:17.760> out<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.209> little

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
around stretch them out just a little

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.280 
around stretch them out just a little
bit<00:02:18.420> longer<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.690> then<00:02:21.690> I'll<00:02:21.840> change<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.110> one

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
bit longer and then I'll change this one

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.010 
bit longer and then I'll change this one
to<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.440> fit<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:23.580> see<00:02:23.760> again<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.780> grips

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
to a fit and you can see again the grips

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.640 
to a fit and you can see again the grips
have<00:02:25.140> changed<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.680> match<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.280> line<00:02:26.459> itself

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
have changed to match the line itself

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.070 
have changed to match the line itself
fit<00:02:28.650> has<00:02:28.890> its<00:02:29.190> grips<00:02:29.490> on<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.300> line<00:02:30.690> itself

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
fit has its grips on the line itself

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.180 
fit has its grips on the line itself
while<00:02:31.830> CV<00:02:32.250> has<00:02:32.490> its<00:02:32.730> grips<00:02:32.970> outside<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.600> line

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
while CV has its grips outside the line

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.110 
while CV has its grips outside the line
let's<00:02:35.190> go<00:02:35.340> ahead<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.550> take<00:02:35.640> another<00:02:35.820> look<00:02:36.000> at

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
let's go ahead and take another look at

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.280 
let's go ahead and take another look at
that<00:02:39.680> there<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.800> go<00:02:41.720> remove<00:02:42.720> this<00:02:42.870> one<00:02:43.020> again

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
that there you go remove this one again

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.030 
that there you go remove this one again
and<00:02:43.730> let<00:02:44.730> me<00:02:44.820> select<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.239> one<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.920> move<00:02:46.920> this

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
and let me select this one and move this

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.729 
and let me select this one and move this
one<00:02:47.190> around<00:02:47.220> as<00:02:47.610> well

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
one around as well

spline splines can be very effective
when<00:04:44.750> you're<00:04:44.840> trying<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.080> model<00:04:45.470> very<00:04:46.280> smooth

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
when you're trying to model very smooth

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.050 
when you're trying to model very smooth
shaped<00:04:47.210> curves<00:04:48.520> but<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.610> may<00:04:49.729> be<00:04:49.789> more

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
shaped curves but it may be more

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.140 
shaped curves but it may be more
efficient<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.690> use<00:04:50.870> arcs<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.620> lines<00:04:52.490> to

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
efficient to use arcs and lines to

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.029 
efficient to use arcs and lines to
represent<00:04:53.599> some<00:04:53.750> of<00:04:53.780> your<00:04:53.960> shapes<00:04:54.229> since<00:04:54.919> they

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
represent some of your shapes since they

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.649 
represent some of your shapes since they
are<00:04:55.159> more<00:04:55.310> easily<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.729> reproduce<00:04:56.300> when<00:04:56.510> you

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
are more easily to reproduce when you

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:59.710 
are more easily to reproduce when you
come<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.050> manufacturing
