00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.250 
the tab for his gun in there and they
can<00:02:25.060> store<00:02:25.300> just<00:02:25.570> right<00:02:25.750> there<00:02:25.900> behind<00:02:26.020> his

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
can store just right there behind his

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.610 
can store just right there behind his
hips<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:28.780> nice<00:02:29.290> figure<00:02:29.650> it's<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.860> nice<00:02:30.010> update<00:02:30.280> of

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
hips a nice figure it's a nice update of

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.220 
hips a nice figure it's a nice update of
Mirage<00:02:32.620> into<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.280> modern<00:02:34.020> poseability<00:02:35.020> I

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
Mirage into the modern poseability I

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.050 
Mirage into the modern poseability I
wish<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.709> this<00:02:35.920> backpack<00:02:36.280> had<00:02:36.730> some<00:02:36.940> way<00:02:37.030> of

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
wish that this backpack had some way of

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.850 
wish that this backpack had some way of
collapsing<00:02:37.720> down<00:02:37.840> maybe<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.290> his<00:02:38.410> wheels<00:02:38.650> are

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
collapsing down maybe so his wheels are

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.699 
collapsing down maybe so his wheels are
right<00:02:39.010> behind<00:02:39.160> his<00:02:39.430> shoulders<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.500> may<00:02:41.650> be

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
right behind his shoulders and it may be

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.770 
right behind his shoulders and it may be
a<00:02:41.830> slightly<00:02:42.190> thicker<00:02:42.580> waist<00:02:42.790> but<00:02:43.570> other<00:02:43.720> than

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
a slightly thicker waist but other than

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.990 
a slightly thicker waist but other than
that<00:02:44.220> overall<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.250> think<00:02:45.370> he's<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.610> good<00:02:45.820> figure

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
that overall I think he's a good figure

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.430 
that overall I think he's a good figure
he's<00:02:46.270> not<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.540> greatest<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:46.989> classics

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
he's not the greatest in the classics

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.040 
he's not the greatest in the classics
line<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:47.830> he's<00:02:48.610> one<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> better<00:02:49.060> ones<00:02:49.209> I'm

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
line but he's one of the better ones I'm

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.500 
line but he's one of the better ones I'm
certainly<00:02:50.380> for<00:02:50.560> poseability

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
certainly for poseability

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.950 
certainly for poseability
there<00:02:52.510> he<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.720> classics<00:02:53.470> Mirage
