could play it if you're just playing the
game<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.819> go<00:02:23.940> through<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.239> game<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.840> makes<00:02:25.140> a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
game to go through the game it makes a

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.630 
game to go through the game it makes a
lot<00:02:25.319> more<00:02:25.349> sense<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.130> way<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.550> if

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
lot more sense to do it that way but if

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.890 
lot more sense to do it that way but if
you're<00:02:26.790> playing<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.150> game<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.630> like

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you're playing the game to be like

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.150 
you're playing the game to be like
competitive<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.830> multiplayer<00:02:29.540> best<00:02:31.160> it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
competitive and multiplayer best it

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160 
competitive and multiplayer best it
doesn't<00:02:32.190> make<00:02:32.580> much<00:02:32.790> sense<00:02:32.819> because<00:02:33.690> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
doesn't make much sense because you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.500 
doesn't make much sense because you
could<00:02:34.349> just<00:02:34.379> like<00:02:34.739> have<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> bad<00:02:35.580> fight<00:02:36.000> you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510

this lock challenge and I died with my
first<00:02:56.760> Pokemon<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.269> think<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:57.810> reset<00:02:58.200> me

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.650 
first Pokemon I think it just reset me
even<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.040> me<00:02:59.160> set<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.400> game<00:02:59.549> would<00:03:00.030> just<00:03:00.209> cancel

even a me set the game would just cancel

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.910 
even a me set the game would just cancel
the<00:03:00.720> challenge<00:03:01.110> because<00:03:01.349> I<00:03:01.410> only<00:03:01.560> had<00:03:01.799> that

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
the challenge because I only had that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.069 
the challenge because I only had that
one<00:03:01.980> Pokemon<00:03:02.579> so<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:03.599> I<00:03:03.660> think<00:03:03.840> if<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:03.989> have

one Pokemon so but I think if you have
like<00:03:04.230> 6<00:03:04.500> or<00:03:04.590> something<00:03:04.860> like<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.370> you

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
like 6 or something like that it you

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
this is not complete because I have

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.009 
this is not complete because I have
noticed<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.700> now<00:03:29.850> all<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.060> animations<00:03:30.870> are

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
noticed that now all the animations are

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.740 
noticed that now all the animations are
there<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:32.310> top<00:03:32.639> you<00:03:32.880> can<00:03:32.910> see<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.269> overhaul

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
there the top you can see the overhaul

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.440 
there the top you can see the overhaul
is<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.989> lot<00:03:34.139> cleaner<00:03:34.639> sharper<00:03:35.639> than<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.120> bottom

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
is a lot cleaner sharper than the bottom

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.650 
is a lot cleaner sharper than the bottom
version<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.670> it's<00:03:38.670> just<00:03:38.940> overall<00:03:39.359> like<00:03:39.569> the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
version and it's just overall like the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.809 
version and it's just overall like the
battles<00:03:40.019> overall<00:03:40.380> as<00:03:40.500> well<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:41.489> just<00:03:41.670> looks

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
battles overall as well it just looks

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.690 
battles overall as well it just looks
really<00:03:41.880> clean<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.769> modern<00:03:44.160> game<00:03:44.370> not

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
really clean and like a modern game not

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.340 
really clean and like a modern game not
like<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:44.850> very<00:03:45.090> pixelated<00:03:45.359> kind<00:03:46.109> of<00:03:46.170> thing<00:03:46.290> I

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
like a very pixelated kind of thing I

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.479 
like a very pixelated kind of thing I
mean<00:03:46.500> there's<00:03:46.650> not<00:03:46.739> really<00:03:46.889> much<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.250> you

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
mean there's not really much of it you

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.339 
mean there's not really much of it you
see<00:03:47.639> much<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.940> difference<00:03:48.239> because<00:03:49.019> I<00:03:49.170> mean

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
see much of a difference because I mean

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.960 
see much of a difference because I mean
I<00:03:49.380> think<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.950> subtle<00:03:50.250> difference<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.730> want<00:03:50.819> is

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
I think a subtle difference I want is

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.870 
I think a subtle difference I want is
like<00:03:51.090> blurrier<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.690> little<00:03:52.049> bit<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.670> can't<00:03:53.670> see

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
like blurrier a little bit I can't see

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.640 
like blurrier a little bit I can't see
much<00:03:54.030> difference<00:03:54.750> yeah<00:03:54.959> me<00:03:55.139> neither<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.410> mean

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
much difference yeah me neither I mean

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.039 
much difference yeah me neither I mean
to<00:03:56.489> me<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.760> overhaul<00:03:57.239> seems<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.599> lot<00:03:57.720> sharper

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
to me the overhaul seems a lot sharper

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.569 
to me the overhaul seems a lot sharper
but<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.530> really<00:03:58.829> see<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.220> when<00:03:59.370> it's<00:03:59.489> in

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
but you really see it when it's in

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.250 
but you really see it when it's in
battle<00:03:59.940> because<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.599> also<00:04:00.780> have<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.169> black

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
battle because you also have the black

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.409 
battle because you also have the black
and<00:04:01.380> white<00:04:01.709> pack<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.310> can<00:04:02.519> install<00:04:03.209> to

and white pack that you can install to

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.400 
and white pack that you can install to
play<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:03.660> game<00:04:03.870> where<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.049> had<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.230> black

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
play this game where you had the black

and white pokemon black of my animations

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.259 
and white pokemon black of my animations
and<00:04:06.329> for<00:04:07.169> the<00:04:07.260> black<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.500> white<00:04:07.799> yeah<00:04:08.220> games<00:04:08.940> I

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
and for the black and white yeah games I

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.759 
and for the black and white yeah games I
really<00:04:09.540> didn't<00:04:09.780> like<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.019> fact<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.410> you

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
really didn't like the fact that you

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.339 
really didn't like the fact that you
poke<00:04:10.980> him<00:04:11.130> on<00:04:11.250> your<00:04:11.669> Pokemon<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.930> was<00:04:13.140> like

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
poke him on your Pokemon it was like

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.630 
poke him on your Pokemon it was like
really<00:04:13.920> blurry

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
really blurry

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.759 
really blurry
in<00:04:14.850> comparison<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.990> Pokemon<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.650> were

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
in comparison to the Pokemon you were

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.500 
in comparison to the Pokemon you were
fighting<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.760> know<00:04:17.790> I<00:04:17.880> mean<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.269> course<00:04:18.420> that

fighting you know I mean of course that

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.560 
fighting you know I mean of course that
would<00:04:18.750> probably<00:04:19.250> perspective<00:04:20.250> wise<00:04:20.640> reality

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
would probably perspective wise reality

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.990 
would probably perspective wise reality
but<00:04:21.930> um<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.770> was<00:04:22.860> just<00:04:22.980> annoying<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.430> like<00:04:23.820> hurt

clean but there's no animations here

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.230 
clean but there's no animations here

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
then the bottom right we have the 3d

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.870 
then the bottom right we have the 3d
sprites<00:04:39.870> which<00:04:40.230> looks<00:04:40.590> just<00:04:40.890> like<00:04:41.160> the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
sprites which looks just like the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.000 
sprites which looks just like the
Pokemon<00:04:42.450> X&amp;Y<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.500> only<00:04:43.710> thing<00:04:43.860> that's

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
Pokemon X&amp;Y and the only thing that's

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.530 
Pokemon X&amp;Y and the only thing that's
different<00:04:44.070> about<00:04:44.400> these<00:04:44.640> is<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:45.090> when

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
different about these is that when

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.940 
different about these is that when
they're<00:04:45.690> doing<00:04:45.900> their<00:04:46.170> attacks<00:04:46.560> they<00:04:46.800> don't

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
they're doing their attacks they don't

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.920 
they're doing their attacks they don't
move<00:04:47.250> into<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:48.000> attacks<00:04:48.330> they<00:04:48.570> just<00:04:48.750> stay

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
move into the attacks they just stay

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.020 
move into the attacks they just stay
there<00:04:49.140> all<00:04:49.440> it<00:04:49.860> happens<00:04:50.160> if<00:04:50.280> there's<00:04:50.430> animated

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
there all it happens if there's animated

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.250 
there all it happens if there's animated
while<00:04:51.150> this<00:04:51.300> standard<00:04:51.600> so<00:04:51.690> this<00:04:51.810> is<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:51.930> 3d

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
while this standard so this is a 3d
