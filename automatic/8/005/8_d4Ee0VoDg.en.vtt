00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hello everyone, I am with you and we continue 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.600
 to consider 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.550
 replicas well that we have an extraordinary 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.770
 action immediately from the wounds that play 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.529
 against pro net and on this map and in 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.839
 in most cases, tyrants fly to 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.089
 gold if you do not notice them in time 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:24.630
 they can get well 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:28.140
 and punish you but see how it is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.929
 Everything will react durable and look 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.890
 immediately the workers went to mine in advance 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.950
 minerals 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.740
 each other opponents wishes gff them and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.020
 you can see that they are from one clone 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.170
 replay was sent to the mountainside and 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.090
 so it will be a lot of fun 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.000
 replay to short as i already said 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.990
 just six minutes of playing time 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.660
 and therefore you already know the outcome of events 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.760
 let's see how it looks 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.280
 usually the elephant flies by default 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.610
 intelligence and thanks to that he will notice 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.240
 that there is a groove naturally ram 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.429
 immediately tries the whole thing 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.740
 save and he builds a wall 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:17.009
 actually dogs or cats have not recorded 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.630
 or cockroaches in general, all who live on 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.390
 the kitchen 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.369
 and see what makes it durable Th 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.680
 he miss that he took all of them 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.229
 workers is 2 so now there are people 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.340
 emit stand out and here's a sponge cake 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.039
 turned out and everything here we see that over 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.850
 finally and the finger that the whole thing 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:44.220
 It stands in the way of gold note 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:47.130
 here we don't have such a huge 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.590
 plus strength that we took he took 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.689
 a couple of workers an armful namely 12 pieces and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.959
 drove the whole thing nag because 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.509
 here the worker is only 8 pieces plus two of 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.979
 those engaged in the construction and natural 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.349
 they all win 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.899
 all this makes through mineral fields 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.149
 send and then through the attack and everything is here 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.780
 the worker began to fight bite eat 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.840
 each other and eat here he did not cast 1 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.959
 minus 1 already in a small minus 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.650
 the whole thing is moving you can not even 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.350
 especially 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.000
 but especially visible 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.020
 but still in response as he through 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.020
 mineral scorching it emits and 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.020
 punishes 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.200
 so turn the camera around and look narrow 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.250
 aisle and eat 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.930
 sit down already mirrors won by 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.490
 the number of slaves and see he does he 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.830
 somehow wants to fly here a 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.140
 probably most likely 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.020
 the Marine will not have access and therefore better 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.410
 already have leadership to push as competently 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.020
 here the cell seems to be as it is but until 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.850
 Marines do not get there and we 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.550
 surviving two workers who are now 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.740
 will try to bring as much as possible 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.740
 more minerals but we need at least one 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.030
 slave here send us extra mineral and 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.130
 then we will all deal 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.840
 have ripeness to build a worker 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.480
 returns see what we have here 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.600
 here we have built a floor there are two 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.520
 minnows here everything is mined and well 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.520
 gas is most likely ordered for arachs 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.810
 so that the orcs could always do 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.880
 calmly spit 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.640
 long distance because paint brushes 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.280
 also in some way here anyway 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.290
 these little ones just came to the tower 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.220
 to water let's see here 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.470
 see give and here they are zil naked 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.540
 show that in general there is only 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.750
 here is dead. but this elephant 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.540
 calm now everything will be considered 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.900
 give the elephant by the way saw the trunk of the Marine 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.150
 goes for his soul and for some reason he is somewhere 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.020
 picked up all the buildings un just flew over 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.310
 a little closer 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.010
 or a little further away running two dogs 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.020
 which can, if desired, but then eat 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.040
 again the workers are brought out again by the world 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.849
 the economy 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.060
 girl flies here I can not understand by 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.530
 wants stenochka here only to build 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.830
 no wonder he's trying to wall here 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.169
 build pull this mail right there 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.769
 run over the dog will not be called 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:24.300
 the network did all this unsubscribe 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.280
 birch and profession wins and so and 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.560
 dear friends if you play this 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.600
 card against you plays a tyrant in this 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.250
 urgent look through these 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.770
 eyes because most often 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.680
 tyrants fly over here but exist 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.840
 Such an opinion that this they themselves do in 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.450
 minus and if also during the burn 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.139
 then it can calmly not lock 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.270
 it is important whether you and the mirror to 5 taiga 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.970
 protoss or tyrant your main thing will be 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.320
 the advantage is that he will have six 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.910
 working start of the game 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.960
 and you will have 12 or even a little more 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.169
 Zerg of course it's easier to do 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.260
 because they have larvae which 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.600
 you can three slaves at once such 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.700
 renders but still so 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:16.729
 check this and filthy places and to 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.729
 meeting the following replay until koch
