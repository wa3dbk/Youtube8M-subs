first week of wearing orthodontic

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.460 
first week of wearing orthodontic

appliances would cause me that kind of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.559 
appliances would cause me that kind of
chafing<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.489> pain<00:03:02.790> but<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.920> rawness<00:03:04.920> but<00:03:05.730> for

a wire change I think i'm at a pretty

to straighten at the lower palette so
perhaps<00:05:00.300> you<00:05:00.660> can<00:05:00.780> take<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.020> peek<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:01.729> see<00:05:02.729> if<00:05:02.880> I

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
perhaps you can take a peek and see if I

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.020 
perhaps you can take a peek and see if I
making<00:05:03.270> any<00:05:03.570> progress<00:05:03.990> so<00:05:04.650> let's<00:05:05.430> get<00:05:05.700> in<00:05:05.850> for

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
making any progress so let's get in for

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.630 
making any progress so let's get in for
a<00:05:06.060> closer<00:05:06.450> look<00:05:06.690> it's<00:05:06.900> always<00:05:07.640> uncomfortable

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
a closer look it's always uncomfortable

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.540 
a closer look it's always uncomfortable
to<00:05:08.940> do<00:05:09.060> this<00:05:09.240> but<00:05:09.510> I<00:05:09.810> know<00:05:10.290> when<00:05:11.220> I'm<00:05:11.340> watching

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
to do this but I know when I'm watching

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.210 
to do this but I know when I'm watching
videos<00:05:12.090> I'd<00:05:12.180> like<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.419> see<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:13.070> let's<00:05:14.070> get

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
videos I'd like to see that so let's get

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.290 
videos I'd like to see that so let's get
a<00:05:14.280> closer<00:05:14.610> look

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:38.910 

so

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.220 

again<00:05:39.790> I<00:05:39.880> know<00:05:39.940> that<00:05:40.270> one<00:05:40.480> front<00:05:40.780> tooth<00:05:40.930> here

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
again I know that one front tooth here

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.640 
again I know that one front tooth here
is<00:05:41.440> longer<00:05:42.010> and<00:05:42.870> either<00:05:43.870> he's<00:05:44.170> going<00:05:44.380> to<00:05:44.440> try

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
is longer and either he's going to try

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.130 
is longer and either he's going to try
to<00:05:44.680> drop<00:05:44.890> the<00:05:45.040> one<00:05:45.190> next<00:05:45.370> to<00:05:45.520> it<00:05:45.580> down<00:05:45.880> or<00:05:46.240> when

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
to drop the one next to it down or when

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.930 
to drop the one next to it down or when
I<00:05:47.170> have<00:05:47.410> the<00:05:47.560> bracelets<00:05:47.920> removed<00:05:48.280> we're<00:05:48.790> going

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
I have the bracelets removed we're going

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.310 
I have the bracelets removed we're going
to<00:05:49.350> have<00:05:50.350> that<00:05:50.650> tooth<00:05:51.510> shortened<00:05:52.510> f<00:05:52.660> it<00:05:52.900> so

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
to have that tooth shortened f it so

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:00.530 
to have that tooth shortened f it so
they're<00:05:53.470> nice<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:53.740> even<00:05:54.100> straight<00:05:54.430> across

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.740 

but<00:06:01.140> I've<00:06:01.230> been<00:06:01.350> happy<00:06:01.560> so<00:06:01.800> far<00:06:02.750> I'll

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
but I've been happy so far I'll

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.660 
but I've been happy so far I'll
definitely<00:06:03.930> see<00:06:04.260> progress<00:06:04.500> I<00:06:04.920> see<00:06:05.130> there<00:06:05.610> are

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
definitely see progress I see there are

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.880 
definitely see progress I see there are
still<00:06:05.850> gaps<00:06:06.030> in<00:06:06.300> my<00:06:06.330> bike<00:06:06.680> that's<00:06:07.680> not

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
still gaps in my bike that's not

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.530 
still gaps in my bike that's not
perfectly<00:06:08.430> of<00:06:08.520> course<00:06:08.610> if<00:06:08.850> it<00:06:08.940> was<00:06:09.030> perfect

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
perfectly of course if it was perfect

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.000 
perfectly of course if it was perfect
I'd<00:06:09.690> be<00:06:09.870> getting<00:06:10.020> those<00:06:10.170> braces<00:06:10.440> off<00:06:10.740> but

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
I'd be getting those braces off but

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.160 
I'd be getting those braces off but
that's<00:06:11.240> probably<00:06:12.240> not<00:06:12.420> going<00:06:12.630> to<00:06:12.720> happen<00:06:12.900> for

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
that's probably not going to happen for

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.930 
that's probably not going to happen for
11<00:06:16.170> months<00:06:16.290> or<00:06:16.560> so<00:06:16.800> i<00:06:17.040> think<00:06:17.430> i<00:06:17.490> was<00:06:17.610> told<00:06:17.820> her

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
11 months or so i think i was told her

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.490 
11 months or so i think i was told her
we'd<00:06:18.120> you<00:06:18.480> know<00:06:18.510> july<00:06:19.020> of<00:06:19.050> next<00:06:19.290> year<00:06:19.860> but<00:06:20.100> i

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
we'd you know july of next year but i

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.230 
we'd you know july of next year but i
anticipate<00:06:22.500> it<00:06:22.620> could<00:06:22.710> be<00:06:22.830> as<00:06:22.980> next<00:06:23.880> October

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
anticipate it could be as next October

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.820 
anticipate it could be as next October
I'm<00:06:24.570> just<00:06:24.960> hoping<00:06:25.230> not<00:06:25.380> to<00:06:25.440> have<00:06:25.560> to<00:06:25.710> go

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
I'm just hoping not to have to go

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.230 
I'm just hoping not to have to go
through<00:06:25.860> know<00:06:26.100> the<00:06:26.220> birthday<00:06:26.550> in<00:06:26.610> November<00:06:27.030> or

another Thanksgiving with this I mean

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.160 
another Thanksgiving with this I mean
I'm<00:06:31.590> assuming<00:06:31.770> I'll<00:06:32.160> have<00:06:32.900> retainers<00:06:33.900> but

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
I'm assuming I'll have retainers but

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.410 
I'm assuming I'll have retainers but
that's<00:06:34.320> a<00:06:34.440> whole<00:06:34.560> other<00:06:34.620> issue<00:06:35.180> but<00:06:36.180> it'd<00:06:36.390> be

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
that's a whole other issue but it'd be

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.320 
that's a whole other issue but it'd be
nice<00:06:36.690> to<00:06:36.750> be<00:06:36.900> able<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.290> have<00:06:37.470> these<00:06:37.680> offer<00:06:38.330> next

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:43.980 
thanksgiving and this season that I've

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.500 
thanksgiving and this season that I've
been<00:06:44.130> able<00:06:44.280> to<00:06:44.550> you<00:06:44.940> know<00:06:45.030> go<00:06:45.240> through<00:06:45.420> this

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
been able to you know go through this

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.240 
been able to you know go through this
process<00:06:45.570> it's<00:06:46.260> really<00:06:46.680> hopeful<00:06:47.010> that<00:06:47.040> the

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
process it's really hopeful that the

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.970 
process it's really hopeful that the
orthodontist<00:06:47.850> is<00:06:48.600> willing<00:06:49.080> to<00:06:49.110> give<00:06:49.950> me

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 
orthodontist is willing to give me

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.820 
orthodontist is willing to give me
interest-free<00:06:50.520> payments<00:06:51.180> over<00:06:52.170> 18<00:06:52.470> months<00:06:52.740> so

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
interest-free payments over 18 months so

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.170 
interest-free payments over 18 months so
that<00:06:52.860> really<00:06:53.100> helps<00:06:53.430> it<00:06:53.580> ends<00:06:53.790> up<00:06:53.880> being<00:06:53.910> about

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 
that really helps it ends up being about

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.560 
that really helps it ends up being about
192<00:06:55.020> dollars<00:06:55.410> a<00:06:55.650> month<00:06:56.180> which<00:06:57.180> I<00:06:57.330> feel<00:06:57.510> is

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
192 dollars a month which I feel is
