00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.930
 I greet all lovers of embroidery on 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.150
 I want to share my channel 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.730
 happy shopping in one of my 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.780
 previous videos I showed how I 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.689
 also bought 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.860
 nikken rhyolis wool firms in order 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:28.690
 to survive and here is a picture under 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:32.680
 title kiss artist clint later 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.600
 some time I looked at the circuit 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.589
 which I had in stock 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.969
 somehow not very inspired to start it 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:46.749
 embroider because the pattern as always 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.760
 It was not very high quality, not that 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:51.549
 always a lot of quality schemes but here 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.219
 I got what I like or 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:57.010
 finely or slightly smeared symbol well 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.319
 and I basically thought that I was better 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.049
 the future is really less but 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:05.170
 sets in perspective and now how 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:08.260
 would get ready to quietly buy and what 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.020
 I like it so much 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.270
 set again I already talked about the title 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:19.450
 I will not repeat it in principle 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.910
 standard I will not open it and not 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.400
 offend because when I do not embroider 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.860
 know just don't wanna break it 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.150
 integrity I like it, and then the soul 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.690
 warm when he is so clean 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.470
 neat unpacked principle 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.600
 the composition of the set is all familiar with it 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.110
 woolen strings here even you are beautiful 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.270
 their colors are visible to a hank just yes further 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.990
 this tablet goes to 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.070
 coated thread is the case and if the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.390
 not exactly how to say see 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:58.690
 numbers or pick panin color to 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.100
 then according to the scheme to navigate the canvas 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.760
 here I don't know my garth of course wants her 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.390
 touch 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.950
 to the touch but here I am looking at it visually 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.920
 particular difference 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:17.349
 angam even now I do not see it so 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.120
 good but i will try when to embroider 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.849
 You can probably make some kind of conclusion 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:28.290
 for yourself well, naturally enters the set 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:34.920
 color scheme is written here 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:40.590
 composition of the set that color scheme outline 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.590
 so here is designer elena kolmakova 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:49.870
 they somehow like this drawing 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:59.950
 embroider it I will of course parking 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:05.829
 and in a pair with him I acquired another 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.239
 set of rhyolis from the same series based on 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:13.680
 works of klimt 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:18.579
 and he is called my mother and my baby 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.489
 I don't know when I ordered it 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.920
 finished work they have identical thirty 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.280
 thirty five centimeters that is how 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.609
 when I would pick up these two sets I like 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.340
 what if there are a couple of men and women 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:36.700
 a couple they don't even seem like a girl something 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:43.090
 looks like a girl from that picture with 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:45.760
 i like this baby i like baby to 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.739
 pretty darling and not found here 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.000
 pictures like these here's what that 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.810
 like mosaic patterns are so very bright 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.290
 I do not know how everything will embroider will not 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:03.870
 when your your parking is not scary 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.870
 identical composition also wool threads 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.780
 canvas 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.900
 its proud and 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.540
 strings and color scheme naturally 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.150
 when I start to embroider them I don't know 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.150
 definitely no sooner how to finish it all 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.090
 I have not started my work recently 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.250
 hurry me somehow already hang especially 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.289
 paintings have nowhere but their favorite hobby 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.139
 for this and not going to throw 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.440
 so here I am embroidering so slowly 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.800
 just a few works purely for the sake of 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.699
 pleasure in the future may be 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.850
 somehow change some pictures by 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.740
 I will hang everything else 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.210
 not yet material yes that is a picture 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.340
 which has to embroider 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:57.030
 to somehow put together could 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:59.530
 prettier here so here well that's all 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.830
