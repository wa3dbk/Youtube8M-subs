00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.460
 of the tan team of the season 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.840
 during a short weekend is also 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.829
 this is his little twitter and in the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.869
 description of the video 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.130
 so the gases the tan ibrahimovic there 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.140
 succeeds so you've seen right now 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.940
 one of the teams I'm working with 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.229
 test this is one of the teams here I 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.360
 wanted to clarify because I had 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.230
 I had created another team with 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.460
 zlatan with the cloud is 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.340
 bedtime 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.810
 high man of the match this version of the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.440
 cradle at 90 I'm really a very 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.479
 beautiful team 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.119
 and there I had made a team 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.159
 with ronaldo of the match tells him to the juke 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.240
 king but that was before the end 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.280
 in short, you understood 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.950
 jérémy du cabba and in this team 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.600
 jaimy ducasse and me rougeau prey brief 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.610
 a team really that is very very 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.319
 bad ass then the table what is that 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.080
 I then think of the nlhe and wait 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.600
 of a chief a guarantee a form sitive 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.550
 you see what I'm looking at first 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.519
 already it is that I take by its version 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.170
 boosted to its march in regular 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.700
 honestly guys what am I 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.110
 could have fallen that is what I could and 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.820
 games then it's true that in the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.830
 aerial domain is boss it's true 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.710
 than 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.260
 in the field what they physically know 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.250
 not too much but fucking there's a finish 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.320
 honestly finish so maybe 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.150
 that he has 99 finishing low so I have them 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.460
 wheels are absolutely not the guys the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.200
 second-hand name that I missed I had a 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.510
 little galley to mark with data 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.550
 and yet when you when I look at the 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.800
 like you say 'enough' the size of his 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.319
 balls at easy marc here but take 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.019
 two years when you compare these versions 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.209
 thot and its regular version is not a 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.280
 very big difference honestly that's it 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.480
 and it's true that it disappointed me it's 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.519
 still thing that disappointed me me 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.719
 quite disappointed because I was expecting 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.340
 to have georges do long at home 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.659
 which I did not put a motion for everything 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.040
 tell you I did not put a free kick 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.620
 also it's true that I like 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.510
 not too much of his stance when he 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.780
 him when he is when he fires a shot 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.939
 franc 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.900
 it hurried it's my personal opinion 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.969
 but hey I think I'm not the 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.319
 alone on corner he's just it's just 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.499
 god here it is true that this is 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.819
 one of those big big points but 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.739
 after that it's true that I find by this 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.120
 from the right in the field of 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.530
 finish 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.689
 even if it's not in the field 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.400
 of the fenice where I find it not 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.650
 exceptionally honestly here are the guys 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.209
 I had to heal and join aboard 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.739
 boats and that's after that does not prevent 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.079
 that bookstore beach it remains a player 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.209
 exceptional that he is one of the best 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.129
 scorers of access barrels but I was 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.930
 disappointed here I was disappointed it remains my 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.689
 opinion of one obviously but I was disappointed 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.459
 beb s because you see when you get 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.689
 say that this player cost and millions of 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.340
 where do I study my ass is chicken 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.620
 end here so maybe I did a 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.989
 shit expression but I think you 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.729
 did you understand this is selatan when you're there 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.229
 when you 're in lahti and the sim card of 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.409
 6th you expect it to be 12 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:11.130
 days 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:15.090
 and honestly it's heavy b 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.770
 no more here it is if it is the 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.270
 union minimum here are his qualities 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.160
 already low and his physique as I 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.989
 the ai said on set pieces 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.890
 especially on corner here I wanted to 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.570
 clarify because it's true that on 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.890
 free kick and serge lesbats work 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.250
 exceptional though it's true that these 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.680
 stats 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.700
 that's what he has five stars of gestures 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.010
 techniques it's really something 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.870
 crazy guys it's true that either 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.220
 beautiful already when we are 50 years old I was 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.230
 always in physics twice with a 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.230
 1095 it's true it's something 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.120
 from crazy to lega but dead is the same 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.560
 that sense the regular card but it's true 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.360
 that his cape town is sure it's a hit 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.500
 if they have to improve and that's 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.640
 something bad foot here 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.500
 it is true that of the left foot 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.910
 m6 happen I 'll have more I 'll be 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.590
 more put a five star mourinho 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.520
 clearly chestnut to reach for 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.400
 the assembly good reason that their 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.260
 business by bidel bias I believe in 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.780
 I'm a little tired ago 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.460
 now we're going to get started 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.140
 with his qualities we will finish with 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.690
 its defects but these defects if its 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.800
 finish and its price here's a price 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.660
 which is just mirobolant that's for 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.700
 quantity that this word is cute credit 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.160
 still for this player it's not 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.130
 all given here after his note 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.200
 then I am given in 7 out of 10 6 20 14th 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.740
 1 for health - that's its reason 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.660
 finish 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.510
 I honestly find that it's something 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.090
 thing that is part of a scorer 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.650
 who who is even the very essence in the 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.210
 scorer I told myself I can not 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.080
 leave that to people him two points because 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.460
 she rests the tad 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.590
 and then I removed a point also for 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.300
 its price even though it's true that you 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.550
 can tell me rose reach it's a 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.530
 player is normalized civc lé a move 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.440
 the game itself is very ylenia to make 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.380
 not take off I want well I well 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.420
 first will have 4 million or even 5 me 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.760
 your bepa not so honestly 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.350
 guys are a few months the tutti cost 5 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.870
 millions to tell you everything here 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.270
 know 196 was costing 5 million alas 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.500
 snatch touch costs 8 me including 3 kills 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.600
 here I am walking to ps she well 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.310
 obviously and yes the geishas a little 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.720
 little is therefore put for these is for 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.360
 that I decided to put him a 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.020
 rating of 7 out of 10 which is not either 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.970
 of 10 thanks 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.830
 that's because hide but it's not 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.900
 no longer a hood and envied but so 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.150
 and well in the past now because he 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.920
 needed when I was going to pass 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.200
 I am really very very tired 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.340
 thought did not touch my post he 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.470
 should not miss but no I am 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.420
 girl I'm just exploded down is 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.400
 now in his balance sheet so this is this 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.720
 part is played 11 goals scored here it is 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.770
 I could not put all the goals for 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.960
 the assembly good reason that I could not 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:36.120
 save all the clips and so at 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.250
 final must I buy and ben j said 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.480
 to see because for what he 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.760
 really worth it and for its price 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.320
 honestly it's not worth the 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.270
 that's where they left off here 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.770
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.080
 plainview it's true that it's been since 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.910
 a very long time that I had steupled rebus 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.250
 or how can I do 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.750
 that we story you see that it's been doing since 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.490
 two, three, little weeks since then 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.150
 and it's true that with what is mine 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.820
 happened that it's 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.160
 I could not record the sound if 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.590
 I can say the Koran tahri anyway 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.760
 in short the genres we will stop here 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.080
 guys hopefully that will have you more 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.520
 of books the small with small 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.480
 comments the little sharing dark and 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.310
 you know the music 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:15.830
 worse if the wars tomorrow may be 

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.830
 for a video stone
