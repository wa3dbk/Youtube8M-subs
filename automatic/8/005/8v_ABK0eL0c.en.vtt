I<00:05:07.110> guess<00:05:07.320> of<00:05:07.880> starting<00:05:08.880> up<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.360> car<00:05:09.630> is

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
I guess of starting up the car is

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.580 
I guess of starting up the car is
actually<00:05:11.970> it's<00:05:12.780> going<00:05:13.020> to<00:05:13.080> be<00:05:13.170> on<00:05:13.290> a<00:05:13.320> cold

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
actually it's going to be on a cold

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:26.119 
actually it's going to be on a cold
start<00:05:13.920> so<00:05:14.220> you<00:05:14.280> guys<00:05:14.580> can<00:05:14.790> hear<00:05:15.090> it

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:26.129 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:28.999 

it<00:05:26.610> starts<00:05:26.969> up<00:05:27.119> like<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:27.449> every<00:05:28.020> time<00:05:28.050> it

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
it starts up like that every time it

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.709 
it starts up like that every time it
