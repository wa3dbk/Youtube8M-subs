using so right now I have been

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.769 
using so right now I have been
researching<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.609> lot<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.880> things<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.300> find<00:00:18.510> out

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
researching a lot of things to find out

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.859 
researching a lot of things to find out
what<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.350> my<00:00:19.770> hair<00:00:20.070> actually<00:00:20.310> needs<00:00:21.060> so

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
what it is my hair actually needs so

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.390 
what it is my hair actually needs so
that<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.320> stay<00:00:22.560> moisturized<00:00:23.070> throughout

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that it can stay moisturized throughout

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.750 
that it can stay moisturized throughout
the<00:00:23.850> day<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.410> where<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> started<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.369> finding

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
the day so where I started was finding

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.630 
the day so where I started was finding
out<00:00:26.910> exactly<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:28.109> he<00:00:28.410> meant<00:00:28.619> tense<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.220> anti

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
out exactly what he meant tense and anti

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.140 
out exactly what he meant tense and anti
he<00:00:29.849> met<00:00:30.029> density

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
use it with a dew point between 30

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.470 
use it with a dew point between 30
degrees<00:00:39.830> Fahrenheit<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:40.940> 50<00:00:41.330> degrees

Fahrenheit anything above or below that

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
Fahrenheit anything above or below that
can<00:00:45.680> actually<00:00:46.390> do<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.720> reverse<00:00:48.110> effect<00:00:48.410> of

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
can actually do the reverse effect of

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.900 
can actually do the reverse effect of
the<00:00:49.310> humidity<00:00:50.290> so<00:00:51.290> but<00:00:51.950> within<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:52.640> dew

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
the humidity so but within that dew

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.570 
the humidity so but within that dew
point<00:00:52.970> of<00:00:53.510> 30<00:00:53.900> degrees<00:00:54.320> Fahrenheit<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.160> 50

point of 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 50
degrees<00:00:55.910> Fahrenheit<00:00:56.200> it<00:00:57.200> causes<00:00:57.770> your<00:00:58.130> your

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
degrees Fahrenheit it causes your your

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.910 
degrees Fahrenheit it causes your your
hair<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.420> draw<00:00:59.630> in<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.050> moisture<00:01:00.530> from<00:01:00.800> the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
hair to draw in the moisture from the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.840 
hair to draw in the moisture from the
air<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:02.530> it's<00:01:03.530> actually<00:01:03.710> beneficial<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.760> your

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
air so it's actually beneficial to your

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.900 
air so it's actually beneficial to your
hair<00:01:05.180> now<00:01:05.449> if<00:01:06.229> it's<00:01:06.470> a<00:01:06.619> note<00:01:06.800> if<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:07.340> are<00:01:07.520> in<00:01:07.760> a

25 degrees Fahrenheit of a dew point

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.180 
25 degrees Fahrenheit of a dew point
then<00:01:16.160> you<00:01:16.729> don't<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:17.570> do<00:01:17.750> not<00:01:17.780> want<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.979> use<00:01:19.160> a

then you don't you do not want to use a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.910 
then you don't you do not want to use a
humectant<00:01:19.700> on<00:01:20.119> your<00:01:20.300> hair<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.320> humic<00:01:21.710> that

wet right out your hair versus

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.880 
wet right out your hair versus
moisturize<00:01:25.520> okay<00:01:25.940> so<00:01:26.690> it's<00:01:27.050> not<00:01:27.170> beneficial

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
moisturize okay so it's not beneficial

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.060 
moisturize okay so it's not beneficial
for<00:01:28.310> desert<00:01:28.880> climates<00:01:29.540> or<00:01:29.869> climates<00:01:30.680> like<00:01:30.860> I'm

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
for desert climates or climates like I'm

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.290 
for desert climates or climates like I'm
in<00:01:31.310> here<00:01:32.110> if<00:01:33.110> you<00:01:33.320> like<00:01:33.500> humidity<00:01:33.920> area<00:01:34.550> then

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
in here if you like humidity area then

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.230 
in here if you like humidity area then
it<00:01:35.900> will<00:01:36.259> still<00:01:37.130> draw<00:01:37.430> moisture<00:01:37.729> into<00:01:38.149> your

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
it will still draw moisture into your

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.810 
it will still draw moisture into your
hair<00:01:38.330> but<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:39.140> will<00:01:39.320> over<00:01:39.920> saturate<00:01:40.610> your<00:01:40.759> hair

hair but it will over saturate your hair
with<00:01:41.270> moisture<00:01:41.570> lead<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:42.679> that<00:01:42.920> will<00:01:43.130> cause

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
with moisture lead and that will cause

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.690 
with moisture lead and that will cause
the<00:01:43.399> frizziness<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.780> happen<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:45.350> your<00:01:45.500> hair<00:01:45.740> so

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
for people on a high humidity you might

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.940 
for people on a high humidity you might
want<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.210> look<00:01:50.390> into<00:01:50.630> using<00:01:51.350> anti<00:01:52.039> human

right<00:02:23.680> now<00:02:23.920> are<00:02:24.190> called<00:02:24.600> silicones<00:02:25.600> coz

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
right now are called silicones coz

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.490 
right now are called silicones coz
silicones<00:02:27.100> repel<00:02:27.640> moisture<00:02:27.970> now<00:02:28.960> there<00:02:29.290> are

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
silicones repel moisture now there are

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.910 
silicones repel moisture now there are
certain<00:02:30.010> silicones<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:31.000> are<00:02:31.290> water<00:02:32.290> soluble

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
certain silicones that are water soluble

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.420 
certain silicones that are water soluble
so<00:02:34.260> silicones<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.380> are<00:02:35.650> while<00:02:35.950> you<00:02:36.100> saw<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
so silicones that are while you saw the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.330 
so silicones that are while you saw the
water<00:02:37.030> soluble<00:02:37.660> will<00:02:38.140> break<00:02:38.410> down<00:02:38.440> in<00:02:39.130> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
water soluble will break down in the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.420 
water soluble will break down in the
water<00:02:39.580> making<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.750> easier<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.320> wash<00:02:41.770> now<00:02:42.070> you

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
water making it easier to wash now you

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.170 
water making it easier to wash now you
use<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.910> anti<00:02:43.380> humectants<00:02:44.410> in<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:45.040> way<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.340> seal

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
use the anti humectants in a way to seal

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.900 
use the anti humectants in a way to seal
your<00:02:46.630> hair<00:02:46.960> so<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.260> could<00:02:47.620> seal<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.670> moisture

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
your hair so you could seal the moisture

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.840 
your hair so you could seal the moisture
inside<00:02:49.810> of<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.740> won't<00:02:51.130> escape<00:02:53.850> so

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
inside of it so that it won't escape so

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.530 
inside of it so that it won't escape so
which<00:02:55.600> is<00:02:55.840> come<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:57.010> my<00:02:57.190> next<00:02:57.430> point<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:58.030> using

which is come to my next point is using
a<00:02:58.810> water<00:02:59.140> oil

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.090 

those<00:03:33.420> are<00:03:33.600> some<00:03:33.870> humans<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.950> would

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
those are some humans and I would

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.120 
those are some humans and I would
suggest<00:03:36.020> you<00:03:37.020> know<00:03:37.050> using<00:03:37.530> them<00:03:37.860> in
