00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
do some wide grip moves and you had

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.040 
do some wide grip moves and you had
place<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.270> lat<00:00:54.570> pulldown

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
place this up on the lat pulldown

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.549 
place this up on the lat pulldown
machine<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:56.090> maybe<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.449> little<00:00:57.480> guy<00:00:57.960> here

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
machine or maybe this little guy here

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.799 
machine or maybe this little guy here
it's<00:00:59.039> more<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.430> triangle<00:00:59.820> for<00:01:00.359> some<00:01:00.539> narrow

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it's more of a triangle for some narrow

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.200 
it's more of a triangle for some narrow
grip<00:01:01.079> movements<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.280> we're<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> focus

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
grip movements so we're going to focus

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
grip movements so we're going to focus
on<00:01:03.480> these<00:01:03.690> three<00:01:03.750> pieces<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.739> how<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.010> can

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
on these three pieces and how you can

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.550 
on these three pieces and how you can
utilize<00:01:05.519> them<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.240> your<00:01:06.630> back<00:01:07.110> workout

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
utilize them in your back workout

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.420 
utilize them in your back workout
particularly<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> lat<00:01:08.939> pulldown<00:01:09.330> machine

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
particularly on the lat pulldown machine

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.609 
particularly on the lat pulldown machine
so<00:01:11.430> here<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.510> wide<00:01:12.900> grip<00:01:13.290> lat

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
so here we are at the wide grip lat

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.560 
so here we are at the wide grip lat
pulldown<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.299> don't

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
pulldown and as you can see I don't

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
pulldown and as you can see I don't
think<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> appropriate<00:01:16.530> weight<00:01:17.009> set

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
think we have the appropriate weight set

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100 
think we have the appropriate weight set
on<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> machine<00:01:18.030> because<00:01:18.390> Ashley<00:01:18.869> can

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
on the machine because Ashley can

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
on the machine because Ashley can
literally<00:01:19.350> hang<00:01:19.770> from<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.400> not<00:01:20.939> pull<00:01:21.210> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
literally hang from it and not pull it

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.820 
literally hang from it and not pull it
down<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.869> why<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.229> important

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
down so this is why it's so important

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.070 
down so this is why it's so important
that<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.430> check<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.000> select<00:01:24.780> an<00:01:24.960> appropriate

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
that you check and select an appropriate

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.679 
that you check and select an appropriate
wait<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> correctly<00:01:27.299> now

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
wait for you to do it correctly now

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.060 
wait for you to do it correctly now
she's<00:01:27.900> choosing<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.409> weight<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.590> even

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
she's choosing a weight that's even

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.170 
she's choosing a weight that's even
lighter<00:01:29.280> than<00:01:29.520> she<00:01:29.729> would<00:01:29.820> normally<00:01:29.970> use

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
lighter than she would normally use

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.730 
lighter than she would normally use
because<00:01:30.509> we're<00:01:30.750> focusing<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.290> technique

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
because we're focusing on technique

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.550 
because we're focusing on technique
she's<00:01:32.700> got<00:01:32.850> her<00:01:32.939> hands<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.479> nice<00:01:33.659> wide<00:01:34.140> grip

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
she's got her hands in a nice wide grip

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.950 
she's got her hands in a nice wide grip
here<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.310> want<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> make<00:01:35.790> sure<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.720> grip

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
here so you want to make sure the grip

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.260 
here so you want to make sure the grip
is<00:01:37.170> wide<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:38.070> too<00:01:38.369> wide<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.180> she

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
is wide but not too wide for you so she

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.149 
is wide but not too wide for you so she
had<00:01:39.630> her<00:01:39.780> hands<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.439> way<00:01:40.829> out<00:01:40.950> here

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
had her hands all the way out here

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.700 
had her hands all the way out here
that's<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.240> too<00:01:42.540> wide<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:42.840> her<00:01:43.229> body<00:01:43.470> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
that's just too wide for her body and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.889 
that's just too wide for her body and
frame<00:01:43.920> some<00:01:44.640> people<00:01:44.970> even<00:01:45.119> need<00:01:45.450> two<00:01:45.600> more

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
frame some people even need two more
