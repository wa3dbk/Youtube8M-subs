and he hadn't I'd be able to do put it
for<00:01:39.530> three<00:01:39.710> years<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.210> basically<00:01:41.210> I<00:01:41.240> know<00:01:41.360> that

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
for three years so basically I know that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.100 
for three years so basically I know that
the<00:01:41.690> pressure<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.080> on<00:01:42.259> us<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:44.420> everybody

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
the pressure is on us and that everybody

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.039 
the pressure is on us and that everybody
expect<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:46.460> we<00:01:47.330> win<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.570> Tour<00:01:47.720> de<00:01:47.810> France

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
expect that we win the Tour de France

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.340 
expect that we win the Tour de France
we've<00:01:48.920> done<00:01:49.100> at<00:01:49.220> nine<00:01:49.399> times<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.630> think<00:01:51.200> we

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
we've done at nine times so I I think we

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.249 
we've done at nine times so I I think we
have<00:01:51.530> we<00:01:52.220> have<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.580> quality<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.030> do<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.420> again

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
but for me it's also about dealing with

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.249 
but for me it's also about dealing with
that<00:01:59.090> pressure<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.630> that's<00:01:59.780> actually<00:01:59.899> what
