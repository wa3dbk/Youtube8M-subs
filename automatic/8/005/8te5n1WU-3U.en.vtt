is<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.239> cool-looking<00:03:04.510> piece<00:03:04.840> light<00:03:05.650> blue

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
is a cool-looking piece light blue

is a cool-looking piece light blue
translucent<00:03:07.329> blue<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:09.400> really<00:03:09.579> cool<00:03:10.650> yeah

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
translucent blue it's really cool yeah

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.300 
translucent blue it's really cool yeah
it's<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.940> little<00:03:13.030> smaller<00:03:13.510> than<00:03:13.629> the<00:03:13.930> new<00:03:14.079> one

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
it's a little smaller than the new one

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.140 
it's a little smaller than the new one
actually<00:03:15.310> maybe<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.989> quite<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.019> bit<00:03:17.230> smaller<00:03:17.440> I

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
actually maybe the quite a bit smaller I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.839 
actually maybe the quite a bit smaller I
like<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.389> I'll<00:03:19.769> probably<00:03:20.769> do<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.040> comparison<00:03:21.549> I

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
like it I'll probably do a comparison I

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.210 
like it I'll probably do a comparison I
don't<00:03:22.030> know<00:03:22.120> which<00:03:22.299> one<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.510> like<00:03:22.750> better<00:03:23.220> sort

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
don't know which one I like better sort

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.830 
don't know which one I like better sort
of<00:03:24.310> like<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.609> new<00:03:24.760> one<00:03:24.970> because<00:03:25.209> how<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.629> does

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
of like the new one because how it does

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.849 
of like the new one because how it does
that<00:03:26.049> like<00:03:26.290> Tareen<00:03:26.650> thing<00:03:26.949> but<00:03:27.660> yeah<00:03:28.859> there's

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
that like Tareen thing but yeah there's

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.670 
that like Tareen thing but yeah there's
this<00:03:29.980> one<00:03:30.190> sweeter<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:31.389> now<00:03:31.930> on<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.379> the<00:03:32.470> big

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
this one sweeter and now on to the big

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.530 
this one sweeter and now on to the big
part<00:03:33.150> yeah<00:03:35.730> here<00:03:36.730> we<00:03:36.849> go<00:03:37.440> look<00:03:38.440> at<00:03:38.739> it<00:03:38.799> right

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
part yeah here we go look at it right

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.460 
part yeah here we go look at it right
it's<00:03:40.540> got<00:03:41.069> like<00:03:42.069> a<00:03:42.099> bullet<00:03:42.609> I<00:03:43.260> didn't<00:03:44.260> want<00:03:44.349> to

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
it's got like a bullet I didn't want to

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.439 
it's got like a bullet I didn't want to
shoot<00:03:44.680> that<00:03:44.889> can<00:03:45.669> shoot<00:03:45.849> it<00:03:45.970> pretty<00:03:46.209> far

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
shoot that can shoot it pretty far

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.970 
shoot that can shoot it pretty far
though<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:48.730> old<00:03:49.120> ones<00:03:49.480> had<00:03:49.780> have<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.500> big<00:03:50.680> tip

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
though the old ones had have the big tip

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.580 
though the old ones had have the big tip
on<00:03:51.160> them<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.639> then<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.480> new<00:03:52.660> ones<00:03:52.900> just<00:03:53.319> have

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
on them and then the new ones just have

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.599 
on them and then the new ones just have
that<00:03:53.859> little<00:03:54.040> flimsy<00:03:54.489> thing<00:03:54.940> on<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.419> but<00:03:55.750> I

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
that little flimsy thing on it but I

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.339 
that little flimsy thing on it but I
like<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.790> old<00:03:57.910> ones<00:03:58.209> but<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:58.870> new<00:03:58.989> ones<00:03:59.169> go

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
like the old ones but the new ones go

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.240 
like the old ones but the new ones go
farther<00:03:59.620> so<00:04:00.220> I<00:04:00.660> know<00:04:01.859> it's<00:04:02.859> got<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.129> nice

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
farther so I know it's got the nice

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.860 
farther so I know it's got the nice
engine<00:04:03.519> detail<00:04:05.609> looks<00:04:06.609> really<00:04:07.000> cool<00:04:07.269> it's<00:04:07.750> got

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
engine detail looks really cool it's got

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.360 
engine detail looks really cool it's got
two<00:04:08.769> rotors<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:10.230> sort<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.290> wish<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.980> could<00:04:12.159> like

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
two rotors I sort of wish you could like

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.099 
two rotors I sort of wish you could like
connect<00:04:12.790> them<00:04:13.030> so<00:04:13.389> they<00:04:13.540> would<00:04:13.659> stay<00:04:13.930> like

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
connect them so they would stay like

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.710 
connect them so they would stay like
that<00:04:14.879> but<00:04:15.879> they<00:04:16.030> they<00:04:16.570> both<00:04:16.810> spin<00:04:18.000> like<00:04:19.000> I<00:04:19.239> can

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
that but they they both spin like I can

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.240 
that but they they both spin like I can
leave<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.109> one<00:04:20.289> around

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.260 

yeah<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:25.310> supposed<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.460> look<00:04:26.580> like<00:04:26.640> that<00:04:26.850> the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
yeah so supposed to look like that the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.350 
yeah so supposed to look like that the
whole<00:04:27.300> time<00:04:27.630> but<00:04:30.890> yep<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.550> can<00:04:32.850> drop<00:04:33.060> bombs

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
whole time but yep so you can drop bombs

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
whole time but yep so you can drop bombs
and<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.020> have<00:04:34.200> my<00:04:34.380> tripod<00:04:34.620> here<00:04:35.040> with<00:04:35.250> me<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:35.940> I

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
and I have my tripod here with me so I

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.820 
and I have my tripod here with me so I
can<00:04:37.380> show<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:37.740> how<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.250> mechanism<00:04:38.910> art<00:04:39.830> it's

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
can show you how the mechanism art it's

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:49.060 
can show you how the mechanism art it's
a<00:04:40.920> pretty<00:04:41.160> nice<00:04:41.750> cool<00:04:43.940> okay<00:04:44.940> so<00:04:47.210> here<00:04:48.210> we<00:04:48.300> go

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
a pretty nice cool okay so here we go

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.360 
a pretty nice cool okay so here we go
you<00:04:50.070> pull<00:04:50.280> this<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:51.690> pulls<00:04:52.140> that<00:04:52.410> little<00:04:52.860> axle

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
you pull this it pulls that little axle

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.650 
you pull this it pulls that little axle
there<00:04:53.720> which<00:04:55.070> pulls<00:04:56.070> a<00:04:56.280> little<00:04:56.550> slot<00:04:56.910> open

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
there which pulls a little slot open

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.100 
there which pulls a little slot open
from<00:04:58.080> here<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.560> drops<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.100> box<00:04:59.310> and<00:05:03.110> here

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
from here and drops the box and here

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:14.150 
from here and drops the box and here
let's<00:05:04.950> try<00:05:05.730> show<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:09.290> here<00:05:11.660> it<00:05:12.800> just<00:05:13.800> sort<00:05:14.010> of

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
let's try show you here it just sort of

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.900 
let's try show you here it just sort of
clicks<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:15.270> like<00:05:15.510> that<00:05:15.780> goes<00:05:16.020> in<00:05:16.669> let's<00:05:17.669> try

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
clicks that like that goes in let's try

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.670 
clicks that like that goes in let's try
that<00:05:18.120> again<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:18.930> can<00:05:19.110> wash<00:05:19.320> that<00:05:19.620> part<00:05:20.419> so

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
that again and you can wash that part so

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.310 
that again and you can wash that part so
well<00:05:22.680> I<00:05:23.010> have<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.400> pull<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.730> out<00:05:23.850> because

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
well I have to pull it out because

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.860 
well I have to pull it out because
Daphne's<00:05:25.320> gone<00:05:25.910> then<00:05:26.910> but<00:05:27.330> ok<00:05:28.229> so<00:05:28.310> watch<00:05:29.310> that

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
part and I push this in it just clicks

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.980 
part and I push this in it just clicks
up<00:05:34.560> a<00:05:34.650> little<00:05:34.919> bit<00:05:35.070> goes<00:05:35.340> in<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:35.610> little<00:05:35.940> bit<00:05:36.120> and

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
cool I really like that re mechanism

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.500 
cool I really like that re mechanism
then<00:05:45.270> all<00:05:45.990> of<00:05:46.050> most<00:05:46.710> of<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.010> old<00:05:47.820> ones<00:05:48.150> on<00:05:48.390> this

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
then all of most of the old ones on this

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.310 
then all of most of the old ones on this
series<00:05:49.040> of<00:05:50.040> on<00:05:50.820> have<00:05:51.360> bombs<00:05:51.690> or<00:05:52.020> something
