00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.900
 I am Laura Borlini and today I'm dying 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.940
 I want to give you my beauty secret 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.650
 let's make a mask that we 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.299
 It serves all because who does not have 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.920
 some little spots sometimes we do 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.470
 Be careful, we do not wear protective 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.510
 sun spots appear and sometimes the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.119
 skin is half luminous and is ugly it looks 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.890
 ugly why a mask for the skin 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.080
 bright and for spots on the skin 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.720
 first we cut the lemon in two parts 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.180
 and we remove some juice then at 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.710
 lemon we add a pinch of sugar and 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.780
 a few drops of olive oil once 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.579

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.010
 preparation we apply it for all 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.100

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.899
 nose , chin and cheeks 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.579
 of course always taking care of the contour of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.270
 the eyes then we can face with 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.430
 abundant water I recommend you 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.820

 so there goes my secret in a 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.509
 container place the yolk of an egg 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.750
 add a spoonful of milk in 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.050
 powder then we add a spoonful of 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.530
 almond oil finally we add 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.320
 a spoonful of honey we mix the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.070
 ingredients to form a very paste 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.049
 creamy 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:01.119
 once the mask is ready we apply 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:05.869
 on the hands we rub well 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:09.110
 interlacing both hands we let act 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.680
 for 20 minutes past the time 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.950
 remove with plenty of cold water 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.700
 I recommend you practice this recipe two 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:27.079
 times per week so your hands will look 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:29.239
 radiant and nourished hello friends like 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.060
 I am in the registry and today 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.519
 I 'm going to show you how to shape your nose 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.569
 with good makeup and for that 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.780
 we need a brown shadow a shadow 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.810
 luminous white and of course a brush 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.870
 first we dial from the 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.540
 frown to the tip of the nose with 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:55.269
 the brown shadow then we blend with 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.269
 the same brush from the top down 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.739
 step 3 we take the white shadow with the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.370
 fingertip and we put a little bit in 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:09.250
 the tip of the nose 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.250
 then we blink upwards 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:19.870
 and so we will have the result of a 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:23.310
 Practical nose practice is very easy 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.310
 and super simple
