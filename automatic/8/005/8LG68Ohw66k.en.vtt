00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.790
 I know I 've been late to do these 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.990
 reviews and I know I'm also late 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.610
 in other products that I also have to 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.240
 do I am a little behind I have 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.800
 to put on the turbo and get fast 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.350
 because we are waiting for the video other 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.560
 products go 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.710
 well today it is then the turn to the 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.320
 product by at minimum and be minimized 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.570
 from dior pores this product i what 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.400
 I wrote in December exactly on 6 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.380
 December I remember exactly because 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.420
 nicola's day here in germany me 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.420
 I put the gifts of St. Nicholas day and 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.309
 also a portfolio and that makes then 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.570
 I received a test previously 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.960
 previously of this product and I 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.699
 loved me I was fascinated by the test and I 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.340
 I was thinking about buying it but not what 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.260
 I was thinking a lot and my wife seems 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.510
 in this case listen to the listened 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.610
 say to me I want it but it 's very expensive 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.290
 I do not want to pay in life I'm a 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.940
 of the people that I think a lot to the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.220
 time to spend my money on what I spend 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.510
 and if it 's worth speaking and those things and 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.750
 for a single product because more or less 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.610
 the cream we are going to say is set me 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.240
 it seems that they were 43 euros exactly 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.980
 we buy it indular they sell it in all 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 parties drugstores and it 's because they come 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.400
 he soon really gave me a little bit of 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.950
 pain paralyzed so I conquered it and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.070
 I happy well then the product brings 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.920
 exactly 30 milliliters of product what 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.810
 which is pretty good is practically 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.910
 the same thing that brings most of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.360
 makeup bases that we buy 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.310
 so if we compare I have is here 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.600
 for example 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.979
 by hand and it is exactly this is the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.439
 base of several ore that I made the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.869
 previous video and this one also has 30 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.039
 milliliters of product ok almost always 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.350
 for achieving the foundation of makeup 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.170
 brings about 30 milliliters and those 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.360
 things well for the amount you have more 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.930
 or less is fine considering the brand 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.209
 of the product true ok the product is 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.550
 designed to minimize pores and 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.220
 expression lines this is a first one 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.100
 use before makeup and 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.540
 normally this type of product prime 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.340
 general primers of any brand 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.110
 that is are indicated for people who 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.390
 they go from 25 and they start to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.060
 show either by a little dilated or 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.160
 open or expression lines 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.870
 this goes practically then to erase the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.090
 expression line this version 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.180
 exactly indirectly it is a 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.060
 matifying version they also have 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.980
 the same first in light version that 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.540
 for dry skin or that there are 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.549
 people who have dry skin then 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.230
 that will use the other version because 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.000
 This is indicated for people of skin 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.670
 this normal 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.690
 to massify the people who have 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.190
 faithful here has nothing to 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.470
 notify the opposite needs 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.820
 luminosity let's move on then to the 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.350
 application of this product as I what 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.530
 I use the quantity and we continue with the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.530
 video 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.540
 and well my loves as they saw a 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.830
 little enough and too many to use 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.780
 remember my loves that as for 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.600
 foundation creams if those things 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.430
 always always always good 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.470
 economize product do not get 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.880
 too much product because not because 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.440
 use more products you will have a 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.610
 better effect otherwise the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.500
 people that we have lines of expression 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.640
 already a little bit marked like me by 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.310
 example to whom refers to the front a 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.930
 little bit so if we do not put too much 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.550
 product is going to be worse because it's going 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.170
 to accumulate the product in the line of 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.850
 expression then ok ok because 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.710
 removes the good diffuses tooth and point 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.200
 this product for me is a product 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.880
 Wonder is the best product of 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.740
 first one that I've used so far 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.720
 I have a bugle for example 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.040
 clarins minutes I also have by 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.230
 example the pre base of that forum 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.060
 and other brands that I do not 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.610
 agreement very well and of all that everything 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.610
 be all the favorites that I say 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.310
 good this product wow is this product 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.980
 from dior to me this has been a before and 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.630
 a later definitely and although 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.880
 has a pretty expensive price is 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.550
 highly recommended I would recommend 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.840
 this product to eyes closed to eyes 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.340
 Closed is one of the few products 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.070
 that I can put my hand on fire 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.400
 because I know that when I use them 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.990
 going to love they are going to say when 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.980
 many times for example we bought a 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.200
 makeup foundation that costs us 35 40 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.480
 euros and it does not hurt us so much then 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.180
 a prime if we think good to the girl 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.310
 that we have already passed the 30 35 and so this 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.020
 it is a necessary product because this does not 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.060
 will help the finish of the base 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.280
 is very very different , we will see the 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.490
 much smoother skin much more then of 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.410
 chord and much more settled and pores 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.050
 they disappear completely with this 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.460
 first of all I think my love 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.930
 which has scored more or less everything 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.040
 everything has to do with this product 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.150
 that I have stayed that I want 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.220
 ask 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.130
 I have always been told in below in 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.690
 the box then in the comments 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.340
 do not forget to also follow my others 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.260
 channels has a blog channel 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.930
 relatives etc. there is also a channel 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.070

 I talk then everything that has to do 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.270
 as johnny with my weight loss my 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.040
 food and those things but I checked to 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.870
 do not saturate this program this channel 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.580
 beauty with those themes that perhaps 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.020
 many people are interested in that 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.850
 I have a separate channel for whoever is 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.980
 interested in the systems every time 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.130
 we already have until next time 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.130
 bye
