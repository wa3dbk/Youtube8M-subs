00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990 

I<00:00:00.299> was<00:00:01.050> an<00:00:01.560> experimenter<00:00:02.220> on<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.429> Voyager<00:00:02.820> 1

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
I was an experimenter on the Voyager 1

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.710 
I was an experimenter on the Voyager 1
and<00:00:03.030> 2<00:00:03.389> spacecraft<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.380> after<00:00:04.770> they<00:00:05.480> swept<00:00:06.480> by

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
and 2 spacecraft and after they swept by

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.040 
and 2 spacecraft and after they swept by
the<00:00:06.750> Jupiter<00:00:07.680> Saturn<00:00:07.859> Uranus<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.580> Neptune

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
the Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.620 
the Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune
systems<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.650> was<00:00:11.280> possible<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.030> do<00:00:12.240> something

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
systems it was possible to do something

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.270 
systems it was possible to do something
I<00:00:12.750> had<00:00:12.929> wanted<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.290> do<00:00:13.500> from<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.860> beginning

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
I had wanted to do from the beginning

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.300 
I had wanted to do from the beginning
and<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.849> turn<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:16.170> cameras<00:00:16.590> on<00:00:16.859> one

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and that is to turn the cameras on one

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.760 
and that is to turn the cameras on one
of<00:00:17.430> these<00:00:17.520> spacecraft<00:00:17.820> back<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:19.260> photograph

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
of these spacecraft back to photograph

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.420 
of these spacecraft back to photograph
the<00:00:20.100> planet<00:00:20.699> from<00:00:20.910> which<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.270> had<00:00:21.390> come<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
the planet from which it had come and

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.500 
the planet from which it had come and
clearly<00:00:23.430> there<00:00:24.029> would<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.330> much

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
clearly there would not be much

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.830 
clearly there would not be much
scientific<00:00:25.350> data<00:00:26.130> from<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.670> because<00:00:27.090> we

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
scientific data from this because we

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
scientific data from this because we
were<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.109> far<00:00:28.349> away<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.010> earth<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.910> just

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
were so far away that the earth was just

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.620 
were so far away that the earth was just
a<00:00:30.539> point<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.289> pale<00:00:31.740> blue<00:00:31.949> dot<00:00:32.180> but<00:00:33.180> when<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.450> took

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
a point a pale blue dot but when we took

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.590 
a point a pale blue dot but when we took
the<00:00:33.809> picture<00:00:34.610> there<00:00:35.610> was<00:00:35.760> something<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the picture there was something about it

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.080 
the picture there was something about it
that<00:00:36.780> seemed<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.320> me<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.149> poignant<00:00:41.090> vulnerable

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that seemed to me so poignant vulnerable

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.500 
that seemed to me so poignant vulnerable
tiny<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.370> had<00:00:44.520> photographed<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.239> from

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
tiny and if we had photographed it from

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.299 
tiny and if we had photographed it from
a<00:00:45.780> much<00:00:46.020> further<00:00:46.260> distance<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.039> would<00:00:47.160> have

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
a much further distance it would have

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.569 
a much further distance it would have
been<00:00:47.430> gone<00:00:47.730> lost<00:00:48.230> against<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> backdrop

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
been gone lost against the backdrop

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.920 
been gone lost against the backdrop
backdrop<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> distant<00:00:51.180> stars<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.649> me<00:00:52.829> I

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
backdrop of distant stars and to me I

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.069 
backdrop of distant stars and to me I
thought<00:00:54.930> there<00:00:55.620> that's<00:00:56.520> us<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:57.390> our<00:00:57.690> world

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
thought there that's us that's our world

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.020 
thought there that's us that's our world

heard of lived out their lives there on

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
heard of lived out their lives there on
a<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.020> mote<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.049> dust<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.830> sunbeam<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:09.080> it

a on a mote of dust in a sunbeam and it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.340 
a on a mote of dust in a sunbeam and it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
spoke to me about the need for us to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.740 
spoke to me about the need for us to
care<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.070> another<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.689> also<00:01:15.689> to

underscored the tiny pneus the

underscored the tiny pneus the

comparative insignificance of our world

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.660 
comparative insignificance of our world
and<00:01:30.840> ourselves<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:32.250> said<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.640> your

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
and ourselves as you said in your

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.350 
and ourselves as you said in your
opening<00:01:32.820> remarks<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:34.650> know<00:01:34.770> back<00:01:35.070> when<00:01:35.850> men

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
opening remarks you know back when men

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.999 
opening remarks you know back when men
were<00:01:36.570> walking<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.140> moon<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.320> there<00:01:37.860> was

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
were walking on the moon that there was

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.640 
were walking on the moon that there was
that<00:01:38.130> famous<00:01:38.400> photo<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.360> earth<00:01:39.869> rise<00:01:40.200> over

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that famous photo of the earth rise over

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.960 
that famous photo of the earth rise over
the<00:01:40.680> moon<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.520> guess<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.790> might<00:01:41.909> call

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the moon and the I guess you might call

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.450 
the moon and the I guess you might call
it<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> bright<00:01:42.659> blue<00:01:42.899> marble<00:01:43.369> compared<00:01:44.369> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
it the bright blue marble compared to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.569 
it the bright blue marble compared to
your<00:01:44.579> pale<00:01:44.850> blue<00:01:45.119> dot<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.899> sort<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.409> led<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
your pale blue dot that sort of led to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.249 
your pale blue dot that sort of led to
movements<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> environmental

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
movements like the environmental

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
movements like the environmental
movement<00:01:49.290> when<00:01:49.649> people<00:01:49.950> could<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.340> us<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.670> a

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
movement when people could see us as a

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460 
movement when people could see us as a
united<00:01:51.240> planet<00:01:51.630> without<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.990> political

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
united planet without the political

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.880 
united planet without the political
boundaries<00:01:52.850> exactly<00:01:53.850> oh<00:01:54.170> can<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.470> use<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
boundaries exactly oh can we you use the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.130 
boundaries exactly oh can we you use the
pale<00:01:56.100> blue<00:01:56.130> dot<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.939> an<00:01:57.090> analogy<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.930> or

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
pale blue dot as an analogy to that or

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.690 
pale blue dot as an analogy to that or
something<00:01:58.469> that's<00:01:58.590> even<00:01:58.829> further<00:01:59.219> looking

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
something that's even further looking

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.590 
something that's even further looking
that's<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.869> set<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.939> steps<00:02:02.939> outward

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
that's it it's a set of steps outward

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.139 
that's it it's a set of steps outward
and<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.530> Apollo<00:02:04.829> 17<00:02:05.250> picture<00:02:05.969> i<00:02:06.000> think

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and that Apollo 17 picture i think

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.779 
and that Apollo 17 picture i think
raised<00:02:06.719> many<00:02:07.079> people<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.770> an<00:02:07.890> environmental

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
raised many people to an environmental

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.260 
raised many people to an environmental
consciousness<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.830> pale<00:02:11.580> blue<00:02:11.610> dot<00:02:11.819> at
