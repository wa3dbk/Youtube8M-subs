interesting<00:04:43.520> build<00:04:43.790> for<00:04:44.510> our<00:04:44.630> Terran<00:04:44.930> player

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
interesting build for our Terran player

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.530 
interesting build for our Terran player
and<00:04:45.380> of<00:04:45.500> course<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.830> Zerg<00:04:46.010> player<00:04:46.540> probably

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
and of course the Zerg player probably

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.150 
and of course the Zerg player probably
not<00:04:47.660> going<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:47.810> see<00:04:47.960> any<00:04:48.140> tier<00:04:48.350> 3<00:04:48.590> anytime<00:04:48.919> soon

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
not going to see any tier 3 anytime soon

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.420 
not going to see any tier 3 anytime soon
because<00:04:49.510> he's<00:04:50.510> still<00:04:50.960> really<00:04:51.280> struggling<00:04:52.280> to

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
because he's still really struggling to

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.750 
because he's still really struggling to
rebuild<00:04:52.730> his<00:04:53.240> economy<00:04:54.080> which<00:04:54.520> just<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.580> few

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
rebuild his economy which just a few

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.550 
rebuild his economy which just a few
minutes<00:04:56.000> ago<00:04:56.090> was<00:04:56.390> in<00:04:56.540> shambles<00:04:56.780> but<00:04:57.140> now<00:04:57.320> it

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
minutes ago was in shambles but now it

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.080 
minutes ago was in shambles but now it
looks<00:04:57.740> like<00:04:57.830> heart<00:04:58.220> his<00:04:58.400> drones<00:04:58.640> are<00:04:58.850> fully

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
looks like heart his drones are fully

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.110 
looks like heart his drones are fully
saturated<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:01.250> he's<00:05:01.340> actually<00:05:01.520> gonna<00:05:01.730> break

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
saturated and he's actually gonna break

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.240 
saturated and he's actually gonna break
through<00:05:02.360> these<00:05:02.510> destructible<00:05:03.050> rocks<00:05:03.250> which

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
through these destructible rocks which

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.760 
through these destructible rocks which
can<00:05:04.910> be<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.150> good<00:05:05.360> thing<00:05:05.419> but<00:05:05.720> also<00:05:06.140> keep<00:05:06.680> in

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
can be a good thing but also keep in

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:07.870 
can be a good thing but also keep in
mind<00:05:06.860> that<00:05:07.040> means<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.310> Hellions<00:05:07.669> have<00:05:07.850> a

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
mind that means the Hellions have a

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.159 
mind that means the Hellions have a
shorter<00:05:08.240> route<00:05:08.419> to<00:05:08.630> get<00:05:08.780> into<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.020> Zerg

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
shorter route to get into the Zerg

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.620 
shorter route to get into the Zerg
players<00:05:09.410> base<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.830> here<00:05:09.919> we<00:05:10.040> go<00:05:10.360> huge<00:05:11.360> ball<00:05:11.600> of

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
Terran player so right now it's all

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.020 
Terran player so right now it's all
about<00:05:29.410> mindset<00:05:29.980> really<00:05:30.370> and<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.580> Zerg<00:05:30.790> player

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
about mindset really and the Zerg player

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.570 
about mindset really and the Zerg player
is<00:05:31.270> in<00:05:31.480> the<00:05:31.600> worst<00:05:31.840> of<00:05:32.050> mindsets<00:05:32.530> being<00:05:32.950> in<00:05:33.310> a

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
is in the worst of mindsets being in a

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.910 
is in the worst of mindsets being in a
completely<00:05:33.970> defensive<00:05:34.480> position<00:05:34.900> but<00:05:35.200> he

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
completely defensive position but he

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.890 
completely defensive position but he
does<00:05:36.220> have<00:05:36.460> a<00:05:36.490> lot<00:05:36.610> of<00:05:36.670> hydras<00:05:37.090> and<00:05:37.240> my

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
does have a lot of hydras and my

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.720 
does have a lot of hydras and my
thinking<00:05:38.650> here<00:05:38.950> is<00:05:38.980> he's<00:05:39.250> putting<00:05:39.550> up<00:05:39.640> these

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
thinking here is he's putting up these

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.090 
thinking here is he's putting up these
four<00:05:39.940> spine<00:05:40.210> crawlers<00:05:40.570> to<00:05:40.750> defend<00:05:41.200> and<00:05:41.470> he's

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
four spine crawlers to defend and he's

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.260 
four spine crawlers to defend and he's
going<00:05:42.280> to<00:05:42.370> push<00:05:42.580> straight<00:05:42.970> through<00:05:43.150> these

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
going to push straight through these

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.090 
going to push straight through these
rocks<00:05:43.540> and<00:05:43.750> attack<00:05:44.050> with<00:05:44.080> those<00:05:44.560> fine<00:05:44.770> callers

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
rocks and attack with those fine callers

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.430 
rocks and attack with those fine callers
being<00:05:45.520> used<00:05:45.700> for<00:05:45.790> defense<00:05:46.150> is<00:05:47.080> it<00:05:47.260> going<00:05:47.380> to

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
being used for defense is it going to

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.290 
being used for defense is it going to
work<00:05:47.590> I<00:05:47.860> don't<00:05:48.490> know<00:05:48.610> because<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:49.030> Terran
