video and I'm really sorry about my hair

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.470 
video and I'm really sorry about my hair
because<00:00:13.860> my<00:00:14.070> friend<00:00:14.370> braided<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.240> slept

because my friend braided it and I slept

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.910 
because my friend braided it and I slept
with<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.870> but<00:00:16.020> she<00:00:16.139> didn't<00:00:16.320> braid<00:00:16.470> all<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.800> it

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
with it but she didn't braid all of it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
with it but she didn't braid all of it
so<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.160> looks<00:00:17.310> kind<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.609> awkward<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.510> second

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
so it looks kind of awkward and second

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.650 
so it looks kind of awkward and second
of<00:00:19.080> all<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.529> huge<00:00:19.680> disclaimer<00:00:20.550> I'm<00:00:21.000> not<00:00:21.390> trying

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
to brag in any way shape or form this

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.910 
to brag in any way shape or form this
video<00:00:24.390> was<00:00:24.600> pretty<00:00:24.779> requested<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.680> lot<00:00:25.830> of

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
video was pretty requested a lot of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.470 
video was pretty requested a lot of
people<00:00:26.130> messaged<00:00:26.490> me<00:00:26.640> about<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.150> decided

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
people messaged me about it so I decided

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.779 
people messaged me about it so I decided
to<00:00:27.599> do<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.980> figured<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
to do it and I figured that it was the

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.490 
to do it and I figured that it was the
right<00:00:29.970> time<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.240> do<00:00:30.510> one<00:00:30.689> because<00:00:30.840> we're<00:00:31.260> kind

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
right time to do one because we're kind

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.400 
right time to do one because we're kind
of<00:00:31.679> almost<00:00:31.980> myth<00:00:32.930> midway<00:00:33.930> through<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> year

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
of almost myth midway through the year

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.319 
of almost myth midway through the year
and<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:35.040> think<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.430> good<00:00:35.550> time<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.790> make<00:00:36.059> one

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
and I think it's a good time to make one

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.990 
and I think it's a good time to make one
so<00:00:36.690> yeah<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.370> here's<00:00:38.790> my<00:00:39.059> backpack<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:41.000> just
