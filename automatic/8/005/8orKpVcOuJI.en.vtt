00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:12.010 
assembly instructions and diagrams are
confusing<00:01:08.380> attach<00:01:09.380> bars<00:01:09.860> what<00:01:10.280> bars<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.990> is

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
confusing attach bars what bars it is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.330 
confusing attach bars what bars it is
confusing<00:01:12.590> we<00:01:13.490> are<00:01:13.610> figuring<00:01:13.909> it<00:01:14.240> out<00:01:14.390> though

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340

back<00:01:16.340> elements<00:01:17.030> installed<00:01:21.189> clamp<00:01:22.189> goes<00:01:22.310> on

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
back elements installed clamp goes on

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.139 
back elements installed clamp goes on
like<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:26.020> bottom<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.439> pole<00:01:28.369> holder<00:01:28.880> goes

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
like that bottom of the pole holder goes

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.630 
like that bottom of the pole holder goes
straight<00:01:29.899> down<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:32.210> how<00:01:32.390> its<00:01:32.600> set<00:01:32.780> up

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
straight down so this is how its set up

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.639 
straight down so this is how its set up
don't<00:01:34.640> install<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.210> backwards<00:01:35.750> like<00:01:36.259> I<00:01:36.439> did

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
don't install it backwards like I did

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:43.389 
don't install it backwards like I did
the<00:01:36.770> first<00:01:36.950> time<00:01:38.979> all<00:01:39.979> assemble<00:01:41.679> bow<00:01:42.679> ties<00:01:43.009> go

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
the first time all assemble bow ties go

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:54.359 
the first time all assemble bow ties go
on<00:01:43.610> like<00:01:43.909> that<00:01:51.849> connect<00:01:52.849> your<00:01:53.060> bar<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.720> the

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
on like that connect your bar to the

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:02.139 
on like that connect your bar to the
tenha<00:01:56.380> transformer<00:01:57.380> he's<00:01:57.619> on<00:01:57.799> like<00:01:58.069> this<00:02:01.149> you

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
tenha transformer he's on like this you

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.229 
tenha transformer he's on like this you
may<00:02:02.360> note<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.319> actual<00:02:03.530> assembly<00:02:04.369> is<00:02:05.030> the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
may note that the actual assembly is the

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.479 
may note that the actual assembly is the
newer<00:02:05.450> model<00:02:05.959> does<00:02:06.170> not<00:02:06.409> match<00:02:06.709> the<00:02:06.739> picture

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
newer model does not match the picture

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:15.580 
newer model does not match the picture
on<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.539> box<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.759> setup<00:02:11.150> one<00:02:11.630> way<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:15.470> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
on the box so the setup one way and the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.849 
on the box so the setup one way and the
actual<00:02:15.980> antenna<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:17.329> different<00:02:17.930> closed<00:02:18.470> but

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
actual antenna is different closed but

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.759 
actual antenna is different closed but
different<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.239> causes<00:02:20.720> confusion<00:02:21.200> on

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
different so that causes confusion on

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:30.070 
different so that causes confusion on
the<00:02:21.980> assembly<00:02:25.120> do<00:02:26.120> be<00:02:26.299> a<00:02:26.329> setup
