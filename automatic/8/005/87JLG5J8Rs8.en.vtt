00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.720
 i 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.380
 the next exercise the 129 is called 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.349
 abduction horizontal abduction 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.720
 shoulders like in standing ropes that 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.160
 it sounds a bit like Chinese that is the long 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.290
 it's as easy as this from the front 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.079
 keeping the dumbbells to the height 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.230
 of the eyes we are going to take 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.630
 back at the same height and towards the anc 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.399
 taking air back and pulling the go 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.829
 forward we can do it in this 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.630
 position can be wrong we imply already 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.510
 you know different positions 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.940
 deltoid fibers in this position 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.090
 they are really working a lot 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.830
 deltoid fibers throughout 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.800
 really travel in the dumbbells 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.020
 that are producing that direction of 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.850
 the force goes towards the ground by 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.970
 the mere fact that he's holding it there 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.030
 up in each position of the route 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.360
 there are fibers that are preventing the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.310
 dumbbell make that movement according 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.229
 keeping it and up 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:24.310
 the next exercise the 130 what called 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.810
 just like 126 plus 129 it's worth 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.119
 it seemed jazz the previous one had a name 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.890
 long if I used all the names 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.539
 complete technicians for the exercise and 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.119
 it became extremely long 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.600
 so if we remember or if you are 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.149
 exercise number 126 you will see were the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.850
 front elevations then at 130 is 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.530
 a combination of these two first 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.250
 front elevation 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.480
 then productivity horizontal option 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:56.640
 we recover and go back down 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:02:02.010
 up back to the front and down I take a breath 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:05.330
 shot with lame shot 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.780
 I catch lame pull 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:14.210
 and the next one is 131 is a 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.310
 combination of 126% 29.127 of 127 of 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.450
 the lateral delegations then 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.620
 we put the 3 together 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:27.069
 from our side 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.590
 up front and down up back and 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.750
 down to the 3 windows height of the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 arms in cross height approximately of 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.120
 the eyes and a little bit above 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:41.720
 work your house 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.819
 ok for all these exercises 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.069
 We keep constant the position of the 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.310
 body 10 well supported on the floor 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:52.519
 knees slightly bent hip 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.190
 a little back shoulders pulling towards 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.840
 back pulling chest selling area 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.840
 lumbar and tightening abdomen 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.269
 yes 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.020
 and 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.170
 32
