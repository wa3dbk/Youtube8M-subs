so what these are designed to do is as

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.650 
so what these are designed to do is as
you<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.120> little

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
you can see here they have little

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.740 
you can see here they have little
padding<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.470> bottom<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.270> when<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
padding on the bottom so that when you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.410

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
walk your feet are doing more work so I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.500
