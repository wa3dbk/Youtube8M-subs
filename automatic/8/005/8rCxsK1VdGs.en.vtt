00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.970
 it was here 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 What's up guys who played in the pound 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Welcome to the video with 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.460
 safe four game bizarre gameplay 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.400
 You can see that things are very 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.840
 Weird that part of the face. 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.240
 I entered a match of heat 4 this 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.700
 week last week before 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.620
 recently and expensive for incredible that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.140
 It seems the classes were practically 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.230
 all hacked was hardly 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.120
 finding a good room and this 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.160
 which is one of the things that happened and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.260
 I had never really seen it, huh? 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.970
 I had never encountered this type of 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.220
 hacked room 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.550
 Can you give supercars all the 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.380
 their schineider the food and stayed with 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.200
 a flag in the hand to each opponent 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.390
 that people kill will earn 60 thousand xp 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.710
 and also has three attacks of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.170
 helicopters in the air 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.110
 I do not know why leaving the game very strange 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.790
 really capture 4 and that's fine 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.340
 complicated to play at least in these 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.650
 last days I tried to play and almost 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.450
 I was always finding a hacked room. 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.369
 I always bring gameplay of these 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.799
 games for you right because I can always 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.619
 finding good matches is not for me 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.840
 finally rooms well quiet generally 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.490
 I always think that only the revolver rack 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.409
 infinite ammo but this ends 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.359
 disturbing you know what you are looking for 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.979
 another room can play more 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.079
 lately I confess to you that you are 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.960
 complicated mainly by the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.819
 playstation 3 is very ugly thing and 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.889
 for you to have another sense of how 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.200
 it's complicated, look at this part 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:46.049
 I just do not face gun in 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.999
 hand stayed with both the two arms 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.939
 pointed forward as if it were more 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:52.920
 or less a pistol position of the fingers and 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.439
 has an object that something a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.659
 Dude, following me, finally, a lot of things. 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.240
 strange that she did there a several shots 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.679
 and will be able to see on top of this 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.530
 construction that several people give 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.499
 support finally jumping something very 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.670
 strange happening in these games more 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.890
 of the series that it lasts 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.959
 especially code 4 is fine 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.710
 complicated then everything is well down there 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.780
 Playing 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.940
 these games have even stopped playing that 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.740
 flower ii and these older ones are still 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.930
 almost impossible to play 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.240
 playstation 3 I think both sony and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.070
 spiritual debut had to launch 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.800
 updates some form of power 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.840
 correct because there are a lot of people he plays 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.580
 multiplayer these games only 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.040
 Unfortunately there's no way to hide it. 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.200
 infested with hackers I know that in xbox 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.580
 also has only it's much less I 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.220
 particularly I'm playing module was 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.220
 2 on the Xbox 360 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.180
 How can you play ball? 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.710
 hacker infested the entire match and 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.270
 do you find various hackers and 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.100
 mainly Brazilians 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.720
 so I hope they can correct 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.490
 I think it's going to be very difficult for them 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.320
 they do at first, but neither do they 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.150
 hope is the last to die 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.400
 I thought only one video and a half short 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.960
 to bring these strange things and 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.790
 to be able to show you guys be smart 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.190
 You can play where four 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.860
 mainly on playstation 3 and will be 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.330
 preparing to spend a lot of anger when 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.220
 I had a lot of anger 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.530
 in these last days then this galera 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.390
 thank you very much for the company and the people 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.390
 see you in the next video bye
